      "\u201cNo thank you. Let's go!\u201d explained soprano Christian Nilsson, who is singing Eva in her role debut. \u201cShe is a strong girl.\u201d",

      "But it wasn't until Thursday that the friendly red monster made his Grand Ole Opry debut, a country music rite of passage. The squeaky voiced singer's roots in the genre actually run pretty deep.",
      "Elmo helped ring in the Grand Ole Opry's 100th anniversary this year by co-hosting with his \u201cSesame Street\u201d pal Abby Cadabby. Elmo, in a little blue cowboy hat and matching shirt, teamed up for a duet alongside Lauren Alaina, while Abby Cadabby sang with Tayla Lynn, the daughter of Loretta Lynn, the late country star who had visited \"Sesame Street\" herself.",
      "\u201cWe sing all the time on \u2018Sesame Street,\u2019 but um, well, being able to sing in the home of country music is amazing!\u201d Abby Cadabby told The Associated Press prior to their performance.",
      "The puppet pair shared the spotlight in Music City during a stop on the \"Sesame Street\" crew's Road Trip Across America this summer and fall, when the characters that kids have watched on TV for decades are heading to events such as professional baseball games, state fairs and corn mazes. Cookie Monster even served as the grand marshal at the NASCAR Brickyard 400 in Indiana, making a cookie crumb mess, as expected.",
      "Throughout the years, the \"Sesame Street\" gang has played and sung songs with some of country music's brightest stars, including Garth Brooks, Lee Ann Womack, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, Thomas Rhett, Kane Brown, Mickey Guyton, Kacey Musgraves and more. Chris Stapleton stopped by Sesame Street in late July.",
      "Johnny Cash made multiple appearances. He won over Oscar the Grouch with his song, \u201cNasty Dan,\u201d about a mean guy who never laughed and was rumored to have never taken a bath. \u201cWow, I'd like him,\u201d Oscar the Grouch mused from his trash can.",

      "After getting out of the scripted TV business in 2021 for reality TV and sports coverage, USA Network is returning to air scripted originals with the legal drama \u201cThe Rainmaker.\"",
      "Since 2021, the USA Network had stacked its lineup with reality shows and sports, entirely forgoing original, scripted programming. Fans of \"Suits\u201d, \u201cWhite Collar\u201d and \u201cMonk\u201d were left with only memories of those shows' case-of-the-week storytelling. But on Friday, the network returns to scripted TV with the legal thriller \u201cThe Rainmaker.\u201d",
      "If the title sounds familiar, it's because it\u2019s based on the 1995 novel by John Grisham, which was first adapted into the 1997 Matt Damon-starring film directed by Francis Ford Coppola. In this \u201cRainmaker,\u201d British actor Milo Callaghan plays Rudy Baylor. It's the first leading role for Callaghan, who had previously played recurring characters in shows like HBO's \u201cDune: Prophecy\" and Starz\u2019s \u201cThe Spanish Princess.\u201d",
      "Baylor is fresh out of law school and about to start working at the largest law firm in the state, run by Leo F. Drummond (John Slattery). On his first day, Baylor gets fired after challenging Drummond in a meeting. Desperate for work, he takes a job at a small ambulance-chasing firm that works out of a former taco joint. His boss is Jocelyn \u201cBruiser\u201d Stone (Lana Parrilla, in a gender swap from the film where Mickey Rourke had the role). She\u2019s smart, confident and not afraid to use her sex appeal to get what she wants. Rudy\u2019s first big case pits him against the big, fancy law firm that let him go \u2014 and his girlfriend who still works there.",
      "Callaghan told The Associated Press about learning legalese while doing a Memphis accent and familiarizing himself with the source material. Answers are edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "CALLAGHAN: I watched it when I got cast. Matt Damon is somebody that every young actor would look up to. I wanted to be aware of the work that he did. I mean, it was a Coppola movie as well, so I was excited to see it. And then I gave it maybe like 20 minutes' thought and focused on the script because it is different and I think we have 10 hours of television to explore this character. We go on a windier road than the movie.",
      "CALLAGHAN: Yes. It\u2019s a slow-paced thriller, really, but fantastic. And there\u2019s this chunk, it must be about 100 pages, of him just preparing for this case for months and months and months. So I never wanted it to feel like it was off-the-hand genius. It felt like this is a situation that has to be honored to a certain extent. Like, you can be a fantastic lawyer, but you don\u2019t get there without grinding and grafting. We had great scenes where we were working late into the night.",

      "CALLAGHAN: Consistent work with a great dialogue coach. I remember I got there on my first day and I was running lines with P.J. Byrne, who plays Deck, and he\u2019s kind of looking at me funny. He\u2019s like, \u201cWhy are you talking like that?\u201d I was like, \"What do you mean? Because we start filming in three days.\" I was pronouncing everything phonetically because that was the way I learned. I had to really work on paring it back into a place that felt so natural. For a movie, you might get away with it, but for 10 hours of television, it just has to be light, it has to be quick, it has to be at your fingertips.",
      "CALLAGHAN: \u201cNorth City Hospital.\u201d It was the hardest thing. I was like, 'Why did you call it this?\" I got all this legalese down and then \u201cNorth City Hospital\u201d would shoot me in the foot every time.",
      "CALLAGHAN: I went through major trials, like the whole O.J. Simpson murder trial and the Gwyneth Paltrow trial. And also obscure trials. I studied attorneys and their patterns of speech and the way they address the court. We don't really have the same kind of pop star element to the legal system of like, \u201cThat\u2019s the guy who represented this person and that person.\u201d Studying that is fascinating.",

      "Tristan Rogers, who played legacy character Robert Scorpio on ABC's \u201cGeneral Hospital,\u201d died Friday, less than one month after he made a special appearance on the soap opera. He was 79.",
      "\u201cThe entire \u2018General Hospital\u2019 family is heartbroken to hear of Tristan Rogers' passing,\u201d said Frank Valentini, the show's executive producer, in a statement. \u201cTristan has captivated our fans for 45 years and Port Charles will not be the same without him (or Robert Scorpio).\u201d",
      "Born in Melbourne, Australia, Rogers' first foray into performing was in his early twenties and playing drums in a rock band with a group of friends. They weren't successful so Rogers turned to commercial work and modeling to earn some money. When the band dissolved, Rogers decided to give acting a try. After various roles in Australia, he also worked as a DJ and eventually moved to Los Angeles to try to break into Hollywood. He said casting directors were initially turned off by his accent but he eventually landed a two-day role on \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d in 1980.",
      "\u201cI had no idea at the point how big the show was,\u201d Rogers told fellow \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d actor Maurice Benard on the YouTube show, \u201cState of Mind with Maurice Benard\u201d in 2022.",
      "\u201cI had no name. I was brought in expressly to beat up the hero, Luke, (played by Anthony Geary), and then disappear,\u201d Rogers said. His first day was half-over when then-executive producer Gloria Monty asked if he would like to stay on. They had no character written for him so for three weeks Monty asked him to just appear in scenes \u201clooking furtive, looking suspicious\u201d until they came up with a storyline. It was decided he would play a spy known as \u201cCK8\u201d and eventually he was given the name Robert Scorpio. The character would remain a fixture in Port Charles for the rest of Rogers' life, even when he wasn't a current cast member.",
      "Scorpio's on again/off again romance with Emma Samms' character, Holly Sutton, remained a favorite among fans. Scorpio also had a romance, and many storylines with another spy, Anna Devane, played by Finola Hughes. Scorpio and Devane shared a daughter, Robin, played by Kimberly McCullough. Samms returned to the show for a stint last fall where it was revealed that Scorpio was the father of her adult daughter, Sasha Gilmore (played by Sofia Mattson.)",

      "Filmmaker Kate Beecroft points her lens toward the real cowgirls of the Badlands in the lyrical new film \u201cEast of Wall.\u201d",
      "The film blends fact and fiction to tell a story about the working women of South Dakota, skilled riders and trainers with ranching and rodeo in their blood who also can't seem to catch a break. There are a few Hollywood actors in the mix, including Jennifer Ehle as a hard living grandmother with a lifetime of regrets as well as some nuggets of wisdom and Scoot McNairy as an out-of-towner who wants to acquire the land, but most of the cast are non-actors playing themselves. The film won an audience award earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival.",
      "At the heart of \u201cEast of Wall,\u201d now playing in select theaters, is Tabatha Zimiga, a South Dakota native whose ability to tame wild horses is the stuff of legend in the area. In the film, the horses she rescues and rehabilitates are sold at auctions and often accepted for far less than what they\u2019re worth. She needs the money. There are bills to pay on the ranch and many mouths to feed (not just her own kids, but others from around the town who come to her for safety and shelter when their own caretakers stop providing).",
      "Tabatha is also living with new and old traumas, from the generational agony of abuse to the more recent death of her husband, the shocking circumstances of which are withheld for some time. But the effects of the loss are still felt, especially for their daughter Porshia (played by her real-life daughter Porshia Zimiga), whose grief is threatening to turn into hate of her mother. Teenage Porshia provides the poetic voiceovers, in which she talks about riding, her mother and, most effectively, the land. It's reminiscent of Linda Manz\u2019s narration in \u201cDays of Heaven.\u201d",
      "\u201cEast of Wall\u201d is best when it\u2019s capturing the landscapes and the girls in action, riding and filming energetic TikToks of their friends racing cars on horseback. Some have suggested that \u201cEast of Wall\u201d might have been stronger as a documentary. These women are vibrant and authentic and don't look like anyone we see in the movies these days, with real bodies and imperfect skin, heads half-shaved, tattoos everywhere and the ability to really, really ride \u2014 no stunt team required. And they have stories to tell, many of them unhappy, as we see in one of the most moving non-action scenes involving a group of mothers speaking candidly about their lives and their regrets.",
      "The real-life drama of financial instability is compelling and likely rooted in truth; however, the introduction of McNairy\u2019s suspect Texan feels like a narrative contrivance and drama for drama\u2019s sake. He offers to buy the ranch and let them live and work as usual, just for him now instead of themselves. These are the kind of scenes that remind you that the filmmakers, despite all their best intentions and care, are, in essence, also interlopers in this world.",

It made $70 million internationally.",
      "The film\u2019s success also handed its distributor, Warner Bros. Pictures, the seventh No. 1 opening of the year, and became the studio\u2019s sixth film in a row to debut with over $40 million domestically.",
      "\u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d Disney\u2019s chaotic sequel to the 2003 classic, \u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d took the second spot during its premiere weekend, earning $29 million in 3,975 North American theaters. Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis return, this time for a double body-swapping between the mother-daughter duo and Lohan\u2019s teen daughter and soon-to-be stepdaughter.",
      "Viral marketing tactics, coupled with strong social media word-of-mouth, boded well for both films\u2019 success, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore.",
      "\u201cThe top two films could not be more different, and that\u2019s what makes this weekend so appealing for moviegoers,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cBoth are perfectly tailored for their audiences to react in real time over the weekend to these films and then post on social media.\u201d",
      "\u201cWeapons\u201d transports audiences to the small town of Maybrook, where 17 kids up and leave their homes at 2:17 a.m., leaving bewildered parents in their wake. The town is left to navigate the lingering effects of trauma through horror, paranoia and a touch of existential humor.",
      "The film is Cregger\u2019s follow-up to his solo directorial debut with the 2022 genre-bending horror, \u201cBarbarian.\u201d That critically-acclaimed film had a slower start and smaller budget, but still topped the charts during its premiere with $10 million domestically and made a splash in the genre.",
      "\u201cWeapons\u201d generated a lot of buzz for its strong reviews (95% on Rotten Tomatoes).",

      "The success of the comedy-horror double premiere meant \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d surrendered its two-week run in the top spot and landed in the third position, bringing in $15.5 million domestically. The superhero movie enjoyed a strong $118 million debut, but stumbled in its second weekend.",
      "\u201cThe Bad Guys 2,\u201d which got a healthy start at the No. 2 spot during its premiere weekend, came in fourth place, earning $10.4 million domestically. \u201cThe Naked Gun\u201d had a similar fate, reaching the fifth position with $8.4 million in North American theaters.",

In the full episode, Swift revealed she worked on the album in Europe while she was on the \u201cEras Tour\" \u2014 flying between dates to record, truly embodying the album's title, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl.\u201d Then she read the track list. The entire album was completed in Sweden with producers Max Martin and Shellback.3. Why orange? The color embodies \u201cwhat was going on in my inner life during this tour,\u201d she said, before referring to Martin as her \u201cmentor.\u201d \u201cThese guys, they're just geniuses,\u201d she said of Martin and Shellback.4. \u201cBangers,\u201d is how she describes the album.

      "Republican lawmakers are blaming Canada for not preventing and containing wildfires, whose smoke has fouled the air in several states this year",
      "The sternly worded statements and letters are filled with indignation and outrage: Republican U.S. lawmakers say Canada has done too little to contain wildfires and smoke that have fouled the air in several states this summer.",
      "\u201cInstead of enjoying family vacations at Michigan\u2019s beautiful lakes and campgrounds, for the third summer in a row, Michiganders are forced to breathe hazardous air as a result of Canada\u2019s failure to prevent and control wildfires,\u201d read a statement last week from the state\u2019s GOP congressional delegation, echoing similar missives from Republicans in Iowa, New York, North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin.",
      "They\u2019ve demanded more forest thinning, prescribed burns and other measures to prevent fires from starting. They've warned the smoke is hurting relations between the countries and suggested the U.S. could make it an issue in tariff talks.",
      "But what they haven't done is acknowledge the role of climate change \u2014 a glaring and shortsighted omission, according to climate scientists. It also ignores the outsized U.S. contribution to heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas that cause more intense heat waves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires, scientists say.",
      "\u201cIf anything, Canada should be blaming the U.S. for their increased fires,\u201d said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.",
      "On Tuesday, the Canadian government announced almost $46 million in funding for wildfire prevention and risk assessment research projects. But Corey Hogan, parliamentary secretary to the federal energy and natural resources minister, said international cooperation is needed.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no people that want to do more about wildfires than Canadians,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cBut I think this also underlines the international challenges that are brought on by climate change ... we need to globally tackle this problem.\u201d",
      "The country has \u201cbeen fighting wildfires in this country at unprecedented rates since 2023,\u201d when Canada saw its largest wildfire on record, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs. This year\u2019s first fire started in April, one of the earliest on record, and 2025 is now the second-worst year.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 700 wildfires were burning across the country, two-thirds of them out of control, with more than 28,000 square miles (72,520 square kilometers) burned in 4,400 wildfires so far this year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. That's almost five times the surface area that's burned so far in the U.S. this year. Most wildfires are started by people, sometimes on purpose but mostly by mistake, though McMullen said lightning is the culprit in many of Canada's fires, especially in remote areas.",
      "McMullen said he has no interest in debating the role of climate change, but data show that something has changed. Sloughs and basins have dried up and water that once lapped at people\u2019s back doors in Canada\u2019s lake communities now is often hundreds of feet away.",
      "\u201cPeople can make up their own mind as to why that is,\u201d he said. \u201cBut something clearly has changed.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax \u2014 a belief echoed by many in the GOP \u2014 and his administration has worked to dismantle and defund federal climate science and data collection, with little to no pushback from Republicans in Congress.",
      "He\u2019s proposed to revoke the scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare \u2014 the central basis for U.S. climate change action. He's declared a national energy emergency to expedite fossil fuel development, canceled grants for renewable energy projects and ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels.",
      "The Associated Press reached out to more than half a dozen Republicans who criticized Canada but none returned phone calls or emails.",

      "McMullen, the Canadian wildfire expert, said battling the fires isn\u2019t as simple as many seem to believe.",
      "The country and its territories are vast and fires are often in remote areas where the best \u2014 and sometimes only \u2014 course of action if there are no residents or structures is to let them burn or \u201cit is going to just create another situation for us to deal with in a year or two or 10 or 20 years from now,\u201d McMullen said.",
      "Prescribed burns to clear underbrush and other ignition sources are used in some areas, but aren\u2019t practical or possible in some forests and prairies that are burning, experts said.",
      "McMullen has advocated for a Canadian forest fire coordination agency to help deploy firefighters and equipment where they're needed.",
      "But as for stopping worsening fires, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much they can do,\u201d said University of Michigan climate scientist Jonathan Overpeck. He noted that hotter temperatures are melting permafrost in northern Canada, which dries out and makes the vast boreal forests far more likely to burn.",
      "Instead, the two countries should collaborate on climate change solutions \"because our smoke is their smoke, their smoke is ours,\u201d Overpeck said. \u201cAs long as this trend of warming and drying continues, we\u2019re going to get a worsening problem.",

      "Summer heat, outdoor fun ... and cold and flu symptoms?",
      "The three may not go together in many people's minds: partly owing to common myths about germs and partly because many viruses really do have lower activity levels in the summer.",
      "But it is possible to get the sniffles \u2014 or worse \u2014 in the summer. Federal data released Friday, for example, shows COVID-19 is trending up in most states, with emergency department visits up among people of all ages.",

      "Flu is trending down and RSV has been steady. But COVID-19 is trending up in most U.S. states. Wastewater data from around the country estimates \u201cmoderate\u201d COVID-19 activity.",
      "CDC wastewater also shows the XFG variant \u2014 nicknamed stratus \u2014 is most common in the U.S. Stratus can cause a \u201crazor blade\u201d sore throat and is considered a \u201cvariant under monitoring\u201d by the World Health Organization. The WHO said the variant is only marginally better at evading people's immune systems and vaccines still work against it.",
      "The expectation is that COVID-19 will eventually settle into a winter seasonal pattern like other coronaviruses, but the past few years have brought a late summer surge, said Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at University of California Davis Children\u2019s Hospital.",
      "Other viruses circulating this time of year include the one that causes \u201chand, foot and mouth\u201d disease \u2014 which has symptoms similar to a cold, plus sores and rashes \u2014 and norovirus, sometimes called the stomach flu.",
      "Many viruses circulate seasonally, picking up as the weather cools in the fall and winter. So it's true that fewer people get stuffy noses and coughs in the summer \u2014 but cold weather itself does not cause colds.",
      "It's not just about seasonality. The other factor is our behavior, experts say. Nice weather means people are opening windows and gathering outside where it's harder for germs to spread.",
      "But respiratory viruses are still around. When the weather gets too hot and everyone heads inside for the air conditioning, doctors say they start seeing more sickness. In places where it gets really hot for a long time, summer can be cold season in its own right.",

      "Global talks to slash plastic production and the toxic chemicals used to produce plastic products fell apart in Geneva this week",
      "Talks aimed at a global treaty to cut plastic pollution fizzled in Geneva this week, with no agreement to meaningfully reduce the harms to human health and the environment that come with the millions of tons of plastic water bottles, food containers and packaging produced today.",
      "Though as many as 100 countries sought caps on production, powerful oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia and the United States stood against them. They argued the caps were unnecessary and a threat to their economies and industries.",
      "That means any progress continues to depend on efforts to improve recycling, reuse and product design \u2014 the very things that powerful nations argued were sufficient to address the problem without resorting to production cuts.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about how successful those efforts have been.",
      "The world makes more than 400 million tons of new plastic each year, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that could increase by about 70% by 2040 without meaningful change. A great deal of that ends up in landfills or, worse, the environment.",
      "Pollution isn't the only problem. Plastics, made almost entirely from fossil fuels, are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Plastics generated 3.4% \u2014 or 1.8 billion tons \u2014 of planet-warming emissions across the globe in 2019, the United Nations says.",
      "Not very.",
      "It's notoriously difficult to recycle plastics; only 6% of what's made gets recycled, according to the OECD. That's largely because different kinds of plastic cannot be recycled together. They have different chemical compositions, making it costly and time-consuming, and requiring a lot of manual sorting.",
      "\u201cThere are many different colors of plastics, many different types of plastics called polymers, and 16,000 to 17,000 different chemicals used to make plastics, so by design, plastics are not easily recyclable,\" said Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics, an organization that works to cut plastic pollution.",
      "Experts say plastic is different from materials like paper, cardboard, metal and glass, which all get reused at much higher rates.

      "The plastics industry says innovations in material science are helping to incorporate more recycled plastics into products and enable more plastic products to be recyclable.

      "He said this also includes upgrading recycling infrastructure or improving sorting to capture more used plastics. This also means making recycling more accessible and helping consumers know what can and can\u2019t go in the recycling bin.",

      "Depending on consumers for accurate pre-sorting is a lot to ask. And cities may hesitate to make costly infrastructure improvements to their recycling programs if there is little financial incentive or market for the recycled material.",
      "\"Local recycling facilities, or markets for the recycled material, don\u2019t always exist. Where the collection and processing infrastructure does exist, the recycling plants are essentially plastic production facilities, with the same air, water, and soil pollution problems that are harmful to local residents,\" said Holly Kaufman, director of The Plastics & Climate Project and senior fellow at World Resources Institute.",

      "\u201cReuse means creating packaging or products designed to be used multiple times, like refillable containers, or more durable zippered bags that can be washed and refilled many times, extending their lifespan and reducing waste,\u201d Eisenberg, of America's Plastic Makers, said.",

      "It was six months ago that Selin Celikoyar bought her last tampon and switched to a reusable menstrual disc.",
      "\"I had already been wary of tampons from an environmental perspective and also from a biological perspective. I felt that they were very wasteful and expensive to consistently keep buying,\" she said.",
      "The flexible discs and other reusable menstrual products are gaining traction as alternatives to the billions of single-use pads and tampons that get tossed into landfills every year. Products such as the discs, silicone cups and period underwear can be reused for years, so they\u2019re cost-effective and long-lasting in addition to helping people reduce waste. The popularity of the reusable alternatives has grown since the pandemic, when it was easier to experiment with period products in the privacy of a home bathroom, according to women's health experts.",
      "Celikoyar said she used tampons and pads for years because those are the options she grew up knowing about. But when she saw her friend make the switch to a menstrual disc, she decided to try it too.",
      "\u201cThe experience has been such a game changer,\u201d she said.",
      "About 12 billion disposable pads and 7 billion tampons go into U.S. landfills every year, according to Dr. Luwam Semere, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Kaiser Permanente Santa Clara. Pads are mostly plastic. Once they're in the landfill, they take up to 800 years to degrade, according to the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Single-use pads and tampons are by far the most popular period products. Women's health expert Dr. Navya Mysore said that's not because they're better, they're just usually the first options kids are shown.",
      "\u201cIt was often like, \u2018What did your mom use? What did your grandma use?\u2019 And that\u2019s how you were introduced into period hygiene,\u201d said Mysore, a primary care physician based in New York City.",
      "The most popular is the menstrual cup, which gets inserted much like a tampon. The discs get inserted farther in, so they don't interrupt intercourse. Both can hold several times more than a tampon and can stay inserted for up to 12 hours, instead of the four to eight hours recommended for tampons. Semere also said the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome commonly associated with tampons is much lower with menstrual cups and discs.",
      "The cons? The products require some technique to put them in right, and doing it wrong can get messy. The cups and discs also have to be cleaned regularly with soap and water.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to do that if you\u2019re at work and you\u2019re in a shared, public restroom. It\u2019s not the most convenient,\u201d said Mysore.",
      "Cups prevent leakage by creating a suction, so people who use intrauterine devices for contraception risk dislodging them if they pull out a menstrual cup without breaking the seal.",
      "The placement of discs, which don\u2019t use suction, can also take some getting used to.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s high up there, you don\u2019t feel it, but it can be sometimes harder for women to pull them out,\u201d said Dr. Annemieke van Eijk, an epidemiologist with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.",

      "\u201cIdeally, you would like to experiment a bit with what type of cup works best for you. And the cost can be kind of prohibitive to do that,\u201d van Eijk said.",
      "A reusable product can help save money over the long term. Celikoyar estimates that she was using three tampons every day for seven days, or about 20 per month. With tampons costing 20 to 25 cents each, someone who switched to a reusable product would likely break even after a few months.",
      "For people who prefer pads, the most common reusable option is period underwear, which is comparable to regular-looking underwear with an extra absorbent lining.",
      "\u201cThose are nice because we do see people getting irritation from pad use,\" said Semere. \"Because of the different materials that are in the disposable pads.\u201d",
      "The downside, just like with pads, is the inability to tell when it's absorbed all that it can.",

    "story": [
      "Pope Leo XIV is marking his first 100 days in office, showing a mix of continuity with and change from Pope Francis' papacy",
      "VATICAN CITY -- When Pope Leo XIV surprised tens of thousands of young people at a recent Holy Year celebration with an impromptu popemobile romp around St. Peter\u2019s Square, it almost seemed as if some of the informal spontaneity that characterized Pope Francis\u2019 12-year papacy had returned to the Vatican.",
      "But the message Leo delivered that night was all his own: In seamless English, Spanish and Italian, Leo told the young people that they were the \u201csalt of the Earth, the light of the world.\u201d He urged them to spread their hope, faith in Christ and their cries of peace wherever they go.",
      "As Robert Prevost marks his 100th day as Pope Leo this weekend, the contours of his pontificate have begun to come into relief, primarily where he shows continuity with Francis and where he signals change. Perhaps the biggest takeaway is that after 12 sometimes turbulent years under Francis, a certain calm and reserve have returned to the papacy.",
      "Leo seems eager above all to avoid polemics or making the papacy about himself, and wants instead to focus on Christ and peace.",
      "That seems exactly what many Catholic faithful want, and may respond to what today's church needs.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been very direct and forthright \u2026 but he\u2019s not doing spontaneous press hits,\u201d said Kevin Hughes, chair of theology and religious studies at Leo\u2019s alma mater, Villanova University. Leo has a different style than Francis, and that has brought relief to many, Hughes said in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cEven those who really loved Pope Francis always kind of held their breath a little bit: You didn\u2019t know what was going to come out next or what he was going to do,\u201d Hughes said.",
      "Leo has certainly gone out of his way in his first 100 days to try to heal divisions that deepened during Francis\u2019 pontificate, offering messages of unity and avoiding controversy at almost every turn. Even his signature issue \u2014 confronting the promise and peril posed by artificial intelligence \u2014 is something that conservatives and progressives alike agree is important. Francis' emphasis on caring for the environment and migrants often alienated conservatives.",
      "Closer to home, Leo offered the Holy See bureaucracy a reassuring, conciliatory message after Francis\u2019 occasionally authoritarian style rubbed some in the Vatican the wrong way.",
      "\u201cPopes come and go, but the Curia remains,\u201d Leo told Vatican officials soon after his May 8 election.",
      "Leo, though, has cemented Francis\u2019 environmental legacy by celebrating the first-ever ecologically inspired Mass. He has furthered that legacy by giving the go-ahead for the Vatican to turn a 430-hectare (1,000-acre) field north of Rome into a vast solar farm that should generate enough electricity to meet Vatican City\u2019s needs and turn it into the world\u2019s first carbon-neutral state.",
      "He has fine-tuned financial transparency regulations that Francis initiated, tweaked some other decrees to give them consistency and logic, and confirmed Francis in deciding to declare one of the 19th century\u2019s most influential saints, John Henry Newman, a \u201cdoctor\u201d of the church.",
      "But he hasn\u2019t granted any sit-down, tell-all interviews or made headline-grabbing, off-the-cuff comments like his predecessor did. He hasn\u2019t made any major appointments, including to fill his old job, or taken any big trips.",
      "In marking the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki last week, he had a chance to match Francis\u2019 novel declaration that the mere possession of nuclear weapons was \u201cimmoral.\u201d But he didn\u2019t.",
      "Compared to President Donald Trump, the other American world leader who took office in 2025 with a flurry of Sharpie-penned executive decrees, Leo has eased into his new job slowly, deliberately and quietly, almost trying not to draw attention to himself.",
      "At 69, he seems to know that he has time on his side, and that after Francis\u2019 revolutionary papacy, the church might need a bit of a breather. One Vatican official who knows Leo said he expects his papacy will have the effect of a \u201ccalming rain\u201d on the church.",
      "Maria Isabel Ibarcena Cuarite, a Peruvian member of a Catholic charismatic group, said it was precisely Leo\u2019s quiet emphasis on church traditions, its sacraments and love of Christ, that drew her and upward of 1 million young people to Rome for a special Jubilee week this month.",
      "Ibarcena said Francis had confused young people like herself with his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics and approval of blessings for same-sex couples. Such gestures went beyond what a pope was supposed to do and what the church taught, she thought.",

      "Leo, she said, has emphasized that marriage is a sacrament between men and woman. \u201cFrancis was ambiguous, but he is firm,\u201d she said.",
      "From his very first appearance on the loggia of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, Leo has insisted he is first and foremost a \u201cson of St. Augustine. \u201d It was a reference to the fifth century theological and devotional giant of early Christianity, St. Augustine of Hippo, who inspired the 13th century religious Augustinian order as a community of \u201cmendicant\u201d friars.",
      "Like the other big mendicant orders of the early church \u2014 the Franciscans, Dominicans and Carmelites \u2014 the Augustinians spread across Christian Europe over the centuries. Today, Augustinian spirituality is rooted in a deep interior life of prayer, living in community, and journeying together in search of truth in God.",
      "In nearly every speech or homily since his May 8 election, Leo has cited Augustine in one way or another.",
      "\u201cI see a kind of Augustinian flavor in the way that he\u2019s presenting all these things,\u201d said Hughes, the theology professor who is an Augustine scholar.",
      "Leo joined the Augustinians after graduating from Augustinian-run Villanova, outside Philadelphia, and was twice elected its prior general. He has visited the Augustinian headquarters outside St. Peter's a few times since his election, and some wonder if he will invite some brothers to live with him in the Apostolic Palace to recreate the spirit of Augustinian community life there.",
      "Leo is also very much a product of the Francis papacy. Francis named Prevost bishop of Chiclayo, Peru, in 2014 and then moved him to head one of the most important Vatican jobs in 2023 \u2014 vetting bishop nominations. In retrospect, it seems Francis had his eye on Prevost as a possible successor.",
      "Given Francis\u2019 stump speech before the 2013 conclave that elected him pope, the then-Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio essentially described Prevost in identifying the church's mission today: He said the church was \"called to go outside of itself and go to the peripheries, not just geographic but also the existential peripheries.\u201d",
      "Prevost, who hails from Chicago, spent his adult life as a missionary in Peru, eventually becoming bishop of Chiclayo.",
      "\u201cHe is the incarnation of the \u2018unity of difference,\u2019 because he comes from the center, but he lives in the peripheries,\u201d said Emilce Cuda, secretary of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.",
      "Cuda said during a recent conference hosted by Georgetown University that Leo encapsulated in \u201cword and gesture\u201d the type of missionary church Francis promoted.",
      "That said, for all Leo owes to Bergoglio, the two didn\u2019t necessarily get along.",
      "Prevost has recounted that at one point when he was the Augustinian superior, the then-archbishop of Buenos Aires expressed interest in assigning an Augustinian priest to a specific job in his archdiocese.",
      "\u201cAnd I, as prior general, said \u2018I understand, Your Eminence, but he\u2019s got to do something else\u2019 and so I transferred him somewhere else,\u201d Prevost told parishioners in his home state of Illinois in 2024.",
      "Prevost said he \u201cnaively\u201d thought the Francis wouldn\u2019t remember him after his 2013 election, and that regardless \u201che\u2019ll never appoint me bishop\u201d due to the disagreement.",
      "Bergoglio not only made him bishop, he laid the groundwork for Prevost to succeed him as pope, the first North American pope following the first South American.",

      "\u201cThese two men have been on Nigeria\u2019s most-wanted list for years. They jointly spearheaded multiple attacks on civilians, security forces and critical infrastructure,\" Ribadu said at a news conference.",
      "He said the arrested leaders are responsible for the Kuje prison attack in 2022 that led to the escape of dozens of jailed Boko Haram members and an attack on the Niger uranium facility in 2013, among others.

      "From his stronghold in Bolivia's tropics of Chapare, where he has been holed up for months under the protection of die-hard supporters, he repeated his call for voters to deface their ballots in Sunday's high-stakes elections in defiance of the race from which he is barred due to a contentious constitutional court ruling.",

With the Bolivian economy undergoing its worst crisis in around four decades, the implosion of the MAS party has given the right-wing opposition its best shot at winning at the ballot box since Morales first came to power in 2006.",
      "\u201cLook, it\u2019s an election without legality, without legitimacy .... without the Indigenous movement, without the popular movement,\u201d Morales, Bolivia's first Indigenous president, contended in his interview with the AP at his political organization's headquarters, where he broadcasts a weekly radio show.",

      "Relations between Beirut and Damascus remain tense \u2014 as they have been for decades past, a time during which Syria failed to treat its smaller neighbor as a sovereign nation",
      "BEIRUT -- A lot has happened in just a year on both sides of the Lebanon-Syria border. A lightning offensive by Islamist insurgents in Syria toppled longtime autocrat Bashar Assad and brought a new government in place in Damascus.",
      "In Lebanon, a bruising war with Israel dealt a serious blow to Hezbollah \u2014 the Iran-backed and Assad-allied Shiite Lebanese militant group that had until recently been a powerful force in the Middle East \u2014 and a U.S.-negotiated deal has brought a fragile ceasefire.",
      "Still, even after the fall of the 54-year Assad family rule, relations between Beirut and Damascus remain tense \u2014 as they have been for decades past, with Syria long failing to treat its smaller neighbor as a sovereign nation.",
      "Recent skirmishes along the border have killed and wounded several people, both fighters and civilians, including a four-year-old Lebanese girl. Beirut and Damascus have somewhat coordinated on border security, but attempts to reset political relations have been slow. Despite visits to Syria by two heads of Lebanon's government, no Syrian official has visited Lebanon.",
      "Here is what's behind the complicated relations.",
      "Many Syrians have resented Hezbollah for wading into Syria's civil war in defense of Assad's government. Assad's fall sent them home, but many Lebanese now fear cross-border attacks by Syria's Islamic militants.",
      "There are new restrictions on Lebanese entering Syria, and Lebanon has maintained tough restrictions on Syrians entering Lebanon.",
      "The Lebanese also fear that Damascus could try to bring Lebanon under a new Syrian tutelage.",
      "Syrians have long seen Lebanon as a staging ground for anti-Syria activities, including hosting opposition figures before Hafez Assad \u2014 Bashar Assad's father \u2014 ascended to power in a bloodless 1970 coup.",
      "In 1976, Assad senior sent his troops to Lebanon, allegedly to bring peace as Lebanon was hurtling into a civil war that lasted until 1990. Once that ended, Syrian forces \u2014 much like a colonial power \u2014 remained in Lebanon for another 15 years.",
      "A signature of the Assad family rule, Syria's dreaded security agents disappeared and tortured dissidents to keep the country under their control. They did the same in Lebanon.",
      "\u201cSyrians feel that Lebanon is the main gateway for conspiracies against them,\u201d says Lebanese political analyst Ali Hamadeh.",
      "It took until 2008 for the two countries to agree to open diplomatic missions, marking Syria's first official recognition of Lebanon as an independent state since it gained independence from France in 1943.",
      "The move came after the 2005 truck-bombing assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri that many blamed on Damascus. Two months later, Syria pulled its troops out of Lebanon under international pressure, ending 29 years of near-complete domination of its neighbor.",
      "When Syria\u2019s own civil war erupted in 2011, hundreds of thousands of Syrians fled across the border, making crisis-hit Lebanon the host of the highest per capita population of refugees in the world. Once in Lebanon, the refugees complained about discrimination, including curfews for Syrian citizens in some areas.",
      "Hezbollah, meanwhile, rushed thousands of its fighters into Syria in 2013 to shore up Assad, worried that its supply lines from Iran could dry up.",

Damascus is asking Beirut to hand them over to continue their prison terms in Syria, but Lebanese judicial officials say Beirut won't release any attackers and that each must be studied and resolved separately.",
      "In July, family members of the detainees rallied along a border crossing, demanding their relatives be freed. The protest came amid reports that Syrian troops could deploy foreign fighters in Lebanon, which Damascus officials denied.",
      "Another obstacle is Lebanon\u2019s demand that Syrian refugees go back home now that Assad is gone. About 716,000 Syrian refugees are registered with the U.N. refugee agency, while hundreds of thousands more are unregistered in Lebanon, which has a population of about 5 million.",
      "Syria is also demanding the return of billions of dollars worth of deposits of Syrians trapped in Lebanese banks since Lebanon's historic financial meltdown in 2019.",
      "The worst post-Assad border skirmishes came in mid-March, when Syrian authorities said Hezbollah members crossed the border and kidnapped and killed three Syrian soldiers. The Lebanese government and army said the clash was between smugglers and that Hezbollah wasn't involved.",
      "Days later, Lebanese and Syrian defense ministers flew to Saudi Arabia and signed an agreement on border demarcation and boosting their coordination.",
      "In July, rumors spread in Lebanon, claiming the northern city of Tripoli would be given to Syria in return for Syria giving up the Golan Heights to Israel. And though officials dismissed the rumors, they illustrate the level of distrust between the neighbors.",
      "Beirut was also angered by Syria's appointment this year of a Lebanese army officer \u2014 Abdullah Shehadeh, who defected in 2014 from Lebanon to join Syrian insurgents \u2014 as the head of security in Syria\u2019s central province of Homs that borders northeastern Lebanon.",

      "SERREKUNDA, Gambia -- Three women were charged in Gambia over the death of a one-month-old girl who had undergone female genital mutilation, the police said, in the first such case since the country stopped short of reversing a ban on the practice last year.",
      "The West African nation banned female genital cutting in 2015, but the country was rocked by a renewed debate about the practice last year following the first prosecutions of female cutters. It was the first time the practice \u2014 also known as female circumcision and outlawed in many nations \u2014 was publicly discussed.",
      "Eventually, the Gambian parliament upheld the ban, but many say the practice continues in secrecy.",
      "Three women were charged Tuesday under the ban, the Women\u2019s (Amendment) Act, 2015, the Gambian police said in a statement published Wednesday on social media. One woman is facing life imprisonment, and the other two were charged as accomplices.",
      "\u201cPreliminary findings indicate the child was allegedly subjected to circumcision and later developed severe bleeding,\u201d the police said in a separate statement published Sunday, following the infant's death. \u201cShe was rushed to Bundung Maternal and Child Health Hospital, where she was pronounced dead on arrival.\u201d",
      "The United Nations estimates that about 75% of women in Gambia have been subjected as young girls to the procedure known by its initials FGM, which includes partial or full removal of a girl\u2019s external genitalia. The World Health Organization says it\u2019s a form of torture.",
      "More than 200 million women and girls across the world are survivors of FGM, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa, according to U.N. estimates. In the past eight years alone, some 30 million women globally have been cut, most of them in Africa but also in Asia and the Middle East, UNICEF said last year.",
      "The procedure, typically performed by older women or traditional community practitioners, is often done with tools such as razor blades and can cause serious bleeding, death and complications later in life, including in childbirth.",

      "Peruvian President Dina Boluarte has visited an Amazon River island at the center of a territorial dispute with Colombia",
      "LIMA, Peru -- LIMA, Peru (AP) \u2014 Peruvian President Dina Boluarte on Friday traveled to an Amazon River island at the center of a territorial dispute with Colombia, where she affirmed Peru\u2019s unquestionable sovereignty over the territory.",
      "The first visit from Boluarte to the island comes against a backdrop of diplomatic tensions with Colombia, whose president, Gustavo Petro, recently disavowed Peruvian jurisdiction over Santa Rosa Island.",
      "Security force chiefs and members of Parliament welcomed Boluarte and Cabinet ministers to the territory, where she sang the Peruvian national anthem as people waved red-and-white flags.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, for several days now, unacceptable actions have been taking place that affect the brotherhood that unites our two nations and the border communities,\u201d Boluarte said. \u201cPeru\u2019s sovereignty is not in dispute; the district of Santa Rosa de Loreto is Peruvian and will remain so.\u201d",
      "Tensions between the neighboring countries escalated Tuesday, when Peruvian police arrested three Colombian men who were on the island doing land surveying work. Colombia\u2019s government on Thursday demanded the immediate release of the men after a Peruvian judge freed one of them but ordered the other two remain in jail for seven days while authorities investigate them for the alleged crime of attacking national sovereignty.",
      "Petro described the arrests as a \u201ckidnapping.\u201d His government has said the detainees \u2014 a land surveyor and a boat driver \u2014 were conducting studies to measure the depth of bodies of water for a pier expansion in the Colombian border city of Leticia. Peruvian authorities said the workers were not authorized to carry out the measurements.",
      "The arrest of the two Colombians marks the third binational incident in the area since Petro denied Peru\u2019s jurisdiction over Santa Rosa Island on Aug. 5. Two days later, a Colombian military aircraft flew over the island, and on Monday, the former mayor of the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn, Daniel Quintero, planted a Colombian flag there. Police later removed the flag.",

      "Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu said now is not the time to take risks with the economy, noting the unprecedented tariffs the U.S. has imposed on Canada. The intervention means the 10,000 flight attendants will return to work soon.",
      "The government\u2019s action came less than 12 hours after workers walked off the job.",
      "\"The talks broke down. It is clear that the parties are not any closer to resolving some of the key issues that remain and they will need help with the arbitrator,\u201d Hajdu said.",
      "Hajdu said the full resumption of services could take days, noting it is up to the Canada Industrial Relations Board. Meanwhile, Wesley Lesosky, president of the Air Canada Component of the CUPE union, accused the government of violating the flight attendants' constitutional right to strike \u2014 and decried Hajdu for only waiting hours to intervene.",
      "\u201cThe Liberal government is rewarding Air Canada\u2019s refusal to negotiate fairly by giving them exactly what they wanted,\u201d Lesosky said.",
      "Air Canada did not immediately have additional comments when reached Saturday afternoon. But Air Canada Chief Operating Officer Mark Nasr previously said it could take up to a week to fully restart operations. It's likely that travelers will continue to see disruptions in the coming days.",
      "The shutdown of Canada\u2019s largest airline early Saturday is impacting about 130,000 people a day, and some 25,000 Canadians may be stranded. Air Canada operates around 700 flights per day.",
      "According to numbers from aviation analytics provider Cirium, Air Canada had canceled a total of 671 flights by Saturday afternoon \u2014 following 199 on Friday. And another 96 flights scheduled for Sunday were already suspended.",
      "Hajdu ordered the Canada Industrial Relations Board to extend the term of the existing collective agreement until a new one is determined by the arbitrator.",
      "\u201cCanadians rely on air travel every day, and its importance cannot be understated,\u201d she said.",
      "Union spokesman Hugh Pouliot didn\u2019t immediately know what day workers would return to work. \u201cWe\u2019re on the picket lines until further notice,\u201d he said.",
      "The bitter contract fight escalated Friday as the union turned down Air Canada\u2019s prior request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.",
      "Flight attendants walked off the job around 1 a.m. EDT on Saturday. Around the same time, Air Canada said it would begin locking flight attendants out of airports.",
      "Ian Lee, an associate professor at Carleton University\u2019s Sprott School of Business, earlier noted the government repeatedly intervenes in transportation strikes.",
      "\u201cThey will intervene to bring the strike to an end. Why? Because it has happened 45 times from 1950 until now,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt is all because of the incredible dependency of Canadians.\u201d",
      "Last year, the government forced the country\u2019s two major railroads into arbitration with their labor union during a work stoppage. The union for the rail workers is suing, arguing the government is removing a union\u2019s leverage in negotiations.",
      "The Business Council of Canada had urged the government to impose binding arbitration in this case, too. And the Canadian Chamber of Commerce welcomed the intervention.",

      "Following the news of the Canadian government forcing arbitration on Saturday, Reyt also expressed concern for Air Canada\u2019s flight attendants. \u201cI think the flight attendants are making some reasonable arguments,\u201d he said, adding that he hopes the intervention isn't \"a way just to silence them.\u201d",

      "The company has faced lawsuits and backlash for not doing enough to protect kids on its gaming services.

      "Small-scale solar panels about the size of a door are poised to be plugged into more U.S. homes and apartments as homeowners and renters who want to harness the sun\u2019s energy look for cheaper alternatives to rooftop installations",
      "When Terrence Dwyer received a knock on his door and a flyer for a solar panel system small enough to fit on his deck, he was quickly sold. Solar systems that plug into regular wall outlets have been popular in Europe for years and are gaining traction in the U.S. for their affordability and simple installation.",
      "\u201cWe thought absolutely, let\u2019s do this right away,\u201d said Dwyer, who lives in Oakland, California.",
      "These small-scale solar systems could become attractive to more homeowners now that President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping budget-and-policy package will scrap residential rooftop solar tax credits and may shift interest to cheaper alternatives. Even before the GOP bill passed, manufacturers of the smaller systems known as plug-in or balcony solar were seeing increased demand and other positive signs such as a new Utah law streamlining regulations for homeowners to buy and install them. The systems about the size of a door haven\u2019t been as widely adopted in the U.S. as in Europe because of lack of awareness, patchwork utility rules and limited availability.",
      "The $2,000 plug-in solar system installed on Dwyer's backyard deck in March consists of two 400 watt panels, an inverter, a smart meter and a circuit breaker. It saves him around $35 per month on his power bill because he is consuming less energy from the grid, but he said reducing his carbon footprint was his primary motivation.",
      "\u201cWe like the environmental benefits of solar and wanted to engage with solar in some fashion,\u201d Dwyer said.",
      "Had Dwyer opted for rooftop solar, he would have paid $20,000 for the system and $30,000 to upgrade his roof to support the panels.",
      "Installing a plug-in solar system requires some homework. What power companies let customers do with energy-generating equipment varies, which is why prospective purchasers should check their utility\u2019s policies first. Building permits might be required depending on the municipality. Some systems can be self-installed, while others may require an electrician. For example, some kits have meters that must be wired into a home's circuit breaker.",
      "Dwyer bought his system from Bright Saver, a nonprofit company in California that advocates for plug-in solar. In addition to the type Dwyer bought, the company also offers a smaller model costing $399 that recently sold out in six days.",
      "\u201cThe interest and demand have been overwhelming,\u201d said Cora Stryker, a founder of Bright Saver. \u201cIt is clear that we are hitting a nerve \u2014 many Americans have wanted solar for a long time but have not had an option that is feasible and affordable for them until now.\u201d",
      "Kevin Chou, another founder of Bright Saver, said wider adoption of the systems in the U.S. has been hindered by utility policies that create uncertainty about whether they're allowed and a lack of state and local policies to make clear what rules apply.",
      "Some utilities contacted by The Associated Press say plug-in solar systems require the same interconnection applications as rooftop panels that send electricity back to the wider network. But Steven Hegedus, an electrical engineering professor at University of Delaware, said he doesn't understand why a utility would need to require an interconnection agreement for plug-in solar because, unlike rooftop systems, they are designed to prevent energy from flowing to the grid.",
      "Still, if in doubt, a customer should follow their utility's policy.",
      "During the early days of plug-in solar's growth, some opposition from utilities is likely since customers are buying less energy, said Robert Cudd, a research analyst at the California Center for Sustainable Communities at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cUtilities really prefer everyone being a predictable and generous consumer of the electricity they sell,\u201d Cudd said.",
      "This year, Utah enacted a novel law supporting plug-in solar by exempting certain small-scale systems from interconnection agreements and establishing safety requirements such as being certified by a nationally recognized testing organization such as Underwriters Laboratories. It appears to be the only state that's passed legislation supporting plug-in solar, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Republican state Rep. Raymond Ward, who sponsored the legislation, said the smaller systems allow people to better manage where their energy comes from and what they pay.",
      "\u201cEurope has these things. You can go buy them and they work and people want them. There is no reason why we shouldn\u2019t have them here in the United States,\u201d Ward said.",

      "Some questions remain about how much customers could save. Severin Borenstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business, said the cost of some portable solar systems in the U.S. would make it hard for customers to come out ahead on their utility bills over the time they own them. He estimates the price of a $2,000 system in the U.S. works out to paying about $0.20 a kilowatt-hour over a 25-year period, which only saves people money if they have high utility costs. By comparison, Borenstein said the cost of systems sold in Europe, typically around $600, is equivalent to paying about $0.05 or $0.06 per kilowatt-hour over 25 years.",
      "Baltimore resident Craig Keenan said saving money was only part of why he installed one of the smaller Bright Saver models on his balcony in July.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m interested in renewable energy because the amount of carbon emissions that we produce as a species is very, very unsustainable for our world,\u201d he said.",
      "He said he expects the system will save him about $40 per year on utility bills, so it would take him about 10 years to recoup the cost of the kit.",
      "Keenan, a mechanical engineer, said installation took him 10 to 15 minutes.",
      "\u201cI think anyone can install this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not complicated. It doesn\u2019t require a technical degree.\u201d",
      "Other companies selling plug-in solar kits include Texas-based Craftstrom. It has sold about 2,000 systems in the U.S. since 2021, mostly in California, Texas and Florida. The company's basic kits contain a solar panel that can fit in a backyard or other sunny space, along with equipment to maintain and regulate the flow of energy including an inverter and smart meter.",
      "Kenneth Hutchings, Craftstrom\u2019s chief revenue officer, said their U.S. sales rose this year even before the passage of the GOP tax bill, and he expects demand for plug-in solar to increase further as federal rooftop solar credits expire.",

      "China-based EcoFlow plans to begin selling plug-in solar systems in Utah and expand to other states if supportive legislation is passed, said Ryan Oliver, a company spokesperson.",
      "\u201cThis is an example of where technology is sort of ahead of the regulators,\u201d Oliver said, adding: \u201cAs this rolls out to more of a nationwide product, we expect it will become more mainstream as people understand it better.\"",

      "The Lithuanian banks do not operate in China, giving Beijing\u2019s move a largely symbolic character. Nonetheless, the tit-for-tat measures underscore deepening tensions between the EU and China over Beijing's support for Russia in its war on Ukraine.",

      "At EU headquarters in Brussels, European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill defended the bloc\u2019s sanctions on Chinese banks.",
      "China \u201cmust respect the problems we have identified,\u201d Gill said. \u201cOur sanctions are the centerpiece of our efforts to minimize the effectiveness of the Russian war machine.\u201d",
      "He said the Commission does not believe that the Chinese countermeasures \u201chave any justification or are evidence based, and therefore we call on China to remove them even now.\u201d",
      "The EU\u2019s latest Russia sanctions package, adopted in July and effective August 9, included Heihe Rural Commercial Bank and Heilongjiang Suifenhe Rural Commercial Bank. The bloc accused them of providing crypto-asset services that help Moscow evade restrictions.",
      "In explaining its sanctions on the Lithuanian banks, the Chinese Ministry said the EU sanctions on Chinese firms had \"a serious negative impact on China-EU economic and trade relations and financial cooperation.\u201d",
      "The banks and the government in Lithuania said the sanctions were not expected but would likely have little practical impact.",
      "\u201cAccording to the preliminary assessment, this decision will not have a significant impact on either the country\u2019s financial system or the activities of the banks themselves, since the business models of the mentioned banks are focused on the local market,\u201d the Bank of Lithuania said on Wednesday in a statement.",

      "This is the fourth week in a row that rates have come down. The latest average rate on a 30-year mortgage is now at its lowest level since Oct. 24, when it averaged 6.54%.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation.",

The maker of Froot Loops and Apple Jacks gave the timeline as U.S. food producers face increasing pressure from the U.S. government and consumers to phase out synthetic colorings from their products.",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. wholesale inflation surged unexpectedly last month, signaling that President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping taxes on imports are pushing costs up and that higher prices may be headed toward consumers.",
      "The Labor Department reported Thursday that its producer price index \u2014 which measures inflation before it hits consumers\u2014 rose 0.9% last month from June, biggest jump in more than three years. Compared with a year earlier, wholesale prices rose 3.3%,",
      "The numbers were much higher than economists had expected.",
      "Prices rose faster for producers than consumers last month, suggesting that U.S. importers may, for now, be eating the cost of Trump's tariffs rather than passing them on to customers.",

Core consumer prices rose 3.1%, up from 2.9% in June. Both figures are above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target.",
      "The new numbers suggest that slowing rent increases and cheaper gas are at least partly offsetting the impacts of Trump\u2019s tariffs. Many businesses are also likely still absorbing much of the cost of the duties instead of passing them along to customers via higher prices.",
      "Wholesale prices can offer an early look at where consumer inflation might be headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably measures of health care and financial services, flow into the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.",

      "New England rookies TreVeyon Henderson and Efton Chism III each scored for the second straight preseason game as the Patriots beat the Minnesota Vikings 20-12",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- New England rookies TreVeyon Henderson and Efton Chism III each had another preseason touchdown, and the Patriots beat the Minnesota Vikings 20-12 on Saturday.",
      "Henderson, the second-round draft pick from national champion Ohio State who's been turning heads in training camp and tracking toward a prominent role in the backfield, rushed for 20 yards with an 8-yard score on four carries during a two-drive stint for the first-team offense. Henderson had a 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown last week.",
      "\u201cHe runs hard and protects the ball, and guys were finishing and gave him a little bit of grease,\u201d Patriots coach Mike Vrabel said. \u201cYou don't need much, and he finds it.\u201d",
      "Vrabel held a handful of projected starters out, including four-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Stefon Diggs, who's returning from a torn ACL in his right knee suffered halfway through his lone season with the Houston Texans.",
      "Second-year quarterback Drake Maye started against an all-backups Vikings defense and went 4 for 7 for 46 yards with a delay-of-game penalty and an overthrow that was nearly intercepted but dropped by Tavierre Thomas.",
      "Chism made another compelling case for a regular-season roster spot with six receptions from backup QB Joshua Dobbs for 71 yards and a score. He caught a short throw on third-and-9 from the 12 and broke six tackle attempts as he twisted and muscled his way into the end zone.",
      "\u201cHe wants it, and I think that's the biggest thing he's showed,\u201d Maye said. \u201cI think it's paying off for him.\u201d",
      "With Diggs, DeMario Douglas, Kayshon Boutte and veterans Kendrick Bourne and Mack Hollins secure on the roster, the Patriots (2-0) might only have one spot left for a wide receiver. Chism, who was undrafted as an FCS player from Eastern Washington, will certainly get a long look. He had a 12-yard touchdown catch last week.",
      "\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter how you get here,\u201d Vrabel said. \u201cThe only thing that matters is what you do when you\u2019re here and I think that\u2019s another great example of that.\u201d",
      "The two teams had two days of joint practices this week, providing plenty of tests for players in situational drills in a controlled setting, and Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell was more than satisfied with the work. No projected starter on either side of the ball suited up for Minnesota (1-1), and several key backups who are locks to make the team were given the afternoon off, too.",
      "New quarterback J.J. McCarthy, who led one 12-play drive last week, wore an earpiece on the sideline while Sam Howell started. Howell, who was acquired in a trade with the Seattle Seahawks in April after the veteran backup market dried up, went 1 for 5 with an interception he forced off his back foot under pressure.",

His final throw from the 13-yard line on the last play of the game was tipped and intercepted in the end zone by Kyle Dugger.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why we\u2019re playing all three of them,\" O'Connell said. \u201cAs far as what that means in the overall competition, I think I would just say that it\u2019s still open and we\u2019re trying to figure out what that room is going to look like for the season.\u201d",
      "Dugger has 65 starts over five seasons, but he's been relegated to the second team as the Patriots implement a new scheme under Vrabel. Another incumbent starter, outside linebacker Anfernee Jennings, joined Dugger with extensive playing time in the second half while surrounded by rookies trying to make the team.

      "Ojeda earned his 14th assist of the season when Enrique scored for the seventh time, giving Orlando City (13-6-8) a 2-1 lead in the 76th minute. Ojeda tied Sebastian Giovinco\u2019s 12-match run for Toronto FC in 2018 for the second longest in league history.

Toye, also in his first season with the team, had not had an assist in 123 league appearances since 2018.",
      "Orlando City regained the lead in the 76th minute when Enrique used assists from Ojeda and Iv\u00e1n Angulo to score after subbing in for Luis Muriel in the 71st. It was the seventh assist for Angulo, who subbed in for Marco Pa\u0161ali\u0107, also in the 71st.",

      "\u201cI played this hole pretty well this week,\u201d Herrington said. \u201cI knew I could do it. Wind was in my favor. I hit a cut, was going to straighten every ball out. Had a good number for second shot.\u201d",
      "Herrington won 1 up and will face Georgia teenager Mason Howell in the 36-hole final Sunday. Howell beat Eric Lee 3 and 2 in the other semifinal at the 125th U.S. Amateur.",
      "Both Harrington and Howell advanced to the final after being among the 17 players to survive a 20-man playoff Wednesday morning to determine the final 64 for match play.",
      "The matches teed off in typical summer San Francisco weather with heavy fog that made it difficult to track shots, along with a steady mist and wind gusts of more than 20 mph.",
      "Herrington got in an early hole after bogeying the first two holes against Donegan, the 20-year-old Scot who grew up just across the Golden Gate Bridge in Mill Valley.",
      "Herrington, a 19-year-old about to enter his sophomore season at Tennessee, overcame the partisan crowd, the weather and the early deficit to get the win.",
      "\u201cI think I kind of feed off of it,\u201d Herrington said about the crowd. \u201cToday we\u2019d be walking up the fairway, after he hit the fairway and they\u2019d be yelling like he made a hole-in-one. It was funny, I\u2019d walk up the fairway and be like thank you. I\u2019d feed off of it. There\u2019s a couple of people out here that wanted me to win, but it was kind of me against everybody else.\u201d",
      "Donegan nearly pulled off a fifth straight late rally. He erased a two-hole deficit when Herrington bogeyed the par-5 16th and then Donegan made a short birdie putt at the par-5 17th to set the stage for the decisive final hole in front of loud crowd of his supporters.",
      "Herrington hit a perfect approach shot on the par-4 18th and then made his 5-foot birdie putt after Donegan narrowly missed his birdie attempt.",
      "\u201cI did what I could,\u201d Donegan said. \u201cI had a really good second shot in there, just didn\u2019t quite spin, and then the putt. Just a tough putt. It\u2019s just such a great experience still, though. I\u2019m only 20. Like hopefully I\u2019ve got a long career ahead of me, and this is just one of the many building blocks along the journey that hopefully commences.\u201d",

      "Federal officials say Arizona, Nevada and Mexico must again live with less Colorado River water as drought lingers in the West",
      "DENVER -- Arizona, Nevada and Mexico will again live with less water from the Colorado River as drought lingers in the West, federal officials announced Friday.",
      "The Colorado River is a critical lifeline to seven U.S. states, 30 Native American tribes, and two Mexican states. The cuts are based on projections for levels at federal reservoirs \u2014 chief among them Lake Powell and Lake Mead \u2014 released every August by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "Arizona will again go without 18% of its total Colorado River allocation, while Mexico loses 5%. The reduction for Nevada \u2014 which receives far less water than Arizona, California or Mexico \u2014 will stay at 7%. California won't face any cuts because it has senior water rights and is the last to lose in times of shortage.",
      "Decades of overuse and the effects of long-term drought worsened by climate change means there\u2019s far more demand for water than what actually flows through the river. Low reservoir levels at Lake Mead have triggered mandatory cutbacks every year since 2022, with the deepest cuts in 2023, which hit farmers in Arizona the hardest.",
      "Meanwhile, the states are working to reach agreement by next year on new long-term rules to govern the river in dry years. The Trump administration gave a mid-November deadline for states to reach a preliminary agreement, or risk federal intervention. Negotiations have faced delays as states push back against how much water they should each give up.",
      "The original 1922 Colorado River Compact was calculated based on an amount of water that doesn't exist in today's climate. That leaves the Upper Basin states of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and Utah to share far less water after the required amount is sent to the to the \u201cLower Basin\u201d states of Nevada, Arizona and California. Lots of water is also lost to evaporation and leaky infrastructure.",
      "Fairly splitting the river's water in the era of climate change has been vexing for years, with all of the major users hesitant to give anything up as they anticipate a drier future. There has to be enough water in the reservoirs to reach the tunnels that usher water downstream, and ideally, even more water for hydropower generation. Key infrastructure like the Hoover Dam rely on certain water levels in Lake Mead to generate electricity.",
      "Mandatory cuts and emergency water releases are \u201creactive,\" said John Berggren, a regional policy manager at Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit focused on climate change.",
      "\u201cIf we are going to be able to have a sustainable Colorado River and not just be responding to crisis after crisis, we need large amounts of flexibility built into this new set of guidelines,\" he said.",

      "\u201cIt was completely unfazed by us,\" said Sullivan, who went on to say she felt \u201cjust in awe of how graceful the creature was and to be so close in the wild to it.\u201d",
      "A few days later, the animal was seen stranded on the tidal flats in Mattapoisett. Bystanders who found the manatee beached on the flats around sunrise pushed it back into the water, said Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries Protected Species Program Manager Erin Burke.",
      "It hasn't been spotted since, Burke said, but a team with the International Fund for Animal Welfare is standing by to rescue the animal if it becomes necessary.",
      "The species prefers swimming in warmer waters, usually traveling only as far north as the Carolinas. If the manatee stays in water that is too cold for too long, it could suffer severe illness or death, said New England Aquarium Research Scientist Dr. Nadine Lysiak.",
      "Additionally, manatees are herbivores that sustain themselves on extensive seagrass beds and mangroves not typically found in New England.",
      "\u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t experience cold stunning, it may have some health declines associated with not having enough food, not having enough water,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s important to intervene as soon as it's sighted again to prevent health declines.\u201d",
      "Lysiak said it's unclear how and why the manatee found its way so far north. It may have followed the warm water Gulf Stream current system from Florida up past the Carolinas and eventually found its way to New England, she said.",
      "\u201cWe have kind of an average understanding of what a wild population does in terms of their range, or their habitat range, and some individuals will go beyond that and maybe wander or seek out other habitats or other food sources,\" she said. \"It\u2019s hard to know exactly why this manatee came to Cape Cod.\u201d",

      "Scientists from a university are filtering Mexico City's waters for traces of the DNA of an endangered salamander, the axolotl",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Sixty years ago, residents of a canal-crossed borough in Mexico City could pluck axolotls \u2014 the large salamander reminiscent of a tiny dragon \u2014 out of the water with their hands because they were so plentiful. Now it\u2019s almost impossible to find them in the wild.",
      "That's why scientists from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University are filtering Xochimilco\u2019s murky waters for traces of the endangered creature\u2019s DNA.",
      "\u201cWe all shed DNA along our path across the world and that can be captured by filtering air or water,\u201d said biologist Luis Zambrano, from the university's ecological restoration lab.",
      "As they try to monitor the axolotls\u2019 dwindling numbers, scientists increasingly rely on this technique as their nets come back empty during periodic surveys of the population, which is only found in Xochimilco.",
      "They sample water taken from the canals and filter it for environmental DNA, or the genetic particles left by animals and plants that have contact with the water. That\u2019s then compared to the profiles contained in a genetic library put together some years ago by British scientists, said Esther Quintero of Conservation International in Mexico, which has collaborated with Zambrano since 2023.",
      "Scientists collected water from 53 locations in Xochimilco: 10 inside refuges where water is filtered and the water is cleaner and 43 outside those areas. They found axolotl DNA inside the protected areas and in one site outside them.",
      "Referring to the one unprotected area, Zambrano said \u201cit\u2019s very little,\u201d but a sign that there is the possibility of resilience, even with continuing environmental degradation and pollution of the canals.",
      "So far, the researchers have only searched a third of Xochimilco with the environmental DNA technique and the manual work with nets, but they plan to continue the work and hopefully present an updated census early next year.",
      "The trend, however, is not good. From an estimated 6,000 axolotls per square kilometer in 1998, there were only 36 per square kilometer in the last census, in 2014.",

      "But policymakers can do more, he said, such as prohibiting the opening of dance clubs, spas and soccer fields on Xochimilco\u2019s traditional man-made islands, known as chinampas. Instead, the government should incentivize the islands\u2019 traditional agricultural production, ensuring that farmers can actually make a living at it.",
      "If its habitat is fixed, the axolotl can take care of the rest.",
      "\u201cThe axolotl reproduces a lot because it lays a lot of eggs \u2026 it can easily recover and we know how,\u201d Zambrano said.",

      "Farmers in Kenya face challenges with elephants raiding crops and sometimes causing harm",
      "TAITA TAVETA, Kenya -- For farmers in the Taita hills in southern Kenya, elephants are a menace: they raid crops and will occasionally injure or even kill people.",
      "Farmer Richard Shika, 68, has had some close encounters. \u201cOne time, I was trying to chase away an elephant that was in my maize field, but it turned and charged me,\u201d Shika remembers. \u201cIt stopped when it was right in front of me, and I managed to jump out of the way.\u201d",
      "He feels lucky to be alive. Almost exactly two years ago, local media reported that a 3-year-old girl had been trampled to death by an elephant in Taita Taveta county, her mother injured.",
      "The area where Shika has his farm is almost surrounded by Kenya\u2019s biggest National Park. The border of Tsavo East National Park is less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) to the east, and Tsavo West curves around to the north, west and south. The parks have always been unfenced, allowing animals to migrate. Increasingly, that puts them in the path of humans.",
      "\u201cThe places and infrastructure that we humans develop hinder the migratory routes and paths which elephants used to take,\u201d explains Yuka Luvonga, who researches human-elephant coexistence for conservation organization Save The Elephants.",
      "Elephants eat about 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of vegetation a day, so keeping them off farms is tricky, especially if forage is scarce elsewhere. \u201cElephants are clever creatures,\u201d says Shika. \u201cThey will try touching a fence, and once they realize that it is not electrified, they charge through.\u201d",
      "If farmers try to chase them off, as Shika did, the elephants will sometimes turn and defend themselves. Kenya Wildlife Service and conservation organizations tracking human-elephant conflict estimate that 30-35 people are killed every year in elephant-related incidents across Kenya.",
      "Communities will sometimes retaliate by spearing or poisoning elephants, but there are other solutions, as farmers here have found.",
      "One of them is bees.",
      "\u201cElephants don\u2019t like getting stung by bees, so they keep away from areas where hives are,\u201d Shika says.",
      "With help from Save The Elephants, Shika is one of 50 farmers who have hung beehives from wires between poles around their farms. If an elephant touches the wire, the hives are rocked, disturbing the bees. It\u2019s an army of tiny security guards that keeps elephants well away from the farm.",
      "\u201cWith hives acting as a fence, I can continue crop-farming and also earn a livelihood from honey,\u201d Shika says. This year, he\u2019s made almost $250 selling honey.",
      "Changing crops can also make a difference. Elephants love maize and watermelons. But sesame? Blegh.",

    "story": [
      "Delivery drones are supposed to be fast, yet the long-promised technology has been slow to take off in the United States",
      "Delivery drones are so fast they can zip a pint of ice cream to a customer\u2019s driveway before it melts.",
      "Yet the long-promised technology has been slow to take off in the United States. More than six years after the Federal Aviation Administration approved commercial home deliveries with drones, the service mostly has been confined to a few suburbs and rural areas.",
      "That could soon change. The FAA proposed a new rule last week that would make it easier for companies to fly drones outside of an operator's line of sight and therefore over longer distances. A handful of companies do that now, but they had to obtain waivers and certification as an air carrier to deliver packages.",
      "While the rule is intended to streamline the process, authorized retailers and drone companies that have tested fulfilling orders from the sky say they plan to make drone-based deliveries available to millions more U.S. households.",
      "Walmart and Wing, a drone company owned by Google parent Alphabet, currently provide deliveries from 18 Walmart stores in the Dallas area. By next summer, they expect to expand to 100 Walmart stores in Atlanta; Charlotte, North Carolina; Houston; and Orlando and Tampa, Florida.",
      "After launching its Prime Air delivery service in College Station, Texas, in late 2022, Amazon received FAA permission last year to operate autonomous drones that fly beyond a pilot's line of sight. The e-commerce company has since expand its drone delivery program to suburban Phoenix and has plans to offer the service in Dallas, San Antonio, Texas, and Kansas City.",
      "The concept of drone delivery has been around for well over a decade. Drone maker Zipline, which works with Walmart in Arkansas and the Dallas-Fort Worth area, began making deliveries to hospitals in Rwanda in 2016. Israel-based Flytrex, one of the drone companies DoorDash works with to carry out orders, launched drone delivery to households in Iceland in 2017.",
      "But Wing CEO Adam Woodworth said drone delivery has been in \u201ctreading water mode\u201d in the U.S. for years, with service providers afraid to scale up because the regulatory framework wasn\u2019t in place.",
      "\u201cYou want to be at the right moment where there\u2019s an overlap between the customer demand, the partner demand, the technical readiness and the regulatory readiness,\u201d Woodworth said. \u201cI think that we\u2019re reaching that planetary alignment right now.\u201d",
      "DoorDash, which works with both Wing and Flytrex, tested drone drop-offs in rural Virginia and greater Dallas before announcing an expansion into Charlotte. Getting takeout food this way may sound futuristic, but it's starting to feel normal in suburban Brisbane, Australia, where DoorDash has employed delivery drones for several years, said Harrison Shih, who leads the company's drone program.",
      "\u201cIt comes so fast and it's something flying into your neighborhood, but it really does seem like part of everyday life,\u201d Shih said.",
      "Even though delivery drones are still considered novel, the cargo they carry can be pretty mundane. Walmart said the top items from the more than 150,000 drone deliveries the nation's largest retailer has completed since 2021 include ice cream, eggs and Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups.",
      "Unlike traditional delivery, where one driver may have a truck full of packages, drones generally deliver one small order at a time. Wing\u2019s drones can carry packages weighing up to 2.5 pounds. They can travel up to 12 miles round trip. One pilot can oversee up to 32 drones.",
      "Zipline has a drone that can carry up to 4 pounds and fly 120 miles round trip. Some drones, like Amazon\u2019s, can carry heavier packages.",
      "Once an order is placed, it's packaged for flight and attached to a drone at a launch site. The drone automatically finds a route that avoids obstacles. A pilot observes as the aircraft flies to its destinations and lowers its cargo to the ground with retractable cords.",
      "Shakiba Enayati, an assistant professor of supply chain and analytics at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, researches ways that drones could speed the delivery of critical health supplies like donated organs and blood samples. The unmanned aircraft offer some advantages as a transport method, such as reduced emissions and improved access to goods for rural residents, Enayati said.",
      "But she also sees plenty of obstacles. Right now, it costs around $13.50 per delivery to carry a package by drone versus $2 for a traditional vehicle, Enayati said. Drones need well-trained employees to oversee them and can have a hard time in certain weather.",

She thinks the same thing could happen with drones, especially as improved technology reduces the chance for errors.",
      "Woodworth added that U.S. airspace is tightly controlled, and companies need to demonstrate to the FAA that their drones are safe and reliable before they are cleared to fly. Even under the proposed new rules, the FAA would set detailed requirements for drone operators.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why it takes so long to build a business in the space. But I think it leads to everybody fundamentally building higher quality things,\u201d Woodworth said.",
      "Others worry that drones may potentially replace human delivery drivers. Shih thinks that\u2019s unlikely. One of DoorDash's most popular items is 24-packs of water, Shih said, which aren't realistic for existing drones to ferry.",
      "\u201cI believe that drone delivery can be fairly ubiquitous and can cover a lot of things. We just don't think its probable today that it\u2019ll carry a 40-pound bag of dog food to you,\" Shih said.",
      "DoorDash said that in the areas where it offers drone deliveries, orders requiring the services of human delivery drivers also increase.",
      "That\u2019s been the experience of John Kim, the owner of PurePoke restaurant in Frisco, Texas. Kim signed on to offer drone deliveries through DoorDash last year. He doesn\u2019t know what percentage of his DoorDash customers are choosing the service instead of regular delivery, but his overall DoorDash orders are up 15% this year.",
      "Kim said he\u2019s heard no complaints from drone delivery customers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very stable, maybe even better than some of the drivers that toss it in the back with all the other orders,\u201d Kim said.",
      "For some, drones can simply be a nuisance. When the FAA asked for public comments on Amazon\u2019s request to expand deliveries in College Station, numerous residents expressed concern that drones with cameras violated their privacy. Amazon says its drones use cameras and sensors to navigate and avoid obstacles but may record overhead videos of people while completing a delivery.",
      "Other residents complained about noise.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like a giant nagging mosquito,\u201d one respondent wrote. Amazon has since released a quieter drone.",
      "But others love the service. Janet Toth of Frisco, Texas, said she saw drone deliveries in Korea years ago and wondered why the U.S. didn\u2019t have them. So she was thrilled when DoorDash began providing drone delivery in her neighborhood.",
      "Toth now orders drone delivery a few times a month. Her 9-year-old daughter Julep said friends often come over to watch the drone.",
      "\u201cI love to go outside, wave at the drone, say \u2018Thank you\u2019 and get the food,\u201d Julep Toth said.",

      "Erin has become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, with several areas already on alert for heavy rain while strong waves and rip currents are possible along the East Coast of the United States as early as next week.",
      "As of Saturday night, Hurricane Erin had weakened into a Category 4 storm with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. Fluctuations in the storm's intensity are expected over the next 24 to 48 hours, but Erin is still forecast to remain a major hurricane through at least Wednesday of next week.",
      "Located about 145 miles north-northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico, Erin continued to lash the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with heavy rains and gusty winds. Downed trees and power poles were reported in around the San Juan area of Puerto Rico. The highest rainfall totals reported along the northern shores of St. Thomas and Puerto Rico ranged between 1 to 2 inches, with locally higher amounts in the British Virgin Islands.",

      "Moving to next week, Erin will continue to move northwest, staying east of the Bahamas. The storm should begin to slow down and turn north by Monday and will track in between Bermuda and the East Coast of the U.S.",
      "The majority of meteorological modeling continues to keep Erin well off the East Coast of the U.S. by hundreds of miles, but large waves and life-threatening rip currents are still expected to reach the coast from Aug. 20 to Aug. 27.",
      "This would not only be dangerous for anyone entering the waters, but also for property along the coast, as erosion -- especially along North Carolina's Outer Banks -- could be a serious threat. The Outer Banks and other parts of North Carolina could see waves of 8 to 12 feet, with other areas of South Carolina and Virginia possibly seeing waves reaching 6 feet next week.",

      "Mountain resorts near Sarajevo are shifting from snow sports to summer tourism",
      "SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- A short drive from the Mediterranean coast, mid-altitude mountain resorts near Sarajevo \u2014 traditionally dependent on snow sports \u2014 are slowly but steadily pivoting to attract summertime tourists.",
      "Despite Bosnia\u2019s notoriously poor record-keeping, tourism officials in the mountainous Balkan country of 3.3 million say a clear trend is emerging.",
      "\u201cWe used to rely on snow, but there is no escaping the fact that snow is now likely to fall and accumulate at altitudes above 2,500 meters (8,000 feet) and our mountains are simply not that high,\u201d said Haris Fazlagic, the Sarajevo tourism board president.",
      "Fazlagic believes that by expanding their summer offerings, mountain resorts can lure tourists away from the scorching heat and high costs of traditional seaside vacations along the Adriatic coast of Croatia and Montenegro. He said increasing the area's year-round appeal is \u201cthe future of tourism,\u201d but acknowledged it\u2019s a long-term strategy.",
      "In 2017, after several winters with little snow, the Jahorina and Bjelasnica mountains near Sarajevo began to expand their summer offerings. These mountains, which hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics, have elevations of 1,906 meters (6,253 feet) and 2,067 meters (6,781 feet), respectively.",
      "They now operate ski lifts year-round for scenic views and are steadily adding new hiking, biking and ATV trails and tours.",
      "\u201cThe weather here is fantastic \u2014 it's not hot at all,\" said Dusko Kurtovic, a visitor from the Bosnian town of Doboj, while on a walk during a short vacation in Jahorina last week.",
      "Like other visitors exploring the forest trails and riding ski lifts around Sarajevo, Kurtovic was dressed for balmy summer weather. Temperatures here typically stay between 24 and 30 degrees Celsius (75-86 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "The weather is a welcome change for tourists, as coastal regions in Central and Eastern Europe have experienced increasingly frequent and prolonged heat waves, with daily temperatures often reaching 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in the past few years.",

Unlike their Bosnian counterparts who are trying to increase visitors, Dubrovnik\u2019s tourism authorities are focused on managing crowds, limiting the number of tourists from cruise ships in the city to 4,000 at any one time during the day and restricting traffic around the Old Town to local permit holders.",
      "Despite these restrictions and extreme summer heat, Dubrovnik recorded nearly two million overnight stays in the first seven months of 2025, almost double that of the Sarajevo region.",
      "While climate change is driving Bosnia and Croatia toward different tourism strategies, both countries share a common objective: to \u201cextend the season\u201d and become a \u201cyear-round tourist destination,\u201d in the words of Aida Hodzic of the Dubrovnik tourism board.",

      "After about 2 1/2 hours of talks at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, the two men appeared before reporters for what had been billed as a joint news conference \u2014 but they took no questions.",
      "\u201cWe had an extremely productive meeting and many points were agreed to, there are just a very few that are left,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.\u201d",
      "Putin, welcomed into the U.S. after being shunned by Western allies since early 2022 for ordering the invasion of Ukraine, thanked Trump for hosting the meeting and suggested with a chuckle that the next time the two sit down it could be in Moscow.",
      "Here are key takeaways from the summit:",
      "Putin got a red carpet welcome and even rode in Trump\u2019s presidential limousine from the tarmac to the summit venue. There, the pair were joined by two of their top aides: Secretary of State and national security adviser Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff for Trump and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and national security adviser Yuri Ushakov for Putin.",
      "Putin, who spoke first after the meeting concluded, lauded the historical relationship between the United States, Russia and the former Soviet Union, recalling joint missions conducted by the two countries during World War II.",
      "He said the U.S. and Russia share values, a standard talking point for Russian officials when trying to woo Trump and his aides. Putin also noted that Trump has frequently said the Ukraine war wouldn\u2019t have happened had he won the 2020 election.",
      "\"I think that would have been the case,\" the Russian leader said, a comment sure to please Trump.",
      "However, there is no indication and no way to prove that Moscow would have acted differently toward Ukraine had Democrat Joe Biden not been elected.",
      "Trump had gone into the meeting hoping to get Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine \u2014 or at least a commitment from Russia to enter into negotiations to reach one.",
      "Instead, Trump conceded that \u201cwe haven\u2019t quite got there\u201d and said he would be conferring with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO leaders about next steps.",
      "Trump said he and Putin had made some significant progress toward the goal of ending the conflict but gave no details on what that entailed and had to acknowledge that they had been unable to bridge substantial gaps.",
      "\u201cI believe we had a very productive meeting,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t quite got there, but we\u2019ve made some headway. So, there\u2019s no deal until there\u2019s a deal.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In California\u2019s Death Valley National Park, one of the hottest places on Earth, summer temperatures can soar into the 130s F",
      "DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. -- Ray Estrada's 11-year-old grandson is used to Las Vegas' scorching summers, but he'd always wanted to experience the heat in one of the Earth's hottest places. So Estrada recently drove him to Death Valley National Park, with an umbrella, extra water and electrolytes in tow. That day, the thermometer soared to 118 F (47.78 C).",
      "\u201cWe have to be very careful when we go out there,\u201d Estrada told him. \u201cIf you start feeling dizzy or whatever... we\u2019re just gonna turn back and be safe so we can do this again another time.\u201d",
      "The extreme temperatures in this stretch of California desert attract visitors every year, some determined to finish a grueling, multiday race, others just curious about the sizzling heat and the landscape's vast beauty. Yet despite the warnings, the heat kills one to three people annually, and park rangers respond to overheated visitors multiple times per week, making communication about heat safety a priority for the National Park Service.",
      "But that's easier said than done.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to underestimate how dangerous heat is,\" said Abby Wines, the park's acting deputy superintendent. \u201cPeople are usually used to thinking of heat as something that makes them uncomfortable,\" and that they can tough it out.",
      "\u201cThis type of heat will kill,\u201d she said.",
      "Death Valley holds the record for the hottest temperature ever officially recorded \u2014 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 \u2014 although some experts have disputed it and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C) there in July 2021.",
      "In the U.S., heat kills more people than other weather events combined, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. If planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, which come from burning fuels like oil and coal, continue at their current pace, more places could experience broiling temperatures. That makes it crucial to communicate the dangers of extreme heat and safety precautions, as both can influence who lives and dies.",
      "Throughout this desert are stark warnings of the deadly heat: \u201cStop. Extreme heat danger. Walking after 10 a.m. not recommended,\u201d one sign says. \u201cHEAT KILLS!\u201d warns another. On bathroom walls there are reminders to hydrate in the form of charts displaying the color of pee \u2014 the darker the urine, the more you need to drink water.",
      "Another sign warns visitors that helicopters for medical emergencies can\u2019t safely fly amid extreme temperatures. Ambulances can often deploy in extreme heat but are not a guarantee. The safety of emergency responders is always considered.",
      "Baruch Fischhoff, professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies decision-making, said evidence shows that people generally underestimate risk when they have a sense of control. Information that explicitly says rescue might not be an option if it\u2019s too hot \u201ctakes away that sense of the control that can lead to underestimating risk.\u201d",
      "Failing to recognize those risks can be deadly. Last summer, a helicopter was unable to fly to a rescue because of 128 F (53.33 C) temperatures. A group of visitors were traveling on motorcycles when one died from the heat, and another was treated for severe heat illness and transported to a hospital.",
      "Rescue options are even more limited for hikers lost on a trail. Unless it\u2019s a short distance and rescuers know where the person is, they\u2019ll likely wait until sunset if it\u2019s above 115 F (46.11 C). \u201cDepending on their situation,\u201d Wines said, that's \u201cprobably too late.\u201d",
      "Two of the park's busiest months are in the summer, and it sees a small bump in visitors when temperatures are expected to hit the high 120s or 130s F (48.89s to 54.44s C). But it's the moderate temperatures that tend to get people into more trouble.",
      "\u201cWe actually have a harder time communicating our concerns about heat to the public when they visit and it\u2019s only 100 to 115,\" Wines said. The dryness evaporates sweat almost instantly, so many people don't realize how much they're actually sweating.",
      "Then there's the vastness. Death Valley has more than 50 entrances, so many visitors aren't seeing rangers who can relay important information. Instead, they place heat warning signs in the hottest and most popular spots. But they discovered that people responded less to heat warning signs that looked permanent compared to those that seemed temporary.",

      "Jennifer Marlon, senior research scientist at the Yale School of the Environment, has studied public perceptions of the health risks of extreme heat across the U.S. How people perceive heat and other climate risks varies by factors like age, race, gender, income level and where they live. Older white men, for instance, tend to have lower risk perceptions across the board, whereas women have higher risk perceptions than men.",
      "\u201cThe challenge, though, is that the level of worry or risk perception doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into action,\u201d Marlon said. Optimism bias could also falsely make a person believe the heat won\u2019t personally affect them. While studies show that experience with heat increases people\u2019s concern, it is short-lived.",
      "\u201cYou get a bump for like a year or so after a really big event and then it just goes right back to the baseline,\u201d she said.",
      "Marlon said to be specific. Don't just tell people that heat can be lethal, tell them what could happen to their bodies and what to do to stay safe.",
      "Death Valley park does this. On site and online, park officials tell visitors to avoid hiking at low elevations after 10 a.m., to stay on paved roads and near their cars. They say to drink and carry plenty of water, and to seek shade and hydrate if you feel dizzy, nauseous or have a headache.",
      "And while this isn't something the park would initiate, if scientists gave names to heat waves, similar to how hurricanes are named, that could better grab people\u2019s attention because human brains are attuned to novelty, Marlon said.",
      "The messenger is also important. If friends, family and neighbors are worried and nudging you to do something, that can be more powerful than reading information online. Community leaders modeling appropriate behavior \u2014 like saying they\u2019re evacuating their family ahead of a hurricane or that they carry extra water in their trunk \u2014 can also go a long way.",
      "Marlon also suggested communicating how extreme heat can impair the ability to think clearly. When communicating with images, show people drinking water, putting on cold wet towels or resting in shade.",
      "\u201cWhatever the recommended behavior is, show them pictures of that behavior because we\u2019re incredibly and fundamentally social animals, and body language is so much of how we communicate,\u201d Marlon said.",

      "Gee called last week's hearing \u201cd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u201d after reminding the court of the federal government's attempt to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement in 2019 under the first Trump administration. She repeated the sentiment in Friday's order.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing new under the sun regarding the facts or the law. The Court therefore could deny Defendants\u2019 motion on that basis alone,\" Gee wrote, referring to the government's appeal to a law they believed kept the court from enforcing the agreement.",

      "Kylan Darnell is a TikTok star known for documenting sorority recruitment, but she decided to step back from posting this year",
      "TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- Kylan Darnell became an overnight celebrity in the TikTok niche that documents the glitzy, ritualistic recruitment process for sororities. As a 21-year-old rising senior four years later, she's taking more of her sorority life offline.",
      "Darnell has until now been the embodiment of RushTok, a week-long marathon that has teens at schools around the country meticulously documenting their efforts to land a cherished spot in a sorority during the colorful, girly and enigmatic recruitment process known as rush week.",
      "Reactions to the content that once catapulted her to fame \u2014 depicting her life as a Zeta Tau Alpha member at the University of Alabama \u2014 had become so negative that it was affecting her mental health, she said.",
      "\u201cThis year it was just like a whole different level of hate,\" Darnell said.",
      "Citing a need to protect prospects from harassment, many sororities have made similar moves, issuing a de facto ban against talking to the press or posting on social media during rush week at Alabama, where almost 13,000 students participate in the nation's largest on-campus Greek life.",
      "Across the country, rush is typically a 10-day event where \u201cprospective new members\u201d try out sororities through rounds of activities prescribing a strict slate of outfits and etiquette. In the lead-up, girls often submit \"social resumes\" and letters of recommendation from sorority alums.",
      "Participation often requires an eye-opening price tag.",
      "After spending sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on outfits, makeup and plane tickets, each of this week's 2,600 recruits paid $550 to participate. It's non-refundable if they don't get picked. If accepted, they'll pay an average $8,400 a semester to live in the sorority house, or $4,100 if they live elsewhere, according to the Alabama Panhellenic Association.",
      "The pressure can be so intense that an industry of consultants now helps girls navigate the often mysterious criteria for landing a desired sorority. Some charge up to $10,000 for months of services that can begin in high school.",
      "Throughout rush, many events are invite-only. At any point, girls can get a dreaded call informing them they\u2019ve been dropped \u2014 that a sorority is no longer interested in letting them join. Matches are finally made on bid day as prospects rank top choices and sororities make offers.",
      "Morgan Cadenhead, now 20, gained such an audience on RushTok despite being dropped that she covered most of her tuition with income from social media. Then came the social cost as she was slammed online for criticizing Greek life. Now the marketing major \u2014 featured on Lifetime\u2019s \u201cSorority Mom\u2019s Guide to Rush!\u201d \u2014 said she's looking for offline work.",
      "A fixation with rush was renewed when sororities resumed in-person recruiting after the pandemic.",
      "Social media became flooded with \u201coutfit of the day\u201d and \u201cget ready with me\u201d videos showing sorority members and recruits in well-lit rooms, sometimes flaunting exorbitantly priced designer wear or pieces purchased on Amazon, always precisely curated.",

Today, Black students outside of traditionally Black sororities and fraternities represent 2% of the total Greek membership, the university website says.",

      "Stefaneli coaches girls from around the country, and about a third of her clients enroll at Alabama. She says many are drawn by the vibrant depictions of sisterhood, showing female friendships that can ensure girls feel seen and supported.",
      "\u201cThat's the reason why a lot of them want to go to Alabama, is because they see it on TikTok,\u201d Stefaneli said.",
      "If they gain enough followers to become social influencers, RushTok participants can earn ad revenue and brand deals. Darnell's posts brought her financial independence, more than covering the $58,000 it costs her annually to attend Alabama from out-of-state.",
      "Rush can be fun and help girls build confidence, but it's also an \u201cemotional rollercoaster,\u201d especially for girls who feel they need to reveal themselves to a massive audience, Stefaneli said. She answers phone calls at all hours of the night during rush week.",

      "By adding outside troops to join the existing Guard deployment and federal law enforcement officers, Trump is exercising even tighter control over the city. It\u2019s a power play that the president has justified as an emergency response to crime and homelessness, even though city officials have noted that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump\u2019s first term in office.",

      "The future of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon has split the United States and its European allies with implications for security in the Middle East",
      "WASHINGTON -- The future of U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon has split the United States and its European allies, raising implications for security in the Middle East and becoming the latest snag to vex relations between the U.S. and key partners like France, Britain and Italy.",
      "At issue is the peacekeeping operation known as UNIFIL, whose mandate expires at the end of August and will need to be renewed by the U.N. Security Council to continue. It was created to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon after Israel\u2019s 1978 invasion, and its mission was expanded following the monthlong 2006 war between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah.",
      "The multinational force has played a significant role in monitoring the security situation in southern Lebanon for decades, including during the Israel-Hezbollah war last year, but has drawn criticism from both sides and numerous U.S. lawmakers, some of whom now hold prominent roles in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration or wield new influence with the White House.",
      "Trump administration political appointees came into office this year with the aim of shutting down UNIFIL as soon as possible. They regard the operation as an ineffectual waste of money that is merely delaying the goal of eliminating Hezbollah\u2019s influence and restoring full security control to the Lebanese Armed Forces that the government says it is not yet capable of doing.",
      "After securing major cuts in U.S. funding to the peacekeeping force, Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed off early last week on a plan that would wind down and end UNIFIL in the next six months, according to Trump administration officials and congressional aides familiar with the discussions.",
      "It\u2019s another step as the Trump administration drastically pares back its foreign affairs priorities and budget, including expressing skepticism of international alliances and cutting funding to U.N. agencies and missions. The transatlantic divide also has been apparent on issues ranging from Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza and the Russia-Ukraine conflict to trade, technology and free speech issues.",
      "Israel has for years sought an end to UNIFIL\u2019s mandate, and renewal votes have often come after weeks of political wrangling. Now, the stakes are particularly high after last year\u2019s war and more vigorous opposition in Washington.",
      "European nations, notably France and Italy, have objected to winding down UNIFIL. With the support of Tom Barrack, U.S. ambassador to Turkey and envoy to Lebanon, they successfully lobbied Rubio and others to support a one-year extension of the peacekeeping mandate followed by a time-certain wind-down period of six months, according to the administration officials and congressional aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic negotiations.",
      "Israel also reluctantly agreed to an extension, they said.",
      "The European argument was that prematurely ending UNIFIL before the Lebanese army is able to fully secure the border area would create a vacuum that Hezbollah could easily exploit.",
      "The French noted that when a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali was terminated before government troops were ready to deal with security threats, Islamic extremists moved in.",
      "With the U.S. easing off, the issue ahead of the U.N. vote expected at the end of August now appears to be resistance by France and others to setting a firm deadline for the operation to end after the one-year extension, according to the officials and congressional aides.",
      "French officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The final French draft resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, does not include a date for UNIFIL's withdrawal, which U.S. officials say is required for their support. Instead, it would extend the peacekeeping mission for one year and indicates the U.N. Security Council's \u201cintention to work on a withdrawal.\u201d",
      "But even if the mandate is renewed, the peacekeeping mission might be scaled down for financial reasons, with the U.N. system likely facing drastic budget cuts, said a U.N. official, who was not authorized to comment to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity.",

      "In an interview, Hill argued that Trump had emerged from the meeting in a weaker position on the world stage because of his reversal. Other leaders, she said, might now look at the U.S. president and think he\u2019s \u201cnot the big guy that he thinks he is and certainly not the dealmaking genius.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll the way along, Trump was convinced he has incredible forces of persuasion,\u201d she said, but he came out of the meeting without a ceasefire \u2014 the \u201cone thing\u201d he had been pushing for, even after he gave the Russian leader the \u201cred carpet treatment.\"",
      "Trump has \u201crun up against a rock in the form of Putin, who doesn\u2019t want anything from him apart from Ukraine,\" she said.",
      "At home, Democrats expressed alarm at what at times seemed like a day of deference, with Trump clapping for Putin as he walked down a red carpet during an elaborate ceremony welcoming him to U.S. soil for the first time in a decade. The two rode together in the presidential limousine and exchanged compliments.",
      "Trump seemed to revel in particular in Putin echoing his oft-repeated assertion that Russia never would have invaded Ukraine if Trump had been in office instead of Democrat Joe Biden at the time.",
      "Before news cameras, Trump did not use the opportunity to castigate Putin for launching the largest ground invasion in Europe since World War II or human rights abuses he's been accused of committing. Instead, Putin was the one who spoke first, and invited Trump to join him in Moscow next.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump appears to have been played yet again by Vladimir Putin,\" said Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cThe President rolled out a red carpet and warmly greeted a murderous dictator on American soil and reports indicate he got nothing concrete in return.\u201d",
      "\u201cEnough is enough,\" she went on. \u201cIf President Trump won\u2019t act, Congress must do so decisively by passing crushing sanctions when we return in the coming weeks.\u201d",
      "Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who is the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he supports diplomacy but \u201cpeacemaking must be done responsibly.\u201d",

      "Working from an office in the charming village of Hamilton, down the road from Colgate University, Marshall prepared taxes and sold insurance. He also took money for what was sometimes called the \u201c8% Fund,\u201d which guaranteed that much in annual interest no matter what happened with the financial markets.",

      "Marshall's lawyers declined to comment.",
      "Total losses by Marshall's investors fall short of the multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme masterminded by Bernie Madoff. But they loom large in the small, college town of about 6,400 people and its largely rural surrounding area.",
      "Many investors were Colgate professors, laborers, office workers or retirees. Some lost their life's savings of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. Corrigan and her husband, who own a restaurant 30 miles (48 kilometers) east, were owed about $1.5 million.",
      "Now they're wondering how someone who seemed so reliable, who held annual parties for his clients and even called them on their birthdays could betray their trust.",

Withdrawals could be made with 30 days\u2019 notice. People could choose to receive regular interest payments.",

      "It has been 150 years since miners first flocked to South Dakota's Black Hills in a gold rush that displaced Native Americans",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- A gold rush brought settlers to South Dakota's Black Hills roughly 150 years ago, chasing the dream of wealth and displacing Native Americans in the process.",
      "Now, a new crop of miners driven by gold prices at more than $3,000 an ounce are seeking to return to the treasured landscape, promising an economic boost while raising fears of how modern gold extraction could forever change the region.",
      "\u201cThese impacts can be long term and make it so that tourism and outdoor recreation is negatively impacted,\u201d said Lilias Jarding, executive director of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance. \u201cOur enjoyment of the Black Hills as a peaceful place, a sacred place, is disturbed.\u201d",
      "The Black Hills encompass over 1.2 million acres (485,622 hectares), rising up from the Great Plains in southwest South Dakota and extending into Wyoming. The jagged peaks are smaller than those of the Rocky Mountains, but the lush pine-covered hills are sacred to the Lakota Sioux people and serve as a destination for millions of tourists who visit Mount Rushmore and state parks.",
      "One gold mine now operates in the Black Hills, but companies have proposals before state and federal agencies for another one, plus exploratory drilling sites that they hope will lead to full-fledged mines. That has prompted opposition by Native American tribes and environmentalists who argue the projects are close to sacred sites, will contaminate waterways and permanently scar the landscape.",
      "Gold extraction has changed dramatically in the decades since prospectors first began panning for gold in the Black Hills. The industry now typically relies on massive trucks and diggers that create deep, multitiered pits and use chemicals like cyanide to extract the gold.",
      "The land can never return to its original state. The Homestake mine, once the largest and deepest gold mine in the Western Hemisphere, now sits barren in Lead, South Dakota, and is used for scientific research.",
      "Interest in Black Hills gold mining has soared along with the price of the metal. When the Homestake mine closed in 2002, gold sold for about $300 an ounce. Now it goes for about 10 times as much.",
      "Joseph Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council, attributes the price spike to global economic uncertainty.",
      "\u201cGold tends to be a stable asset,\u201d he said. \u201cThat actually performs well in inflationary times, and holds its value in recessionary times. That\u2019s why gold as an asset in investment.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump also boosted the industry by issuing an executive order in March to increase American mineral production, calling for expedited permitting and reviews.",
      "Colin Paterson, professor emeritus of geological engineering at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, notes that Black Hills gold is encased in rock. To extract it, the rock is crushed and then a chemical like cyanide is used to dissolve the mineral and remove it.",
      "Coeur Mining runs the single active mine in the Black Hills, but the company Dakota Gold has plans for an open pit mine to begin operating in 2029. The company is also targeting the area near the old Homestake site to build an underground mine where workers would descend hundreds or even thousands of feet into shafts.",

Dakota Gold will conduct an environmental study and surveys of soil and vegetation to ensure safe operation, Henris said.",
      "\u201cMost of the people that work here are from this area and just love to live here,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re a big part of the Hills and we love them just as much as other folks.\u201d",
      "To a great extent, gold mining helped create the modern Black Hills region.",
      "The U.S. government signed a treaty in 1868 that recognized the Sioux Nation's right to the Black Hills, but the government seized the land after the discovery of gold and allowed settlers into the region. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled the Sioux were entitled to compensation, but they have not accepted any and maintain their claim to the land.",
      "Tribes have largely opposed mining in the Black Hills.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a central truth about mining in the Black Hills in that it was never the most mineral rich place there ever was,\u201d said Taylor Gunhammer, local organizer with the Indigenous advocacy group NDN Collective and an Oglala Sioux, one of the Lakota people. \u201cIt\u2019s not even the actual mineral content of the Black Hills that is so attractive to mining companies. It\u2019s the permissive nature of the officials who oversee mining.\u201d",
      "Some proposed projects, such as Dakota Gold\u2019s mine, are on private land and only subject to state rules, not the U.S. Forest Service regulations required for projects on public acreage.",
      "Environmentalists have focused their opposition on the possibility of chemicals leaks. They note that Coeur's Wharf mine has had nearly 200 spills and that the former Homestake mine was closed because it contaminated a nearby creek.",
      "Coeur\u2019s environmental manager, Jasmine McCauley, said in a statement that each spill was \"thoroughly investigated, mitigated, and corrective actions are put in place to prevent reoccurrence.\u201d The company is always improving its processes, she added.",
      "Jarding, of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance, said she remains concerned about the number of projects in the works.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important that people understand the exponential growth in mining activity that\u2019s been happening in the Black Hills over the last five years or so,\u201d Jarding said. \"There are currently active mining claims on 271,000 acres in the Black Hills. That\u2019s 20% of the whole Black Hills that is potentially going to be subject to mining.\u201d",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- Months before New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell was set to leave office because of term limits, she has been indicted in what prosecutors allege was a yearslong scheme to conceal a romantic relationship with her bodyguard.",
      "Prosecutors say bodyguard Jeffrey Vappie was being paid as if he was working when he and Cantrell were really alone in apartments and visiting vineyards, hiding their communication by sending encrypted messages through WhatsApp and then deleting them. Although the pair have said their relationship was strictly professional, the indictment described it as \u201cpersonal and intimate.\u201d",
      "The first female mayor in New Orleans\u2019 300-year history has been charged with conspiracy, fraud and obstruction. Vappie was already facing charges of wire fraud and making false statements. He has pleaded not guilty. A grand jury returned an 18-count indictment Friday that added Cantrell to the case.",
      "The City of New Orleans said in a statement that it was aware of the indictment and that the mayor\u2019s attorney was reviewing it.",
      "Cantrell hasn\u2019t sent out a message on her official social media feed on X since July 15, when she said the city was experiencing historic declines in crime. She and her remaining allies have said that she has been unfairly targeted as a Black woman and held to a different standard than male officials.",
      "Here are things to know about the mayor and the indictment:",
      "The indictment paints a detailed picture of Cantrell and her bodyguard traveling to vineyards and spending time alone in apartments at the same time it says Vappie was being paid as if he was working.",
      "Vappie reminisced in a WhatsApp exchange cited in the indictment about joining Cantrell in Scotland in October 2021, saying that was \u201cwhere it all started.\u201d",
      "Cantrell had told local reporters she needed a security detail \u201cdue to COVID,\u201d saying her travel accommodations were \u201ca matter of safety, not of luxury.\u201d",
      "The following year, instead of Cantrell attending a conference in Miami, authorities said the pair rendezvoused on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Vappie\u2019s travel to the island was covered by the city to attend a separate conference.",
      "\u201cThe times when we are truly (traveling) is what spoils me the most,\u201d the mayor wrote to him that month.",
      "That same year, they also visited several California wineries, according to the indictment. After a \u201ctrusted staff member\u201d posted a photo of the three of them on social media, one of Cantrell's associates asked them to remove it.",
      "They met in an apartment while Vappie claimed to be on duty, and Cantrell arranged for him to attend 14 trips, Acting U.S. Attorney Michael Simpson said. The trips, he added, were described by her as times \u201cwhen they were truly alone.\u201d",
      "In all, New Orleans taxpayers paid more than $70,000 for Vappie\u2019s travel, Simpson said.",

      "Ziva Mann remembers how joyful and smiley her daughter was as a child \u2014 the family even gave her the nickname \u201cGiggles.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe was just sunshine,\u201d Mann said. That changed around second grade, when her joy began to fade. \u201cShe got sadder and sadder,\u201d Mann recalled. \u201cIt was like watching someone disappear.\u201d",
      "Mann later realized that her child\u2019s growing sadness was connected to a struggle to reckon with her gender identity.",
      "Her daughter came out as transgender at home in Massachusetts four years ago. \u201cMom, I\u2019m a girl,\u201d Mann remembers hearing her say. Though she was surprised by the news, she quickly came to admire her daughter\u2019s bravery.",
      "Since then, the family has striven to find the best ways to support Ellie within their modern Orthodox community, where tradition and strict gender roles shape daily life. They\u2019ve managed to find emotional and spiritual resources close to home at a time when transgender rights are under attack nationwide.",
      "Two of the three biggest branches of Judaism in the U.S. \u2014 Reform and Conservative \u2014 support the rights of transgender people, but it can still be challenging for trans youth to find an inclusive congregation.",
      "Schools in Orthodox Jewish communities are typically divided by gender, and most synagogues have separate seating sections for men and women \u2014 sometimes on different floors.",
      "\u201cOrthodoxy today is just binary,\u201d said Myriam Kabakov, co-founder and executive director of Eshel, an organization supporting LGBTQ+ people in Orthodox environments. \u201cYou\u2019re either male or you\u2019re female. So if a trans person is in between transitioning, very often they will be asked not to come to synagogue.\u201d",
      "She said even after someone has fully transitioned, rabbis should allow them to sit where they feel comfortable. But that acceptance is not guaranteed.",
      "To connect parents and trans children with inclusive synagogues, Eshel developed a program called \u201cWelcoming Shuls,\u201d where people can confide in spiritual leaders who will treat them with respect.",
      "According to Kabakov, about 300 rabbis and 160 families with trans members have joined their listings. Deslie Paneth is among them. She lives on Long Island and has traveled far to find support for Ollie, her transgender son.",
      "\u201cOne night, I said to my husband \u2018I need help, I don\u2019t know how to navigate this,'\u201d Paneth said. \u201cWithout Eshel, I don\u2019t know how this would have turned out for any of us.\u201d",
      "Mann defines herself as modern Orthodox, meaning she strives to uphold Judaic law while embracing the values within her family.",
      "\u201cThe only time we break the rules is to save someone\u2019s life,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause a life is more important than all of the rules.\u201d",
      "Respecting her daughter\u2019s identity felt akin to saving her life, so Mann didn\u2019t feel the need to talk to God about it. She said who her daughter is as a person mattered more than the gender she thought she had.",
      "Mann has heard of families with trans children who were asked to leave their synagogue, but this didn\u2019t happened to her. Before discussing Ellie's identity with other relatives, Mann reached out to her rabbi. He assured her that her daughter would be treated with dignity and respect.",
      "\u201cHe offered us a blessing,\u201d Mann said. \u201cThe strength, the love and the grace to parent a child who\u2019s walking a difficult path.\u201d",
      "Mann feels lucky to have found support, both in religious spaces and among family members, which has helped Ellie be her joyful self again. Some Orthodox families have faced a tougher process.",

      "The counseling he provides for trans children and their parents is specific to each person, but in general, he offers fresh interpretations of the Hebrew Bible.",
      "\u201cThose who want to be transphobic say the Bible says you can\u2019t wear misgendered clothing,\u201d Moskowitz said. \u201cI think a response is that trans folks are not wearing misgendered clothing. They\u2019re wearing gender-affirming clothing.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Road safety activists and some states are pushing to depart from a longstanding rule that sets speed limits in the United States based largely on how fast drivers actually travel",
      "Rose Hammond pushed authorities for years to lower the 55 mph speed limit on a two-lane road that passes her assisted living community, a church, two schools and a busy park that hosts numerous youth sports leagues.",
      "\u201cWhat are you waiting for, somebody to get killed?\u201d the 85-year-old chided officials in northwest Ohio, complaining that nothing was being done about the motorcycles that race by almost daily.",
      "Amid growing public pressure, Sylvania Township asked county engineers in March to analyze whether Mitchaw Road's posted speed is too high. The surprising answer: Technically, it's 5 mph too low.",
      "The reason dates back to studies on rural roads from the 1930s and 1940s that still play an outsized role in the way speed limits are set across the U.S. \u2014 even in urban areas.",
      "Born from that research was a widely accepted concept known as the 85% rule, which suggests a road\u2019s posted speed should be tied to the 15th-fastest vehicle out of every 100 traveling it in free-flowing traffic, rounded to the nearest 5 mph increment.",
      "But after decades of closely following the rule, some states \u2014 with a nudge from the federal government \u2014 are seeking to modify if not replace it when setting guidelines for how local engineers should decide what speed limit to post.",
      "The concept assumes that a road's safest speed is the one most vehicles travel \u2014 neither too high nor too low. If drivers think the speed limit should be raised, they can simply step on the gas and \u201cvote with their feet,\u201d as an old brochure from the Institute of Transportation Engineers once put it.",
      "\u201cThe problem with this approach is it creates this feedback loop,\u201d said Jenny O'Connell, director of member programs for the National Association of City Transportation Officials. \u201cPeople speed, and then the speed limits will be ratcheted up to match that speed.\u201d",
      "The association developed an alternative to the 85% rule known as \u201cCity Limits,\u201d which aims to minimize the risk of injuries for all road users by setting the speed limit based on a formula that factors in a street's activity level and the likelihood of conflicts, such as collisions.",
      "The report points out the 85% rule is based on dated research and that \u201cthese historic roads are a far cry from the vibrant streets and arterials that typify city streets today.\u201d",
      "Amid a recent spike in road deaths across the country, the Federal Highway Administration sent a subtle but important message to states that the 85% rule isn't actually a rule at all and was carrying too much weight in determining local speed limits. In its first update since 2009 to a manual that establishes national guidelines for traffic signs, the agency clarified that communities should also consider such things as how the road is used, the risk to pedestrians, and the frequency of crashes.",
      "Leah Shahum, who directs the Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit advocating for street safety, said she wishes the manual had gone further in downplaying the 85% rule but acknowledges the change has already impacted the way some states set speed limits. Others, however, are still clinging to the simplicity and familiarity of the longstanding approach, she said.",
      "\u201cThe 85th percentile should not be the Holy Grail or the Bible, and yet over and over again it is accepted as that,\u201d Shahum said.",
      "Under its \u201c20 is Plenty\u201d campaign, the Wisconsin capital of Madison has been changing signs across the city this summer, lowering the speed limit from 25 mph to 20 mph on local residential streets.",
      "When Seattle took a similar step in a pilot program seven years ago, not only did it see a noticeable decline in serious injury crashes but also a 7% drop in the 85th percentile speed, according to the Vision Zero Network.",
      "California embraces the 85% rule even more than most states as its basis for setting speed limits. But legislators have loosened the restrictions on local governments a bit in recent years, allowing them to depart from the guidelines if they can cite a proven safety need. Advocates for pedestrians and bicyclists say the change helps, but is not enough.",

      "But Jay Beeber, executive director for policy at the National Motorists Association, an advocacy organization for drivers, said following the 85% rule is usually the safest way to minimize the variation in speed between drivers who abide by the posted limit and those who far exceed it.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't really matter what number you put on a sign,\u201d Beeber said. \u201cThe average driver drives the nature of the roadway. It would be patently unfair for a government to build a road to encourage people to drive 45 mph, put a 30 mph speed limit on it, and then ticket everyone for doing what they built the road to do.\u201d",
      "Fears about oil prices prompted Congress in the 1970s to set a 55 mph national maximum speed limit, which it later relaxed to 65 mph before repealing the law in 1995 and handing the authority to states. Since then, speed limits have kept climbing, with North Dakota this summer becoming the ninth state to allow drivers to go 80 mph on some stretches of highway. There's even a 40-mile segment in Texas between Austin and San Antonio where 85 mph is allowed.",
      "Although high-speed freeways outside major population centers aren't the focus of most efforts to ease the 85% rule, a 2019 study from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety \u2014 a research arm funded by auto insurers \u2014 illustrates the risks. Every 5 mph increase to a state's maximum speed limit increases the chance of fatalities by 8.5% on interstate highways and 2.8% on other roads, the study found.",
      "\u201cMaybe back when you were driving a Model T you had a real feel for how fast you were going, but in modern vehicles you don't have a sense of what 80 mph is. You're in a cocoon,\u201d said Chuck Farmer, the institute's vice president for research, who conducted the study.",
      "If elected officials in Sylvania Township, Ohio, got their way, Mitchaw Road's posted speed limit would be cut dramatically \u2014 from 55 mph to 40 mph or lower. The county's finding that the 85% rule actually calls for raising it to 60 mph surprised the town's leaders, but not the engineers who ran the study.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t make decisions based on data, it\u2019s very difficult to make good decisions,\u201d Lucas County Engineer Mike Pniewski said.",
      "For now, the speed limit will remain as it is. That's because Ohio law sets maximum speeds for 15 different types of roadways, regardless of what the 85% rule suggests.",
      "And Ohio's guidelines are evolving. The state now gives more consideration to roadway context and allows cities to reduce speed limits based on the lower standard of the 50th percentile speed when there's a large presence of pedestrians and bicyclists.

      "A jury in Salt Lake County found Nicholas Rossi guilty of a 2008 rape after a three-day trial in which his accuser and her parents took the stand.

      "President Donald Trump is on his way to a meeting with Russia's Vladimir Putin in Alaska",
      "JOINT BASE ELMENDORF-RICHARDSON, Alaska -- President Donald Trump is meeting face-to-face with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin on Friday for a pivotal Alaska summit that could reshape both the war in Ukraine and relations between Moscow and Washington.",
      "The sit-down gives Trump a chance to prove to the world that he is both a master dealmaker and a global peacemaker. He and his allies have cast him as a heavyweight negotiator who can find a way to bring the slaughter to a close \u2014 something he used to boast he could do quickly.",
      "For Putin, a summit with Trump offers a long-sought opportunity to try to negotiate a deal that would cement Russia\u2019s gains, block Kyiv\u2019s bid to join the NATO military alliance and eventually pull Ukraine back into Moscow\u2019s orbit. Despite having so much at stake, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders aren't invited.",
      "There are significant risks for Trump. By bringing Putin onto U.S. soil \u2014 America bought Alaska from Russia in 1867 for 2 cents per acre \u2014 the president is giving him the validation he desires after his ostracization following his invasion of Ukraine 3 1/2 years ago. Zelenskyy's exclusion from Trump and Putin's first meeting is a heavy blow to the West\u2019s policy of \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\u201d and invites the possibility that Trump could agree to a deal that Ukraine does not want.",
      "Any success is far from assured because Russia and Ukraine remain far apart in their demands for peace. Putin has long resisted any temporary ceasefire, linking it to a halt in Western arms supplies and a freeze on Ukraine\u2019s mobilization efforts, which were conditions rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies.",
      "\"HIGH STAKES!!!\" Trump posted shortly before he boarded Air Force One for Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage.",
      "On his way to the meeting, Putin stopped in Magadan, in Russia\u2019s Far East, where he visited a factory producing omega-3 fish oil capsules, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Putin was reviewing materials on Ukraine, tensions with the U.S., economic cooperation and global affairs during his four-hour flight to Alaska, where he will be greeted at his plane by Trump, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russian state TV.",
      "Trump and Putin have shared closely watched handshakes before \u2014 but Friday's will be as scrutinized as any, as will any body language or hints about how each is feeling.",
      "Trump on Thursday said there was a 25% chance that the summit would fail, but he also floated the idea that if the meeting succeeds he could bring Zelenskyy to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting \u2014 a possibility that Russia hasn't agreed to.",
      "When asked after arriving in Alaska about Trump's estimate of a 25% chance of failure, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that Russia \u201cnever plans ahead.\u201d",
      "\"We know that we have arguments, a clear, understandable position. We will state it,\u201d he said in footage posted to the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s Telegram channel.",
      "Trump said in a Fox News radio interview Thursday that he didn't know if they would get \u201can immediate ceasefire\u201d but he wanted a broad peace deal done quickly. That seemingly echoes Putin\u2019s longtime argument that Russia favors a comprehensive deal to end the fighting, reflecting its demands, not a temporary halt to hostilities.",
      "The Kremlin said Trump and Putin will first sit down for a one-on-one discussion, followed by the two delegations meeting and talks continuing over \u201ca working breakfast.\u201d They are then expected to hold a joint press conference.",
      "In the days leading up to the summit, Trump described it as \u201c really a feel-out meeting.\u201d But he's also warned of \u201cvery severe consequences\u201d for Russia if Putin doesn't agree to end the war and said that though Putin might bully other leaders, \u201cHe\u2019s not going to mess around with me.\u201d",
      "Trump said Friday that his talks with Putin will include Russian demands that Ukraine cede territory as part of a peace deal. He said Ukraine has to decide, but he also suggested Zelenskyy should accept concessions.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got to let Ukraine make that decision. And I think they\u2019ll make a proper decision,\u201d Trump told reporters traveling with him to Alaska.",

      "Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a senior fellow and director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, said U.S. antagonists like China, Iran and North Korea will be paying attention to Trump's posture to see \u201cwhether or not the threats that he continues to make against Putin are indeed credible.\u201d",

      "The admission is just the latest bungle from New York\u2019s beleaguered legal marijuana program, which has been hamstrung by legal challenges, a slow rollout and gaps in the law that allowed an illicit market to flourish.",
      "Business owners found out about the issue from the Office of Cannabis Management last month, which admitted it should have been measuring from the edge of a school\u2019s property line, rather than its entrance, to ensure weed stores were kept at least 500 feet (152 meters) away.",
      "\u201cTo give you this news, and for the weight of it, I am incredibly sorry,\u201d said Felicia A.B. Reid, acting executive director of the cannabis agency, said in notices to the businesses.",
      "The error impacts a sizable share of the state\u2019s roughly 450 cannabis dispensaries.",
      "About 60 of those were licensed using the erroneous measurement system, mostly in New York City, plus around another 40 that have licenses but are yet to open their doors.",
      "On top of that, there are almost 50 other businesses that have applied for licenses under the incorrect measurement system and are awaiting final approval from the agency. The state has set aside a pot of money where applicants can get up to $250,000 to help relocate.",
      "The existing shops have been told they can remain open for now, and even continue to operate with their expired licenses as long as the businesses file an application for a renewal.",

      "Melodies and lyrics were key goals",
      "Swift opened up about the primary objectives she had making \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"",

      "\"I would leave the stage every night going down the elevator, lift,\" Swift said. \"That's how every single Eras show ended \u2014 except for the last one, where I exited through a door, an orange door, to be specific. And that actually was an Easter egg. Basically the reason why I chose to exit that way is because I kind of wanted to give a little subliminal hint to the fans that I may be leaving the Eras Tour era, but I was also entering a new era.\"",
      "Swift said her upcoming album \"was something that I was working on while I was in Europe on the Eras Tour.\"",

      "Fans have long theorized that Swift's 12th album would be released soon.",
      "On Monday, Taylor Nation \u2014 an official branch of the pop superstar's marketing team \u2014 posted a TikTok slideshow of 12 images with the caption \"Thinking about when she said 'See you next era...'\" Swift is seen wearing orange in every image.",

      "Swift's last rerecording, \"1989 (Taylor's Version),\" arrived in October 2023, just four months after the release of \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version).\" That was the same year Swift claimed the record for the woman with the most No. 1 albums in history.",

I don't live by no code, you know? So I guess it's because I'm a rapper. People just threw that on me. But, like, my music has never been about that and I have never tried to pretend I was about that.\"",

A ten-time Grammy Award winner and the first-ever recipient of a Grammy for Latin music, Palmieri revolutionized the genre with his bold, percussive style and deep Afro-Caribbean roots, founding the groundbreaking band La Perfecta and mentoring generations of musicians over a remarkable seven-decade career. He was predeceased by his beloved wife of 60 years, Iraida, whom he lovingly called 'Mi Luz Mayor,' and is survived by his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and a global community of friends and collaborators who felt his passion and generosity. Featured proudly in Spike Lee's upcoming film Highest 2 Lowest, Palmieri's influence transcended music -- his rhythm changed the world, and his spirit will live on in every beat he inspired.\"",
      "\"Being a piano player is one thing. Being a pianist is another.\"",
      "Palmieri was born in New York's Spanish Harlem on Dec. 15, 1936, at a time when music was seen as a way out of the ghetto. He began studying the piano at an early age, like his famous brother Charlie Palmieri, but at age 13 he began playing timbales in his uncle's orchestra, overcome with a desire for the drums.",
      "He eventually abandoned the instrument and went back to the playing piano.",

      "Palmieri dabbled in tropical music as a pianist during the 1950s with the Eddie Forrester Orchestra. He later joined Johnny Segu\u00ed's band and Tito Rodr\u00edguez's before forming his own band in 1961, La Perfecta, alongside trombonist Barry Rogers and singer Ismael Quintana.",
      "La Perfecta was the first to feature a trombone section instead of trumpets, something rarely seen in Latin music. With its unique sound, the band quickly joined the ranks of Machito, Tito Rodr\u00edguez, and other Latin orchestras of the time.",
      "Pioneering Grammy winner's career spanned decades and genres",
      "Palmieri produced several albums on the Alegre and Tico Records labels, including the 1971 classic \"V\u00e1monos pa'l monte,\" with his brother, Charlie, as guest organist. Charlie Palmieri died in 1988.",

      "Palmieri released the album \"Masterpiece\" in 2000, which teamed him with the legendary Tito Puente, who died that year. It was a hit with critics and won two Grammy Awards. The album was also chosen as the most outstanding production of the year by the National Foundation for Popular Culture of Puerto Rico.",

      "Air Canada\u00a0and its striking flight attendants were forced back to work and into arbitration Saturday by Canada's government after an early morning strike stranded more than 100,000 travelers around the world during the peak summer travel season.",
      "Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu said now is not the time to take risks with the economy while announcing the intervention. It means the 10,000 flight attendants will return to work soon.",
      "\"The talks broke down. It is clear that the parties are not any closer to resolving some of the key issues that remain and they will need help with the arbitrator,\" Hajdu said.",
      "Hajdu said the full resumption of services could take days, noting it is up to the Canada Industrial Relations Board.",
      "Earlier Saturday, the airline suspended all operations as more than 10,000 of the airline's flight attendants went on strike after a deadline to reach a deal passed. Air Canada operates around 700 flights per day.",
      "\"We are now officially on strike! Picket lines will be active at all bases,\" the Canadian Union of Public Employees said in a statement.",
      "It is the first strike by flight attendants since 1985.",
      "\"The Liberals have talked out of both sides of their mouths. They said the best place for this is at the bargaining table. They refused to correct this historic injustice through legislation,\" said Wesley Lesosky, President of the Air Canada Component of the Canadian Union of Public Employees.",
      "\"Now, when we're at the bargaining table with an obstinate employer, the Liberals are violating our Charter rights to take job action and give Air Canada exactly what they want \u2014 hours and hours of unpaid labour from underpaid flight attendants, while the company pulls in sky-high profits and extraordinary executive compensation,\" Lesosky said in a statement.",
      "A bitter contract fight between Canada's largest airline and the union representing 10,000 of its flight attendants escalated Friday as the union turned down the airline's request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which would eliminate its right to strike and allow a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.",
      "Flight attendants walked off the job around 1 a.m. EDT on Saturday. Around the same time, Air Canada said it would begin locking flight attendants out of airports.",
      "Hugh Pouliot, the spokesman for the union, earlier said the union had a meeting with Hajdu and representatives from Air Canada earlier Friday evening.",
      "\"CUPE has engaged with the mediator to relay our willingness to continue bargaining \u2014 despite the fact that Air Canada has not countered our last two offers since Tuesday,\" he said in an email. \"We're here to bargain a deal, not to go on strike.\"",
      "A complete shutdown will affect approximately 130,000 people daily, and around 25,000 Canadians will be stranded abroad each day. Air Canada operates around 700 flights per day.",

She said there was an option for the travelers in line to go the United States, but was told there wouldn't be any further assistance once they landed in the U.S.",
      "\"It didn't go over well with the line. Nobody really seemed interested, everybody seemed a little bit amused almost at the suggestion, or exasperated, because it is a bit ridiculous to offer to take stranded passengers to a different country to strand them there,\" she said.",

      "Laroche said he considered booking new flights with a different carrier, but he said most of them are nearly full and cost more than double the $3,000 they paid for their original tickets.",
      "\"At this point, it's just a waiting game,\" he said.",
      "Laroche said he was initially upset over the union's decision to go on strike, but that he had a change of heart after reading about the key issues at the center of the contract negotiations, including the issue of wages.",
      "\"Their wage is barely livable,\" Laroche said.",
      "The airline said it would also offer alternative travel options through other Canadian and foreign airlines when possible. But it warned that it could not guarantee immediate rebooking because flights on other airlines are already full \"due to the summer travel peak.\"",
      "\"Air Canada is strongly advising affected customers not to go to the airport unless they have a confirmed ticket on an airline other than Air Canada or Air Canada Rouge,\" the airline said in a statement. \"Air Canada deeply regrets the effect the strike is having on customers.\"",
      "Canada is the second-largest country in the world and flying is often the only viable way to travel around the nation. The government forced the country's two major railroads into arbitration with their labor union last year during a work stoppage. The union for the rail workers is suing, arguing the government is removing a union's leverage in negotiations.",
      "The Business Council of Canada has urged the government to impose binding arbitration in this case, too.",
      "In anticipation of the strike, the airline began cancelling flights on Thursday and Friday as flight attendants did not report to work.",
      "How long the airline's planes will be grounded remains to be seen, but Air Canada Chief Operating Officer Mark Nasr has said it could take up to a week to restart operations once a tentative deal is reached fully.",
      "Passengers whose travel is impacted will be eligible to request a full refund on the airline's website or mobile app, according to Air Canada.",
      "Air Canada and the Canadian Union of Public Employees have been in contract talks for about eight months, but they have yet to reach a tentative deal.",
      "Both sides say they remain far apart on the issue of pay and the unpaid work flight attendants do when planes aren't in the air.",
      "The airline's latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions over four years, that it said \"would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 16 Aug 2025 09:39:06 -0400",
    "summary": "As less young people meet major economic milestones such as moving out and getting married, the concept of adulthood is changing.",
    "story": [
      "Fewer young adults are achieving economic and family milestones typically associated with adulthood, according to a recent working\u00a0paper\u00a0from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "The paper looked at nationally representative data from 2005 and 2023 to examine changes in young adults' experiences reaching major life events, such as moving out of their parents' house, getting married, and having a child. Researchers found a dramatic shift in the attainment of these milestones in recent decades.",
      "The reason for this, according to the paper, is that more young adults between the ages of 25 and 34 are facing economic barriers compared with previous generations. Changing societal attitudes around family formation are also contributing to the sharp decline in the share of young people reaching what the U.S. Census Bureau considers to be \"key milestones.\"",
      "According to the working paper, \"Changes in Milestones of Adulthood,\" almost half of all young adults in 1975 had reached four milestones associated with adulthood: moving out of one's parents' home, getting a job, getting married and having a child.",
      "Five decades on, that progression has changed dramatically. The share of young adults that have followed the traditional pathway to adulthood has dropped to less than a quarter, according to the paper.",
      "\"...Living arrangements, economic opportunities and attitudes toward family formation have not been experienced in the same fashion across generations of young adults,\" the working paper reads. \"Increases in job turbulence and economic downturns, for example, have resulted in some young adults navigating more volatile and uncertain economic environments.\"",
      "Economic conditions, combined with changing cultural norms, \"have implications for how young people develop their identity as adults,\" the paper states.",
      "This redefinition of young adulthood comes as the cost of everyday essentials, including housing, food, gas and daycare rises. As a result, more Americans are choosing to forego having a family, in some cases because they deem such choices unaffordable, the study finds.",
      "Researchers measured changes in the achievement of individual milestones, too. While one-quarter of young adults achieved all four milestones, 28% met two economic milestones \u2014 moving out of their parents' homes and finding jobs.",
      "Women in the workforce",
      "In the 1970s, getting married, having a child, and living independently, were the second-most common group of milestones young people achieved, next to the completion of all four.",
      "Women's gains in the workforce, along with changing cultural attitudes, however, have led this combination of milestones to become less popular, the report notes.",
      "The completion of education, another marker of adulthood, has overshadowed other milestones over the years as an increasing number of young adults enroll in college, according to the paper.",
      "\"These higher levels of educational attainment result in contemporary cohorts spending a longer portion of their young adult lives enrolled in higher education, potentially delaying other markers of adulthood such as entering the labor force or marriage,\" the working paper states.",
      "When it comes to perceptions of adulthood, having a job takes precedence over marriage, as young adults see economic achievements as more directly tied to adulthood than they do committing to a spouse.",
      "\"Marriage is increasingly viewed as a capstone of adulthood, something to pursue after achieving economic stability through completing formal education, establishing an independent household and becoming employed,\" the working paper states.",

    "story": [
      "Taylor Swift's upcoming album release and her love of all things orange isn't lost on her fans \u2014 or brands that are seeking a ride on what has become an enormous economic tailwind.",
      "On Wednesday after Swift went on the \"New Heights\" podcast co-hosted by her boyfriend, NFL football star Travis Kelce, to announce the imminent release of her 12th studio album \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" major companies went into marketing overdrive.",
      "Numerous corporations, from United Airlines to Olive Garden, began posting orange-hued memes on their own social media accounts soon after the new album was announced. Shake Shack, FedEx, Buffalo Wild Wings, Cinnabon, Walmart and Netflix did, too.",
      "That's because Swift appeared onstage wearing orange numerous times toward the end of her Eras Tour, and discussed her feelings about the color on the Wednesday podcast.",
      "\"It feels like energetically how my life has felt,\" the 14-time Grammy winner tells co-host Jason Kelce.",
      "Many, it seemed, saw value in tying their brand to Swift.",
      "More than a dozen NHL teams, both\u00a0north\u00a0and\u00a0south\u00a0of the Canadian border, followed with posts on social media acknowledging Swift's new album.",
      "mb12 pic.twitter.com/HUz2MYpEMc",
      "Even X got in on the action, declaring that it had a new profile pic: a\u00a0glittery orange X. The post soon garnered 5.5 million views.",
      "Google is using its search engine to celebrate the October release of Swift's \"The Life of a Showgirl.\" Users who search for \"Taylor Swift,\" are greeted with a shower of orange digital confetti, along with a flaming orange heart and the phrase, \"And, baby, that's show business for you.\"",
      "Swift's tour appearances have become economic events. The singer's Eras Tour two years ago was the first such tour to cross the billion-dollar mark, according to Pollstar's 2023 year-end charts. Cities and their surrounding areas registered a sizeable economic boost after Swift appeared, with thousands of fans making the pilgrimage and spending money at hotels, restaurants and elsewhere.",
      "Swift also mentioned during the Wednesday podcast that she had Lasik eye surgery. In response, the X account for LASIK.com wasted no time promoting the fortuitous namedrop. The post had more than 450,000 views and 17,000 likes as of Friday.",
      "About 500,000 Americans undergo Lasik every year, CBS News recently reported. And while the American Refractive Surgery Council says the complication rate is less than 1%, side effects are not uncommon and should not be taken lightly by those considering the procedure.",
      "Swift's two-hour chat with the Kelce brothers marks the singer's first ever podcast interview, a milestone moment for the medium.",
      "By Thursday afternoon, Wednesday night's talk had already been seen more than 11.7 million times on YouTube. Clips distributed on Instagram, TikTok, X and elsewhere have received more than 400 million views, and the episode was also available for streaming on audio platforms.",
      "It has further to go to be a record-setter, though. The most-watched podcast episode ever on YouTube, and likely the most-consumed podcast ever, is by a company called Thmanyah, a Saudi Arabian Arabic podcast network and independent journalism platform, according to its website. The video has racked up 144 million views in two years.",
      "Swift, who infrequently gives interviews to journalists, revealed key information about her upcoming album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" and talked about her relationships with Travis Kelce and her family, and her joy of gaining full control of her past work \u2014 a yearslong quest.",

    "summary": "A new report from Deloitte shows the average cost for a packed lunch is now $6.15, up nearly 3% from 2024. But that all depends on what you buy.",
    "story": [
      "Depending on the items you choose, your child's lunch sandwich could cost more this school year than it did in 2024.",
      "That's according to a new report from Deloitte that shows the overall cost of homemade lunches is on the rise. The average cost for a packed lunch is now $6.15, according to Deloitte, up nearly 3% from $5.99 last year. Just under half of the parents polled by the survey said they expect their child's lunch to cost more this September than it did in 2024.",
      "The reason for the price increase, as the Deloitte report points out, is because the cost of groceries has climbed in recent years. Parents are now paying more for staples like whole milk, which is up 7.8% from a year ago, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data for July, as well as for bananas, which are up 7.2%.",
      "The Consumer Price Index report for July, released earlier this week by the BLS, shows\u00a0that overall grocery prices are up 2.2% compared with last year.",
      "Some foods are cheaper",
      "Not all food prices have gone up; in fact, some food items are cheaper this year. In terms of specific lunch items, CBS' price tracker shows that the cost of white bread is actually 6% lower than it was in 2024.",
      "While the cost of American cheese is up 0.7% from July 2024, according to BLS data, it is down 2.6% from last month.",
      "Iceberg lettuce is 3.9% lower in cost than it was a year ago, according to July CPI data, while the price of romaine lettuce is 4.6% higher.",
      "Tomato prices are also down. The fruit commonly consumed as a vegetable cost 7.8% less per pound in July than it did a year ago.",
      "The overall higher sticker prices at supermarkets has been a major pressure point for Americans, half of whom say the cost of groceries is a\u00a0\"major\" source of stress\u00a0in their life right now, according to a poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "In response to their anticipation of higher lunch prices, caregivers plan to switch from name brands to store brands, choose cheaper sandwich options, and cut down in other household expenses to free up more cash for groceries, according to Deloitte's survey, which polled 1,203 caregivers of school-aged children.",
      "Frugal food shopping in the U.S. has \"generally been on an upward trend since October 2024,\" the report found, though it is still lower today than its peak in 2023.",
      "Cafeteria lunch crunch",
      "It's not just brown bag lunches that could end up costing families more. Cafeteria lunches, which tend to be cheaper than brown bag lunches, could also see a price hike this year.",
      "According to Tuesday's CPI data, the price of food at elementary and secondary schools is up 3.3% since July of last year. To account for inflation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last month that it would funnel more money into the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs \u2014 which provide healthy, low-cost or free meals to children.",
      "To be sure, not everyone will end up paying full price for cafeteria school lunches. In Deloitte's survey, more than half of respondents said their school offers free lunch, regardless of income.",
      "School meal prices range from $2.95 for elementary school to $3.20 for high school a\u00a0survey\u00a0conducted by School Nutrition Association found.",

      "The public media company's board approved the budget cut Wednesday, according to the PBS spokesperson. Board members also voted to reduce dues paid by local stations by $35 million, a move that will slow the spigot of money PBS sources from its wide-spanning member\u00a0network.

    "summary": "As Social Security celebrates its 90th anniversary, concerns are growing over its funding and recent staffing cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security celebrated its 90th anniversary Thursday, marking a major milestone for the program that supplies monthly benefit checks to almost 70 million senior citizens, disabled people and surviving family members of deceased workers.",
      "When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law on Aug. 14, 1935, he guaranteed for the first time that workers could rely on continuing income in retirement after they turned 65. As it enters its 10th decade, the program is only growing in importance amid an aging population, with a record number of Americans now collecting benefits.",
      "In the next 10 years, Social Security is expected to swell by an additional 12 million recipients, according to the AARP. But even as it grows in importance, the program is also facing mounting problems and growing questions over its long term viability.",
      "While many policy experts believe the program should be expanded, its outgoings now far outpace its income. Some Democratic lawmakers are also questioning the agency's ability to serve retirees after the Trump administration earlier this year made cuts to its workforce in what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities referred to\u00a0as the \"largest staffing cut in SSA's history.\"",
      "As these challenges have mounted, faith in the program has deteriorated, even as three-quarters of Americans say they believe Social Security is \"one of the most important programs\" the government offers, according to a recent AARP survey. Confidence in the future of Social Security has declined by 7% in the last five years, from 43% in 2020 to 36% in 2025, it found.",
      "Asked about these concerns, the Social Security Administration pointed to a Fox News interview Thursday with its commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said he's optimistic about the program's future and that the agency is working on improving its operations.",
      "The White House also took issue with the criticisms, with spokeswoman Liz Huston telling CBS News that the administration is improving customer service and \"preventing illegal aliens from accessing benefits. \"President Trump has made Social Security great again,\" she said.",
      "Funding woes",
      "A major headwind facing Social Security may not be new, but it is fast approaching: The possible insolvency of its trust funds as the gap between its revenue and expenditure grows.",
      "For instance, in 2024, the program cost $1.49 trillion, but total income was $1.42 trillion, according to the 2025 Social Security Board of Trustees' report.",
      "Because of that trend \u2014 which is expected to continue given the aging population \u2014 the Social Security trust funds are forecast to be\u00a0depleted by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast, according to the most recent trustees' report. This so-called \"go-broke\" date has been a major source of stress for Americans who worry that there won't be enough money left by the time they reach retirement age.",
      "While some workers believe that the trust funds' insolvency means Social Security will cease making payments after that date, that is incorrect. Because the program is funded through payroll taxes, Social Security has a constant stream of income \u2014 although without the trust funds' financial cushion, the program will face a shortfall, leading to a cut in benefits.",
      "Without a fix, monthly benefits could be cut by as much as 23%, the Social Security Board of Trustees warned in its 2025\u00a0annual report.",
      "But there are options for shoring up the trust funds. For one, there's a current cap on the amount of income subject to Social Security taxes, which stands at $176,100 in 2025, meaning any earnings above that amount are exempt from the payroll tax.",
      "One remedy would be to lift the cap on payroll taxes, an option that some Democratic lawmakers prefer. Another idea, floated by some Republican lawmakers, is to raise the retirement age, which currently stands at 67 for people born after 1960.",
      "Changes under President Trump",
      "President Trump has vowed not to cut Social Security, noting in a \"Meet the Press\" interview in December that \"we're not touching Social Security, other than we might make it more efficient.\" Nonetheless, concerns have mounted over the Trump administration's changes to the program, including cuts to its staff and the closure of some field offices.",
      "During a press call Wednesday organized by advocacy groups, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, claimed Mr. Trump and others in his administration are \"working overtime to try to dismantle Social Security.\"",
      "Many Americans also say they're worried about what sort of changes the new administration could make. According to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0from NerdWallet, 61% of Americans believe Social Security benefits will be cut under the current administration.",
      "The White House, however, contends that Social Security has become more efficient under Mr. Trump's leadership. In a statement released Thursday, the White House claimed that the agency is handling 70% more calls than last year and that it has cut down on wait times with the help of technology. It also said the average wait times for customers at field offices have declined by 23%.",
      "\"We have taken steps to reduce wait times, enhance security, and make it easier to navigate our programs,\" SSA commissioner Frank Bisignano wrote in an opinion piece for Fox News on Thursday. \"All the while ensuring we pay benefits accurately to those who are eligible to receive them.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday repeated his\u00a0promises to protect the program.",

    "summary": "There are four metro areas across the U.S. where the median cost for a mansion is less than $1 million.",
    "story": [
      "As recently as 2021, almost half of all U.S. mansions \u2014 homes with at least 5,000 square feet of livable space \u2014 cost $1 million or less. But today, only a handful of cities still offer top-end homes at that price range, according to a new Zillow\u00a0analysis of home prices across the U.S.",
      "Nationwide, mansions are selling for a median price of $1.4 million, but in some parts of the country, high-end properties fetch far more. In four major California cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, the median mansion has a price tag of $4.5 million, Zillow said.",
      "In four metro areas, though, homebuyers can snap up an extra-large residence for under $1 million:",

      "Cleveland, Ohio: $995,200",
      "Memphis, Tennessee: $996,700",
      "For those willing to trade location for space, mansion values also hover around or slightly more than $1 million across the Midwest and in some Southern cities as well, including Louisville, Kentucky and Birmingham, Alabama, according to Zillow.",
      "\"In general, mansion prices move with general affordability. So in places like Buffalo, Indianapolis, Cleveland and Memphis, in the broad scheme of the U.S., these markets tend to be relatively more affordable,\" Zillow senior economist Kara Ng told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So it makes sense you could find a typical mansion for under $1 million in those regions.\"",
      "Many mansions that below the $1 million mark are less expensive because they are older homes, with a median construction year of 1985 versus 2000 for the median construction year for all mansions, Zillow said.",
      "In 2021, nearly half of all U.S. mansions were worth less than $1 million. Today, just three in 10 fall below the $1 million threshold, according to the report.",
      "Mansions \u2014 and homes in general \u2014 are most costly on the coasts. In San Jose, the median mansion is valued at $6.5 million, for example. \"The coasts tend to be on the pricier side, and that follows general affordability trends,\" Ng said. \"It's hard to build due to geographical constraints, and housing deficits in these areas tends to put upward pressure on prices.\"",
      "To be sure, homebuyers in every price range are getting less for their money, with the median U.S. home sale price reaching\u00a0a record of nearly $400,000 in June, according to Redfin. Tight inventory and high mortgage rates has made it tougher for would-be buyers to enter the property market.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 12:59:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's what new data from the producer price index says about where inflation is headed, according to economists.",
    "story": [
      "The producer price index, or PPI, surged last month, far outpacing economists' forecasts and suggesting that President Trump's tariffs are starting to significantly drive up the cost of imported goods.",
      "Wholesale inflation rose 0.9% in July from the prior month, the Labor Department said Thursday, outstripping economists' expectations for a 0.2% increase. The jump marks the largest in more than three years, since June 2022.",
      "The PPI, which measures price changes before they reach consumers, suggests cost hikes are on the way for shoppers, economists said.",
      "So far in 2025, consumer prices\u00a0have been slow to rise despite economists' warnings that Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariff agenda would hike costs for both U.S. businesses and consumers. That's partly because some importers took steps to offset the impact by preordering inventory and absorbing some tariffs to shield consumers in the short term.",
      "But because those were stop-gap measures, economists have warned consumers are unlikely to be insulated from tariff-driven inflation indefinitely. The latest PPI data underscores that higher prices are rippling through the economy, experts say.",
      "\"Tariff-exposed goods are rising at a rapid clip, indicating that the willingness and ability of businesses to absorb tariff costs may be waning,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note Thursday, noting that the wholesale price increases were broad-based.",
      "\"We anticipate broader signs of tariff-driven inflation in the data over time as inventories roll over and firms adjust pricing under margin pressure,\" they said.",
      "The PPI report comes two days after July's Consumer Price Index was slightly cooler than economists had expected, rising 2.7% on an annual basis. The CPI measures changes in prices for goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "The PPI report \"indicates that the new tariffs are continuing to generate cost pressures in the supply chain, which consumers will shoulder soon,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs said in a research note Thursday.",
      "What does the PPI mean for the Fed?",
      "The data complicates the decision the Federal Reserve faces at its Sept. 17 meeting about whether to hold or cut its benchmark interest rate, according to economists.",
      "The central bank has held the rate steady since December 2024, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noting that the economy remains relatively solid and that it wants to take a \"wait and see\" approach to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "The Fed is tasked with keeping inflation low while also promoting full employment \u2014 a two-pronged goal known as its dual mandate.",
      "Because the CPI report came in cooler than expected, the Fed had been seen as more likely to cut rates next month. But the latest PPI data may put that in doubt, given a rate cut would make it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow, thereby potentially further stoking inflation.",
      "\"After a string of data pointing to greater odds of a September rate cut, the large upside surprise in producer prices highlights the dilemma the Federal Reserve faces in judging the risks to its dual mandate,\" Matthew Martin, of Oxford Economics wrote. The group expects the Fed to hold off on rate cuts until December.",
      "The PPI data \"suggests inflation isn't the non-story some people thought it was after Tuesday's CPI print,\" Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at Morgan Stanley's E*TRADE, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "summary": "Americans are reining in their spending at fast-food restaurants as they continue to face economic uncertainty.",
    "story": [
      "The most important meal of the day is also shaping up to be the most skipped meal of the day, at least according to two of the country's largest fast-food chains.",
      "McDonald's and Wendy's last week, during their respective earnings calls, said they're seeing sluggish breakfast sales. The companies attributed the trend to heightened economic uncertainty and pressures facing low-income consumers.",
      "\"There is a lot of anxiety and unease with that low-income consumer,\" McDonald's CEO Christopher Kempczinski said on the company's earnings call on Aug. 6.",
      "Despite wage gains, real incomes are down for low-income consumers, who are facing a lot of financial stress, the CEO said, citing President Trump's tariffs as a potential contributor.",
      "\"So real incomes are down with the low-income consumer, that absolutely is going to put pressure on visits into the [quick-service retail] industry. Second thing is there is a lot of anxiety and unease with that low-income consumer. I think we could all speculate the reasons for that, probably tariffs and the impact that, that might have, questions around employment situation,\" Kempczinski said.",
      "According to Kempczinski, the decline in traffic from low-income consumers \u2014 a core demographic for fast-food restaurants \u2014 is an industrywide trend, with breakfast menus across the quick service industry taking the biggest hit.",
      "Why skip breakfast?",
      "As many Americans rein in discretionary spending, industry analysts and executives say one of the first items on the chopping block is breakfast. Instead of heading to the drive-thru for a breakfast sandwich, more Americans are opting to grab something at home, or skip the meal altogether.",
      "\"When consumer uncertainty increases and consumers choose to eat another meal at home, breakfast is often the first place that they do that with,\" Wendy's interim CEO Ken Cook said on the company's earnings call Aug. 8.",
      "That's a stark contrast to the breakfast boom fast-food chains have enjoyed for nearly a decade, which led many restaurants over the years to expand their early morning offerings. Starbucks, which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12 separate items. Wendy's\u00a0reintroduced\u00a0breakfast in 2020 and offers 10 items with eggs.",
      "The cost of fast food has also skyrocketed over the past decade,\u00a0according\u00a0to 2024 report by FinanceBuzz. The personal finance site found that the price of a McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese meal from McDonald's more than doubled in price from $5.39 in 2014 to $11.99 in 2024.",
      "To be sure, reports of slowing traffic at fast-food chains have preceded the recent decline in breakfast sales. On an earnings call in May 2024, McDonald's CEO Kempczinski expressed \"heightened anxiety\" about how the economy was weighing on lower- and middle-income Americans. During that same time, the CEO of Dine Brands, which owns Applebee's and IHOP,\u00a0told\u00a0CNBC that casual restaurants were also seeing a drop in low-income customers.",
      "Still, not all fast-food chains are experiencing declines in breakfast traffic. Both Starbucks and Dunkin' told CBS MoneyWatch they've seen success with breakfast sales.",
      "Reached for comment by CBS MoneyWatch, both McDonald's and Wendy's pointed to their earnings reports.",
      "What falling breakfast sales say about the economy",
      "Experts say that American consumers' decision to skip out on breakfast points to myriad economic pressures facing low- and middle-income consumers ranging from sky-high credit card interest rates to inflation.",
      "\"The fact that the breakfast day part is slowing now, in our opinion, speaks to heightened economic uncertainty and the lower consumer confidence that we've seen, and that really escalated as tariff rhetoric came into the picture,\" Matthew Todd, a director at S&P Global Ratings, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The consumer is very value focused, discerning and selective about how they're spending. I think we would say we think breakfast is the easiest meal to cut because consumers can eat something quickly,\" Todd said.",
      "Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, told CBS MoneyWatch that low- and middle-income Americans have been spending more cautiously since the end of last year, in part due to a \"weakening\" labor market. \"That's adding to their nervousness and their caution so far this year,\" he said.",
      "The most recent jobs report showed hiring slowed in July. The Labor Department also sharply revised job growth for May and June down by a combined 258,000, a sign that hiring was weaker than previously estimated. With the revisions, the U.S. added 19,000 jobs in May and 14,000 in June.",
      "Experts also told CBS MoneyWatch that low-income consumers' purchasing power is already under pressure due to inflation \u2014 something they said\u00a0tariffs could exacerbate. The Consumer Price Index in July showed inflation held steady at 2.7% on an annual basis. Restaurant prices are up 3.9% since July of last year and 0.3% from June.",
      "\"If they have to spend more to buy a pair of shoes or get their hair cut, they're gonna have less to spend on everything else again, including breakfast at a fast-food restaurant,\" Zandi said.",

      "The SSA did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Each fall, the agency uses inflation data from July, August and September to determine the COLA for the next year. The consumer price index (CPI), a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers that tracks the change in prices on everyday items over time, showed that the inflation rate in July held steady at 2.7% on an annual basis, the same as it was in June.",
      "The inflation rate has remained at or below 3% since the start of 2025. However, experts predict it could inch up later in the year as tariffs put more pressure on consumer prices. Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, told CBS MoneyWatch that he estimates headline CPI will rise to 3.7% and core CPI will rise to 3.8% by the second quarter of 2026.",

      "Louisville, Kentucky\u00a0\u2014 GE Appliances plans to shift production of refrigerators, gas ranges and water heaters out of China and Mexico as part of a more than $3 billion investment to expand its U.S. operations in Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and South Carolina.",
      "The investment \u2014 the second-largest in the Louisville-based company's history \u2014 is expected to add more than 1,000 jobs while ramping up domestic production and modernizing plants in the next five years.",
      "\"Our long-term strategy is about manufacturing close to our customers,\" said CEO Kevin Nolan. \"With lean manufacturing, upskilling our workforce and automation, the math works for manufacturing in the United States.\"",
      "The majority of GE's appliance production is already in the U.S. and the shift means only that the company will transfer more work to its domestic plants.",
      "GE will relocate production of gas ranges from Mexico to a plant in Georgia, while six refrigerator models now made in China will be manufactured at its Alabama plant, the company said.",
      "In June, the company said it would move production of clothes washers from China to its sprawling manufacturing complex in Louisville. The reshoring announcements come as President Trump tries to lure factories back to the United States by imposing import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on foreign goods.",
      "Lee Lagomarcino, GE Appliances' vice president of clothes care, told CBS MoneyWatch at the time that high levies on\u00a0imports from China\u00a0under Mr. Trump have compelled it to \"accelerate the decision-making.\"",
      "GE Appliances said Wednesday that the first phase of its new investment will begin at plants in five Southern states \u2014 Kentucky, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina.",
      "\"We are defining the future of manufacturing at GE Appliances by investing in our plants, people and communities,\" Nolan said. \"No other appliance company over the last decade has invested more in U.S. manufacturing than we have, and our $3 billion, five-year plan shows that our commitment to U.S. manufacturing will continue into the future.\"",
      "The multiyear plan includes ramping up production of gas ranges that have been made in Mexico but will shift to the company's plant in LaFayette, Georgia, the company said. Production of six refrigerators now made in China will move to its plant in Decatur, Alabama.",
      "GE's plant in Camden, South Carolina, will add production of electric and hybrid heat pump water heaters, doubling the factory's output and employment once the project is complete, the company said. The plant now produces gas water heaters. Production of the company's electric and hybrid water heaters \u2014 now made in China \u2014 will shift to South Carolina.",
      "In Selmer, Tennessee, its plant will produce two new models of air conditioners.",
      "The latest investment includes the June announcement that GE Appliances will pump $490 million into its Kentucky complex to produce a combo washer/dryer and a lineup of front load washers that are now made in China. In all, production of more than 15 models of front load washers will shift to the company's Louisville complex \u2014 known as Appliance Park, it said.",
      "Once its new plan is fully implemented, GE Appliances will have invested $6.5 billion across its 11 U.S. manufacturing plants and nationwide distribution network since 2016, it said.",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday that the investment shows his state's ability to support world-class companies with a skilled workforce and the resources needed to thrive.",
      "\"GE Appliances has established Kentucky as America's destination for advanced manufacturing and job creation, and today's news shows this iconic company's unwavering belief in the commonwealth and the role we play in their success,\" Beshear said.",
      "GE Appliances handles product design and engineering work at its Louisville headquarters but doesn't make all of its products in the U.S. It contracts with other manufacturers, including in China, for some of its production where it doesn't have capacity or needs access to a global supply chain. The company said its core business strategy is to base production in the United States, and investments announced in June and on Wednesday are another step toward achieving that goal.",
      "The company said it's partnering with universities, technical schools and high schools to help ensure that its plants and other facilities have a trained workforce.",
      "\"Infrastructure and tools matter, but they are not enough,\" said Bill Good, vice president of supply chain for GE Appliances. \"America's manufacturing renaissance will be built by people.\"",
      "GE Appliances is a subsidiary of the China-based Haier company.",
      "Overall, GE Appliances says it contributes more than $30 billion annually to the U.S. economy and supports more than 113,000 jobs \u2014 both directly and indirectly \u2014 through its operations, suppliers and distribution network.",

We sincerely accept that our preparations had not been adequate,\" the company said in a statement Monday.",

      "Shares of Spirit Aviation Holdings tumbled $1.39, or 39%, to $2.15 in early afternoon trading.",
      "The budget carrier had warned it has \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to continue as a going concern within the next year \u2014 which is accounting-speak for having the resources needed to sustain operations. The cautionary report comes just months after Spirit emerged from\u00a0Chapter 11 bankruptcy.",
      "In a quarterly report issued Monday, Spirit pointed to \"adverse market conditions\" that it's continued to face despite recent restructuring and other efforts to revamp offerings.",
      "That includes weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year \u2014 among other challenges and \"uncertainties in its business operations\" that the Florida-based company expects to continue \"for at least the remainder of 2025.\"",
      "More Americans are cutting back on travel this year because of economic worries, according to a recent LendingTree study.",
      "Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to bounce back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its looming debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since \u2014 including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months.",
      "Those furloughs and downgrades, both announced in July, are set to go into effect Oct. 1 and Nov. 1 to align with Spirit's \"projected flight volume for 2026,\" the company noted in its quarterly report. They also follow previous furloughs and job cuts taken before the company's bankruptcy filing last year.",
      "Despite these and other cost-cutting efforts, Spirit on Monday stressed that it needs more liquidity. As a result, the company said it may also sell certain aircraft and real estate.",
      "Spirit's aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made the airline an attractive takeover target over the years. But such buyout attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier were unsuccessful both before and during the bankruptcy process.",

      "The U.S. stock market is rallying toward records on Tuesday after data suggested inflation across the country was a touch better last month than economists expected.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 1.1% and was on track to top its all-time high set two weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 473 points, or 1.1%, as of 2:46 p.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was 1.3% higher and also heading toward a record.",
      "Stocks got a lift from hopes that the better-than-expected inflation report will give the Federal Reserve leeway to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September.",
      "Lower rates would give a boost to investment prices and to the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment. President Donald Trump has angrily been calling for cuts to help the economy, often\u00a0insulting\u00a0the Fed's chair personally while doing so.",
      "But the Fed has been hesitant because of the possibility that Trump's tariffs could make inflation much worse. Lowering rates would give inflation more fuel, potentially adding oxygen to a growing fire. That's why Fed officials have said they wanted to see more data come in about inflation before moving.",
      "Tuesday's report said U.S. consumers paid prices for groceries, gasoline and other costs of living that were 2.7% higher in July than a year earlier. That's the same inflation rate as June's, and it was below the 2.8% that economists expected.",
      "The report pushed traders on Wall Street to increase bets that the Fed will cut interest rates for the first time this year in September. They're betting on a 94% chance of that, up from nearly 86% a day earlier, according to data from CME Group.",
      "The Fed will receive one more report on inflation, as well as one more on the U.S. job market, before its next meeting, which ends Sept. 17. The most recent jobs report was a stunner, coming in much weaker than economists expected.",
      "Some economists warn that more twists and turns in upcoming data could make the Fed's upcoming decisions not so easy. Its twin goals are to get inflation to 2% while keeping the job market healthy, and helping one with interest rates often means hurting the other.",
      "Even Tuesday's better-than-expected inflation report had some discouraging undertones. An underlying measure of inflation, which economists say does a better job of predicting where inflation may be heading, hit its highest point since early this year, noted Gary Schlossberg, market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. That helped cause some up-and-down swings for Treasury yields in the bond market.",
      "\"Eventually, tariffs can show up in varying degrees in consumer prices, but these one-off price increases don't happen all at once,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"That will confound the Fed and economic commentators for months to come.\"",

It said its total revenue and reserve income grew 53% in its first quarter as a publicly traded company, and it topped forecasts.",
      "On the losing side of Wall Street was Celanese, which sank 14.1% even though the chemical company delivered a better profit than expected. It said that customers in most of its markets continue to be challenged, and CEO Scott Richardson said that \"the demand environment does not seem to be improving.\"",
      "Cardinal Health dropped 7.2% despite likewise reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell short of forecasts, and analysts said the market's expectations were particularly high for the company after its stock had already soared 33.3% for the year coming into the day.",
      "Critics say the broad U.S. stock market is looking expensive after its surge from a bottom in April. That's putting pressure on companies to deliver continued growth in profit.",
      "In stock markets abroad, indexes edged up in China after Trump signed an executive order late Monday that delayed hefty tariffs on the world's second-largest economy by 90 days.

      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 2.8% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "On a month-over-month basis, the CPI rose 0.2%, in line with economists' forecasts.",
      "The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in prices on everyday items such as food and apparel over time. So far this year, inflation has stayed at 3% or lower, with\u00a0June's CPI reading at 2.7%, above the Fed's 2% annual target.",
      "So-called core inflation, a measure or CPI that excludes food and energy prices (which are more volatile), rose by 3.1% over the past 12 months, the highest level in five months. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 3% increase for that measure.",
      "Food inflation continues",
      "Overall food prices in July rose 0.2% from the previous month, and 2.9% over the past year. The cost of groceries last month rose 0.1% since June and 2.2% on an annual basis.",
      "The data comes as about half of Americans say the\u00a0cost of groceries is a\u00a0\"major\" source of stress in their life right now, while 33% say it's a \"minor\" source of stress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only 14% say it's not a source of stress, underscoring the pervasive anxiety most Americans continue to feel about the cost of daily food essentials.",
      "Everyday staples that saw significant cost increases in July include coffee, up 2.6% from June and 14.8% from 2024. Ground beef, rose 2.4% from June and 11.5% from 2024. On a positive note, egg prices fell 3.4% from June, but were still 16.4% higher than they were in July of last year.",
      "Eating out continues to grow more costly as restaurant prices in July increased 0.3% from the previous month and 3.9% since 2024. The data comes as fast-food restaurants continue to report declines in traffic, as higher prices drive consumers away. Wendy's, for example, cut its sales outlook\u00a0last week, pointing to heightened competition and economic uncertainty weighing on its customer base.",
      "Fast-food chains like Wendy's are competing for the attention of low-income consumers who have pulled back on eating out over concerns about the economy. According to a May study from\u00a0Bankrate, among households earning less than $50,000 per year, 44% say they expect to spend less on dining out this year than they did last year.",
      "\"The low-income consumer remains under pressure,\" Sara Senatore, a research analyst at Bank of America, recently told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Gasoline prices, meanwhile, fell 0.5% from June and 9.5% from July 2024, the CPI data shows.",
      "What the experts say about the impact of tariffs",
      "Economists have been watching closely to determine how tariffs might trickle through to the CPI data. For the first several months of the year, the impact appeared to be limited, but June's reading indicated that the levies might be starting to drive up prices in certain categories such as apparel, home furnishings and appliances.",
      "Goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union are now subject to a new round of reciprocal tariffs that went into effect on Aug. 7.",
      "The figures from today's CPI report suggest that while the prices of certain imported goods such as shoes and furniture rose from June to July, the cheaper cost of gas is offsetting some of the impact of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.",
      "\"There is some sign of tariff pass through to consumer prices but, at this stage, it is not significant enough to ring alarm bells,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist a Principal Asset Management, said in an email to CBS News after today's CPI report was released.",
      "During a call with media yesterday, Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, said the investment bank expects consumers will start to see the direct effects of the tariffs this year or into early next year.",
      "\"It's possible that these tariff-induced price increases are a one-time price level shock that will start coming down early next year,\" said Detmeister. \"We think they're going to be much more lasting.\"",
      "Detmeister expects both core and headline CPI to peak in the second quarter of 2026, with headline CPI at 3.7% and core CPI at 3.8%.",
      "What the inflation data could mean for a Fed rate cut",
      "With the CPI in July rising to annualized rate of 2.7%, inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target rate, however, most analysts say that the possibility of a Fed rate cut in September is likely still on the table.",
      "\"Although core annual inflation is back to its highest level since February, today's CPI print is not hot enough to derail the Fed from cutting rates in September,\" said Shah.",
      "The latest jobs report showed that hiring slowed in July, which could bolster the case for a Fed rate cut.",
      "The Fed's mandate is to maintain maximum employment, while keeping prices down. Otherwise, the country\u00a0could slip into what's called stagflation\u00a0\u2014 which is when high inflation is coupled with high unemployment.",
      "More economic data \u2014 in the form of another CPI and jobs report \u2014 is expected next month, which will inform the central bank's decision.",

    "summary": "E.J. Antoni, an economist nominated by President Trump to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the jobs report is flawed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0is suggesting that the agency suspend its monthly jobs report, an economic staple that is relied upon by the Federal Reserve and U.S. businesses to gauge the health of the economy.",
      "In an interview on Fox News Digital on Monday ahead of his nomination, E.J. Antoni criticized the monthly employment report as flawed and suggested it be replaced with \"more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.\"",
      "Antoni, who is a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, was tapped by Mr. Trump on Monday to run the BLS after the president\u00a0fired the former commissioner\u00a0earlier this month, blaming her for a disappointing July jobs report. Mr. Trump took issue with large revisions made to the previous month's jobs data, although jobs number revisions are commonly issued by the agency as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "\"How on earth are businesses supposed to plan \u2014 or how is the Fed supposed to conduct monetary policy \u2014 when they don't know how many jobs are being added or lost in our economy? It's a serious problem that needs to be fixed immediately,\" Antoni told Fox News Digital.",
      "He added, \"Until it is corrected, the BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports but keep publishing the more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.\"",
      "While some survey recipients immediately respond to the BLS' surveys, others report data later, which leads to the monthly revisions. Despite this, the BLS issues its monthly jobs report in order to report employment information in a timely manner, even though it is subject to revisions \u2014 both up and down \u2014 in later reports.",
      "Asked whether the BLS would continue to release monthly jobs reports, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"I believe that is the plan and that's the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust.\"",
      "Leavitt said \"we need to restore new leadership that we trust\" at the BLS, adding that \"we need to look at the means and the methods of how the United States is acquiring this very important data.\"",
      "\"The goal, of course, is to provide honest and good data for the American people to make very important economic decisions on,\" she said.",
      "Responding to the BLS' employment surveys is voluntary for businesses, while the federal government's Office of Management and Budget directs the BLS to release \"robust\" data on basic economic indicators in a \"timely\" manner. But that's become more challenging as fewer people and institutions respond to surveys, experts say.",

      "\"We will be testing and learning the right inventory mix by category and by brand, but the look and feel of the stores will be a transition from the original Bed Bath and Beyond stores with a tighter focus on Seasonal Home Decor, Bedroom furnishings, and Bath and Laundry products,\" Starr Hudgens, chief of staff at the Brand House Collective, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Brand House Collective\u00a0announced the opening of the Nashville store late last month.",

      "Mr. Trump has called ending the war in Ukraine and Russia a top priority for his administration. He previously said he would end the conflict within 24 hours of taking office in January. He has criticized both Putin and Zelenskyy for failing to end the conflict.

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is signaling it will more heavily scrutinize applications filed by legal immigrants seeking American citizenship, in its latest effort to tighten access to U.S. immigration benefits.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency overseeing the country's legal immigration system, instructed officers on Friday to consider additional factors when determining whether immigrants applying for U.S. citizenship have a \"good moral character.\"",
      "Typically, legal immigrants with U.S. permanent residency, also known as a green card, can apply for naturalized American citizenship after a 3- or 5-year period, depending on their case. Demonstrating \"a good moral character\" has long been one of the requirements in U.S. immigration law for American citizenship, alongside passing English and civics tests.",
      "For decades, under Republican and Democratic administrations, the \"good moral character\" assessment has generally been satisfied if applicants don't have any of the criminal offenses or disqualifying conduct outlined in U.S. immigration law. Those disqualifying factors range from violent crimes like murder and aggravated felonies to drug offenses and being a \"habitual drunkard.\"",
      "But a policy issued Friday by USCIS expands the \"good moral character\" assessment, saying that determination must involve \"more than a cursory mechanical review focused on the absence of wrongdoing.\" Instead, the review, the agency told its officers, should be \"a holistic assessment of an alien's behavior, adherence to societal norms, and positive contributions that affirmatively demonstrate good moral character.\"",
      "The directive orders officers to place a \"greater emphasis\" on applicants' \"positive attributes and contributions,\" listing community involvement, family caregiving and ties, educational attainment, \"stable and lawful\" employment, the length of time spent in the U.S., and paying taxes as some of those factors.",
      "The memo also mandates \"greater scrutiny\" of factors that show applicants lack a \"good moral character,\" beyond the crimes and disqualifying conduct detailed in U.S. immigration law.",
      "Those factors, the policy said, include \"acts that are contrary to the average behavior of citizens in the jurisdiction where aliens reside,\" including actions that are \"technically lawful\" but also \"inconsistent with civic responsibility within the community.\" USCIS listed \"reckless or habitual traffic infractions, or harassment or aggressive solicitation\" as some of those actions.",
      "Lastly, the new USCIS policy instructs officers to weigh factors that could show that applicants who have engaged in wrongdoing have rehabilitated, such as complying with probation, paying overdue taxes or child support and receiving letters of support from their community.",
      "Over the past decade, the U.S. government has naturalized between 600,000 and 1 million immigrants as citizens annually, USCIS figures show.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, USCIS chief spokesman Matthew Tragesser said the directive is another effort by President Trump's administration to \"restore integrity\" to the U.S. immigration system.",
      "\"U.S. citizenship is the gold standard of citizenship \u2014 it should only be offered to the world's best of the best,\" Tragesser added. \"Today, USCIS is adding a new element to the naturalization process that ensures America's newest citizens not only embrace America's culture, history, and language but who also demonstrate Good Moral Character.\"",
      "Doug Rand, a former senior USCIS official during the Biden administration, suggested the Trump administration's policy is designed to scare legal immigrants from applying for American citizenship and require officers to put their \"thumb on the scale\" to find more reasons to deny applications.",
      "\"They're trying to increase the grounds for denial of U.S. citizenship by kind of torturing the definition of good moral character to encompass extremely harmless behavior,\" Rand said, citing the policy's reference to traffic infractions.",
      "While the Trump administration has launched a highly visible crackdown on illegal immigration by deploying thousands of troops to the southern border, expanding immigration raids across the country, and fast-tracking deportations of those in the U.S. illegally, it has simultaneously moved to restrict legal immigration, with less fanfare.",
      "The Trump administration has virtually shut down refugee admissions, terminated Biden-era programs that allowed migrants to enter the U.S. legally, limited visas for certain countries and implemented aggressive vetting procedures for legal immigration benefits. Those efforts include expanded vetting of social media activity of legal immigrants and stricter screening requirements for some applications.",

    "story": [
      "Democrats unveiled a proposal Friday that could give California's dominant political party an additional five U.S. House seats in a bid to win the fight to control Congress next year.",
      "The plan calls for an unusually timed reshaping of House district lines to greatly strengthen the Democratic advantage in the state ahead of midterm elections, when Republicans will be defending the party's fragile House majority.",
      "It amounts to a counterpunch to the Texas Republicans' plan to take five Democratically held seats and redraw them to favor the GOP at the urging of President Trump as he tries to avoid losing control of Congress and, with it, prospects for his conservative agenda in the later part of his term.",
      "The California effort seeks to take five of the state's nine GOP districts and make them more favorable to Democrats. Just like in Texas, however, it is by no means a guarantee that Democrats would win all five of these seats if a new California map becomes law.",
      "Making the shift would likely require an amendment to California's state Constitution. Overhauling the current map that is in law would need to be passed by a two-thirds vote in both the state Assembly and state Senate, and then be approved by California voters in an election.",
      "California lawmakers are scheduled to return to Sacramento on Aug. 18 amid the redistricting talk. The California State Legislature will have a short time span to move forward.",
      "If approved by voters in a special election this November, the California blueprint could nearly erase Republican House members in the nation's most populous state. The Democratic plan is intended to win the party 48 of its 52 U.S. House seats, up from 43 currently.",
      "The proposal was released by the campaign arm of House Democrats, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Democrats in the state Legislature will hold hearings and plan to vote on the new maps next week.",
      "\"This is about more than drawing lines on a map. It's about drawing a line in the sand to stop Texas and Trump from rigging the election,\" state Senate Democratic leader Mike McGuire said in a statement.",
      "New districts have boundaries to boost Democratic edge",
      "While a general notion behind drawing districts is to unite what's called communities of interest \u2014 neighborhoods and cities that share similar concerns or demographic traits \u2014 the proposed remapping would create a jigsaw of oddly shaped districts to maximize Democratic clout.",
      "The 1st Congressional District is currently anchored in the state's conservative far northeast corner and is represented by Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Trump supporter. The district has a nearly 18-point GOP registration edge.",
      "Under the proposal, Democrats would end up with a 10-point registration advantage in the district after drastic reshaping to include parts of heavily Democratic Sonoma County near the Pacific Coast.",
      "In a post on the social platform X, LaMalfa called the proposal \"absolutely ridiculous.\" LaMalfa's first congressional district would include parts of Santa Rosa under the proposed maps, an area that is in Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson's district.",
      "In the battleground 41st District east of Los Angeles, represented by long-serving Republican Rep. Ken Calvert, Democratic and Republican registration is currently split about evenly.",
      "But in the redrawn district, Democratic registration would jump to 46%, with GOP registration falling to 26%.",
      "Other Republicans whose districts would see major changes intended to favor Democrats include Rep. Kevin Kiley in Northern California, Rep. Ken Calvert in Riverside County, Rep. David Valadao in the Central Valley farm belt and Rep. Darrell Issa in San Diego County. Also, embattled Democratic incumbents would see their districts padded with additional left-leaning voters.",
      "\"Well, obviously, Newsom's entire goal was to revert to the era of drawing lines based upon partisan political factors, as politicians draw their lines,\" Kiley told CBS Sacramento earlier Friday.",
      "Kiley's current district covers suburbs, small towns and mountain communities from the Sacramento region to the Eastern California border.",
      "The release of the plan came the same day that Texas Republicans began a second special session to approve new congressional maps sought by Trump.",
      "The GOP's first special session in Texas ended without approving new political maps, thwarted by Democrats who staged a nearly two-week walkout that meant not enough lawmakers were present to pass any legislation. Gov. Greg Abbott then quickly called a second session that started without the necessary quorum to conduct business.",
      "Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday that his state will hold a Nov. 4 special referendum on the redrawn districts.",
      "\"We can't stand back and watch this democracy disappear district by district all across the country,\" Newsom said.",
      "The announcement marked the first time any state beyond Texas officially waded into Trump's fight, though several governors and legislative leaders from both parties have threatened such moves.",
      "Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, who heads the House GOP campaign arm, said Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, is \"shredding California's Constitution and disenfranchising voters.\"",
      "\"Californians oppose Newsom's stunt because they won't let a self-serving politician rig the system to further his career,\" said Hudson, who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee.",
      "How will voters react?",
      "Under current law, California has an independent redistricting commission that was approved by voters earlier this century. Newsom has emphasized that the ballot effort would not get rid of the commission, though it would essentially suspend it. If the measure passes, the commission would then resume being able to write maps after the 2030 census.",
      "A big risk for Democrats is whether voters will be open to setting aside district boundaries crafted by the independent commission for ones shaped for partisan advantage.",
      "Some people already have said they would sue over the effort. Republican former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a longtime opponent of partisan redistricting, signaled that he will not side with Democrats even after talking to Newsom. He posted a photo of himself Friday at the gym wearing a T-shirt that said, \"Terminate gerrymandering,\" with a reference to an obscenity and politicians.",
      "\"I'm getting ready for the gerrymandering battle,\" Schwarzenegger said.",
      "House control could come down to a few seats in 2026",
      "On a national level, the partisan makeup of existing district lines puts Democrats within three seats of a majority. Of the 435 total seats, only several dozen districts are competitive. So even slight changes in a few states could affect which party wins control.",
      "New maps are typically drawn once a decade after the census \u2014 the last being in 2020. Many states, including Texas, give legislators the power to draw maps. California is among those that empowers independent commissions with the task.",
      "If approved, a new California map would take effect only if a Republican state does its own redistricting. It would remain through the 2030 elections. After that, Democrats say, they would return mapmaking power to the independent commission voters approved in 2008.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Aug 2025 21:45:04 -0400",
    "summary": "Attorney General Pam Bondi issued an order Thursday that amounted to a reversal of \"sanctuary\" policies in D.C. The District sued over the order Friday.",
    "story": [
      "After a hearing in the D.C. U.S. District Court Friday, the Justice Department agreed to remove its newly named D.C. emergency police chief and to rewrite a directive ending District of Columbia rules limiting cooperation between its police and federal immigration authorities.",
      "The District of Columbia sued the Trump administration and Attorney General Pam Bondi earlier in the day. D.C. alleges her efforts to scuttle the District's \"sanctuary\" rules curbing local police cooperation with immigration authorities during the federal police takeover are illegal.",
      "Late Thursday night, Bondi named Terry Cole, the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, emergency police chief in Washington, as part of her sweeping orders to increase federal control over the Metropolitan Police Department.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes heard Friday's arguments in the case, which is centered around Section 740 of the Home Rule Act of 1973. That provision allows the president to require the D.C. mayor to provide \"such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary and appropriate\" for up to 30 days. President Trump invoked Section 740 Monday,\u00a0 placing the D.C. MPD under direct federal control to crack down on crime in the district.",
      "\"I think these are the kinds of issues that should be decided between the district and the government,\" Reyes said. \"If I have to step in, I will.\"",
      "Now, D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will continue leading the department, according to Yaakov Roth, principal deputy attorney general in the Justice Department. At the end of the hearing, Roth said the Justice Department would make Cole an intermediary between the White House and MPD during the Trump administration's takeover of the city's police. For now, the federal takeover is expected to last 30 days.",
      "Both sides agreed to continue the arguments over immigration policy next week, after the new policies are written.",
      "In a statement Friday evening following the hearing, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said she needed \"to defend our autonomy. We know that our access to democracy is different than anywhere else in America.\"",
      "\"This evening, I am pleased to be able to report that, after a day in court and in accordance with Home Rule, Pamela Smith remains our Chief of Police,\" she said.",
      "On Thursday night, Bondi, whose department is overseeing the 30-day federalization, announced an order terminating some of the \"sanctuary\" immigration policies in the nation's capital.",
      "Under her order, the MPD would temporarily fully cooperate with federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other immigration authorities.",
      "Bondi also rescinded guidance issued by D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith just this week that allowed police officers to transport ICE agents and their detainees and to share immigration information during traffic stops. Smith's directive had still barred most local involvement in federal immigration enforcement.",
      "Bondi also removed guidance that prohibited D.C. police officers from searching databases to determine a person's immigration status, even when there's no underlying criminal warrant.",
      "She also suspended District rules that barred local police from arresting individuals based on administrative immigration warrants signed by ICE officials \u2014 not judges \u2014 and from assisting federal agents during such arrests. The now-defunct policy had required officers to have a criminal nexus before carrying out an arrest and prohibited arrests solely based on suspected civil immigration law violations.",
      "Mitchell Reich, an attorney for the D.C. attorney general's office, asked Judge Reyes to block the Trump administration from taking full operational control of MPD and to block Bondi's orders revoking the D.C. police department's non-cooperation with ICE and other federal immigration agencies.",
      "Reyes said that the Home Rule Act does require Bowser to follow White House directives, but the administration cannot fully control every MPD move.",
      "\"The statute would have no meaning at all if the president could just say, 'we're taking over your police department,'\" Reyes said. \"The president can't say, 'Mayor, I'm asking for the services of your entire police department. I need them to be at my beck and call.'\"",
      "Reyes said while the Trump administration can make specific requests of the MPD to do something, it cannot tell MPD not to do something.",
      "\"If the president today called the mayor\u2026 and said, 'I need the services of the MPD to help ICE,' I don't think she could say no,\" Reyes said. \"The statute says the mayor shall, not the mayor can.\"",
      "The judge also expressed skepticism about Bondi's appointment of Cole. Reyes, appointed to the bench by Joe Biden, has at times criticized the Trump administration's actions in its cases before her.",
      "Roth argued that the language in the Home Rule Act is \"broad\" and allows for the White House\u00a0 takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department without judicial review.",
      "In D.C.'s complaint, D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb warned that the Trump administration's \"unlawful assertions of authority will create immediate, devastating, and irreparable harms for the District. Most critically, the order threatens to upend the command structure of MPD and wreak operational havoc within the department, endangering the safety of the public and law enforcement officers alike.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of expanding his administration's control of the city's law enforcement beyond the 30-day maximum without congressional approval, Roth said his interpretation of the law was that the federalization would end without intervention from Congress.",
      "\"That's why we want this to be successful,\" Roth said. \"We want this to work well.\"",
      "\"I totally agree that everyone wants this to be successful,\" Reyes replied. \"And my job as I see it is to make sure that it is successful and within constitutional bounds.\"",

      "Here is a transcript of what Mr. Trump and Putin said:",
      "PUTIN: Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, our negotiations have been held in a constructive atmosphere of mutual respect.",
      "We have very thorough negotiations that were quite useful. I would like to thank once again my American counterpart, for the proposal to travel out here to Alaska. It only makes sense that we've met here, because our countries, though separated by the oceans, are close neighbors. So when we've met, when I came out of the plane and I said, 'Good afternoon, dear neighbor. Very good to see you in good health and to see you alive.' I think that is very neighborly. I think that's some kind words that we can say to each other. We're separated by the strait of Bering, though, there are two islands only between the Russian Island and the U.S. Island. They're only four kilometers apart. We are close neighbors, and it's a fact.",
      "It's also important that Alaska has to do with our common heritage, common history between Russia and the U.S., and many positive events have to do with that territory. Still, there is tremendous cultural heritage, back from the Russian America, for example, Orthodox churches, and a lot of- more than 700 geographical names of Russian origin. During the Second World War, it was here in Alaska that was the origin of the legendary air bridge for the supply of military aircraft and other equipment under the Lend-Lease Program.",
      "It was a dangerous and treacherous route over the vast emptiness of ice. However, the pilots of both countries did everything to bring closer the victory. They risked their lives and they gave it all for the common victory. I was just in the city of Magadan in Russia. And there is a memorial there dedicated to the Russian, the U.S. pilots. And there are two flags, the U.S. flag and the Russian flag. And I know that here as well, there is such a memorial. There is a military burial place several kilometers away from here. The Soviet pilots are buried there who died during that dangerous mission. We're thankful to the citizens and the government of the U.S. for carefully taking care of their memory. I think that's very worthy and noble. We'll always remember other historical examples when our countries defeated common enemies together in the spirit of battle camaraderie and allyship that supported each other and facilitated each other. I am sure that this heritage will help us rebuild and foster mutually beneficial and equal ties at this new stage, even during the hardest conditions.",
      "It is known that there have been no summits between Russia and the U.S. for four years, and that's a long time. This time was very hard for bilateral relations, and let's be frank, they've fallen to the lowest point since the Cold War. I think that's not benefiting our countries and the world as a whole. It is apparent that sooner or later, we have to amend the situation to move on from the confrontation to dialog, and in this case, a personal meeting between the heads of state has been long overdue, naturally, under the condition of serious and painstaking work, and this work has been done.",
      "In general, me and President Trump have very good direct contact. We've spoken multiple times. We spoke frankly on the phone. And the special envoy of the president, Mr. Witkoff, traveled out to Russia several times. Our advisers and heads of foreign ministries kept in touch all the time, and we know fully well that one of the central issues was the situation around Ukraine.",
      "We see the strive of the administration and President Trump personally to help facilitate the resolution of the Ukrainian conflict, and his strive to get to the crux of the matter, to understand this history, is precious. As I've said, the situation in Ukraine has to do with fundamental threats to our security. Moreover, we've always considered the Ukrainian nation, and I've said it multiple times, a brotherly nation. How strange it may sound in these conditions. We have the same roots, and everything that's happening is a tragedy for us, and terrible wound. Therefore, the country is sincerely interested in putting an end to it.",
      "At the same time, we're convinced that in order to, to make the settlement lasting and long term, we need to eliminate all the primary roots, the primary causes of that conflict, and we've said it multiple times, to consider all legitimate concerns of Russia and to reinstate a just balance of security in Europe and in the world on the whole, and agree with President Trump, as he has said today, that naturally, the security of Ukraine should be ensured as well. Naturally, we are prepared to work on that.",
      "I would like to hope that the agreement that we've reached together will help us bring closer that goal and will pave the path towards peace in Ukraine. We expect that Kyiv and European capitals will perceive that constructively and that they won't throw a wrench in the works. They will not make any attempts to use some backroom dealings to conduct provocations to torpedo the nascent progress.",
      "Incidentally, when the new administration came to power, bilateral trade started to grow. It's still very symbolic. Still, we have a growth of 20%. As I've said, we have a lot of dimensions for joint work. It is clear that the U.S. and Russian investment and business cooperation has tremendous potential. Russia and the U.S. can offer each other so much in trade, digital, high tech and in space exploration. We see that arctic cooperation is also very possible, in our international context. For example, between the far east of Russia and the West Coast of the U.S.",
      "Overall, it's very important for our countries to turn the page to go back to cooperation. It is symbolic that, not far away from here, the border between Russia and the US, there was a so-called International Date Line. I think you can step over, literally, from yesterday into tomorrow, and I hope that's- will succeed in that, in the political sphere. I would like to thank President Trump for our joint work, for the well wishing and trustworthy tone of our conversation.",
      "It's important that both sides are result-oriented and we see that the president of the U.S. has a very clear idea of what he would like to achieve. He sincerely cares about the prosperity of his nation. Still, he understands that Russia has its own national interests.",
      "I expect that today's agreements will be the starting point, not only for the solution of the Ukrainian issue, but also will help us bring back business-like and pragmatic relations between Russia and the U.S.",
      "And in the end, I would like to add one more thing. I'd like to remind you that in 2022, during the last contact with the previous administration, I tried to convince my previous American colleague, it should not- the situation should not be brought to the point of no return, when it would come to hostilities and accept it quite directly back then, that is a big mistake. Today, when President Trump is saying that if he was the president back then, there would be no war, and I'm quite sure that it would indeed be so. I can confirm that. I think that overall, me and President Trump have built a very good business-like and trustworthy contact, and have every reason to believe that moving down this path, we can come and assume it better to the end of the conflict in Ukraine. Thank you. Thank you.",
      "TRUMP: Thank you very much, Mr. President, that was very profound, and I will say that I believe we had a very productive meeting. There were many, many points that we agreed on, most of them, I would say, a couple of big ones that we haven't quite gotten there, but we've made some headway. So there's no deal until there's a deal.",
      "I will call up NATO in a little while, I will call up the various people that I think are appropriate, and I'll of course, call up President Zelenskyy and tell him about today's meeting. It's ultimately up to them. They're going to have to agree with what Marco and Steve and some of the great people from the Trump administration who've come here, Scott and John Ratcliffe. Thank you very much. But we have some of our really great leaders. They've been doing a phenomenal job.",
      "We also have some tremendous Russian business representatives here. And I think, you know, everybody wants to deal with us. We've become the hottest country anywhere in the world in a very short period of time, and we look forward to that. We look forward to dealing- we're going to try and get this over with.",
      "We really made some great progress today. I've always had a fantastic relationship with President Putin, with Vladimir. We had many, many tough meetings, good meetings. We were interfered with by the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. It made it a little bit tougher to deal with, but he understood it. I think he's probably seen things like that during the course of his career. He's seen- he's seen it all. But we had to put up with the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. He knew it was a hoax, and I knew it was a hoax, but what was done was very criminal, but it made it harder for us to deal as a country, in terms of the business, and all of the things that would like to have dealt with, but we'll have a good chance when this is over.",
      "So just to put it very quickly, I'm going to start making a few phone calls and tell them what happened. But we had an extremely productive meeting, and many points were agreed to. There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there. We didn't get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there. I would like to thank President Putin and his entire team, whose faces who I know, in many cases, otherwise, other than that, whose- whose faces I get to see all the time in the newspapers, you're very- you're almost as famous as the boss, but especially this one right over here.",
      "But we had some good meetings over the years, right? Good, productive meetings over the years, and we hope to have that in the future. Let's do the most productive one right now. We're going to stop, really, 5, 6, 7 thousand, 1000s of people a week from being killed, and President Putin wants to see that as much as I do. So again, Mr. President, I'd like to thank you very much, and we'll speak to you very soon, and probably see you again very soon. Thank you very much, Vladimir.",
      "PUTIN: Next time in Moscow.",
      "TRUMP: Ooh, that's an interesting one. I don't know. I'll get a little heat on that one, but I could see it possibly happening. Thank you very much, Vladimir, and thank you all. Thank you. Thank you.",
      "PUTIN: Thank you so much.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and President Trump's former rival on the presidential campaign trail, said Friday that if Mr. Trump secures an end to the war in Ukraine without Kyiv ceding territory to Russia, she would nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize herself.",
      "Clinton made the comments on the podcast \"Raging Moderates\" with Jessica Tarlov, as Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet in Alaska to discuss a possible end to Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "\"Honestly, if he could bring about the end to this terrible war, where Putin is the aggressor, invading a neighbor country, trying to change the borders \u2014 if he could end it without putting Ukraine in a position where it had to concede its territory to the aggressor, had to, in a way, validate Putin's vision of greater Russia, but instead could really stand up to Putin, something we haven't seen, but maybe this is the opportunity,\" Clinton said.",
      "\"To make it clear that there must be a ceasefire. There will be no exchange of territory. And that, over a period of time, Putin should be actually withdrawing from the territory he's seized in order to demonstrate his good-faith efforts, let us say, not to threaten European security,\" she continued. \"If we could pull that off, if President Trump were the architect of that, I'd nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize, because my goal here is to not allow capitulation to Putin, aided and abetted by the United States. I think that's a terrible, terrible precedent.\"",
      "Clinton added: \"I'm dreaming that for whatever combination of reasons, including the elusive Nobel Peace Prize, President Trump may actually stand up to Putin on behalf of not just Ukraine and its democracy and its very brave people, but frankly, on behalf of our own security and interests.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr and the Ukrainians want a full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine, including the territories Russia has seized.",
      "Mr. Trump, whose supporters chanted \"lock her up\" about Clinton during the 2016 presidential election, expressed appreciation for his formal rival's remarks. The president told Fox News' Bret Baier on Friday it was \"very nice\" of Clinton to say that, and, \"I may have to start liking her again.\"",
      "Clinton on Friday said she hopes Mr. Trump remembers that he's at the very military base \"that has to send up fighter planes to watch and fend off Russian bombers that routinely harass our military assets, do overflights, engage in provocative behavior in the skies above Alaska.\"",
      "\"I hope he's reminded of that,\" she continued. \"He is not meeting with a friend. He is meeting with an adversary, and an adversary who hopes to play him. And the best thing that could come out of this, frankly, is probably nothing, nothing agreed to, except a real strengthening of President Trump's understanding that Putin is not someone you can make a deal with an expect it to last.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Aug 2025 17:16:53 -0400",
    "summary": "Environmental groups and independent scientists are criticizing a report assembled by a small team of well-known climate skeptics selected by Energy Secretary Chris Wright.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has reduced funding for climate research, dismissed federal scientists who worked on the National Climate Assessment, and removed past editions of the report from government websites. Now, critics say, it is taking the next step: rewriting the science itself, according to a lawsuit filed this week by environmental groups.",
      "As the Environmental Protection Agency moves to revoke the Endangerment Finding, the 2009 scientific determination that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, the Department of Energy published a\u00a0new review of the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on U.S. climate that aims to support the EPA's efforts.",
      "The report was developed this spring by the 2025 Climate Working Group, which is composed of five independent climate scientists selected by Energy Secretary Chris Wright.",
      "But environmental groups and independent scientists have criticized the report and how it was written, claiming it was assembled in secret by the five scientists who are recognized by the larger scientific community as climate skeptics.",
      "\"The secret report was produced by a set of known climate contrarians who were commissioned to write this report that's full of inaccuracies,\" said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director of climate and energy programs at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"It's clearly geared towards trying to give the EPA a way to evade its legal responsibility to address the health harms of heat trapping emissions and climate change.\"",
      "A \"secret report\"",
      "The DOE report, entitled \"A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate,\" was commissioned in March when Wright assembled the group to undertake a massive review of scientific findings in a very short period of time, with no public announcement of this effort.",
      "The five authors delivered their final draft by May 28. In the report's preface, the authors wrote, \"The short timeline and the technical nature of the material meant that we could not comprehensively review all topics.\"",
      "Their report argues that carbon-driven warming may be less economically damaging than commonly believed, and that aggressive U.S. climate policies would have little measurable impact on the global climate. It attributes some warming to natural climate cycles or changes in the sun, instead of the burning of fossil fuels, and also claims sea level rise has not been accelerating, contrary to widely accepted scientific evidence. Finally, it highlights the potential benefits of rising carbon dioxide levels for plant growth.",
      "\"I would say that it presents an incomplete and misleading picture of how climate change is affecting the United States,\" said Phil Duffy, chief scientist at Spark Climate Solutions, who previously worked in the Biden and Obama administrations as a science policy expert.",
      "Duffy and other scientists say the DOE report cherry-picks evidence, misrepresents peer-reviewed research, and ignores the overwhelming consensus that human activity is driving dangerous warming. Numerous climate-based groups and researchers have published their own fact-checks on the report, with one listing more than 100 false or misleading claims made by the authors.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Department of Energy about the criticisms of the report. They responded by referring to Wright's statement in the preface, where he wrote that he chose the panel \"for their rigor, honesty, and willingness to elevate the debate.\"",
      "\"This DOE report is in service of a political goal, it's not credible science,\" said Ben Santer, a climate researcher and board member of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Santer says his own published work was misrepresented in the DOE report and said the authors \"fundamentally twist\" the work of many researchers to reach conclusions that \"will be used for a political purpose.\"",
      "Critics in the scientific community have pointed out that the panel's five authors are known for their contrarian views on climate science, which are often at odds with the scientific consensus on the causes of climate change.",
      "\"The people that were handpicked by the Trump administration's energy secretary are this very small group of people who are known to disagree with that mountain of [scientific] evidence,\" said Vickie Patton, general counsel at the Environmental Defense Fund. \"Some of them have connections to the fossil fuel industry.\"",
      "Accusations of rewriting science",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas executive, has been vocal about his views on climate change, which align with the report's findings. In an op-ed earlier this year, he called climate change \"a by-product of progress,\" and wrote, \"I am willing to take the modest negative trade-off for this legacy of human advancement.\" He argues that while climate change is real, it is not the greatest threat, and that expanding access to affordable, reliable energy should remain the priority.",
      "Wright has been transparent about how he views U.S. climate research, telling CNN's Kaitlan Collins that the administration is reviewing past federal climate reports, including the National Climate Assessment, and may provide \"updates\" later this year, leading many in the scientific community to fear the administration is aiming to edit or censor critical research.",
      "\"It's important that science be allowed to speak for itself and I do have concerns that that's not happening,\" Duffy told CBS News.",
      "National Climate Assessments typically take years to write and are authored by hundreds of scientists.",
      "Duffy says that Wright didn't oversee the previous reports and therefore has no authority to review or revise them. \"He can't rewrite the National Climate Assessment any more than I can rewrite 'The Great Gatsby,'\" Duffy says.",
      "The Environmental Defense Fund and Union of Concerned Scientists filed a lawsuit Tuesday in federal court against the EPA and the Department of Energy, arguing that their actions violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires transparency and balanced membership for government advisory panels. The suit alleges that the Climate Working Group was created in secret, its work withheld from the public, and then its report was used extensively by the EPA, cited 22 times, to justify repealing the Endangerment Finding. The organizations are asking a judge to block the government's use of the report to comply with transparency laws.",
      "When asked about the lawsuit, the EPA responded in an email saying, \"As a matter of longstanding practice, EPA does not comment on current or pending litigation,\" and referred CBS News to the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy did not respond to any of our requests for comment.",

    "story": [
      "When President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin sit down\u00a0in Alaska Friday for their high-stakes meeting about the war in Ukraine, the two leaders will bring differing ideas about ending the war that Russia began over three years ago. At the same time, Ukraine will be watching from the outside with European allies, hoping that Mr. Trump is protecting their interests.",
      "Their meetings are expected to be capped by a rare joint news conference with the two world leaders \u2014 the first such event of its kind since their 2018 summit in Helsinki, when Mr. Trump sided with Putin over his own intelligence agencies about Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
      "Expectations ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting",
      "Mr. Trump has tried to lower expectations going into the meeting, telling reporters the day before, \"all I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly.\" The subsequent meeting is an idea he has been floating this week, and he said it would also include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and perhaps other allies. The president raised the possibility that Zelenskyy could even join them in Alaska within a couple of days.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt referred to talks with Putin as \"a listening exercise\" for Mr. Trump and said his goal \"is to walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war.\"",
      "There are a number of questions going into the summit \u2014 chief among them is what Russia wants, and whether there's a way to reconcile its demands with what Ukraine wants. U.S. and Russian counterparts have been speaking, and Mr. Trump and Putin have had their own phone conversations.",
      "In March, Ukraine agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposal backed by the U.S., and months later, in May, when the Kremlin had still not accepted the terms, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. was trying to figure out if Russia was just \"tapping us along.\"",
      "By July, casualties were mounting in Ukraine as Russia stepped up its bombing campaign with hundreds of missile and drone strikes. Mr. Trump gave Putin a 50-day deadline to agree to a deal to end the war, and later shortened it to a 10-day deadline, threatening harsher tariffs and secondary sanctions. Dmitri Medvedev, the former president of Russia, responded by mocking Mr. Trump on X. \"Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war,\" he said, warning that it would not be \"between Russia and Ukraine, but with [Trump's] own country.\"",
      "But a day before the president's 10-day deadline expired \u2014 and after Putin had met with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff \u2014 the Kremlin announced that Putin and Mr. Trump would meet.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said there would be \"very severe consequences\" for Russia if it doesn't agree to end the war after Friday's meeting, though he declined to elaborate.",
      "Zelenskyy and European partners met virtually with Mr. Trump Wednesday, after which Zelenskyy wrote on X: \"Together with our partners, we supported the efforts of U.S. President Donald Trump to end the war, stop the killings, and achieve a just and lasting peace. I am grateful to the partners for our shared position: the path to peace.\"",
      "European leaders have been wary of the Trump-Putin meeting. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Wednesday of the summit, \"The most important thing is that Europe convinces Donald Trump that one can't trust Russia,\" adding, \"no one should think of recognizing Russia's right to demarcate borders for its neighbors.\" Zelenskyy won't be there to represent Ukraine's interests, and Mr. Trump has shown he's sometimes reluctant to criticize Putin.",
      "What Russia wants",
      "Experts say Putin has several objectives that won't be shared by the U.S. and Ukraine, and Mr. Trump must exercise caution.",
      "Putin would love to see the U.S. discontinue its financial support for Ukraine, said Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' Center on Military and Political Power.",
      "\"He wants to sideline the power of the United States so that he can more effectively prey on Ukraine,\" Bowman said, adding that at the same time, Putin will \"try to make the invaded look like the villain.\" While Mr. Trump aims to end the war Russia began, Putin is likely to try to seize on Mr. Trump's desire for peace.",
      "\"He's going to try to gain Trump's support for a bad peace,\" Bowman said, adding, \"Some peace agreements are bad because they lead to more war.\"",
      "John Lough, an associate fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program and the British think-tank Chatham House, predicted that Russia would \"put something in front of [Trump] that he will buy into and say, 'This is a way out of the war, and I like that, and I'm now prepared to go lean on the Ukrainians again and the Europeans and we'll get this over the line.'\"",
      "But Lough also believes that for Russia, the meeting is \"high risk.\"",
      "\"They may not get what they want, but they will at the very least be hoping that it guides the sort of next phase of the process of getting Ukraine to the table, and, I suppose, conducting the negotiations within a framework with which that comes,\" Lough said.",
      "Russia, Lough said, wants \"to get the framework of the peace agreement settled and then talk about a ceasefire, whereas Ukraine, its allies and, to a degree, President Trump has said, 'No, we start with a cease fire and then we build around that.'\"",
      "Daniel Fried, a former U.S. ambassador to Poland and former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, thinks Putin could try to insert a wedge between the U.S. and its allies.",
      "\"He wants to get out of this meeting without any cost and to slice away at the American position and maybe draw Trump out so that there's a gap between him and Zelenskyy, Trump and the Europeans,\" Fried said in a press call Wednesday.",
      "After Mr. Trump's more skeptical comments about Putin since the meeting was scheduled, Fried said, \"I am less worried about that than I was three days ago.\"",
      "Fried, who is now a fellow at the Atlantic Council, said that for Putin, a great outcome would be to \"dazzle\" Mr. Trump with a fake offer and to walk away with a big smile.",
      "At talks in June, the Kremlin presented a memorandum offering Ukraine two options for a 30-day ceasefire, which could give some insight into Putin's maximalist demands.",
      "The first would have required Ukraine to withdraw its forces from four regions illegally annexed by Russia, but which Russia never fully controlled: Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.",
      "The second option involved a number of conditions including a requirement that Ukraine wind down its military effort, cease receiving military aid, exclude any international military forces from its territory, lift martial law and then swiftly hold an election.",
      "As part of a peace treaty, Russia said it would require international recognition of Russian sovereignty over some Ukrainian territories it currently occupies, including Donbas and Crimea, and a pledge by Ukraine not to join any military alliances \u2014 an end to its efforts to join NATO \u2014 or allow any foreign militaries to operate or have bases in its territory.",
      "Russia also said it would want a cap on the strength of Ukraine's armed forces and for Russian to become an official language in Ukraine.",
      "Wendy Sherman, a former deputy secretary of state who has sat across from Putin before, said the Russian leader has no real interest in ending this war \u2014 he is simply \"buying time.\"",
      "\"This is President Putin's meeting,\" Sherman told CBS News Wednesday. \"He really is in charge of this meeting. He asked for it. The president, I think, was flattered to have this meeting. But Putin has no interest in ending this war. He is very smart, he is very cagey.\"",
      "What Ukraine wants",
      "Ukraine wants an end to Russia's assault and its full withdrawal from their territory.",
      "\"There must be an honest end to the war. And it depends on Russia,\" Zelenskyy said on social media earlier this month. \"It is Russia that must end the war it started.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said earlier this week that a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine would involve \"some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody. To the good, for the good of Ukraine. Good stuff, not bad stuff. Also, some bad stuff for both.\"",
      "That prompted a response from Zelenskyy, who said Ukraine would not give up any of its territory to Russia. Ukraine's constitution does not allow him to formally cede parts of the country.",
      "\"We will not reward Russia for what it has perpetrated,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media post last weekend. \"The answer to the Ukrainian territorial question already is in the Constitution of Ukraine. No one will deviate from this \u2014 and no one will be able to. Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier.\"",
      "Despite such statements, John Herbst, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center, said Zelenskyy has demonstrated he's willing to compromise.",
      "\"There is no doubt in my mind that Zelenskyy understands that territorial concessions may be required to get a durable peace,\" Herbst said.",
      "Another major concern is whether Putin, with his deep knowledge of Ukraine, could try to manipulate Mr. Trump, said former intelligence official Andrea Kendall-Taylor, who specialized in Russian affairs.",
      "Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova told CBS News that \"we all understand the reality on the ground, and we are ready to discuss how to end this war.\" She added, \"Let's stop the killings, and let's get to diplomacy.\"",
      "Ukraine and Russia's troubled history",
      "Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union before voting for independence in 1991.",
      "After the Soviet Union collapsed, the NATO alliance expanded eastward, adding former Soviet republics including Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, and it established a close partnership with Ukraine. In 2008, the alliance declared its intention for Ukraine to join NATO at some point in the future.",
      "Putin has said on numerous occasions that he views NATO's expansion as a threat to Russia. He has also said that he believes Ukraine to be part of Russia politically, culturally and linguistically.",
      "Some Ukrainians, primarily in eastern areas, are Russian-speaking and feel more closely aligned with Russia than the nation of Ukraine. But the majority of Ukrainians speak Ukrainian, feel a deep patriotic connection to Ukraine and have favored developing closer ties to Europe.",
      "Widespread protests erupted in Ukraine in 2014 when the pro-Russian president at the time refused to sign an EU association agreement. The public outrage forced him from office \u2014 an apparent victory for Ukrainians who favored closer ties to Europe. But shortly after, Russia annexed Crimea, a peninsula that was internationally recognized as part of Ukraine, and the Kremlin supported a pro-Russian separatist rebellion in Ukraine's east.",
      "In 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, attacking cities across the country, including the capital, Kyiv. Some expected Russia to quickly take over, but Ukrainians fought hard to defend themselves, Russian gains largely stagnated behind front lines in the east, and the war has raged on ever since.",

    "story": [
      "The building at 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan was evacuated on Thursday afternoon following reports of an unknown white powder.",
      "The FDNY said a call came in just before 4 p.m. saying the powder was reported found in the mailroom on the ninth floor of the building, which is home to the Department of Homeland Security and the New York City field office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, among other agencies. First responders and hazmat units were on the scene with four minutes, authorities said.",
      "\"Today's event was under control almost immediately, without incident,\" Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Kaz Daughtry said.",
      "5 letters containing powder were found, FBI says",
      "At an evening news conference, authorities said they were awaiting test results on the powder, which was in five separate letters, adding those letters would also be sent to FBI headquarters in Quantico, Virginia. They said at least two people were exposed.",
      "Christopher Raia, the assistant director of the FBI's New York City field office, said, \"Weapons of Mass Destruction and Hazard Evidence response teams immediately responded to the scene. The building was evacuated as per standard protocol and right now no threat remains to any employees or the public at this time.\"",
      "DHS said in a statement, in part, that \"some individuals were sheltering in place as part of established safety protocols.\"",
      "Officials asked people to avoid the area as they continue to investigate.",
      "On Friday, Mayor Eric Adams said\u00a0preliminary testing\u00a0found no dangerous substance in the powder.",
      "Debate continues over what's going on at 26 Federal Plaza",
      "The building at 26 Federal Plaza has been the scene of numerous detainments by ICE agents following routine immigration hearings. It has also been the site of several protests, alleging immigrants are being held in deplorable conditions.",
      "DHS maintains the building is not a detention center and says allegations of overcrowding or poor conditions are \"categorically false.\"",
      "\"It is a processing center where illegal aliens are briefly processed to be transferred to an ICE detention facility,\" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a recent statement to CBS News New York. \"All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with their family members and lawyers. As we arrest and remove criminal illegal aliens and public safety threats from the U.S., ICE has worked diligently to obtain greater necessary detention space while avoiding overcrowding.\"",
      "A federal judge on Tuesday said he would block the Trump administration from using the building to hold immigrants facing deportation unless it reduces the number of detainees and improves conditions at the site, including by providing sleeping mats and hygiene products.",
      "U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan\u00a0issued the temporary restraining order\u00a0after holding a hearing earlier Tuesday. A government lawyer conceded in court that those detained by ICE at the facility did not have access to certain services, including sleeping mats, in-person legal visits, medication and more than two meals per day.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, taped Aug. 14, 2025, in Anchorage, Alaska, and airing on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 17, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator.",
      "SEN. DAN SULLIVAN: Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for joining us in your home state.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Welcome to Alaska. The father of the U.S. Air Force called Alaska the most strategic place in the world. That's a quote by Billy Mitchell that I use a lot. And now you see why.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2014 very strategic. And I want to talk to you about a lot of things specific to the state--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014but this is the focus of the world right now\u2014",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: It is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014because of who's coming here.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So from your perspective, you're a supporter of Ukraine\u2014",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: I have been.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014what does a successful Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, summit look like?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, look, I think the President and his team need to be commended. You know, they have put a lot of effort and energy in peace, with regard to Ukraine and Russia, like they're doing all around the world, you know, they're they're making a lot of headway on peace, whether it's the Azerbaijan-Armenia issues, Iran-Israel, Pakistan-India, they're putting a lot of energy into bringing peace to different parts of the world, but they put the most energy into this.",
      "So, look, I think a successful outcome would be, as you know, a com- negotiating peace is very complex, very difficult. Even this kind of high level diplomacy has risks for everybody, including the president and his team. The different elements of a peace agreement, starting with the ceasefire, then you would have territorial issues, concessions or not, then you have security guarantees. But I think this is a place-setting exercise that the administration believes that if they can get a ceasefire, then you would do the other elements that I talked about, the much more complex elements, with Zelenskyy, with our European and NATO allies. So I think the President is going to assess Putin's seriousness on a ceasefire. And if he assesses that, that he's serious, and Putin agrees to a ceasefire, then I think that would be success. Then you move on to the other elements for round two. So this is really preliminary, and I would call it, you know, an exercise in place-setting for the real negotiations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, watch for the ceasefire, and judge success based off of that. Well, the Kremlin has announced there's going to be this joint press conference. The White House says, we'll see, the president said maybe, maybe not. Vladimir Putin is being brought in from the cold. He's been isolated by the world for a reason. Do you think that this is rewarding bad behavior, by giving him this spotlight on the American soil?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Look, two things on that. Vladimir Putin is coming to negotiate with Trump because of the sanctions. I mean, don't take it from me. Listen to our European allies who are definitive on that. The reason Putin is even doing this is because of the threat of serious secondary sanctions. So I think that that is important. And, you know, in terms of American soil, look, I actually think Alaska is the appropriate place. Putin understands one thing, as you know, Margaret, strength and power. And my state exudes strength and power with a huge military here. By the way, we're having a giant military exercise going on right now. I hope Vladimir Putin sees a lot of that military power in the next couple of days. Unleashing American energy, which the President is doing. That's the weapon that Putin fears probably more than anything, when we can compete with them.",
      "And then this is also, you know, a place that demonstrates a huge element of American power and strength, which is our allies. We have allies doing military exercises up here as we speak, the president has been doing a great job with our European allies. Gotten NATO to get to 5%, coordinating with them all week. So I think those are really important. And then finally, you know, as an Alaskan. I think it's important, from the perspective of reminding the Russians that we are quite good negotiators, including the president of the United States. You know, last time we had a big deal with Russia in America, about my state, we got this great state for two cents an acre, $7.2 million, probably the deal of the century. And I think the Russians- I think the Russians probably have to remember that too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly. Don't you think for Vladimir Putin, who, you know, allegedly wants to reconstitute the Russian Empire, that maybe has a little bit of a different meaning for him, arriving here?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, look, I think he has no- I mean, who knows what they think about Alaska, but I know what Alaskans think about Russia. And you know, we're a strong state, like I said. We have enormous power right here. And so again, I think for all these reasons, this is going to be a really important summit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So- he is an indicted war criminal, for a very specific crime of kidnapping Ukrainian children. He's bombed hospitals in Syria. He's massacred people, ordered them at least, he's- he's murdered many of his own people. He's used chemical weapons on British soil. That's why he's under this kind of pressure and U.S. sanctions. Really, are you pleased that he's this close to home?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Look, like I said, I mean the- the part about\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think it normalizes that, that it forgives that, that it brings him back into the fold by giving him that photo op that makes him look so powerful?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: You know, peace is difficult, right? We've had high level discussions with Reagan in Gorbachev, with Stalin, with Mao Zedong. I mean, this is what diplomacy is about, when you try to end wars. And it's- the way you end wars is, you discuss them with the leaders of these countries. Look, I'm no fan of Vladimir Putin. I don't trust anything he says. The key is, when I think what the president has done when you're dealing with a dictator, is show up with strength, and that's what the president's done. Putin is coming to the negotiating tables because he's threatened by these sanctions. The president is rebuilding our military, rebuilding our energy sector, which is critical, critical to my state, and very importantly, as I already mentioned, coordinating really closely with one of the greatest strengths we have, and that's our allies. We are an ally rich nation. Putin is ally poor, and that's a huge strength of ours.",
      "So all of these things, I think, you focus on the strength, get Putin to a ceasefire, and move forward with Ukraine, Zelenskyy, our European allies, in terms of the more complicated elements of a peace negotiation. But it starts with this. Starts with a ceasefire. And look, if President Trump assesses Putin is not being honest, you've seen, you know, a lot of frustration from the president recently saying, hey, I have these good discussions with Putin, then he's out bombing, you know, hospitals and nursing homes. If he assesses that he's not serious, then, as the president said, there'll be severe consequences. And I think that's the kind of pressure we need to keep on to try to get to what everybody wants, which is an end of this war.",

    "summary": "The move amounts to a sweeping reversal of \"sanctuary\" policies in the nation's capital, allowing the Metropolitan Police Department, for the time being, to fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.",
    "story": [
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday scrapped local directives that severely limited cooperation between police officers in Washington, D.C., and federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other immigration agencies.",
      "The move amounts to a sweeping reversal of \"sanctuary\" policies in the nation's capital, allowing the Metropolitan Police Department, for the time being, to fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement as President Trump asserts more control over the District of Columbia, citing concerns about crime and disorder. City officials quickly pushed back on the legality of Bondi's order, saying they were not bound by it.",
      "Mr. Trump has cited concerns about criminality and homelessness to launch a high-profile anti-crime crackdown in Washington, deploying National Guard troops and hundreds of agents from federal agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, Customs and Border Protection, ICE and the FBI to patrol parts of the city.",
      "Underpinning Mr. Trump's crackdown is an executive order earlier this week that effectively brought the Metropolitan Police Department under federal control by invoking emergency powers that last for 30 days.",
      "Bondi, who was assigned to oversee federal requests for the police department, wrote in a directive on Thursday that she was making Terry Cole, the current head of the DEA, the emergency police chief in Washington. She also cited Mr. Trump's emergency declaration to reverse several local police policies.",
      "\"D.C. will not remain a sanctuary city, actively shielding criminal aliens,\" Bondi said on Fox News Thursday.",
      "Bondi rescinded guidance issued by Washington police chief Pamela Smith earlier Thursday that allowed police officers to transport ICE agents and their detainees and to share immigration information during traffic stops, but that still barred most local involvement in federal immigration enforcement.",
      "She also scrapped guidance that prohibited D.C. police officers from searching databases for the purposes of determining someone's immigration status, even when there's no underlying criminal warrant.",
      "Bondi suspended rules that barred D.C. police from arresting individuals based on administrative immigration warrants signed by ICE officials \u2014 not judges \u2014 and from assisting federal agents during such arrests. The rescinded policy required officers to have a criminal nexus before carrying out an arrest, prohibiting arrests solely based on suspected civil immigration law violations.",
      "Bondi's order paused a local policy that previously blocked D.C. police from transferring noncitizen detainees to ICE, based on so-called \"detainer\" requests issued by the federal agency, unless there was a criminal warrant signed by a judge.",
      "Late Thursday, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser posted a letter authored by District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who argued Bondi's directives were not authorized by federal law.",
      "\"It is my opinion that the Bondi Order is unlawful, and that you are not legally obligated to follow it,\" Schwalb said in the letter, which was addressed to Smith, the Washington, D.C. police chief.",
      "Schwalb said police officers in the capital \"must\" continue to follow Smith's orders \"and not the order of any official not appointed by the Mayor.\"",
      "It's also unclear how Bondi's order interacts with a local Washington, D.C. law enacted in 2020 that generally forbids city officials from participating in or assisting federal immigration enforcement, unless there's a judicial warrant.",
      "As part of its far-reaching crackdown on illegal immigration, the Trump administration has sought to penalize so-called \"sanctuary\" cities and states that refuse to fully cooperate with federal immigration officers, threatening them with lawsuits and federal funding cuts.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 20:27:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As Texas hurtles toward a flashpoint on a GOP effort to redraw congressional districts, California Democrats are answering with a plan of their own.",
    "story": [
      "California Democrats are preparing to counter Republicans' attempt to reshape a series of Texas congressional districts for political advantage in a back and forth that could define next year's midterm elections and with it, the final two years of President Trump's second term.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he is moving forward with a redistricting plan Thursday as national tensions rage over changing congressional lines mid-decade. Districts are usually redrawn after the decennial census, and under California law, the changes would require a special election.",
      "Newsom has vowed his state would respond after Texas Republicans released plans earlier this summer to redraw five seats held by Democrats and make them more favorable to the GOP.",
      "\"California won't stand by and watch Trump burn it all down \u2014 we are calling a special election to redraw our Congressional maps and defend fair representation,\" Newsom said Thursday in a post on X ahead of his remarks.",
      "Newsom, speaking alongside a number of California officials in Los Angeles, said Mr. Trump is \"trying to rig the system,\" adding that \"as a consequence, we need to disabuse ourselves of the way things have been done.\"",
      "\"We have got to recognize the cards that have been dealt,\" Newsom said. \"And we have got to meet fire with fire.\"",
      "The California governor said the effort is happening \"in reaction to a president of the United States that called a sitting governor of the state of Texas and said 'find me five seats.'\"",
      "\"I know they say don't mess with Texas,\" Newsom said. \"Well, don't mess with the great Golden State.\"",
      "Newsom's team participated in a series of conversations with the state's Democratic congressional delegation and the California Legislature as drafts of possible maps were discussed. According to U.S. Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, the conversations were initially centered on the question, \"Is this even conceptually possible?\"",
      "California Democrats concluded that it was possible to gain five Democratic seats to counter Texas' gains, according to Lofgren. \"I'm confident that if we need to move forward, we will do that successfully. There's tremendous unity on the Democratic side.\"",
      "Republicans currently control both chambers of Congress and hold the White House. At the moment, if Democrats were to win back as few as three seats in next year's midterms, they could flip control of the House. That path would be threatened however if Republicans and Mr. Trump succeed in convincing GOP-led states like Texas, Indiana and Missouri to take some of their Democratic-held districts and alter them to favor Republicans instead.",
      "The developments in California Thursday come as Texas Republicans struggle to pass the maps that have become a national issue. Breakaway state House Democrats fled Texas earlier this month, denying the chamber the quorum it needed to take action on the new maps during a special legislative session.",
      "Since then, national Democrats have sought to call attention to what Republicans are trying to do in Texas, even as it's opened the left up to accusations of hypocrisy. During the standoff, some Texas Democrats have spoken out from Illinois, a blue state that was criticized for drawing its congressional maps after the 2020 Census to give Democrats the advantage.",
      "For both sides, the issue of congressional districts has become even more starkly partisan this summer. Various attempts have also been made in court to bring state House Democrats back to Texas, or to create a path that will help Republicans get their way.",
      "During a floor speech \u2014 before the maps passed the Texas Senate earlier this week in what amounted to a moot effort, given the House's obstacles \u2014 Republican Phil King bluntly said an objective of his \"was to support a plan that, simply put, elects more Republicans to the U.S. Congress.\"",
      "With the special session in Texas set to end in just a few days, Republicans have been adamant about eventually passing the maps, even if it takes more time and special sessions. With Democratic power limited in the state, there is a sense that Republicans will eventually be able to get their way.",
      "But the situation has left an opening for Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, to create a new front in the political fight, given that Democrats may have a path to redrawing Republican-held congressional districts in the blue state of California.",
      "A challenging process in California",
      "But California's effort will likely prove to be far more difficult and time intensive than the Republican-led push in Texas.",
      "In California, only nine of the state's 52 U.S. House districts are held by Republicans. Earlier this century, voters in the state signed off on putting in the state's constitution an independent citizens redistricting commission to decide new boundaries following the once a decade census process.",
      "The state-level differences between Democrat-led California and Republican-led Texas essentially make it harder for California Democrats to redraw districts in their state than it currently is for Texas Republicans. In Texas, GOP leaders and Mr. Trump allies just need to go through the normal legislative process to change districts.",
      "Because of California's constitution, changing the redistricting process in the state ahead of the 2026 midterms would likely require a new amendment. To take effect, it would need to be passed by a two-thirds vote in both the Assembly and Senate, and then be approved by California voters in an election. That election could prove costly, with major implications for the country on the line.",
      "Newsom said the difference between what's happening in California and Texas is \"we're working through a very transparent, temporary and public process.\"",
      "\"We're putting the maps on the ballot, and we're giving the power to the people,\" he said, adding that California would affirm its commitment to the state independent redistricting after the 2030 census.",
      "California lawmakers are scheduled to return to Sacramento on Aug. 18 amid the redistricting talk. The Legislature will have five days to conduct public hearings and formalize the process.",

      "In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland found that the Education Department violated the law when it threatened to cut federal funding from educational institutions that continued with DEI initiatives.",
      "The guidance has been on hold since April when three federal judges blocked various portions of the Education Department's anti-DEI measures.",
      "The ruling Thursday followed a motion for summary judgment from the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association, which challenged the government's actions in a February lawsuit.",
      "The case centers on two Education Department memos ordering schools and universities to end all \"race-based decision-making\" or face penalties up to a total loss of federal funding. It's part of a campaign to end practices the Trump administration frames as discrimination against white and Asian American students.",
      "The new ruling orders the department to scrap the guidance because it runs afoul of procedural requirements, though Gallagher wrote that she took no view on whether the policies were \"good or bad, prudent or foolish, fair or unfair.\"",
      "Gallagher, who was appointed by President Trump, rejected the government's argument that the memos simply served to remind schools that discrimination is illegal.",
      "\"It initiated a sea change in how the Department of Education regulates educational practices and classroom conduct, causing millions of educators to reasonably fear that their lawful, and even beneficial, speech might cause them or their schools to be punished,\" Gallagher wrote.",
      "Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy firm representing the plaintiffs, called it an important victory over the administration's attack on DEI.",
      "\"Threatening teachers and sowing chaos in schools throughout America is part of the administration's war on education, and today the people won,\" said Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO.",
      "The Education Department did not immediately comment on Thursday.",
      "The conflict started with a Feb. 14 memo declaring that any consideration of race in admissions, financial aid, hiring or other aspects of academic and student life would be considered a violation of federal civil rights law.",
      "The memo dramatically expanded the government's interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring colleges from considering race in admissions decisions. The government argued the ruling applied not only to admissions but across all of education, forbidding \"race-based preferences\" of any kind.",
      "\"Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon 'systemic and structural racism' and advanced discriminatory policies and practices,\" wrote Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary of the department's Office for Civil Rights.",
      "A further memo in April asked state education agencies to certify they were not using \"illegal DEI practices.\" Violators risked losing federal money and being prosecuted under the False Claims Act, it said.",
      "In total, the guidance amounted to a full-scale reframing of the government's approach to civil rights in education. It took aim at policies that were created to address longstanding racial disparities, saying those practices were their own form of discrimination.",
      "The memos drew a wave of backlash from states and education groups that called it illegal government censorship.",
      "In its lawsuit, the American Federation of Teachers said the government was imposing \"unclear and highly subjective\" limits on schools across the country. It said teachers and professors had to \"choose between chilling their constitutionally protected speech and association or risk losing federal funds and being subject to prosecution.\"",

    "summary": "Federal funding cuts to mRNA technology research doesn't just impact COVID vaccines \u2014 experts say it could stall progress in treatment for cancers, rare disease and more.",
    "story": [
      "If you think last week's decision by the federal government to halt $500 million in funding\u00a0for vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology will only affect COVID vaccines, think again.",
      "These types of vaccines\u00a0use\u00a0messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the body to make proteins that induce an antibody response to protect against a pathogen. The science behind it is also being studied for a wide range of other uses, from fighting cancer to treating autoimmune conditions and more.",
      "Health experts have criticized the move to defund this research, pointing to the impact it will have on America's ability to develop breakthroughs against deadly or debilitating diseases.",
      "Jeff Coller, professor of RNA biology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins University, called the cuts a \"completely reckless decision from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\" that was \"clearly being made for political motivations and not those that are rested in our science.\"",
      "Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, who served in the first Trump administration, said the technology \"helps us develop vaccines and new treatments,\" and warned that cuts could halt progress in one of the \"most promising areas of modern medicine.\"",
      "\"People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology,\" Adams said in a recent appearance on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "mRNA studied for pancreatic cancer, rare diseases and more",
      "Collier said one of the most exciting avenues for mRNA technology is in the treatment of deadly cancers, including pancreatic cancer, which is fatal for many patients within six months to a year.",
      "In recent years, researchers have been testing the effectiveness of using an mRNA vaccine to target the cancer. A small NIH-funded clinical trial by Sloan Kettering in 2023 used infusions of an mRNA vaccine to help boost T cells in the immune system of pancreatic cancer patients. The results, published in the journal\u00a0Nature, showed improvements among about 50% of participants.",
      "\"It was, in essence, the start of a cure for pancreatic cancer, where half of the patients in that study were surviving,\" Coller said.",
      "The early results encouraged scientists, but the small sample size called for further studies, which led to a\u00a0Phase 2 trial published in Nature earlier this year.",
      "Experimental mRNA-focused treatments have also showed promise in fighting lung,\u00a0colorectal and gastric cancers. For example, a study published online in the journal Gastric Cancer\u00a0found a mRNA-based vaccine led to robust gastric tumor regression in mice.",
      "And earlier this year, the world was was awed by news that an infant named KJ Muldoon became the first patient to undergo personalized gene-editing treatment using a technique known as CRISPR to fix a rare and potentially fatal genetic disorder.",
      "As Coller pointed out, the CRISPR technology had to be delivered via mRNA.",
      "\"This opens a floodgate for rare diseases,\" he said. \"We're now talking about, could we use the same technology to go after all rare diseases?\"",
      "Autoimmune diseases are another area of research, for treating things like multiple sclerosis, Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease.",
      "While all of these are still at the early research stage, Coller urged the importance of investing in this technology now for future progress.",
      "\"We need to do experiments and see where we can get with the next generation of mRNA-based drugs,\" he said.",
      "Like with COVID-19, there has also been continued research on mRNA-based vaccines for infectious diseases like the flu, RSV, Zika virus and cytomegalovirus, known as CMV, an infection that can be harmful to babies exposed during the mother's pregnancy.",
      "\"We're at a point where, if we continue to develop this technology, we'll get more personalized, bespoke medicine that we can use on patients and improve health care outcomes,\" Coller said.",
      "How is mRNA medicine so versatile?",
      "RNA stands for ribonucleic acid, an essential molecule in the body's cells. It is similar to DNA but has different functions. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, carries the information required for making proteins.",
      "As Coller put it: \"If your DNA is a cookbook, your mRNA is an individual recipe that's telling your body what to do.\"",
      "To harness that power for treating disease, \"All we're doing with this technology is giving it new recipes. We're taking advantage of this powerful natural system that exists in your body,\" he said.",
      "The versatility and potential to help such a range of illnesses is what has experts like Coller \u2014 who was not immediately impacted by the funding cuts \u2014 hoping the administration will reinstate funding for mRNA research.",
      "\"We have to keep moving forward,\" he said. \"People wanting to improve their family's lives and their children's lives is a bipartisan issue, it's truly an American issue. So we've got to keep moving.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump is calling up the D.C. National Guard and federal law enforcement to address crime in the capital.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced this week the deployment of 800 members of the D.C. National Guard to the District of Columbia, as part of a push to crack down on crime in the nation's capital.",
      "The president is also temporarily taking control of the District's Metropolitan Police Department. Hundreds of additional federal law enforcement officers have also joined the effort recently, from a variety of agencies fanning out across the city.",
      "\"I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in D.C., and they're going to be allowed to do their job properly,\" Mr. Trump said at a White House news conference Monday.",
      "The Army has activated the D.C. National Guard to \"assist law enforcement in the nation's capital,\" it said in a statement and added that of the approximately 800 soldiers activated, 100 to 200 would be supporting law enforcement at any given time on an \"array of tasks from administrative, logistics and physical presence.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Trump administration's deployment of federal law enforcement and National Guard troops in the District.",
      "What is the National Guard doing in D.C.?",
      "The District of Columbia is unique in that it's controlled by the federal government, which means the president has authority over the D.C. National Guard.",
      "For now, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Guard members will be supporting federal agents, as they recently did in Los Angeles, when they were brought in after protests against Trump administration immigration policies to help protect federal property and personnel enforcing the policies.",
      "The National Guard this week was activated under Title 32, which concerns the role of the Guard when it is under the control of its state's governor, or in this case, the president. D.C. Guard members have the authority to make arrests while they're in this status, but defense officials say that for now, the mission is focused on supporting law enforcement.",
      "Hegseth said the Guard was formally mobilized Monday morning and would be \"flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.\" Asked by Fox News' Laura Ingraham later that day whether the Guard troops would be detaining American citizens on U.S. soil, Hegseth replied, \"Under Title 32, which is the authorization they'll be using, they have broad latitude. But they're not going to be involved in law enforcement functions.\"",
      "He elaborated on how they might be utilized, saying, \"You can help somebody, interdict, temporarily detain like we did in Los Angeles, and hand over to law enforcement.\"",
      "And Hegseth also said the Guard members in D.C. are \"going to be proactive.\"",
      "\"If you take an action or a shot at them, there will be a consequence,\" he told Ingraham.",
      "The Army on Tuesday posted photos of the National Guard near the Washington Monument on X with the comment, \"D.C. National Guard reporting for duty.\"\u00a0Some of the vehicles\u00a0appeared to belong to the D.C. National Guard's 273rd Military Police Company, which often helps with security for high-profile D.C. events like presidential inaugurations and Independence Day celebrations, the unit's website says.",
      "The Guard troops while in Title 32 status are not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the U.S. military from carrying out domestic law enforcement actions.",
      "Members of the D.C. Guard deployed in Title 32 status in 2020, in response to protests over the killing of George Floyd, when the D.C. government requested additional manpower. They also deployed in Title 32 status in response to the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol, after some delay.",
      "There isn't an end date for how long they can stay deployed this time. According to the executive order the president signed Monday, the deployment \"shall remain in effect\" until the president determines the \"conditions of law and order have been restored in the District of Columbia.\"",
      "Before they're sent to the D.C. streets, the service members will receive additional training on de-escalation tactics and rules for the use of force, according to defense officials.",
      "Hegseth said Monday at the White House that other guardsmen from other states and other \"specialized units\" are prepared to deploy to D.C. if needed.",
      "What is the president authorized to do with control of the D.C. police?",
      "The Home Rule Act of 1973 created D.C.'s elected government and framework for its interaction with the federal government.",
      "Section 740 of the law says \"whenever the president of the United States determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist which require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for federal purposes, he may direct the mayor to provide him, and the mayor shall provide, such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the president may deem necessary and appropriate.\"",
      "Under the president's order, Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terry Cole is in charge of the daily D.C. Police operations, under the oversight of Attorney General Pam Bondi and Mr. Trump, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Cole has also been directed to work with D.C. police chief Pamela Smith.",
      "The law gives the president 48 hours to notify congressional leaders about his action, which Mr. Trump did on Monday. The president may remain in control of the D.C. police for up to 30 days, unless the House and Senate enact a joint resolution authorizing an extension.",
      "Leavitt said the deployment would be reassessed at the end of the 30-day period.",
      "The D.C. Police Department, which includes roughly 3,100 officers, has over 800 vacancies, according to the D.C. Police Union. The union, which is highly critical of D.C.'s mayor and city council, supports the federal takeover of the force.",
      "Who are the other federal law enforcement officials deployed to the streets of D.C.?",
      "Overnight Monday, about 850 officers and federal agents sent across the city made 23 arrests and seized six illegal handguns off the streets, Leavitt said Tuesday. The suspected offenses included homicide, firearms offenses, reckless driving, and driving under the influence, she said.",
      "\"This is only the beginning,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Participating members of what the White House is calling the Task Force's Law Enforcement Working Group throughout the operation include the U.S. Capitol Police, Homeland Security Investigations, the Federal Protective Service, the DEA, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Department of the Interior, the U.S. Secret Service, and the U.S. Marshals Service. The White House generally isn't specifying which law enforcement entities are performing what responsibilities.",
      "Homeless people being relocated",
      "Leavitt said that the U.S. Park Police would continue to move homeless people off D.C. streets and suggested homeless shelters and mental health and addiction treatment centers are places they can go \u2014 or jail if they refuse.",
      "Before Mr. Trump's announcement Monday, the White House was already deploying federal law enforcement officers onto D.C. streets as a part of an effort to make the city cleaner and safer.",
      "How D.C. officials are responding to the federal takeover",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi met Tuesday with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, along with the FBI director, head of the U.S. Marshals Service, the DEA's Cole and D.C. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro. The attorney general characterized the meeting as \"productive.\"",
      "But Bowser has called the president's takeover of the D.C. police \"unsettling and unprecedented,\" although her criticism of the Trump administration's move has been largely muted.",
      "The White House and Bowser appear to have conflicting ideas about the chain of command for the D.C. police. Bowser on Tuesday said the president has the authority to request services of the police, but \"our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, how we make changes, none of that has changed.\" That view conflicts with Leavitt's statement that\u00a0 Cole would be in charge of the police force, and would be overseen by the president and attorney general.",
      "D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith said the D.C. Police already work daily with federal law enforcement, and said she thinks an enhanced presence from the federal government may help.",
      "\"We know that we have to get illegal guns off of our street. And if we have this influx or enhanced presence, it's going to make our city even better,\" Smith said.",
      "\"I won't go into the details of our operational plan at this point, but you will see the Metropolitan Police Department working side by side with our federal partners in order to enforce the efforts that we need around the city,\" Smith said.",
      "James  LaPorta and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "The Perseids meteor shower \u2014 considered one of the best shows in the sky \u2014 is set to peak this week. But the peak for fireballs shooting through the night sky coincides this year with a bright moon that is expected to negatively impact visibility for eager viewers.",
      "The Perseids peak in 2025 is Aug. 12-13, specifically early Wednesday for those in North America. At that time, the moon will be 84% full, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"In 2025, the waning gibbous moon will severely compromise this shower at the time of maximum activity,\" the organization says. \"Such conditions will reduce activity by at least 75 percent as only the brighter meteors will be visible.\"",
      "Viewers this year can expect to see between 10-20 Perseids each hour, as opposed to 50 Perseids per hour under darker conditions, it says.",
      "\"The strength of each Perseid display varies year to year, mainly due to lunar conditions,\"\u00a0writes Robert Lunsford with the American Meteor Society. \"If a bright moon is above the horizon during the night of maximum activity, then the display will be reduced. Most of the Perseid meteors are faint and bright moonlight will make it difficult to view.\"",
      "The Perseids meteor shower has been ongoing for several weeks. It started in mid-July and will continue until Aug. 23.",
      "A planetarium program coordinator at a museum in St. Paul, Minnesota, is advising people to instead go out a week or so past the peak when the moon isn't so bright.",
      "The Perseids \"are an incredible meteor shower,\" Thaddeus LaCoursiere, of the Bell Museum, told The Associated Press.",
      "NASA says the best time to view the Perseids is early in the morning, before the sun comes up, in the Northern Hemisphere. However, meteors sometimes can be seen as early as 10 p.m.",
      "When looking at the Perseids, they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which is why this meteor shower has its name. But the meteors don't originate from the constellation; they are space debris left by a comet. That debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere, disintegrating and resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,\" which last visited the inner solar system in 1992, NASA says.",
      "During peak, Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, the Earth will pass closest to the core orbit of comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, Lunsford writes.",
      "\"To view the Perseids successfully, it is suggested you watch from a safe rural area that is as dark as possible,\" he says. \"The more stars you can see, the more meteors will also be visible.\"",

      "Kodak is warning that its future in business is looking very blurry.",
      "The iconic 133-year-old business cautioned Monday that there's \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to continue as a going concern because it might not have the financial resources to meet its future debt obligations, according to an Aug. 11\u00a0regulatory filing. A so-called going concern warning is an accounting term that signals a risk that a business might cease operations.",
      "Shares of Kodak plunged $1.73, or 26%, to $5.05 in Tuesday morning trading. Reached for comment, a Kodak spokesperson pointed to the statement in its regulatory filing.",
      "The warning is the latest development in the photography company's storied history, which includes introducing one of the first consumer cameras in the 1880s and mass manufacturing film rolls for hobbyists and professionals alike. But Kodak struggled to adapt when digital cameras overtook film starting in the 1990s, leading to a bankruptcy filing in 2012.",
      "Its current financial crunch is tied to almost $500 million in short-term debt obligations, as well as more than $200 million in pension liabilities. Last year, Kodak had said it would end its pension plan in order to reduce debt, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Kodak should have \"a clear understanding by Aug.15 of how we will satisfy our obligations to all plan participants,\" Chief Financial Officer David Bullwinkle said in a statement, referring to the pension plan.",
      "A Kodak moment",
      "Rochester, New York-based Eastman Kodak, founded by inventor George Eastman in 1892, mass produced the famed Brownie and Instamatic cameras, popularizing photography as a pastime for generations of Americans. Its yellow-and-red film boxes were ubiquitous in photo shops and other retailers.",
      "Eastman said his goal was \"to make the camera as convenient as the pencil,\" according to the Kodak website.",
      "But Kodak faced competition from Japanese companies, including Fujifilm in the 1990s, as well as the shift to digital technology, leading to its filing for\u00a0bankruptcy protection in 2012.",
      "The company wound up selling off many of its businesses and patents, while shutting down the camera manufacturing unit that first made it famous. It received approval for its plan to emerge from court oversight a year later.",
      "At the time, Kodak was looking to recreate itself as a new, much smaller company focused on commercial and packaging printing.",
      "Kodak is now nearing completion on a manufacturing plant to create regulated pharmaceutical products. The company already makes unregulated key starting materials for pharmaceuticals. Production at the retrofitted facility is expected to start later this year.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government 15% of revenue generated by sales of their AI chips in China, a White House official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The Financial Times on Sunday\u00a0reported that the agreement between the tech giants and the U.S. government was reached as a condition for granting export licenses for China, which were provided last week. A U.S. official confirmed the \"broad strokes\" of the report to CBS News.",
      "The arrangement, with companies providing a stream of revenue in exchange for export licenses, is highly unusual as corporations typically do not pay the federal government a share of revenue from their export sales. Export licenses also do not carry any fees,\u00a0according to shipping giant Maersk.",
      "In a Monday press conference, President Trump described the agreement with Nvidia as a deal that would benefit the nation. He described meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to discuss the terms of agreeing to the export license; Mr. Trump didn't mention AMD in his comments.",
      "\"So I said, 'I want 20% if I'm going to approve it for you,'\" Mr. Trump said of his meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to discuss the terms of the export license. \"I don't want it myself, so when I say I want 20%, it's for the country.\"",
      "\"[Huang] said, 'Will you make it 15%?' so we negotiated a little deal,\" the president added.",
      "The revenue-sharing plan comes after the White House\u00a0announced\u00a0in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia's H20 chips and MI308 chips from rival chipmaker AMD to China. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last month said it had won approval from the Trump administration to sell its H20 chips to China.",
      "The H20 chip, which is specialized for artificial intelligence applications, was developed by Nvidia for the Chinese market, while AMD's MI308 chips are also geared for AI.",
      "It is unclear how the Trump administration would use the money generated from the chip sales agreement.",
      "Nvidia declined to comment on the specifics of the deal. In a statement, a spokesperson said, \"We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets. While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.\"",
      "AMD did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Stocks for both companies rose slightly on Monday.",

      "The company unveiled its new \"universal EV platform\" at a Monday event, with Ford CEO Jim Farley calling it \"the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T,\" which Ford introduced in 1908.",
      "According to Ford, the new assembly line will be structured more like an \"assembly tree,\" with three different lines that converge into one, rather than a single assembly belt.",
      "\"This way of building a vehicle, we're confident, is the first time anyone's done this anywhere in the world,\" said Doug Field, Ford's EV chief of digital and design, at Monday's event.",
      "The company said the design will lead to a quicker, smoother assembly process and improve ergonomics for employees through a less obstructive layout.",
      "\"Ford's announcement is very ambitious, because it includes both a new production process and a new vehicle,\" said Patrick Anderson, founder of Michigan-based consulting firm Anderson Economic Group, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"If they can actually pull off a production line that has 40% fewer workstations and 20% fewer parts, it will be worthy of the 'Model T moment' claim.",
      "Ford's first EV from the new system",
      "The first product of this new production system will be a four-door midsize truck, which will debut in 2027. Farley said on Monday that the new vehicle will accommodate five people and feature a \"frunk\" \u2014 a front storage compartment \u2014 as well as a pickup truck bed.",
      "The vehicle will start at $30,000. By comparison, the average price for a new electric vehicle in July was about $56,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Field touted the new vehicle's charging capabilities, referring to the truck as a \"mobile power plant.\"",
      "\"Outlets in the back can give you high power and let you plug in anything from tools to a refrigerator, and it can provide backup power for your home,\" he said.",
      "The midsize electric truck could be produced up to 40% faster than other vehicles at the Louisville Assembly Plant due to the new process, Ford said.",
      "In another effort to lower costs, the auto company is also reducing the number of components that go into each car. Vehicles produced on the \"universal EV platform\" will have 20% fewer parts than a traditional vehicle, Ford said.",
      "The company will also use smaller cobalt and nickel-free batteries that will allow it to make \"cost gains,\" according to a video shared by Ford.",
      "Anderson said that Ford has its work cut out for them given that the new truck will need to be competitively priced and economical. According to the auto industry expert, the cost of charging EV trucks currently on the market is often much higher than the price at the pump for gas-powered versions. A report from the Anderson Economic Group shows pickup trucks drivers in New York, California and Michigan face \"significantly higher costs\" if they rely on an EV.",
      "A successfully lower-cost truck model, however, could spur a new chapter for the company in its manufacturing of EVs.",
      "\"If Ford shows the industry it can build and sell a reliable compact EV truck for $30,000, it will sell a lot of them, and open the door to making sedans using the new production process,\" Anderson said.",

    "story": [
      "Cold case Detective Clark Schwartzkopf was working a double murder case from the early 1990s and had arranged to meet a person of interest at a Chili's restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona. The idea was to get the possible suspect's DNA so forensic investigators could determine if it matched male DNA found on the bodies of the two female victims, Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas.",
      "Those unsolved murders had become known as the canal murders because both women were attacked while taking bike rides along the city's distinctive canal paths.",
      "It was Jan. 2, 2015, and Schwartzkopf was meeting with a guy named Bryan Patrick Miller. The detective had learned that Miller was something of a local celebrity. He liked to attend popular zombie walks and other festivals in Phoenix dressed as a character known as the Zombie Hunter, and fans and police officers posed with him.",
      "When he was in character, Miller wore a homemade costume with goggles and a menacing mask and carried a fake Gatling gun. He also drove and tricked out an old Crown Victoria police car, splashed it with fake blood and put the name Zombie Hunter on the back. He also often put a ghoulish mannequin in the back seat behind bars.",
      "The day they met for dinner, Miller had driven his distinctive car to Chili's. That certainly caught Schwartkopf's attention, but the detective still didn't believe Bryan Miller was the canal killer. One of the reasons he was a potential suspect was because a genetic genealogist had matched the name Miller to the crime scene DNA.",
      "But Schwartzkopf remained skeptical that this 42-year-old divorced dad raising a teenage daughter alone and working at an Amazon warehouse could be the killer.",
      "Schwartzkopf told \"48 Hours\" correspondent Peter Van Sant that he essentially wanted to cross this Miller off his list. \"I was really more about just getting his DNA,\" Schwartzkopf said, \"clearing him and moving on because my conversation with him, he was the last person I ever thought would be responsible for this. He was mild-mannered.\"",
      "Van Sant reports on the case in \"Unmasking the Zombie Hunter.\"",
      "The detective's doubts were reinforced as he observed the way Bryan Miller treated his teenage daughter whom he had brought along for the meal at Chili's. \"He had a good rapport with his daughter.\"",
      "Van Sant asked, \"Was he physically imposing? He looked like a guy who could overpower people?\"",
      "The canal killer had ambushed Brosso and Bernas while they were each out on nighttime bicycle rides. Somehow, the killer had stopped them, and then stabbed and sexually assaulted them. The killings were particularly vicious and Brosso had been beheaded.",
      "\"He's a bigger guy, but he's more soft,\" the detective said. \"Big enough to where he could certainly overpower women, but not someone you'd be really scared of on the street.\"",
      "Schwartzkopf had arranged to be seated in a quiet section of Chili's. Undercover detectives watched workers take the silverware and plates out of the dishwasher and then detectives placed them on the table to ensure they would not be contaminated, Schwartzkopf told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Miller ordered a burger and a glass of water. \"He swallows his hamburger, in like, five bites, Schwartzkopf said. \"Won't take a drink of his water. And I'm sitting there going, 'Are you sure you\u2026don't want\u2026something else to drink? You just got water.' 'No, no, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.'\"",
      "But then to Schwartkopf's relief, Miller finally took a sip of water: \"That's when I knew that, OK, now we've at least got his DNA.\"",
      "As soon as Miller walked out, undercover detectives secured the glass Miller had used. Miller then gave Schwartzkopf a quick tour of his Zombie Hunter car before he left.",
      "Eleven days later, the detective got a visit from the head of the forensic lab. Schwartzkopf told Van Sant what happened. \"She leans down to me, she goes, 'It's him.' I go 'What?' She goes, 'Bryan Miller, it's him.' \u2026 Well, the blood rushed from my head. \u2026 I kind of sat back and I went, 'You've gotta be kidding.'\"",
      "Miller was arrested immediately and denied he had killed anyone. The case took almost eight years to get to trial, but Miller was convicted of murdering Brosso and Bernas and received the death penalty in June 2023.",
      "Under Arizona law, Miller will receive an automatic appeal."

She was engaged in the dental practice,\" Tubbs said, adding that Angela Craig \"was somebody who was talking about ideas, and their marketing, their message.\" Tubbs thought it was great to see such a successful family business seemingly thriving in Colorado.",
      "Angela Craig was 43 years old when she died, and mother to those six children with James Craig. Former employees and friends told \"48 Hours\" that she had always seemed happy and healthy. In that warrant, police note that Angela and Jim Craig were known to work out together in the mornings, and that James would make Angela a morning protein shake as part of that daily routine.",
      "Angela Craig's mysterious illness begins",
      "Angela Craig's medical troubles had begun on March 6, 2023, when she first started feeling sick. According to that arrest warrant, she texted her husband that morning, writing, \"I don't feel right in my head.\" James Craig texted her back asking, \"do I need to come home?\" and Angela Craig replied \"No\u2026this is just weird. I'm dizzy in my head and my eyes are working slowly and my body is responding slowly.\"",
      "The warrant shows James Craig texted, \"Do you get lightheaded when you stand up?\" and that Angela Craig texted back, \"It feels more like I feel when I take heavy meds and everything adjusts and moves slowly. Like I'm moving in thick gel. My eyes are struggling to stay focused.\" She later texted James Craig, \"I feel drugged\" and soon he did come home and took Angela Craig to the ER.",
      "The warrant says Angela Craig was released from the ER that same day but was back at the hospital three days later, this time as an admitted patient. Angela Craig underwent a series of tests and treatments, but doctors were still struggling to figure out what was wrong. It was during that second hospital visit when a curious thing happened at Summerbrook Dental. It would become a key piece of evidence in a murder investigation.",
      "A package arrives",
      "According to the warrant, James Craig had told his office manager that he was expecting a \"personal package\" and \"not to open it.\" That package arrived on March 13, while Angela Craig was still in the hospital, and, according to the warrant, a staff member, not knowing about those instructions, had opened it. The warrant says that the office manager, closing the box back up for Dr. Craig, saw it contained a canister labeled \"potassium cyanide.\" Police say the package was then hand delivered to Dr. Craig.",
      "Angela Craig was released from her second hospital visit on March 14, the day after that package is alleged to have been delivered to Summerbrook Dental. She had still not been diagnosed but seemed well enough at that moment.",
      "Unfortunately, that moment would not last. The next morning, on March 15, 2023, Angela Craig was back in the hospital, seemingly sicker than ever. She would never come out.",
      "Police say James Craig arrived at the hospital on March 15 soon after Angela Craig but didn't stay long. The warrant says he soon went home and returned roughly an hour-and-a-half later, carrying food. Police say he then went into Angela Craig's room alone and that soon after she had a seizure and her vital signs crashed.",
      "That's when James Craig took photos of his wife, sending them to their friend Michelle Redfearn, a trained nurse married to James Craig's business partner and friend from dental school, Ryan Redfearn. When the Redfearns got those photos and James Craig's text \u2014 that read in part, \"crash. intubated. doc says she's 'very very worried'\" \u2014 they raced to the hospital.",
      "On their way, Ryan Redfearn would later tell police, he got a phone call from the office. That phone call was to alert Ryan Redfearn about that package marked \"potassium cyanide\" that a staffer said had been delivered and opened. That same employee, hearing of Angela Craig's symptoms, had Googled them, and, according to the warrant, was worried Angela Craig may have been poisoned. When the employee saw that Angela's symptoms lined up with the symptoms for cyanide poisoning, she made a phone call.",
      "After arriving at the hospital, Ryan Redfearn would later tell police he saw James Craig crying after talking to a doctor. But Ryan Redfearn did not seem convinced those tears were real. He took a nurse aside and shared the story about that package marked \"potassium cyanide\" that had been delivered to James Craig just two days prior.",
      "The warrant says that nurse, being a mandatory reporter, called police and within hours members of the homicide unit from the Aurora Police Department had launched an investigation. By this time, Angela Craig was on life support, and the outlook was grim.",
      "A phone call between partners",
      "Later that same day, the warrant says, Ryan Redfearn was with Michelle Redfearn in the hospital parking lot when they got a phone call from James Craig. Ryan Redfearn said James Craig asked him if he had spoken to police. Ryan Redfearn told him that he had and that he had heard about that package allegedly marked \"potassium cyanide.\"",
      "According to the warrant, James Craig then told Ryan Redfearn that the package contained a ring for Angela. Ryan Redfearn says he told James Craig that someone had opened that package and seen that container marked cyanide. And, according to the warrant, Ryan Redfearn soon ended that phone call, telling James Craig to \"stop talking and get a lawyer.\"",
      "The next morning, the warrant says, James Craig sent Ryan Redfearn \u00a0a lengthy text, writing, in part: \"I want to make an urgent plea to you,\" it went on \"Please don't talk to anyone \u2026 including any law enforcement officers. You are under no obligation to answer their questions unless you are served a subpoena and you will do more damage than good to my family by continuing to insert yourself into this.\"",
      "In an interview with Natalie Morales, former Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler, when asked about that text said, \"I'm trying to think of all the innocent applications of the phrase, please don't talk to the police. I can't come up with any.\"",
      "Still, as James Craig is awaiting trial, the defense has not yet had the chance to present its case to a jury. At a preliminary hearing in July 2023, Craig's attorney stated that he had struggled with depression in the past and had sought counseling.",
      "Utah-based defense attorney Skye Lazaro is not a part of this case, but has worked on other cases involving poison, and reviewed the records available at the time. Lazaro told Morales it's possible James Craig's defense could argue he was looking for poison not to kill Angela Craig but to kill himself. Lazaro also said she thinks the defense could argue that James Craig's arrest was rushed and that police didn't take the time to explore other theories of how Angela Craig may have died, including the possibility that Angela may have sought to die by suicide \u2014 or that James Craig had.",

    "published": "Sat, 16 Aug 2025 23:25:31 -0400",
    "summary": "Erin is the first hurricane to develop over the Atlantic this year, and meteorologists are closely tracking its path and forecast.",
    "story": [
      "Erin rapidly strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane over the Atlantic Ocean Saturday before weakening slightly to a Category 4 status, but it remained a \"formidable\" storm while it underwent a process known as an \"eyewall replacement cycle,\" the National Hurricane Center said.",
      "\"Some fluctuations in intensity are expected over the next couple of days due to inner-core structural changes,\" the Miami-based hurricane center said.",
      "A\u00a0Category 4 hurricane\u00a0is defined as having maximum sustained winds of 130 mph or higher.",
      "The center of Erin was skirting to the north of the northern Leeward Islands, which includes the Virgin Islands. It was forecast to move away from the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Sunday, and then pass to the east of Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas Sunday night and Monday. The hurricane center warned that heavy rain in some areas could trigger flash flooding, landslides and mudslides.",
      "Tropical storm watches were in place for Turks and Caicos Islands.",
      "Erin, which grew from a tropical storm into a hurricane on Friday, is the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season.",
      "Forecasters urged people in the Caribbean islands to monitor Erin's progress, warning of the potential for heavy rainfall and life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.",
      "Erin is not currently forecast to impact the United States, but meteorologists continue to watch it closely.",
      "What is an eyewall replacement cycle?",
      "The hurricane center disclosed Saturday night that Erin was undergoing an \"eyewall replacement cycle,\" which, according to CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan, is when the storm has become so significantly powerful that its eyewall, its strongest part, reaches maximum strength.",
      "When this happens, Nolan said, the eyewall itself becomes so intense from intaking the available energy from its environment that a new eyewall will begin to build on the outside of the existing, inner eyewall. Once the new eyewall is created, it cuts off the fuel to the original eyewall.",
      "Furthermore, as the new eyewall gains strength to keep up with the power of the storm, the radius of the eye itself will become much larger than it originally was, Nolan said.",
      "This process may cause the storm to weaken temporarily, and its wind speeds may slow as it regains strength.",
      "According to Nolan, however, after this process, the storm could emerge even stronger than it was before.",
      "Maps show Hurricane Erin's forecast path",
      "Erin's path continued to curve northward, with the center of the hurricane passing just to the north of the northern Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico.",
      "The northern Leewards stretch from the Virgin Islands to Guadeloupe and include St. Martin, St. Barts and other islands. Officials\u00a0 had issued tropical storm watches for several islands, alerting people of the possibility of winds ranging between 39 mph and 73 mph.",
      "A \"spaghetti map\" of the forecast models shows the storm skirting the Caribbean islands and remaining well offshore of the U.S. East Coast as it moves north.",
      "A high-pressure system in the Atlantic was expected to steer Erin away from the Eastern Seaboard while a cold front was also forecast to push the hurricane offshore, CBS News Bay Area meteorologist Jessica Burch reported.",
      "On the U.S. Virgin Islands, officials with the National Park Service announced that sites on the island of St. Croix would be closed starting late Friday afternoon until after the storm passes.",
      "First hurricane of the Atlantic season",
      "Erin formed as a tropical storm\u00a0on Monday west of the island nation of Cabo Verde, a few hundred miles off Africa's western coast. It is the fifth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which started in June and runs through November.",
      "So far this year, Tropical Storm Chantal is the only one to have made landfall in the U.S., bringing deadly flooding to North Carolina in early July. In June, Barry made landfall as a tropical depression on Mexico's eastern coast.",
      "Erin's increased strength comes as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its peak in September. According to the hurricane center, most of the season's activity typically happens between mid-August and mid-October. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, hurricane season starts on May 15 with a peak in activity typically seen in late August.",
      "The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, forecast an above-normal season for the Atlantic this year, expecting between 13 and 18 named storms.",
      "Tropical storms have maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph. Forecasters with NOAA anticipated that between five and nine of the storms this year could become hurricanes, which have sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Hurricanes are rated on a scale based on their wind speeds, ranging from Category 1, the weakest, to Category 5, the most severe rating.",
      "NOAA forecasters predicted there could be between two and five major hurricanes in the Atlantic this season.",

      "The murders of two young women, killed months apart while riding their bikes along a canal in Phoenix, Arizona, went unsolved for more than two decades and would become known as the Phoenix canal murders.",
      "Investigators got a break 21 years after the murders thanks to DNA and genetic genealogy. They zeroed in on Bryan Patrick Miller, 42, a divorced father raising his teenage daughter. Investigators soon discovered Miller had an alter ego. He was a local celebrity known for participating in parades and festivals as the Zombie Hunter.",

      "Clark Schwartzkopf: It's one of those cases that you just don't forget \u2026 you can't unsee what happened to those girls, you just can't.",
      "Long before the man known as the Zombie Hunter became the prime suspect in the canal murders, Clark Schwartzkopf was a detective with the Phoenix Police Department's cold case squad. His mission was simple but pointed: find the killer responsible for those vicious murders of two young women from the early 1990s.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: To this day, I'm still not exactly sure about what \u2026 happened on those \u2026 bike paths.",
      "The case began on Nov. 8, 1992. Angela Brosso, a tech worker who had recently moved to Phoenix, was taking advantage of beautiful weather to get in a little exercise, says Briana Whitney, the true crime reporter for the CBS affiliate KPHO in Phoenix.",
      "Briana Whitney: Each night, she would go out for her evening bike ride just at golden hour at sunset, the best time to be riding out here.",
      "Angela was only hours away from turning 22, and, like a lot of locals, she liked to bike on the paths that ran alongside the city's distinctive canals, says Schwartzkopf, a \"48 Hours\" consultant.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Are there places that are sort of natural ambush sites if somebody wants to attack someone?",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: Yeah, they are \u2026 there's a lot of tunnels that go underneath the interstate.",
      "That November evening in 1992, Angela left her apartment around 7 p.m., her boyfriend Joe later told police. He said he stayed home to bake Angela a birthday cake and didn't expect her to be gone long.",
      "Briana Whitney: Hours go by, and Joe grows concerned. Angela hasn't come home. And that's not like her.",
      "Joe told police he took his bike out three times that night, frantically searching for Angela on the canal paths. He spoke to her friends -- even her mother back in Pennsylvania. Finally, he reported Angela missing to police. The next morning, searchers came upon a horrific scene.",
      "Briana Whitney: Angela Brosso's torso was found in a field next to the trail that she had been riding her bike on.",
      "Angela had been stabbed to death.",
      "Approximately 10 days after Angela's headless body was discovered, a man fishing along this section of the canal, spotted her head stuck on a grate.",
      "Morgan Loew, an investigative reporter who also works at KPHO and is a \"48 Hours\" consultant, has been working on the canal killer case for more than a decade.",
      "Morgan Loew: And from what we have heard from witnesses \u2026 the head was in amazingly good condition, especially considering this was days after the murder. \u2026 We've heard that the head looked like it had been preserved \u2026 Like it was a memento for the killer.",
      "Angela's purple mountain bike was also missing. There were no solid leads, and the case went quiet until September 1993\u201410 months after Angela's murder\u2014when the mother of 17-year-old Melanie Bernas returned from a dinner date to find her daughter had broken her curfew and was not home. She then noticed that Melanie's bicycle was missing.",
      "Morgan Loew: Melanie decides to go on a bike ride \u2026 by around 10:30 when Melanie did not return, her mother \u2026 started calling her friends. \"Is Melanie there?\"",
      "Rachel Schepemaker: Well, my mom took the phone call \u2026 said that Melanie's mom was frantic and like nervous \u2026",
      "Rachel Schepemaker was one of Melanie's close friends in high school.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So initially when you hear \u2026 that her mother's looking for her \u2026 You're not thinking something terrible has happened to your friend?",
      "Rachel Schepemaker: Definitely not. I thought she was with a friend and just forgot to communicate with her mom where she was.",
      "Early the next morning Charlotte Pottle, a local resident, happened to be riding along the canal with her young daughter in a bicycle seat. Just as they came out of one of those tunnels that ran under the interstate, she spotted a puddle.",
      "Charlotte Pottle: There was just a big puddle of something. \u2026 Ended up riding right through it \u2026 and having it splash up over me.",
      "Pottle says something about the puddle bothered her, so a few minutes later she doubled back. That's when she made a horrible realization.",
      "Charlotte Pottle: I could tell that it was a puddle of red, that it was a puddle of blood.",
      "Charlotte Pottle (pointing to a tree): And all of a sudden, as I'm looking at it, I noticed that there are some drag marks that went along over here.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Toward that tree.",
      "Charlotte Pottle: Towards that tree. Yes. \u2026 And then went around the tree and was drugged back \u2026 you could see the drag marks right here to the canal.",
      "Pottle went home and called police. Later that night, the local news reported that a woman's body had been found in the canal, close to where Angela Brosso's head had been located.",
      "Rachel Schepemaker: They found the body in a teal bodysuit. I was told by some other friends that Melanie did not own that. It can't be her.",

      "Rachel Schepemaker: I'm at school \u2026 my friends just come up to me crying and saying it was Melanie.",
      "Detectives strongly suspected Melanie had been targeted and stabbed in the back by the same person who had killed Angela.",
      "Morgan Loew: Police believe that somehow, the killer got her off of her bike, whether he knocked her off of her bike or whether he asked her a question.",
      "Schwartzkopf says the evidence indicates the killer approached the women from behind.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf :Both the knife wounds were the exact same position.",
      "Investigators say the killer dragged Melanie's body off the canal path removed her clothes and dressed her in that teal bodysuit.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Along with the stabbing and the dismemberment, there was another component to these murders, wasn't there?",
      "Briana Whitney: Yeah, both women were sexually assaulted.",
      "And that meant investigators had a crucial piece of evidence: DNA.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: when the DNA from Melanie's scene was finally tested later, it \u2026 matched to Angela's scene. So, we knew for sure that we were dealing with the same perpetrator.",
      "Investigators noted that the initial stab wounds to the backs of each woman were fatal and so precise that detectives suspected the killer might be a surgeon.",
      "Morgan Loew: The details about what happened \u2026 were the kinds of things that kept parents from letting their kids out when the sun went down.",
      "THE TRAIL LEADING TO THE \"CANAL KILLER\" BEGINS WITH DNA FROM THE CRIME SCENE",
      "The murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas in the early 1990s created fear in Phoenix that lasted for a generation.",
      "Morgan Loew: They watched the news and read the newspaper every day, hoping that police would make an arrest. And it just kept going on and \u2014 nothing and nothing and nothing.",
      "Investigators had collected matching male DNA from both the victims. But more than two decades passed and the canal murder cases went cold. Then, science finally caught up with the calendar.",
      "Briana Whitney: It's in 2014, Phoenix police detectives are at a DNA conference. \u2026 and a forensic genealogist from California is also at the conference.",
      "Colleen Fitzpatrick, founder of Identifinders International, was there to meet with law enforcement.",
      "Briana Whitney: And she goes up to these detectives, and says, hey, I can take Y chromosomes and create these DNA profiles and try to match \u2026 with genealogy to help solve criminal cases.",
      "Fitzpatrick's company had developed software that could mine public genealogy databases, searching for matches to crime scene DNA. The detectives heard her out.",
      "Colleen Fitzpatrick: And then several weeks later, they sent me the Y-DNA profile \u2026 from the crime scene for the Phoenix canal murders.",
      "Fitzpatrick's company started crunching the data, hoping to provide Phoenix detectives with a name.",
      "Colleen Fitzpatrick: We entered the numbers from the forensic profile into our software. \u2026 That's where I came up with six matches to the name Miller.",
      "While the genetic genealogy search produced the name Miller, it is also one of the most common last names. Detective Schwartzkopf started digging.",
      "Peter Van Sant: You check your files and what do you find?",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: I think there were a total of six Millers that were on what I called my master list. \u2026 And I went down through the list \u2026 got to Bryan Patrick Miller.",
      "But who was Bryan Patrick Miller? Records showed he was 42 years old with a Phoenix address. That name was just one of more than 600 persons of interest who had lived in those case files for years, placed there by a tip. Police at the time seemingly did not pursue Miller.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: We discovered his file downstairs.",
      "Police learned Bryan Miller had a record dating back to before the canal murders. In May 1989, when he was just 16 years old, Miller crossed paths with Celeste Bentley.",
      "Celeste Bentley: I was 24, and I was going to work. \u2026 I had \u2026 just noticed \u2026 a young boy on the bus.",
      "Bentley says she and the boy got off at the same stop. Moments later, she felt something in her     back.",
      "Celeste Bentley: He had ran by me, I thought he had just hit me. \u2026 I just yelled at him. I was like \u2026 \"why \u2014 why'd you do that,\" you know? And then, I reached back and touched my back and realized that it was blood \u2026 I had been stabbed.",
      "With a single knife wound to her upper back, Bentley screamed and managed to make it to the store where she worked. A coworker called for help. About 30 minutes later, when Bentley was in the back of an ambulance \u2014",
      "Celeste Bentley: The police came and said they found him, and they wanted to bring him to the ambulance to show him to me.",
      "Bentley identified her assailant. Bryan Miller was charged with aggravated assault.",
      "Celeste Bentley: They said that if he had held the blade the other way, he would've gone straight through my ribs, and I could have died.",
      "Miller pleaded guilty and was sentenced to juvenile detention until he turned 18. It was a far cry from where Miller's life had begun.",
      "Briana Whitney: He was living in Hawaii for a while as a kid with his mom and his dad. But his dad died early on in a motorcycle accident.",
      "Years later, Miller and his mother Ellen moved to Phoenix.",
      "Briana Whitney: So, for most of his life and early years, it was Bryan Miller and his mom.",
      "While Miller was in juvenile detention, his mother made a disturbing discovery.",
      "Morgan Loew: Bryan Miller's mom was looking through his stuff, and she found a note that he wrote.",
      "The pages detailed a sinister plan: kidnap the girl, tie her up in the truck and cut her clothes off.",
      "Morgan Loew: This note spelled out how he wanted to find, abduct, rape, murder and dismember a young woman. And Bryan's mom was so disturbed by this piece of paper that she took it to Phoenix police.",
      "It was Miller's 18th birthday and he had just been released as an adult.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: She flat out told police at the time that she was really scared for her safety. \u2026 And that she was not going to allow him to come home.",
      "So, after his release, Miller ended up at a Phoenix halfway house. When Schwartzkopf read that note in 2014, he was struck by something.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: There was a lot of things in there that were close or similar to what happened specifically to Angela.",
      "Including a description of decapitating a victim and preserving the head. Phoenix police wanted to locate Miller. Luckily, he was very easy to find.",

      "Peter Van Sant: The Zombie Hunter. \u2026 Like a comic book character?",
      "Briana Whitney: Yeah, like a comic book character. Like a \u2026 good guy fighting the bad guys.",

      "But could Miller be the canal killer? The only way to find out was to get his DNA. Investigators began to surveil Miller, who worked at an Amazon warehouse. Every day when he got there, Miller parked the zombie mobile in the same spot.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: He would come out for his 15-minute break, blast his music really loud. \u2026 Lunchtime came out to the car, same thing. \u2026 Blast this God-awful music.",
      "Schwartzkopf came up with an elaborate plan to get his DNA.",

      "On Jan. 2, 2015, Schwartzkopf met Miller at a Chili's restaurant to fill out a job application. The cold case unit was behind the scenes ready to bag anything that had Miller's DNA on it, such as utensils or a glass.",

      "Schwartzkopf started to worry this operation would be a bust.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And what does he finally do that makes this mission accomplished?",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: He finally took a drink from the water glass \u2026 That's when I knew that, OK, now we've at least got his DNA.",
      "Despite knowing about Miller's juvenile record, as their meal ended, the veteran detective's gut told him Miller was not their man.",

      "At the start of Bryan Miller's trial for the murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas in October 2022, his attorneys opened with a startling defense\u2014they admitted their client was the canal killer.",
      "Morgan Loew: They had to concede right off the bat that he is the actual killer, but that he was not guilty by reason of insanity.",

      "BRYAN MILLER (to detective): She used her security belt, and it was like a law enforcement belt, and usually I got hit by the buckle.",

      "To show Miller's deviant side, prosecutors called the only person in the world Miller said he despised: his ex-wife Amy. The judge did not allow cameras to record her face.

      "But according to that 52-page warrant, none of Angela Craig's family members told police she was suicidal. A more likely argument for the defense, says Lazaro, is that James Craig had been looking for cyanide not to kill Angela \u2014 but to kill himself.",
      "Skye Lazaro: There was some statements that he, in fact, was suicidal, not her.",
      "At that preliminary hearing in 2023, James Craig's defense team said he had spoken to a friend about his own past plans to die by suicide, and that \"Dr. Craig had made a statement\" to that friend that he was going to die by \"suicide with something that was not traceable.\" The defense pointed out that James Craig \"suffered from depression\" and went to counseling in the past.",

James Craig's defense points out that he texted back, \"Given our history, I know that must be triggering. Just for the record, I didn't drug you.\" The defense said this text supports the story of James Craig's past depression and suicide attempts.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-erin-caribbean-storm/",
    "published": "Sat, 16 Aug 2025 21:04:47 -0400",
    "summary": "Hurricane Erin underwent rapid intensification to become a Category 5 storm in just hours. It has since weakened to a Category 4 status.",
    "story": [
      "Erin\u00a0strengthened into a powerful Category 5 hurricane in the Caribbean Saturday before weakening slightly to a Category 4 status, the National Hurricane Center said.",
      "The hurricane is not forecast to hit land, but strong winds are affecting nearby islands, prompting forecasters to warn of possible flooding and landslides. The storm will eventually swerve away from the continental United States, the Miami-based hurricane center said.",
      "Erin began as a tropical storm, became a hurricane on Friday and quickly intensified overnight Saturday. Here's how the storm became so powerful.",
      "What is rapid intensification?",
      "On Friday morning, Erin was only a tropical storm. It underwent rapid intensification, which means the storm's wind speeds strengthened by more than 58 miles per hour in a 24-hour window, overnight.",
      "Erin has low wind shear and a tight, compact core. Those features, combined with its path over very warm water, create the \"perfect conditions for rapid intensification,\" said CBS News weather producer David Parkinson. Sea surface temperatures are over 85 degrees Fahrenheit and warmer than normal.",
      "Hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry said Erin gained strength at a pace that was \"incredible for any time of year, let alone August 16th.\"",
      "The most powerful storms tend to form later in the year, with the hurricane season typically peaking in mid-September.",
      "Hurricane-caused climate change is making it easier for\u00a0hurricanes to rapidly intensify. Since April 2023, global sea surface temperatures have been hotter than any period on record, and hotter oceans fuel stronger storms and amplify evaporation, strengthening hurricane winds and increasing the rain they hold. Storms that ramp up so quickly complicate forecasting for meteorologists and make it harder for government agencies to plan for emergencies.",
      "Rapid intensification can lead to more rainfall and coastal flooding. Erin's outer bands are expected to produce heavy rainfall across the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Local flash and urban flooding, along with landslides or mudslides, are possible, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.",
      "The last Category 5 storm,\u00a0Hurricane Milton, also underwent rapid intensification before slamming into Florida as a Category 3 storm in 2024. Two dozen people died in the storm. Including Erin, there have been 43 hurricanes that reached Category 5 status in the Atlantic.",
      "From 1980 to 2023, 177 Atlantic hurricanes that made landfall rapidly intensified. About 80% of Category 3-5 hurricanes undergo this process.",
      "Hurricane Erin's path",
      "Erin\u00a0formed as a tropical storm\u00a0on Monday west of the island nation of Cabo Verde, a few hundred miles off Africa's western coast, then developed while traveling over the Atlantic.",
      "The center of the storm is forecast to curve northward. Its center is expected to pass north of the northern Leewards, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, the NHC said.",
      "The storm is expected to remain well offshore of the U.S. East Coast, according to a \"spaghetti map\" of forecast models showing Erin's possible paths. A high-pressure system in the Atlantic and a cold front are expected to steer Erin away from the Eastern seaboard. Bermuda may see some effects, Lowry said.",
      "\"All of our best consensus aids show Erin turning safely east of the United States next week, but it'll be a much closer call for Bermuda, which could land on the stronger eastern side of Erin,\" he said.",
      "2025 Atlantic hurricane season so far",
      "Erin is the fifth\u00a0named storm\u00a0of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which started June 1 and runs through November 30.",
      "So far,\u00a0Tropical Storm Chantal\u00a0is the only storm to have made landfall in the U.S., bringing\u00a0deadly flooding\u00a0to North Carolina in early July. In June, Barry made landfall as a tropical depression on Mexico's eastern coast.",
      "Forecasters could see conditions were ripe for Erin to become an extremely powerful storm as it moved across very warm waters in the open Atlantic.",
      "\"Water temperatures at the surface and hundreds of feet deep are several degrees higher than the historical average,\" said Alex DaSilva, Accuweather's lead hurricane expert.",
      "This year's season is once again expected to be unusually busy. The forecast calls for six to 10 hurricanes, with three to five reaching major status with winds of more than 110 mph.",

    "summary": "Environmental groups and independent scientists are criticizing a report assembled by a small team of well-known climate skeptics selected by Energy Secretary Chris Wright.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has reduced funding for climate research, dismissed federal scientists who worked on the National Climate Assessment, and removed past editions of the report from government websites. Now, critics say, it is taking the next step: rewriting the science itself, according to a lawsuit filed this week by environmental groups.",
      "As the Environmental Protection Agency moves to revoke the Endangerment Finding, the 2009 scientific determination that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, the Department of Energy published a\u00a0new review of the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on U.S. climate that aims to support the EPA's efforts.",
      "The report was developed this spring by the 2025 Climate Working Group, which is composed of five independent climate scientists selected by Energy Secretary Chris Wright.",
      "But environmental groups and independent scientists have criticized the report and how it was written, claiming it was assembled in secret by the five scientists who are recognized by the larger scientific community as climate skeptics.",
      "\"The secret report was produced by a set of known climate contrarians who were commissioned to write this report that's full of inaccuracies,\" said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director of climate and energy programs at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"It's clearly geared towards trying to give the EPA a way to evade its legal responsibility to address the health harms of heat trapping emissions and climate change.\"",
      "A \"secret report\"",
      "The DOE report, entitled \"A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate,\" was commissioned in March when Wright assembled the group to undertake a massive review of scientific findings in a very short period of time, with no public announcement of this effort.",
      "The five authors delivered their final draft by May 28. In the report's preface, the authors wrote, \"The short timeline and the technical nature of the material meant that we could not comprehensively review all topics.\"",
      "Their report argues that carbon-driven warming may be less economically damaging than commonly believed, and that aggressive U.S. climate policies would have little measurable impact on the global climate. It attributes some warming to natural climate cycles or changes in the sun, instead of the burning of fossil fuels, and also claims sea level rise has not been accelerating, contrary to widely accepted scientific evidence. Finally, it highlights the potential benefits of rising carbon dioxide levels for plant growth.",
      "\"I would say that it presents an incomplete and misleading picture of how climate change is affecting the United States,\" said Phil Duffy, chief scientist at Spark Climate Solutions, who previously worked in the Biden and Obama administrations as a science policy expert.",
      "Duffy and other scientists say the DOE report cherry-picks evidence, misrepresents peer-reviewed research, and ignores the overwhelming consensus that human activity is driving dangerous warming. Numerous climate-based groups and researchers have published their own fact-checks on the report, with one listing more than 100 false or misleading claims made by the authors.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Department of Energy about the criticisms of the report. They responded by referring to Wright's statement in the preface, where he wrote that he chose the panel \"for their rigor, honesty, and willingness to elevate the debate.\"",
      "\"This DOE report is in service of a political goal, it's not credible science,\" said Ben Santer, a climate researcher and board member of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Santer says his own published work was misrepresented in the DOE report and said the authors \"fundamentally twist\" the work of many researchers to reach conclusions that \"will be used for a political purpose.\"",
      "Critics in the scientific community have pointed out that the panel's five authors are known for their contrarian views on climate science, which are often at odds with the scientific consensus on the causes of climate change.",
      "\"The people that were handpicked by the Trump administration's energy secretary are this very small group of people who are known to disagree with that mountain of [scientific] evidence,\" said Vickie Patton, general counsel at the Environmental Defense Fund. \"Some of them have connections to the fossil fuel industry.\"",
      "Accusations of rewriting science",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas executive, has been vocal about his views on climate change, which align with the report's findings. In an op-ed earlier this year, he called climate change \"a by-product of progress,\" and wrote, \"I am willing to take the modest negative trade-off for this legacy of human advancement.\" He argues that while climate change is real, it is not the greatest threat, and that expanding access to affordable, reliable energy should remain the priority.",
      "Wright has been transparent about how he views U.S. climate research, telling CNN's Kaitlan Collins that the administration is reviewing past federal climate reports, including the National Climate Assessment, and may provide \"updates\" later this year, leading many in the scientific community to fear the administration is aiming to edit or censor critical research.",
      "\"It's important that science be allowed to speak for itself and I do have concerns that that's not happening,\" Duffy told CBS News.",
      "National Climate Assessments typically take years to write and are authored by hundreds of scientists.",
      "Duffy says that Wright didn't oversee the previous reports and therefore has no authority to review or revise them. \"He can't rewrite the National Climate Assessment any more than I can rewrite 'The Great Gatsby,'\" Duffy says.",
      "The Environmental Defense Fund and Union of Concerned Scientists filed a lawsuit Tuesday in federal court against the EPA and the Department of Energy, arguing that their actions violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires transparency and balanced membership for government advisory panels. The suit alleges that the Climate Working Group was created in secret, its work withheld from the public, and then its report was used extensively by the EPA, cited 22 times, to justify repealing the Endangerment Finding. The organizations are asking a judge to block the government's use of the report to comply with transparency laws.",
      "When asked about the lawsuit, the EPA responded in an email saying, \"As a matter of longstanding practice, EPA does not comment on current or pending litigation,\" and referred CBS News to the Department of Energy.

      "In the year leading up to the collision with an American Airlines flight, claiming the lives of all 67 aboard the two aircraft, one out of every 10 helicopters flying in that area were above the route's 200-foot altitude limit, according to analysis of the FAA data released as part of the National Transportation Safety Board's investigation into the crash.",
      "The route was already tight, offering a maximum of 75 feet of margin between helicopters passing through and landing airplanes flying overhead, NTSB officials have concluded.",
      "\"What I'm trying to figure out is how do we not find this out until after an accident,\" the NTSB's Jennifer Homendy asked after presenting the FAA data during investigative hearings on Aug. 1. \"How do we ensure that data is being evaluated and shared?\"",
      "\"None of the airlines had identified any of the risk here, the Army hadn't identified the risk here, and we hadn't identified the risk,\" FAA acting deputy chief operations officer Nick Fuller said in response to the questioning. \"I hope that the AI tools that we're developing will find some of the things that we are missing that we just can't catch, because most of the operations that we looked into were actually compliant.\"",
      "Robert Sumwalt, former chair of the NTSB and CBS News' transportation safety expert and analyst, said the newly-public FAA data indicates such close operations between helicopters and airplanes may have been normalized.",
      "\"So, therefore it just looked like noise in the data that people really were not taking it as a serious risk. And as we now know the risk was unacceptable,\" Sumwalt said.",
      "The FAA has been evaluating helicopter flight data for airports nationwide, relying on data similar to the information analyzed by CBS News. The effort has already led to safety changes at some airports, including Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, where FAA officials said helicopter close encounters declined 30% in three weeks after action was taken earlier this year.",
      "\"The FAA took quick action after the accident to stop mixed traffic in the DC airspace,\" a statement released Thursday by the agency said. \"We continue to work with the NTSB to support the ongoing investigation.\"",
      "The data analyzed by CBS News came from two FAA studies completed in the months after the January crash, including one initiated by the NTSB. One examined helicopter altitudes near the airport in the year leading up to the crash and the other examined encounters between aircraft over periods of various lengths up to 52 months before the crash.",
      "A third study has been requested but not yet received from the FAA, according to NTSB officials.",
      "At least half of the helicopters flying routes within five miles of Washington National in the year before the collision were military flights, the FAA data showed.",
      "Those flying missions similar to the Black Hawk involved in the crash came within 1,000 feet of other aircraft 687 times over the course of 52 months leading up to the crash. That's an average of more than three times per week.",
      "The American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas\u00a0involved in the collision was operated by PSA Airlines on a Bombardier CRJ-700 regional airliner. Both the airline and that model of jet were the most likely to depart or land at the airport during the 52 months leading up to the crash, the CBS News analysis of FAA data shows. They were also the most likely aircraft types to end up within 1,000 feet of a helicopter. The airline's flights were involved in a close encounter an average of four times per week, the analysis of FAA data shows.",
      "The NTSB's investigation into the collision is ongoing. A final report with determinations about the probable cause is likely within the next year.",

    "summary": "Americans are reining in their spending at fast-food restaurants as they continue to face economic uncertainty.",
    "story": [
      "The most important meal of the day is also shaping up to be the most skipped meal of the day, at least according to two of the country's largest fast-food chains.",
      "McDonald's and Wendy's last week, during their respective earnings calls, said they're seeing sluggish breakfast sales. The companies attributed the trend to heightened economic uncertainty and pressures facing low-income consumers.",
      "\"There is a lot of anxiety and unease with that low-income consumer,\" McDonald's CEO Christopher Kempczinski said on the company's earnings call on Aug. 6.",
      "Despite wage gains, real incomes are down for low-income consumers, who are facing a lot of financial stress, the CEO said, citing President Trump's tariffs as a potential contributor.",
      "\"So real incomes are down with the low-income consumer, that absolutely is going to put pressure on visits into the [quick-service retail] industry. Second thing is there is a lot of anxiety and unease with that low-income consumer. I think we could all speculate the reasons for that, probably tariffs and the impact that, that might have, questions around employment situation,\" Kempczinski said.",
      "According to Kempczinski, the decline in traffic from low-income consumers \u2014 a core demographic for fast-food restaurants \u2014 is an industrywide trend, with breakfast menus across the quick service industry taking the biggest hit.",
      "Why skip breakfast?",
      "As many Americans rein in discretionary spending, industry analysts and executives say one of the first items on the chopping block is breakfast. Instead of heading to the drive-thru for a breakfast sandwich, more Americans are opting to grab something at home, or skip the meal altogether.",
      "\"When consumer uncertainty increases and consumers choose to eat another meal at home, breakfast is often the first place that they do that with,\" Wendy's interim CEO Ken Cook said on the company's earnings call Aug. 8.",
      "That's a stark contrast to the breakfast boom fast-food chains have enjoyed for nearly a decade, which led many restaurants over the years to expand their early morning offerings. Starbucks, which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12 separate items. Wendy's\u00a0reintroduced\u00a0breakfast in 2020 and offers 10 items with eggs.",
      "The cost of fast food has also skyrocketed over the past decade,\u00a0according\u00a0to 2024 report by FinanceBuzz. The personal finance site found that the price of a McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese meal from McDonald's more than doubled in price from $5.39 in 2014 to $11.99 in 2024.",
      "To be sure, reports of slowing traffic at fast-food chains have preceded the recent decline in breakfast sales. On an earnings call in May 2024, McDonald's CEO Kempczinski expressed \"heightened anxiety\" about how the economy was weighing on lower- and middle-income Americans. During that same time, the CEO of Dine Brands, which owns Applebee's and IHOP,\u00a0told\u00a0CNBC that casual restaurants were also seeing a drop in low-income customers.",
      "Still, not all fast-food chains are experiencing declines in breakfast traffic. Both Starbucks and Dunkin' told CBS MoneyWatch they've seen success with breakfast sales.",
      "Reached for comment by CBS MoneyWatch, both McDonald's and Wendy's pointed to their earnings reports.",
      "What falling breakfast sales say about the economy",
      "Experts say that American consumers' decision to skip out on breakfast points to myriad economic pressures facing low- and middle-income consumers ranging from sky-high credit card interest rates to inflation.",
      "\"The fact that the breakfast day part is slowing now, in our opinion, speaks to heightened economic uncertainty and the lower consumer confidence that we've seen, and that really escalated as tariff rhetoric came into the picture,\" Matthew Todd, a director at S&P Global Ratings, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The consumer is very value focused, discerning and selective about how they're spending. I think we would say we think breakfast is the easiest meal to cut because consumers can eat something quickly,\" Todd said.",
      "Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, told CBS MoneyWatch that low- and middle-income Americans have been spending more cautiously since the end of last year, in part due to a \"weakening\" labor market. \"That's adding to their nervousness and their caution so far this year,\" he said.",
      "The most recent jobs report showed hiring slowed in July. The Labor Department also sharply revised job growth for May and June down by a combined 258,000, a sign that hiring was weaker than previously estimated. With the revisions, the U.S. added 19,000 jobs in May and 14,000 in June.",
      "Experts also told CBS MoneyWatch that low-income consumers' purchasing power is already under pressure due to inflation \u2014 something they said\u00a0tariffs could exacerbate. The Consumer Price Index in July showed inflation held steady at 2.7% on an annual basis. Restaurant prices are up 3.9% since July of last year and 0.3% from June.",
      "\"If they have to spend more to buy a pair of shoes or get their hair cut, they're gonna have less to spend on everything else again, including breakfast at a fast-food restaurant,\" Zandi said.",

      "The SSA did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Each fall, the agency uses inflation data from July, August and September to determine the COLA for the next year. The consumer price index (CPI), a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers that tracks the change in prices on everyday items over time, showed that the inflation rate in July held steady at 2.7% on an annual basis, the same as it was in June.",
      "The inflation rate has remained at or below 3% since the start of 2025. However, experts predict it could inch up later in the year as tariffs put more pressure on consumer prices. Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, told CBS MoneyWatch that he estimates headline CPI will rise to 3.7% and core CPI will rise to 3.8% by the second quarter of 2026.",
      "Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at New York City's New School, believes inflation will likely rise and is concerned that a moderate cost-of-living adjustment \"probably won't be enough to cover the inflation rates that we're headed into,\" AARP reported.",
      "Martha Shedden, the president and co-founder of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts, echoed that concern, telling CBS MoneyWatch that based on the current way COLA is calculated, the increase\u00a0is \"not keeping up with seniors' true expenses.\"",
      "According the the AARP, the 2.5% COLA adjustment introduced this year boosted the average Social Security retiree's payment by about $49 a month. The average monthly Social Security check for all beneficiaries was $1,861 in June 2025 and $2,005 for retired workers,\u00a0according to the Senior Citizens League.",
      "In addition to the COLA, some senior citizens will also benefit from a provision included in President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" which provides a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for Americans aged 65 and older.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/adults-drink-alcohol-record-low-new-poll-decline/",
    "published": "Wed, 13 Aug 2025 09:42:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Gallup has been tracking Americans' drinking behavior since 1939. Here's what a recent survey found.",
    "story": [
      "Fewer Americans are reporting that they drink alcohol amid a growing belief that even moderate alcohol consumption is a health risk, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday.",
      "The survey finds that 54% of U.S. adults say they drink alcoholic beverages such as liquor, wine or beer \u2014 \"the lowest by one percentage point in Gallup's nearly 90-year trend,\" the analytics company says.",
      "And a record high percentage of U.S. adults, 53%, now say moderate drinking is bad for their health, up from 28% in 2015. The uptick in doubt about alcohol's benefits is largely driven by young adults \u2014 the age group that is most likely to believe drinking \"one or two drinks a day\" can cause health hazards \u2014 but older adults are also now increasingly likely to think moderate drinking carries risks.",
      "The findings of the poll, which was conducted in July, indicate that after years of many believing that moderate drinking was harmless \u2014 or even beneficial \u2014 worries about alcohol consumption are taking hold. According to Gallup's data, even those who consume alcohol are drinking less.",
      "The federal government is updating new dietary guidelines, including those around alcohol. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, government data showed U.S. alcohol consumption was trending up. But other government surveys have shown a decline in certain types of drinking, particularly among teenagers and young adults.",
      "This comes alongside a new drumbeat of information about alcohol's risks. While moderate drinking was once thought to have benefits for heart health, health professionals in recent years have pointed to overwhelming evidence that alcohol consumption leads to negative health outcomes and is a leading cause of cancer.",
      "Growing skepticism about alcohol's benefits",
      "Younger adults have been quicker than older Americans to accept that drinking is harmful, but older adults are coming around to the same view.",
      "About two-thirds of 18- to 34-year-olds believe moderate drinking is unhealthy, according to the poll, up from about 4 in 10 in 2015. Older adults are less likely to see alcohol as harmful \u2014 about half of Americans age 55 or older believe this \u2014 but that's a substantial increase, too. In 2015, only about 2 in 10 adults age 55 or older thought alcohol was bad for their health.",
      "In the past, moderate drinking was thought to have some benefits. That idea came from imperfect studies that largely didn't include younger people and couldn't prove cause and effect. Now the scientific consensus has shifted, and several countries recently lowered their alcohol consumption recommendations. Earlier this year, the outgoing U.S. surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, recommended a label on bottles of beer, wine and liquor that would clearly outline the link between alcohol consumption and cancer.",
      "\"Alcohol is a well-established, preventable cause of cancer responsible for about 100,000 cases of cancer and 20,000 cancer deaths annually in the United States \u2014 greater than the 13,500 alcohol-associated traffic crash fatalities per year in the U.S. \u2014 yet the majority of Americans are unaware of this risk,\" Murthy said in a statement in January.",
      "The federal government's current dietary guidelines recommend Americans not drink or, if they do consume alcohol, men should limit themselves to two drinks a day or fewer while women should stick to one or fewer.",
      "Gallup's director of U.S. social research, Lydia Saad, said shifting health advice throughout older Americans' lives may be a reason they have been more gradual than young adults to recognize alcohol as harmful.",
      "\"Older folks may be a little more hardened in terms of the whiplash that they get with recommendations,\" Saad said. \"It may take them a little longer to absorb or accept the information. Whereas, for young folks, this is the environment that they've grown up in ... in many cases, it would be the first thing young adults would have heard as they were coming into adulthood.\"",
      "The government is expected to release new guidelines later this year, under the directive of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has promised big changes. Kennedy has not hinted at how the alcohol recommendations may shift.",
      "Drinking rates fall to decade low",
      "Slightly more than half of Americans, 54%, report that they drink alcohol \u2014 a low in Gallup's data that is especially pronounced among women and young adults. The previous low was 55%, recorded in 1958.",
      "\"Declines in alcohol consumption do not appear to be caused by people shifting to other mood-altering substances \u2014 in particular, recreational marijuana, which is now legal in about half of U.S. states,\" Gallup said in a news release. \"Although marijuana use is higher today than a decade ago, it has been fairly steady over the past four years and thus doesn't appear to be a factor in people choosing not to drink alcohol.\"",
      "Gallup says it has been tracking Americans' drinking behavior since 1939. Since 2001, it has tracked their views on health implications related to moderate drinking.",
      "Young Americans' alcohol consumption has been trending downward for years, accelerating the overall decline in alcohol consumption. In sharp contrast with Gallup's findings two decades ago, when young adults were likeliest to report drinking, young adults' drinking rate is now slightly below middle-aged and older adults.",
      "Americans' reported drinking is among the lowest since the question was first asked in 1939. For most of the last few decades, at least 6 in 10 Americans have reported drinking alcoholic beverages, only dipping below that point a few times in the question's history.",
      "Americans who drink alcohol are consuming less",
      "Even if concerns about health risks aren't causing some adults to give up alcohol entirely, these worries could be influencing how often they drink.",
      "The survey found that adults who think moderate drinking is bad for one's health are just as likely as people who don't share those concerns to report that they drink, but fewer of the people with health worries had consumed alcohol recently.",
      "About half of those who worry moderate drinking is unhealthy said they had a drink in the previous week, compared with about 7 in 10 who did not think drinking was bad for their health.",
      "Overall, only about one-quarter of Americans who drink said they had consumed alcohol in the prior 24 hours, a record low in the survey. Roughly 4 in 10 said that it had been more than a week since they had poured a drink.",

      "The warning is the latest development in the photography company's storied history, which includes introducing one of the first consumer cameras in the 1880s and mass manufacturing film rolls for hobbyists and professionals alike.

    "published": "Sat, 16 Aug 2025 23:25:31 -0400",
    "summary": "Erin is the first hurricane to develop over the Atlantic this year, and meteorologists are closely tracking its path and forecast.",
    "story": [
      "Erin rapidly strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane over the Atlantic Ocean Saturday before weakening slightly to a Category 4 status, but it remained a \"formidable\" storm while it underwent a process known as an \"eyewall replacement cycle,\" the National Hurricane Center said.",
      "\"Some fluctuations in intensity are expected over the next couple of days due to inner-core structural changes,\" the Miami-based hurricane center said.",
      "A\u00a0Category 4 hurricane\u00a0is defined as having maximum sustained winds of 130 mph or higher.",
      "The center of Erin was skirting to the north of the northern Leeward Islands, which includes the Virgin Islands. It was forecast to move away from the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Sunday, and then pass to the east of Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas Sunday night and Monday. The hurricane center warned that heavy rain in some areas could trigger flash flooding, landslides and mudslides.",
      "Tropical storm watches were in place for Turks and Caicos Islands.",
      "Erin, which grew from a tropical storm into a hurricane on Friday, is the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season.",
      "Forecasters urged people in the Caribbean islands to monitor Erin's progress, warning of the potential for heavy rainfall and life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.",
      "Erin is not currently forecast to impact the United States, but meteorologists continue to watch it closely.",
      "What is an eyewall replacement cycle?",
      "The hurricane center disclosed Saturday night that Erin was undergoing an \"eyewall replacement cycle,\" which, according to CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan, is when the storm has become so significantly powerful that its eyewall, its strongest part, reaches maximum strength.",
      "When this happens, Nolan said, the eyewall itself becomes so intense from intaking the available energy from its environment that a new eyewall will begin to build on the outside of the existing, inner eyewall. Once the new eyewall is created, it cuts off the fuel to the original eyewall.",
      "Furthermore, as the new eyewall gains strength to keep up with the power of the storm, the radius of the eye itself will become much larger than it originally was, Nolan said.",
      "This process may cause the storm to weaken temporarily, and its wind speeds may slow as it regains strength.",
      "According to Nolan, however, after this process, the storm could emerge even stronger than it was before.",
      "Maps show Hurricane Erin's forecast path",
      "Erin's path continued to curve northward, with the center of the hurricane passing just to the north of the northern Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico.",
      "The northern Leewards stretch from the Virgin Islands to Guadeloupe and include St. Martin, St. Barts and other islands. Officials\u00a0 had issued tropical storm watches for several islands, alerting people of the possibility of winds ranging between 39 mph and 73 mph.",
      "A \"spaghetti map\" of the forecast models shows the storm skirting the Caribbean islands and remaining well offshore of the U.S. East Coast as it moves north.",
      "A high-pressure system in the Atlantic was expected to steer Erin away from the Eastern Seaboard while a cold front was also forecast to push the hurricane offshore, CBS News Bay Area meteorologist Jessica Burch reported.",
      "On the U.S. Virgin Islands, officials with the National Park Service announced that sites on the island of St. Croix would be closed starting late Friday afternoon until after the storm passes.",
      "First hurricane of the Atlantic season",
      "Erin formed as a tropical storm\u00a0on Monday west of the island nation of Cabo Verde, a few hundred miles off Africa's western coast. It is the fifth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which started in June and runs through November.",
      "So far this year, Tropical Storm Chantal is the only one to have made landfall in the U.S., bringing deadly flooding to North Carolina in early July. In June, Barry made landfall as a tropical depression on Mexico's eastern coast.",
      "Erin's increased strength comes as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its peak in September. According to the hurricane center, most of the season's activity typically happens between mid-August and mid-October. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, hurricane season starts on May 15 with a peak in activity typically seen in late August.",
      "The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, forecast an above-normal season for the Atlantic this year, expecting between 13 and 18 named storms.",
      "Tropical storms have maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph. Forecasters with NOAA anticipated that between five and nine of the storms this year could become hurricanes, which have sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Hurricanes are rated on a scale based on their wind speeds, ranging from Category 1, the weakest, to Category 5, the most severe rating.",
      "NOAA forecasters predicted there could be between two and five major hurricanes in the Atlantic this season.",

      "A bitter contract fight between Canada's largest airline and the union representing 10,000 of its flight attendants escalated Friday as the union turned down the airline's request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which would eliminate its right to strike and allow a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.",

      "Laroche said he was initially upset over the union's decision to go on strike, but that he had a change of heart after reading about the key issues at the center of the contract negotiations, including the issue of wages.",
      "\"Their wage is barely livable,\" Laroche said.",
      "The airline said it would also offer alternative travel options through other Canadian and foreign airlines when possible. But it warned that it could not guarantee immediate rebooking because flights on other airlines are already full \"due to the summer travel peak.\"",
      "\"Air Canada is strongly advising affected customers not to go to the airport unless they have a confirmed ticket on an airline other than Air Canada or Air Canada Rouge,\" the airline said in a statement. \"Air Canada deeply regrets the effect the strike is having on customers.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump announced the news on Truth Social hours after meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Alaska.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump said he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday afternoon to discuss an agreement \"which would end the war\" between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "The Truth Social post came about half a day after Mr. Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Mr. Trump said the meeting with Putin \"went very well.\" He also said the meeting was followed by a \"late night phone call\" with Zelenskyy and other European leaders, including Mark Rutte, the secretary general of NATO. The call took place around 2:40 a.m. ET.",
      "\"It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump did not share any details of the agreement. Diplomatic sources told CBS News that Mr. Trump said that Putin would make some concessions, but failed to specify what that might mean.",
      "In his first remarks since Friday's summit, Putin said the visit to Alaska was \"timely and very useful\" and that addressing the \"root causes\" of the war \"should be the basis of a settlement.\"",
      "\"We have not had direct negotiations of this kind at this level for a long time. I repeat: there was an opportunity calmly, in detail once again to express our position,\" Putin said, according to a transcript of a meeting with senior Russian officials released by Kremlin. \"We, of course, respect the position of the U.S. administration, which sees a need for an early cessation of hostilities. Well, we would also like to resolve all issues by peaceful means. The conversation was very frank, informative, and I think it brings us closer to the right decisions.\"",
      "European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, said in a statement that they had been debriefed on the meeting with Putin, and said Mr. Trump had supported security guarantees for Ukraine. The guarantees would allow Ukraine to \"effectively defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" the statement said.",
      "Diplomatic sources told CBS that European leaders were relieved to hear President Trump offer a U.S. security guarantee, but described the idea as vague, and it's unclear how it would work.",
      "Mr. Trump said Zelenskyy would join him in the Oval Office on Monday afternoon to discuss the proposal.",
      "Zelenskyy has previously supported a ceasefire agreement to meet and discuss a peace agreement, but Moscow has rejected the idea. He has also criticized any talks that take place without Ukraine.",
      "\"If it all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Potentially, millions of people's lives will be saved.\"",
      "First Lady Melania Trump on Friday also\u00a0wrote a letter to Putin, saying he can \"singlehandedly restore\" children's laughter. Attorney General Pam Bondi posted the letter on social media Saturday.",
      "\"In protecting the innocence of these children, you will do more than serve Russia alone \u2014 you serve humanity itself,\" the letter said, in part. \"Such a bold idea transcends all human division, and you, Mr. Putin, are fit to implement this vision with a stroke of the pen today. It is time.\"",
      "Zelenskyy previously joined Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance in the Oval Office in March, but the gathering quickly descended into insults and chaos.",
      "Mr. Trump's meeting with Putin in Anchorage on Friday ended without a ceasefire or peace deal. In brief remarks after the leaders' nearly three-hour meeting, Putin alluded to \"unspecified agreements,\" but no further details were given. Mr. Trump said the meeting had been \"extremely productive.\" Neither leader mentioned an end to the fighting in Ukraine.",
      "The summit, which included a red carpet and military flyover, ended early without a planned luncheon between a broader group of officials. Mr. Trump returned to Washington, D.C. overnight.",
      "In a taped conversation with Fox News' Sean Hannity before he departed from Alaska, Mr. Trump said he believes Putin wants the war to end and that the nations are close to a deal, and added that it's \"really up to President Zelenskyy to get it done.\" He did not specify what an agreement might look like.",
      "Zelenskyy has said in the past that he will never agree to any formal Russian annexation of Ukrainian territory or abandon the country's bid for NATO membership. Meanwhile, Putin has been\u00a0unwavering in his demand to keep all Ukrainian territory that his forces occupy and prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, with the long-term goal of returning it to Moscow's sphere of influence.",
      "Diplomatic sources expressed concern to CBS that Mr. Trump had dropped his ceasefire demand and feared that the U.S. president and Putin may have come to an agreement on deal terms that they may try to force on Ukraine. The sources said that European leaders are trying to show unity with Zelenskyy to push back.",
      "Mr. Trump has called ending the war in Ukraine and Russia a top priority for his administration. He previously said he would end the conflict within 24 hours of taking office in January. He has criticized both Putin and Zelenskyy for failing to end the conflict. In recent months, he has appeared to become frustrated with Putin,\u00a0giving several ultimatums and criticizing the Russian leader for the violence against civilians in Ukraine amid ongoing conversations with the U.S.",
      "\"I always hang up, [and] say, 'Well, that was a nice phone call,'\" Mr. Trump said in July. \"And then missiles are launched into Kyiv or some other city, and I say, 'That's strange.' And after that happens three or four times, you say, the talk doesn't mean anything.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Friday that he would not enact economic sanctions he had\u00a0threatened against Russia if an agreement wasn't reached by early August. He said he \"may have to think about\" enacting the sanctions \"in two weeks or three weeks or something.\"",
      "There were strikes between the two countries overnight. Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defenses shot down 29 Ukrainian drones over Russia and the Sea of Azov, the Associated Press reported. Ukraine's air force said one ballistic missile and 85 Shahed drones were fired at parts of Sumy, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk and Chernihiv, according to the AP, and 61 of the drones were shot down.",
      "A Ukrainian soldier in Sumy told CBS News that \"things get even more terrifying on the front line\" when there are peace talks.",
      "\"They try and seize more territory,\" the soldier said.",

      "\"I couldn't believe I'd found something so quickly into my first ever excavation,\" Souza said in a press release. \"After I'd had to miss Birdoswald last year, it was amazing to discover something that hasn't been seen for more than a thousand years, I was really geeking out over it.\"",

Dere Street was still used after the fall of the Roman Empire and went on to become part of the modern-day A68 highway.",

    "summary": "Both President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered brief remarks, but took no questions, in Alaska.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin left Alaska Friday without a ceasefire agreement, although both men described the meeting as constructive.",
      "In what was billed by the White House as a press conference following their meeting, Mr. Trump and Putin took no questions, ignoring shouted ones from reporters.",
      "Putin spoke little of Ukraine, focusing on the bond and heritage between the U.S. and Russia, while Mr. Trump said many points were agreed to, and a few are left, regarding Ukraine. The U.S. president plans to call European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he said.",
      "Here is a transcript of what Mr. Trump and Putin said:",
      "PUTIN: Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, our negotiations have been held in a constructive atmosphere of mutual respect.",
      "We have very thorough negotiations that were quite useful. I would like to thank once again my American counterpart, for the proposal to travel out here to Alaska. It only makes sense that we've met here, because our countries, though separated by the oceans, are close neighbors. So when we've met, when I came out of the plane and I said, 'Good afternoon, dear neighbor. Very good to see you in good health and to see you alive.' I think that is very neighborly. I think that's some kind words that we can say to each other. We're separated by the strait of Bering, though, there are two islands only between the Russian Island and the U.S. Island. They're only four kilometers apart. We are close neighbors, and it's a fact.",
      "It's also important that Alaska has to do with our common heritage, common history between Russia and the U.S., and many positive events have to do with that territory. Still, there is tremendous cultural heritage, back from the Russian America, for example, Orthodox churches, and a lot of- more than 700 geographical names of Russian origin. During the Second World War, it was here in Alaska that was the origin of the legendary air bridge for the supply of military aircraft and other equipment under the Lend-Lease Program.",
      "It was a dangerous and treacherous route over the vast emptiness of ice. However, the pilots of both countries did everything to bring closer the victory. They risked their lives and they gave it all for the common victory. I was just in the city of Magadan in Russia. And there is a memorial there dedicated to the Russian, the U.S. pilots. And there are two flags, the U.S. flag and the Russian flag. And I know that here as well, there is such a memorial. There is a military burial place several kilometers away from here. The Soviet pilots are buried there who died during that dangerous mission. We're thankful to the citizens and the government of the U.S. for carefully taking care of their memory. I think that's very worthy and noble. We'll always remember other historical examples when our countries defeated common enemies together in the spirit of battle camaraderie and allyship that supported each other and facilitated each other. I am sure that this heritage will help us rebuild and foster mutually beneficial and equal ties at this new stage, even during the hardest conditions.",
      "It is known that there have been no summits between Russia and the U.S. for four years, and that's a long time. This time was very hard for bilateral relations, and let's be frank, they've fallen to the lowest point since the Cold War. I think that's not benefiting our countries and the world as a whole. It is apparent that sooner or later, we have to amend the situation to move on from the confrontation to dialog, and in this case, a personal meeting between the heads of state has been long overdue, naturally, under the condition of serious and painstaking work, and this work has been done.",
      "In general, me and President Trump have very good direct contact. We've spoken multiple times. We spoke frankly on the phone. And the special envoy of the president, Mr. Witkoff, traveled out to Russia several times. Our advisers and heads of foreign ministries kept in touch all the time, and we know fully well that one of the central issues was the situation around Ukraine.",
      "We see the strive of the administration and President Trump personally to help facilitate the resolution of the Ukrainian conflict, and his strive to get to the crux of the matter, to understand this history, is precious. As I've said, the situation in Ukraine has to do with fundamental threats to our security. Moreover, we've always considered the Ukrainian nation, and I've said it multiple times, a brotherly nation. How strange it may sound in these conditions. We have the same roots, and everything that's happening is a tragedy for us, and terrible wound. Therefore, the country is sincerely interested in putting an end to it.",
      "At the same time, we're convinced that in order to, to make the settlement lasting and long term, we need to eliminate all the primary roots, the primary causes of that conflict, and we've said it multiple times, to consider all legitimate concerns of Russia and to reinstate a just balance of security in Europe and in the world on the whole, and agree with President Trump, as he has said today, that naturally, the security of Ukraine should be ensured as well. Naturally, we are prepared to work on that.",
      "I would like to hope that the agreement that we've reached together will help us bring closer that goal and will pave the path towards peace in Ukraine. We expect that Kyiv and European capitals will perceive that constructively and that they won't throw a wrench in the works. They will not make any attempts to use some backroom dealings to conduct provocations to torpedo the nascent progress.",
      "Incidentally, when the new administration came to power, bilateral trade started to grow. It's still very symbolic. Still, we have a growth of 20%. As I've said, we have a lot of dimensions for joint work. It is clear that the U.S. and Russian investment and business cooperation has tremendous potential. Russia and the U.S. can offer each other so much in trade, digital, high tech and in space exploration. We see that arctic cooperation is also very possible, in our international context. For example, between the far east of Russia and the West Coast of the U.S.",
      "Overall, it's very important for our countries to turn the page to go back to cooperation. It is symbolic that, not far away from here, the border between Russia and the US, there was a so-called International Date Line. I think you can step over, literally, from yesterday into tomorrow, and I hope that's- will succeed in that, in the political sphere. I would like to thank President Trump for our joint work, for the well wishing and trustworthy tone of our conversation.",
      "It's important that both sides are result-oriented and we see that the president of the U.S. has a very clear idea of what he would like to achieve. He sincerely cares about the prosperity of his nation. Still, he understands that Russia has its own national interests.",
      "I expect that today's agreements will be the starting point, not only for the solution of the Ukrainian issue, but also will help us bring back business-like and pragmatic relations between Russia and the U.S.",
      "And in the end, I would like to add one more thing. I'd like to remind you that in 2022, during the last contact with the previous administration, I tried to convince my previous American colleague, it should not- the situation should not be brought to the point of no return, when it would come to hostilities and accept it quite directly back then, that is a big mistake. Today, when President Trump is saying that if he was the president back then, there would be no war, and I'm quite sure that it would indeed be so. I can confirm that. I think that overall, me and President Trump have built a very good business-like and trustworthy contact, and have every reason to believe that moving down this path, we can come and assume it better to the end of the conflict in Ukraine. Thank you. Thank you.",
      "TRUMP: Thank you very much, Mr. President, that was very profound, and I will say that I believe we had a very productive meeting. There were many, many points that we agreed on, most of them, I would say, a couple of big ones that we haven't quite gotten there, but we've made some headway. So there's no deal until there's a deal.",
      "I will call up NATO in a little while, I will call up the various people that I think are appropriate, and I'll of course, call up President Zelenskyy and tell him about today's meeting. It's ultimately up to them. They're going to have to agree with what Marco and Steve and some of the great people from the Trump administration who've come here, Scott and John Ratcliffe. Thank you very much. But we have some of our really great leaders. They've been doing a phenomenal job.",
      "We also have some tremendous Russian business representatives here. And I think, you know, everybody wants to deal with us. We've become the hottest country anywhere in the world in a very short period of time, and we look forward to that. We look forward to dealing- we're going to try and get this over with.",
      "We really made some great progress today. I've always had a fantastic relationship with President Putin, with Vladimir. We had many, many tough meetings, good meetings. We were interfered with by the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. It made it a little bit tougher to deal with, but he understood it. I think he's probably seen things like that during the course of his career. He's seen- he's seen it all. But we had to put up with the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. He knew it was a hoax, and I knew it was a hoax, but what was done was very criminal, but it made it harder for us to deal as a country, in terms of the business, and all of the things that would like to have dealt with, but we'll have a good chance when this is over.",
      "So just to put it very quickly, I'm going to start making a few phone calls and tell them what happened. But we had an extremely productive meeting, and many points were agreed to. There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there. We didn't get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there. I would like to thank President Putin and his entire team, whose faces who I know, in many cases, otherwise, other than that, whose- whose faces I get to see all the time in the newspapers, you're very- you're almost as famous as the boss, but especially this one right over here.",

      "A complete shutdown of the country's largest airline threatens to impact about 130,000 people a day.",
      "On Friday, the carrier said in a post on X that the \"wind down\" ahead of an impending strike had led to 294 flight cancellations, affecting 55,726 people.",

      "Nasr said this approach will help facilitate an orderly restart, \"which under the best circumstances will take a full week to complete.\"",
      "He said a first set of cancellations involving several dozen flights will impact long-haul overseas flights that were due to depart Thursday night.",
      "Late Thursday night, the carrier said on X that 34 flights had been canceled with almost 8,000 people impacted and 19 additional flights were canceled impacting more than 3,000 people \"due to unplanned crew book-offs.",
      "\"By tomorrow evening, we expect to have canceled flights affecting over 100,000 customers,\" Nasr said. \"By the time we get to 1 a.m. on Saturday morning, we will be completely grounded.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump visits Alaska Friday for a meeting with Russia's President Vladimir Putin \u2014 a discussion the White House has called a \"listening exercise.\"",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin sit down\u00a0in Alaska Friday for their high-stakes meeting about the war in Ukraine, the two leaders will bring differing ideas about ending the war that Russia began over three years ago. At the same time, Ukraine will be watching from the outside with European allies, hoping that Mr. Trump is protecting their interests.",
      "Their meetings are expected to be capped by a rare joint news conference with the two world leaders \u2014 the first such event of its kind since their 2018 summit in Helsinki, when Mr. Trump sided with Putin over his own intelligence agencies about Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
      "Expectations ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting",
      "Mr. Trump has tried to lower expectations going into the meeting, telling reporters the day before, \"all I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly.\" The subsequent meeting is an idea he has been floating this week, and he said it would also include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and perhaps other allies. The president raised the possibility that Zelenskyy could even join them in Alaska within a couple of days.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt referred to talks with Putin as \"a listening exercise\" for Mr. Trump and said his goal \"is to walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war.\"",
      "There are a number of questions going into the summit \u2014 chief among them is what Russia wants, and whether there's a way to reconcile its demands with what Ukraine wants. U.S. and Russian counterparts have been speaking, and Mr. Trump and Putin have had their own phone conversations.",
      "In March, Ukraine agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposal backed by the U.S., and months later, in May, when the Kremlin had still not accepted the terms, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. was trying to figure out if Russia was just \"tapping us along.\"",
      "By July, casualties were mounting in Ukraine as Russia stepped up its bombing campaign with hundreds of missile and drone strikes. Mr. Trump gave Putin a 50-day deadline to agree to a deal to end the war, and later shortened it to a 10-day deadline, threatening harsher tariffs and secondary sanctions. Dmitri Medvedev, the former president of Russia, responded by mocking Mr. Trump on X. \"Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war,\" he said, warning that it would not be \"between Russia and Ukraine, but with [Trump's] own country.\"",
      "But a day before the president's 10-day deadline expired \u2014 and after Putin had met with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff \u2014 the Kremlin announced that Putin and Mr. Trump would meet.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said there would be \"very severe consequences\" for Russia if it doesn't agree to end the war after Friday's meeting, though he declined to elaborate.",
      "Zelenskyy and European partners met virtually with Mr. Trump Wednesday, after which Zelenskyy wrote on X: \"Together with our partners, we supported the efforts of U.S. President Donald Trump to end the war, stop the killings, and achieve a just and lasting peace. I am grateful to the partners for our shared position: the path to peace.\"",
      "European leaders have been wary of the Trump-Putin meeting. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Wednesday of the summit, \"The most important thing is that Europe convinces Donald Trump that one can't trust Russia,\" adding, \"no one should think of recognizing Russia's right to demarcate borders for its neighbors.\" Zelenskyy won't be there to represent Ukraine's interests, and Mr. Trump has shown he's sometimes reluctant to criticize Putin.",
      "What Russia wants",
      "Experts say Putin has several objectives that won't be shared by the U.S. and Ukraine, and Mr. Trump must exercise caution.",
      "Putin would love to see the U.S. discontinue its financial support for Ukraine, said Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' Center on Military and Political Power.",
      "\"He wants to sideline the power of the United States so that he can more effectively prey on Ukraine,\" Bowman said, adding that at the same time, Putin will \"try to make the invaded look like the villain.\" While Mr. Trump aims to end the war Russia began, Putin is likely to try to seize on Mr. Trump's desire for peace.",
      "\"He's going to try to gain Trump's support for a bad peace,\" Bowman said, adding, \"Some peace agreements are bad because they lead to more war.\"",
      "John Lough, an associate fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program and the British think-tank Chatham House, predicted that Russia would \"put something in front of [Trump] that he will buy into and say, 'This is a way out of the war, and I like that, and I'm now prepared to go lean on the Ukrainians again and the Europeans and we'll get this over the line.'\"",
      "But Lough also believes that for Russia, the meeting is \"high risk.\"",
      "\"They may not get what they want, but they will at the very least be hoping that it guides the sort of next phase of the process of getting Ukraine to the table, and, I suppose, conducting the negotiations within a framework with which that comes,\" Lough said.",
      "Russia, Lough said, wants \"to get the framework of the peace agreement settled and then talk about a ceasefire, whereas Ukraine, its allies and, to a degree, President Trump has said, 'No, we start with a cease fire and then we build around that.'\"",
      "Daniel Fried, a former U.S. ambassador to Poland and former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, thinks Putin could try to insert a wedge between the U.S. and its allies.",
      "\"He wants to get out of this meeting without any cost and to slice away at the American position and maybe draw Trump out so that there's a gap between him and Zelenskyy, Trump and the Europeans,\" Fried said in a press call Wednesday.",
      "After Mr. Trump's more skeptical comments about Putin since the meeting was scheduled, Fried said, \"I am less worried about that than I was three days ago.\"",
      "Fried, who is now a fellow at the Atlantic Council, said that for Putin, a great outcome would be to \"dazzle\" Mr. Trump with a fake offer and to walk away with a big smile.",
      "At talks in June, the Kremlin presented a memorandum offering Ukraine two options for a 30-day ceasefire, which could give some insight into Putin's maximalist demands.",
      "The first would have required Ukraine to withdraw its forces from four regions illegally annexed by Russia, but which Russia never fully controlled: Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.",
      "The second option involved a number of conditions including a requirement that Ukraine wind down its military effort, cease receiving military aid, exclude any international military forces from its territory, lift martial law and then swiftly hold an election.",
      "As part of a peace treaty, Russia said it would require international recognition of Russian sovereignty over some Ukrainian territories it currently occupies, including Donbas and Crimea, and a pledge by Ukraine not to join any military alliances \u2014 an end to its efforts to join NATO \u2014 or allow any foreign militaries to operate or have bases in its territory.",
      "Russia also said it would want a cap on the strength of Ukraine's armed forces and for Russian to become an official language in Ukraine.",
      "Wendy Sherman, a former deputy secretary of state who has sat across from Putin before, said the Russian leader has no real interest in ending this war \u2014 he is simply \"buying time.\"",
      "\"This is President Putin's meeting,\" Sherman told CBS News Wednesday. \"He really is in charge of this meeting. He asked for it. The president, I think, was flattered to have this meeting. But Putin has no interest in ending this war. He is very smart, he is very cagey.\"",
      "What Ukraine wants",
      "Ukraine wants an end to Russia's assault and its full withdrawal from their territory.",
      "\"There must be an honest end to the war. And it depends on Russia,\" Zelenskyy said on social media earlier this month. \"It is Russia that must end the war it started.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said earlier this week that a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine would involve \"some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody. To the good, for the good of Ukraine. Good stuff, not bad stuff. Also, some bad stuff for both.\"",
      "That prompted a response from Zelenskyy, who said Ukraine would not give up any of its territory to Russia. Ukraine's constitution does not allow him to formally cede parts of the country.",
      "\"We will not reward Russia for what it has perpetrated,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media post last weekend. \"The answer to the Ukrainian territorial question already is in the Constitution of Ukraine. No one will deviate from this \u2014 and no one will be able to. Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier.\"",
      "Despite such statements, John Herbst, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center, said Zelenskyy has demonstrated he's willing to compromise.",
      "\"There is no doubt in my mind that Zelenskyy understands that territorial concessions may be required to get a durable peace,\" Herbst said.",
      "Another major concern is whether Putin, with his deep knowledge of Ukraine, could try to manipulate Mr. Trump, said former intelligence official Andrea Kendall-Taylor, who specialized in Russian affairs.",
      "Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova told CBS News that \"we all understand the reality on the ground, and we are ready to discuss how to end this war.\" She added, \"Let's stop the killings, and let's get to diplomacy.\"",
      "Ukraine and Russia's troubled history",
      "Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union before voting for independence in 1991.",
      "After the Soviet Union collapsed, the NATO alliance expanded eastward, adding former Soviet republics including Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, and it established a close partnership with Ukraine. In 2008, the alliance declared its intention for Ukraine to join NATO at some point in the future.",
      "Putin has said on numerous occasions that he views NATO's expansion as a threat to Russia. He has also said that he believes Ukraine to be part of Russia politically, culturally and linguistically.",
      "Some Ukrainians, primarily in eastern areas, are Russian-speaking and feel more closely aligned with Russia than the nation of Ukraine. But the majority of Ukrainians speak Ukrainian, feel a deep patriotic connection to Ukraine and have favored developing closer ties to Europe.",
      "Widespread protests erupted in Ukraine in 2014 when the pro-Russian president at the time refused to sign an EU association agreement. The public outrage forced him from office \u2014 an apparent victory for Ukrainians who favored closer ties to Europe. But shortly after, Russia annexed Crimea, a peninsula that was internationally recognized as part of Ukraine, and the Kremlin supported a pro-Russian separatist rebellion in Ukraine's east.",
      "In 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, attacking cities across the country, including the capital, Kyiv. Some expected Russia to quickly take over, but Ukrainians fought hard to defend themselves, Russian gains largely stagnated behind front lines in the east, and the war has raged on ever since.",

      "Days before the summit\u00a0between the leaders of Russia and the U.S. in Alaska, Moscow's forces breached Ukrainian lines in a series of infiltrations in the country's industrial heartland of Donetsk. Though the advances amount to only a limited success for Russia since it still needs to consolidate its gains before achieving a true breakthrough, analysts say, it's a potentially dangerous moment for Ukraine.",
      "President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will hold their high-stakes discussion about the war in Ukraine in Alaska on Friday. At the same time, Ukraine will be watching from the outside along with with European allies, hoping Mr. Trump is protecting their interests.",
      "Putin will likely try to persuade\u00a0Mr. Trump to pressure Ukraine by arguing the war is going badly for Kyiv, said Mykola Bieleskov, a senior analyst at CBA Initiatives Center.",
      "\"The key risk for Ukraine is that the Kremlin will try to turn certain local gains on the battlefield into strategic victories at the negotiating table,\" he said.",
      "Asked about Russia's continued military offensive as he headed to Alaska Friday morning, Mr. Trump said Putin is \"trying to set a stage. I mean, in his mind, that helps him make a better deal. It actually hurts him, but in his mind, that helps him make a better deal, if they can continue the killing.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that Kyiv still controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the Ukrainian leader categorically rejected.",
      "After years of fighting, Russia still does not fully control all of the Donetsk region, which it illegally annexed in 2022, along with the Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.",
      "Attention has been focused on Pokrovsk \u2014 a key highway and rail junction that once was home to about 60,000 and now is partially encircled \u2014 but Russian forces have been probing for weaknesses north of the city, according to battlefield analysis site DeepState. The forces found a gap east of the coal-mining town of Dobropillia and advanced about 6 miles.",
      "Zelenskyy noted its clear significance to the summit: \"To create a certain information backdrop ahead of Putin's meeting with Trump, especially in the American information space, suggesting that Russia is moving forward and Ukraine is losing ground.\"",
      "Russia trying to expand its gains",
      "Small groups of Russian troops are slipping past the first defensive line, hiding and trying to build up their forces, said Dmytro Trehubov, spokesman for Ukraine's \"Dnipro\" operational-strategic group.",
      "Ukraine's military has been repelling these attempts, he said, although DeepState said the situation has not been stabilized.",
      "Analysts described the breach near Dobropillia as a localized crisis that could escalate if the Russians are not neutralized and their main forces can widen the gap.",
      "The breach of the defensive line has seemed inevitable for months, according to a drone pilot in the area, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly. Moscow's forces have been exploiting the lack of Ukrainian infantry, a problem tied not only to the country's stalled mobilization but also to poor management, the pilot said.",
      "\"We pay with territory and lives to fix mistakes \u2014 and we can keep fixing mistakes only as long as we have even a scrap of land left,\" the pilot said.",
      "Ukrainian forces have tried to plug the gaps by extensive use of first-person-view drones \u2014 remotely piloted devices loaded with explosives that enable operators to see targets before striking.",
      "These FPVs have turned areas up to about 12 miles from the front into deadly zones on both sides of the line. But because the Russians attack with small groups, it's hard to counter with drones alone.",
      "\"We can't launch 100 FPVs at once,\" the pilot said, noting the drone operators would interfere with each other.",
      "With tactics and technology roughly equal on both sides, the Russians' superior manpower works to their advantage, said Bielieskov, the Kyiv-based analyst.",
      "\"They have no regard for human life. Very often, most of those they send are on a one-way mission,\" he said.",
      "Stopping the infiltrations and assaults by armored vehicles requires different defenses and leadership structures \u2014 changes that have yet to appear on Ukraine's side, he said.",
      "Ukraine seeking to stem the recent tide",
      "Ukraine's military said Thursday additional troops have been moved to affected areas, with battle-hardened forces like the Azov brigade being deployed to the sector. However, the Deepstate map doesn't show any changes in favor of the Ukrainian army.",
      "Michael Kofman, a military analyst for the Carnegie Endowment, said in a post on X that it was too early to assess if the front line was collapsing.",
      "Russia is focused on expanding the breach of the front line into a corridor to support its ground forces, Bieleskov said. The strategy avoids direct assaults on heavily fortified urban centers, instead pushing through open terrain where Ukraine's troop shortages and large settlements make defense harder.",
      "If successful, such a move could bypass Russia's need to storm Kostiantynivka \u2014 once a city of over 67,000 people and now significantly ruined and on the verge of falling. That would complicate defending the region's last big cities of Sloviansk, Kramatorsk and Druzhkivka, posing a serious challenge for Ukraine's military.",
      "Cmdr. Serhii Filimonov of the \"Da Vinci Wolves\" battalion of the 59th brigade warned that Kostiantynivka could fall without a fight if Russia severs supply routes.",
      "With few major roads, maintaining logistics for the large number of Ukrainian forces in the area would become \"extremely difficult,\" Filimonov said.",
      "Turning to the summit, Filimonov decried what he described as ongoing Russian killings and atrocities. \"And then the civilized world comes to them and says, 'Fine, let's make a deal.' That's not how it should be done,\" he said.",

Its center was some 520 miles east of the northern Leeward Islands and was moving west-northwest at 17 mph, the center said.",
      "\"Steady strengthening is expected during the next few days and Erin is forecast to become a hurricane later today and could become a major hurricane by this weekend,\" the center said. A major hurricane is defined as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph.",
      "Thursday evening, the center said Erin would likely become \"large and formidable.\"",
      "Erin doesn't appear to pose a direct threat to the U.S.",

      "The center of the storm is likely to move near or just north of the northern Leewards over the weekend, the hurricane center said.",
      "The northern Leewards are a string of islands stretching from the Virgin Islands to Guadeloupe, including Anguilla, St. Martin, St. Barts, Antigua and Barbuda, and several others.",
      "Drone video footage posted to\u00a0social media\u00a0showed the aftermath of flooding from the storm in Cabo Verde, a group of islands about 385 miles off the African coast. Local media reported at least eight people were killed, and officials declared a state of emergency as crews dealt with the damage.",
      "There's uncertainty about where Erin goes after this week, but most models show the storm pivoting to the northwest and north, CBS News Miami meteorologist Shane Hinton reported.",
      "Erin is the fifth named storm to develop during the Atlantic hurricane season, which started just over two months ago. Last week, Tropical Storm Dexter formed in the western Atlantic but didn't pose a threat to land. In early July, Tropical Storm Chantal made landfall on the Carolina coast, bringing deadly flooding to the region.",

      "Geneva \u2014 Negotiators working on a landmark treaty to address the global crisis of plastic pollution failed to reach an agreement during talks that extended into Friday in Geneva.",
      "Nations were meeting for an 11th day at the United Nations offices there to try to complete a treaty to end the plastic pollution crisis. They remain deadlocked over whether the treaty should reduce exponential growth of plastic production and put global, legally binding controls on toxic chemicals used to make plastics. Some 1,400 delegates took part in the talks.",
      "The negotiations at the U.N. hub were supposed to be the last round and produce the first legally binding treaty on plastic pollution, including in the oceans. But just like at the meeting in South Korea last year, they're leaving without a treaty.",
      "The biggest issue of the talks has been whether the treaty should impose caps on producing new plastic or focus instead on things like better design, recycling and reuse.",
      "Powerful oil- and gas-producing nations and the plastics industry oppose production limits. They want a treaty focused on better waste management and reuse.",
      "Every year, the world makes more than 400 million tons of new plastic, and that could grow by about 70% by 2040 without policy changes. About 100 countries want to limit production. Many have said it's also essential to address toxic chemicals used to make plastics.",

      "\"Yesterday, together with all partners, today in a bilateral format, we discussed expectations from the meeting in Alaska and possible prospects,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media post after the meeting. \"We also discussed in detail security guarantees that can make peace truly sustainable if the United States still manages to pressure Russia to stop the killings and engage in real meaningful diplomacy. It is important that we can all work together within a coalition of those willing to achieve effective formats for security work.\"",
      "Zelenskyy's trip to the British capital came a day after he took part in virtual meetings from Berlin with President Trump and the leaders of several European countries. Those leaders said Mr. Trump had assured them he would make it a priority to try to achieve a ceasefire in Ukraine during his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday in Anchorage.",
      "Putin was holding a meeting in Russia on Thursday with members of Russia's leadership to prepare for the Alaska meeting. As part of that preparatory meeting, he said he wanted to discuss the negotiation process with Ukraine and how it was going.",
      "Putin also said he planned \"to talk about the stage we are at with the current American administration, which, as everyone knows, is making, in my opinion, quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the fighting, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict.\"",
      "Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said Thursday that the Friday meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin in Alaska is expected to begin at around 11:30 a.m. local time on Friday. The main topic will be the war in Ukraine, but there will also be discussions about economic cooperation between Washington and Moscow.",
      "He said the meeting will take place at Elmendorf-Richardson Air Force Base, and that there will first be a one-on-one meeting between the two leaders before their delegations join.",
      "Mr. Trump and Putin will say a few words at the start of the meeting, Ushakov said, and they will hold a joint press conference afterward.",
      "Ushakov said each delegation will have five members. For Russia, those will be Ushakov, as well as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund Kirill Dmitriev, and Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov.",
      "Alaska summit \"hugely important\"",
      "Both Zelenskyy and the Europeans have worried the bilateral U.S.-Russia summit would leave them and their interests sidelined, and that any conclusions reached could favor Moscow and leave Ukraine and Europe's future security in jeopardy.",
      "Yet some of those leaders, like German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron, praised Wednesday's video conference with Mr. Trump as constructive.",
      "Speaking after the meetings to reporters, Mr. Trump warned of \"very severe consequences\" for Russia if Putin does not agree to stop the war against Ukraine after Friday's meeting.",
      "Starmer on Wednesday said the Alaska summit would be \"hugely important,\" and could be a \"viable\" path to a ceasefire in Ukraine. But he also alluded to European concerns that Mr. Trump may strike a deal that forces Ukraine to cede territory to Russia, and warned that Western allies must be prepared to step up pressure on Russia if necessary.",
      "During a call Wednesday among leaders of countries involved in the \"coalition of the willing\" \u2014 those who are prepared to help police any future peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv \u2014 Starmer stressed that any deal reached on bringing the fighting to an end must protect the \"territorial integrity\" of Ukraine.",
      "\"International borders cannot be, and must not be changed by force,'' he said. \"Any talk about borders, diplomacy, ceasefire has to sit alongside a robust and credible security guarantee to ensure that any peace, if there is peace, is lasting peace and Ukraine can defend its territorial integrity as part of any deal.\"",
      "Kyiv has long insisted that safeguards against future Russian attacks provided by its Western allies would be a precondition for achieving a durable end to the fighting in Ukraine. Yet many Western governments have been hesitant to commit to engaging their military personnel.",
      "Countries in the \"coalition of the willing,\" which include France and the U.K., have been trying for months to secure U.S. security backing should it be required. Following Wednesday's virtual meetings, Macron said Mr. Trump told the assembled leaders that while the NATO military alliance must not be part of future security guarantees, the U.S. leader agreed that \"the United States and all the parties involved should take part.\"",
      "\"It's a very important clarification that we have received,\" Macron said.",
      "European Council President Antonio Costa also welcomed \"the readiness of the United States to share with Europe the efforts to reinforce security conditions once we obtain a durable and just peace for Ukraine.\"",
      "\"I don't see any changes coming\"",
      "With another high-level meeting on their country's future on the horizon, some Ukrainians expressed skepticism that any breakthroughs would be achieved during Friday's U.S.-Russia summit.",
      "Oleksandra Kozlova, 39, a department head at a digital agency in Kyiv, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that she believes Ukrainians \"have already lost hope\" that meaningful progress can be made on ending the 3 1/2-year-old war.",
      "\"I don't think this round will be decisive,\" she said. \"There have already been enough meetings and negotiations promising us, ordinary people, that something will be resolved, that things will get better, that the war will end. Unfortunately, this has not happened, so personally I don't see any changes coming.\"",
      "Anton Vyshniak, a car salesman in Kyiv, said Ukraine's priority now should be saving the lives of its military servicepeople, even at the expense of making territorial concessions.",
      "\"At the moment, the most important thing is to preserve the lives of male and female military personnel. After all, there are not many human resources left,\" he said. \"Borders are borders, but human lives are priceless. Therefore, some principles can be disregarded here.\"",

      "Development in E1, an open tract of land east of Jerusalem, has been under consideration for more than two decades, but was frozen due to U.S. pressure during previous administrations. On Thursday, Smotrich praised President Trump and U.S. ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee as \"true friends of Israel as we have never had before.\"",
      "The E1 plan hasn't yet received its final approval, which is expected next week. The plan includes around 3,500 apartments to expand the settlement of Maale Adumim, Smotrich said. While some bureaucratic steps remain, if the process moves quickly, infrastructure work could begin in the next few months and construction of homes could start in around a year.",
      "Rights groups swiftly condemned the plan. Peace Now called it \"deadly for the future of Israel and for any chance of achieving a peaceful two-state solution\" that is \"guaranteeing many more years of bloodshed.\"",

      "\"U.S. President Trump will start discussions with President Putin in Alaska about bringing the war to an end, and important decisions could be reached,\" Merz, standing alongside Zelenskyy, told journalists in a press conference after meeting with Mr. Trump. \"We as Europeans are doing everything we can to help set the agenda for that meeting. We're hoping that Donald Trump has success in that meeting in Anchorage.\"",
      "Merz said that he and Zelenskyy had spoken with Mr. Trump together.",
      "\"In Alaska, security interests of Europe and Ukraine must be protected. That is part of what we discussed with President Trump. We were together on the conditions of this meeting and the goals of this meeting on Friday,\" Merz said.",
      "The German leader said Ukraine would need a seat at the table if peace was to be reached in Ukraine, and that he told Mr. Trump he would speak to him after his Alaska meeting with Putin.",
      "\"We want to make sure that the right chronology happens: that there is a ceasefire and that there is an agreement that is discussed after that,\" he said. \"A legal recognition of Russian ownership of this territory cannot happen. There have to be robust security guarantees. The sovereignty of Ukraine has to be respected. Negotiations have to be part of a larger transatlantic strategy, and has to be part of necessary pressure on Russia.\"",
      "Merz added, \"If there is no movement on the Russian side, we and the U.S. have to put more pressure on Russia. President Trump knows this position and largely agrees with it, and we had a good conversation with each other.\"",
      "\"Everything ... needs to be discussed with Ukraine\"",

      "\"President Trump has supported us today, and the U.S. is ready to support us,\" he said.",

      "Earlier on Wednesday, Merz pledged to help Ukraine develop its own long-range missile systems that would be free of any Western-imposed limitations on their use and targets as the Kyiv government fights to repel Russia's invasion.",

      "Mr. Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace. Mr. Trump said that following Friday's summit, a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders could be arranged, or that it could also be a meeting with \"Putin and Zelenskyy and me.\"",
      "Zelenskyy warned that \"talks about us, without us, will not work.\"",
      "Ukrainian and European concerns",
      "The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia's energy might to try to intimidate the European Union, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them.",
      "The overarching fear of many European countries is that Putin will set his sights on one of them next if he wins in Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that it still controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the leader categorically rejected.",
      "Zelenskyy reiterated that Ukraine would not give up any territory it controls, saying that would be unconstitutional and would serve only as a springboard for a future Russian invasion.",
      "He said diplomatic discussions led by the U.S. focusing on ending the war have not addressed key Ukrainian demands, including security guarantees to prevent future Russian aggression and including Europe in negotiations and rehabilitate Putin.",
      "General Sir Richard Shirreff, former NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe, told CBS News partner network BBC News he didn't believe Friday's meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin could lead to an end of the war between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "\"Russia has to recognize and Putin has to recognize that Zelenskyy is president of Ukraine, recognize the Ukrainian constitution and Ukraine's right to exist as a sovereign state. And that is only going to happen ... when Russia gets a really bloody nose. And for that to happen, we need to see some proper strategic thinking from NATO - from the president of the United States - that recognizes that this is about transatlantic security.\"",
      "Shirreff said an end to the war would require Ukraine becoming a member of NATO.",
      "\"Even if Putin moves on or falls under a bus, we're probably likely to get somebody in place just as hard-line, just as ultra-nationalistic, and just as determined to press on (with Russia's takeover of Ukraine),\" Shirreff said. \"So I think we have to recognize that European security means deterrence - a band of deterrent steel, as I've said many times - from the Baltic to the Black Sea, with Ukraine as a NATO member. Now, however far-fetched that may seem from where we are at the moment, that's the reality. ... Any sort of compromise now, any so-called freezing of conflict, is only going to continue to postpone it.\"",
      "Trump-Putin summit to take place on Alaskan military base",
      "The summit between Mr. Trump and Putin will be the first in-person meeting between Putin and a sitting U.S. president since Russia invaded Ukraine more than three years ago.",
      "The meeting will take place at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, on the northern edge of Anchorage, a senior White House official told CBS News Tuesday. Given that it is peak tourist season in Alaska, there were few viable options to host the talks. Possible venues for the high-stakes meeting also needed to meet security requirements.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Tuesday that the mechanics of the meeting were \"still being ironed out.\"",
      "Leavitt described the meeting as \"a listening exercise for the president.\"",
      "\"Only one party that's involved in this war is going to be present, and so this is for the president to go and to get, again, a more firm and better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end,\" Leavitt said.",
      "\"Trump has obviously not been listening at all because it's very clear \u2014 and Putin continues to make it clear \u2014 what his demands are, and he's not stepped back one iota from his maximalist demands,\" former NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe Shirreff said. \"And those, as we've heard, are simply impossible for Ukraine to accept without capitulation.\"",
      "Asked Wednesday at the Kennedy Center if he believes he can convince Putin to stop targeting Ukrainian civilians, Mr. Trump said no.",
      "\"Well, I'll tell you what,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"I've had that conversation with him. I've had a lot of good conversations with him. Then I go home and I see that a rocket hit a nursing home or a rocket hit an apartment building and people are laying dead in the streets. So I guess the answer to that is no, because I've had this conversation.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters in the White House briefing room Monday, Mr. Trump expressed optimism that his meeting with Putin will be \"constructive,\" and said that he is planning to establish an in-person meeting involving Putin and Zelenskyy.",

      "\"Historically, ads for jeans have been provocative,\" he noted. \"Look back to Calvin Klein\u2019s advertising campaign in the early 1980s featuring Brooke Shields; there was a lot of criticism about how a 15-year-old girl was being portrayed. The ads turned out to have a positive result for both Klein and Shields, and in many ways put the actress/model on the map.\"",
      "Honig continued, \"As far as the Sweeney ads being too sexual or aimed at \u2018male gazing,\u2019 I would point to the highly successful Pepsi ad campaign with Cindy Crawford, which was recently rebooted. Gloria Vanderbilt\u2019s advertising campaign was all about her name being on a woman\u2019s backside.\"",
      "\"The bottom line here is that American Eagle decided to push the envelope in much the same way Klein and Vanderbilt did,\" he added. \"Like it or not, the campaign is sparking discussion and getting a lot of notice, which is likely what they set out to do.\"",

      "In a $50 million lawsuit filed Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court, Priscilla\u2019s former business partners, Brigitte Kruse and Kevin Fialko, alleged the 80-year-old widow of Elvis Presley made a calculated move in the final hours of Lisa Marie's life, accusing her of allegedly pulling her daughter off life support against her wishes.",
      "Meanwhile, Priscilla\u2019s high-profile attorney, Marty Singer, blasted the lawsuit as \"shameful\" and \"salacious,\" and told Fox News Digital the accusations are \"malicious character assassination.\"",

      "According to a lawsuit obtained by Fox News Digital, Priscilla acted immediately after Lisa Marie went into cardiac arrest on Jan. 12, 2023.",
      "\"Within just over twenty-four hours, Lisa suffered cardiac arrest on Thursday, January 12th and she was rushed to West Hills Hospital,\" the complaint alleges.But instead of honoring Lisa Marie\u2019s medical direction to \"prolong her life,\" the lawsuit claimed Priscilla saw a window to regain control of the Presley estate, especially with Lisa Marie reportedly in the process of removing her as trustee of a multimillion-dollar trust.",
      "\"Priscilla rushed to West Hills Hospital, and despite Lisa\u2019s clear directive to \u2018prolong her life,\u2019 Priscilla pulled the plug within hours of Lisa being admitted,\" the lawsuit stated, adding that Riley Keough, Lisa Marie\u2019s daughter and heir, had not yet arrived.",
      "The lawsuit further alleged that Priscilla wasted no time taking command of the media response. According to the filing, she pressured Kruse to issue a carefully worded statement soon after Lisa Marie's passing \u2013 Kruse and Fialko claim the rapid-fire statement was part of a calculated effort to recast Presley as the grieving family figurehead and consolidate power amid looming estate battles.",

      "This allegation is one of several explosive claims in the $50 million lawsuit that accuses Priscilla of fraud, breach of contract and reputation destruction, including allegedly exploiting her daughter\u2019s death for personal and financial gain.",
      "Kruse and Fialko claimed Priscilla had sold the rights to her own name, image and likeness (NIL) two decades ago \u2013 and \"forgot\" to mention it.",
      "Their lawyer, Jordan Matthews, said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital that the \"evidence will establish that the real victims here are my clients, who invested millions and years of hard work into revitalizing Priscilla Presley\u2019s brand, only to be betrayed and falsely accused once the money was on the table and every personal and business issue had been resolved.\"",
      "LISA MARIE PRESLEY \u2018HAD A SENSE\u2019 ELVIS WOULD DIE THE NIGHT BEFORE HIS PASSING, DAUGHTER RILEY KEOUGH SAYS",
      "Kruse and Fialko alleged that Priscilla first reached out to them in 2021 while drowning in debt \u2013 owing nearly $700,000 in taxes and reportedly behind on car payments. They claimed they spent thousands of hours \u2013 and millions in funding \u2013 revitalizing her brand, brokering deals and restructuring her finances.",

      "The lawsuit stated that when confronted about the previous agreement, Priscilla repeatedly denied making it and later said she had forgotten about it when confronted with evidence of it.",
      "Kruse and Fialko also said they negotiated a $2.4 million payout for Priscilla in a high-stakes legal standoff with granddaughter Keough over the estate. They also claimed Priscilla cut them off, trashed their reputations and filed a retaliatory elder abuse lawsuit.",

The complaint alleges that Priscilla's relationship with her daughter was in ruins for decades and long before Kruse and Fialko were involved.\"",
      "He added, \"Kruse and Fialko invested seven figures into rebuilding Priscilla's brand, stabilizing her finances, settling her lawsuits, cleaning up numerous private family ordeals,\u00a0and attempting to help Priscilla repair her relationship with her daughter.

      "\"But really what it is is a record of crimes that are reported to the police and then those of those crimes that get reported to the FBI. It's not a full record of all violent crimes, and this is a problem. And the FBI is very explicit about this when they present the data in their formal report every year, where they say, \u2018Do not directly compare the data from year to year because there are differences in how frequently people report crimes and how frequently the FBI gets that data from the local police agencies.\u2019\"",
      "While many prominent Democrats, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, have insisted violent crime is at a 30-year low in the city, Agresti told Fox News Digital the \"best way to understand the state of violent crime\" in any jurisdiction is to look at the number of murders because it is a violent crime that is difficult to \"sweep under the rug\" because it \"produces a dead body.\"",

      "Fox News Digital spoke to Just Facts President Jim Agresti about the crime situation in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 (Getty)",
      "\"When we look at the murder data for DC, we see that it is not a situation that is lower now than it's been in the last 30 years. Quite the opposite,\" Agresti explained. \"It is currently 83% higher than it was at its low point a dozen years ago. So, there is a serious problem with serious crime, violent crime in D.C., and the city now, the nation's capital, has a murder rate that is five times the U.S. average.\"",
      "The chances of a person facing a violent crime in\u00a0Washington, D.C., have dropped in recent years, but the possibility of dying during such a crime has skyrocketed, data shows, Fox News Digital\u00a0reported on Wednesday.",
      "Lethality in D.C. jumped by a whopping 341% when compared to 2012 data, the study found, reporting that there were 13 homicides per 1,000 serious violent crimes in 2012 and 57 homicides per 1,000 serious violent crimes in 2024.",
      "Agresti explained that while many people operate with the belief that crime spiked across the country during and because of COVID, the issue actually began getting worse specifically when the Black Lives Matter rioting erupted.",

      "\"That makes a lot of sense,\" Agresti said. \"Police were vilified. They pulled back out of fear of being hurt. People were talking about defunding the police, and there was overall mayhem in this country. So, that rise, by the way, that people blame on COVID actually didn't start with COVID, and it didn't appear in other countries. It happened here where we had these BLM riots.\"",
      "Agresti told Fox News Digital there is a \"clear connection\" between crime in the United States and the \"Defund the Police\" movement and that most people don\u2019t grasp the \"full extent\" of the crime problem in this country.",
      "\"We had roughly 17,000 murders last year,\" Agresti explained. \"Imagine if all of them made national news. At the current rate of murders in this county, roughly one in every 230 people in the United States will have their lives cut short by being murdered. That statistic is so unbelievable.\"",
      "In addition to the \"staggering\"\u00a0facts about murder, Agresti said\u00a0data compiled by Just Facts shows one in 10 women in the United States are raped in the course of their lives.",
      "\"Think about the horror of that, and beyond all this pain, suffering, death, there's also a financial cost to crime,\" Agresti said. \"It's been quantified in a 2021 academic paper, and, bottom line, crime in all of its forms, pain, death, suffering, financial loss, activities we take to prevent crime, they amount to a cost on our US economy of roughly $40,000 per U.S. household.\"",
      "Questions have also been raised about local crime stats from D.C. showing crime is down so far this year, with many pointing to news reports that a D.C. police commander was recently suspended for allegedly altering crime data.",
      "Agresti said anyone can \"cherry-pick\" crime statistics to promote a specific agenda but that it is important to also realize that many crimes also go unreported due to various factors, including animosity toward police or the belief that calling the police won\u2019t yield results.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"The vast majority of crime goes unreported, and another phenomenon that's really, really disturbing is the amount of crimes that are solved,\" Agresti said. \"It used to be in this country, in 1960, that 92% of all murders are solved. In 2023, that figure was down to 58%, meaning that 40-plus percent of people who committed murders got away with it, and they're out there to commit them again.\"",
      "As of Thursday, 800 Trump-authorized National Guard troops were in Washington, D.C., supporting other federal law enforcement agencies with \"monument security, community safety patrols, protecting federal facilities and officers, traffic control posts and area beautification,\" according to the State Department.",
      "President Donald Trump gestures in the State Dining Room of the White House Aug. 8, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)",
      "Trump's move to crack down on crime in the capital, which the White House says is happening at levels that dwarf capitals in other far more impoverished countries across the world, has sparked protests led by liberal activists and outrage from some elected Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.",
      "\"When politicians are saying, 'We don't have to worry about this, it's the lowest crime rate in 30 years,' they are abdicating their responsibility,\" Agresti told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The Declaration of Independence said that governments are instituted to protect the rights of people, including their life, their liberty and the pursuit of happiness. What we have right now is many politicians and governments who are doing an extremely poor job of that, and the pain and suffering is unbelievable. It's just so broad and so horrible.\"",

      "Google has confirmed that a hacking group known as ShinyHunters stole customer data from one of its internal Salesforce databases used to manage business client relationships. The company disclosed the breach in a blog post published in early August, noting that the stolen data included\u00a0\"basic and largely publicly available business information, such as business names and contact details.\"",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The breach was carried out by ShinyHunters, a well-known cybercriminal group formally tracked as UNC6040. The group has recently been linked to a string of high-profile incidents involving companies such as AT&T, Ticketmaster, Allianz Life and Pandora. In this case, the attackers targeted Google's corporate Salesforce system, which the company uses to store contact information and notes about small and medium-sized businesses.",

Vishing isn't new, but its growing success shows just how fragile even well-defended systems can be when human error is involved.",

      "Stronger roads and a cleaner planet thanks to cigarette butt recycling",
      "Recycled cigarette butts make asphalt stronger, more flexible and longer-lasting. The fibers released during mixing act as micro reinforcement, improving fatigue resistance and helping roads withstand heavy traffic and temperature changes. The wax in the pellets lowers the temperature needed to mix asphalt, reducing both energy use and emissions during production. Beyond performance, this method gives cigarette waste a second life. By repurposing billions of discarded filters, cities can reduce litter and pollution while building more sustainable infrastructure.",

Once you request a summary, the AI can be tricked into presenting fake security alerts or urgent instructions that appear to come from Google.",

      "Just because a summary appears in Gmail or Docs does not mean it is automatically safe. Treat AI-generated suggestions, alerts or links with the same caution you would any unsolicited message. Always verify critical information, such as security alerts or phone numbers, through official sources.",
      "If an email seems unusual, especially if it is unexpected or from someone you do not recognize, avoid using the AI summary feature. Instead, read the full email as it was originally written. This lowers the chance of falling for misleading summaries.",
      "Watch for emails or messages that create a sense of urgency, ask you to verify account details or provide unexpected links or contact information, even if they appear trustworthy or come from familiar sources. Attackers can use AI to craft realistic-looking alerts or requests for sensitive information, sometimes concealed within automatically generated summaries. So, always pause and scrutinize suspicious prompts before responding.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "Ensure that Google Workspace and your browser are always running the latest version. Google regularly releases security updates that help prevent newer types of attacks. Also, avoid using unofficial extensions that have access to your Gmail or Docs.",
      "AI-driven scams like the Gemini summary attack don't happen in a vacuum. They often begin with stolen personal information. That data might come from past breaches, public records or details you've unknowingly shared online. A data removal service can help by continuously scanning and requesting the removal of your information from data broker sites. While no service can wipe everything, reducing your digital footprint makes it harder for attackers to personalize phishing attempts or link you to known breach data.

      "At Woohoo, your waiter might be human, but the creative mind behind your dish is not. That job belongs to Chef Aiman, a large language model trained on food science, global culinary traditions and molecular gastronomy. The name Aiman blends \"AI\" and \"man,\" reflecting the partnership between technology and human creativity. Aiman doesn't taste or smell. Instead, it analyzes ingredients by texture, acidity, umami and dozens of other variables to invent dishes that push boundaries.",

      "Instead of baking in a GPS system, Skechers took a simpler route. The model, officially called Skechers GO RUN Elevate 2.0 - Find My Skechers, features a screw-secured compartment beneath the insole. That's where you can insert your own\u00a0Apple AirTag. Once inside, the AirTag becomes invisible and unnoticeable to the child wearing the shoes. From there, all tracking happens through Apple's Find My app, which works on any iPhone. It updates the tag's location as long as it remains near an Apple device. Since AirTags were made to track objects like keys and bags, slipping one into a shoe was just a matter of time.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The pros: Clever design and smart functionality",
      "Skechers designed these shoes with both practicality and peace of mind in mind. They feature an adaptive closure system with stretch laces and an adjustable instep strap, making it easy for kids to slip them on and off without help. Comfort isn't an afterthought either. Each pair includes a Skechers Air-Cooled Goga Mat insole with high-rebound cushioning, giving growing feet the support they need throughout the day. Plus, they're machine washable, which saves parents time and effort. The standout feature is the hidden AirTag-compatible compartment tucked beneath the heel of the insole. It comes with a screw-tight cover that keeps the tracker secure and discreet. There's no external AirTag branding, so the shoes look like any regular pair of Skechers. With a breathable mesh and synthetic upper, durable rubber outsole, and 1 1/4-inch heel height, the design delivers both style and function. They're available in sizes for boys and girls, and even without an AirTag, they work perfectly as everyday sneakers.",
      "Skechers GO RUN Elevate 2.0 - Find My Skechers. (Skechers)",

      "Still, parents should be aware: these are not GPS shoes with real-time, all-the-time tracking.\u00a0AirTags\u00a0rely on nearby Apple devices to update their location. If the tag moves out of range or its battery dies, the updates stop. Another issue? Anyone who has access to your Apple account can view the tag's location. While you can manage and revoke access in your iPhone settings, this means privacy depends on your own security habits. And yes, it's possible for someone to remove the battery and disable an AirTag in seconds. That means this shoe-tracking feature won't replace supervision; it's simply a backup.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Skechers GO RUN Elevate 2.0 - Find My Skechers. (Skechers)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you're a parent looking for a low-cost way to track where your child's shoes are, this is a creative solution. It's less intrusive than giving them a phone and more flexible than a built-in GPS system. You control the tracker, you install the battery, and you decide who gets access. But don't confuse shoe tracking with child safety. These trainers can offer location updates, but they can't think, speak, or call for help. Think of them as one extra tool, not your only one.",

      "There are clear differences in how Putin \u2013 who has openly chastised Gorbachev and referred to the collapse of the Soviet Union as the \"greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century\" in a 2005 speech \u2013 operates in comparison to his Soviet predecessor.",
      "Though some have argued there are similarities in how Trump works as a statesman, in comparison to Reagan.",

      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska \u2014 President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin emerged from a nearly three-hour meeting on the Ukraine war and struck a cordial tone in brief public statements, but left without announcing a ceasefire or peace agreement.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no deal until there\u2019s a deal,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The White House had said there would be a news conference after the closed-door meeting, but both men walked offstage after 12 minutes without taking questions from the scores of American and Russian reporters in attendance.",
      "Trump hosted the summit at a military base in Alaska in an audacious bid to broker a peace deal and stop Russia\u2019s three-year war with Ukraine and its ever-rising body count. It was not immediately clear what was agreed upon in the talks. Trump said the two sides had made \u201csome great progress,\u201d but offered no specifics.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there,\u201d Trump said.",
      "To Putin, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ll probably see you again very soon.\u201d",
      "\u201cNext time in Moscow,\u201d Putin replied.",
      "Trump appeared buoyant at the start of the summit, deflated by the end.",
      "He met Putin on the tarmac of Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, applauding as his Russian counterpart approached. The leaders warmly clasped hands and then walked side by side along a red carpet to Trump\u2019s limousine for the short drive to the closed-door meeting. They rode alone with no aides present. In a military flourish, a B-2 bomber and a quartet of F-35 jets took part in a flyover marking the start of the summit.",
      "Hours later, Trump seemed subdued and unsmiling upon taking the stage for the joint appearance. He perked up, it seemed, when Putin said the war with Ukraine wouldn\u2019t have happened had Trump been in office. Trump often makes the same point, blaming former President Joe Biden for the hostilities. He nodded and looked over at Putin when the Russian leader backed up his claim.",
      "Follow along for live updates.",
      "Trump was joined in the summit meeting by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and a special U.S. envoy, Steve Witkoff \u2014 a departure from what was originally described as a one-on-one between the two leaders.",
      "Putin was accompanied at the meeting by two Russian officials, foreign affairs aide Yuri Ushakov and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Ahead of the summit, Lavrov was spotted in Alaska wearing a shirt with the Cyrillic letters \u201cCCCP,\u201d a cheeky reference to the USSR. Before declaring its independence in 1991, Ukraine was part of the old Soviet empire.",
      "Trump spent the run-up to the summit tempering expectations, casting the sit-down as a prelude to an as-yet-unscheduled meeting that would include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "\u201cI want to see a ceasefire rapidly,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday en route to Alaska. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be today, but I\u2019m not going to be happy if it\u2019s not today. Everyone said it can\u2019t be today, but I\u2019m just saying I want the killing to stop.\u201d",
      "Normally bullish about his negotiating skills, Trump told Fox News Radio earlier in the week that the odds are 1 in 4 that his sit-down with Putin would be a failure. His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, likened the summit to a \u201clistening exercise\u201d given that Zelenskyy wouldn\u2019t be present.",
      "\u201cThe president is realistic that this is likely a multistep process and he\u2019s ready and positive about this step forward,\u201d a senior Trump administration official told NBC News on Friday morning, when asked about the president\u2019s mindset.",
      "Still, the face-to-face meeting between the two leaders loomed as one of the few hopeful moments in a grinding conflict that started in February 2022 when Russia sent tanks rolling across the border into Ukraine with the goal of swallowing up its democratic neighbor.",
      "Trump said as recently as Thursday that he would call Zelenskyy to discuss the outcome of his meeting with Putin if it went \u201cwell.\u201d It is unclear if that call has happened.",
      "Trump has pushed for the two nations to end the fighting as he makes an increasingly public campaign to win the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "But if the bombing continues and Russia seizes more Ukrainian territory, Trump will have risked giving legitimacy to a Russian leader who has become an international pariah.",
      "\u201cMy worry is that the photo-op in and of itself essentially legitimizes war crimes, telegraphs to other autocrats or evil men around the world that they can get away with murdering civilians and still get a photo-op with the president of the United States,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee, said Friday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d",
      "Russia\u2019s early attempt to conquer Ukraine sputtered and the conflict has since devolved into a war of attrition, with casualties totaling about 1.5 million. At present, Putin holds a slight edge on the battlefield.",
      "Though nothing was announced Friday, Trump still enjoys considerable leverage over both combatants. If he chooses, he could slap stiffer sanctions on countries such as India that buy oil from Russia. Or he could withhold much-needed money and military hardware that have kept Ukraine in the fight against its bigger adversary. For those reasons alone, the warring countries need to take seriously Trump\u2019s insistence that the conflict end.",
      "\u201cPutin is clearly in a weaker position,\u201d William Taylor, who was  U.S. ambassador to Ukraine under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said in an interview. \u201cThis invasion of Ukraine has turned out to be a disaster for him. Trump has the cards this time.\u201d",
      "The summit location was itself rich in symbolism. For one, the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin stemming from his conduct in the war, meaning he could have been apprehended if the site had been in a host of other nations. (The U.S. is not a signatory to the court.)",
      "What\u2019s more, Alaska used to belong to Putin\u2019s country, a fact that Russian commentators and political elite had seized on as a positive signal for the talks. The U.S. purchased the territory in 1867 for $7.2 million, an acquisition that, ironically, strengthened America\u2019s military position on the Pacific rim in a rivalry with Russia that has waxed and waned for decades.",
      "\u201cPutin has agreed to come to Trump, to come to America,\u201d Robert O\u2019Brien, White House national security adviser in Trump\u2019s first term, said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s critical because Alaska is a former Russian colony and Putin\u2019s whole policy is about recovering what he believes to be former Russian Empire territory. Putin wants all of Russia\u2019s territory back and yet he\u2019s coming to a place that was a former Russian colony to meet with the president of the United States \u2014 when he has no chance of getting Alaska back.\u201d",
      "A subplot of the meeting was the personal chemistry between the American and Russian presidents. Trump took office in 2017 wanting a good relationship with Putin, who has become an outcast over his yearslong assault on Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty. Upon his return to the White House in January, Trump at one point suggested he had a certain kinship with Putin over investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential race.",
      "\u201cLet me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,\u201d Trump said during a televised meeting with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office in February. During his appearance with Putin on Friday, he again made reference to the Russia \u201choax.\u201d",
      "Recently, Trump has voiced irritation with Putin over continued Russian attacks on Ukraine. Though Putin has sounded accommodating in phone calls, Trump has said, Russia hasn\u2019t let up its military assault.",
      "\u201cWe get a lot of bulls--- thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth,\u201d Trump said last month. \u201cHe\u2019s very nice all of the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.\u201d",
      "As a candidate in 2024, Trump was confident he could end the war quickly. That early optimism has given way to a rueful recognition that the problem is tougher than he anticipated.",
      "A central point of contention is land. Zelenskyy insisted last week that Ukraine would not cede territory to Russia.",
      "\u201cUkrainians will not give their land to the occupier,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has suggested that some mutual \u201cswapping\u201d of territories would be part of a ceasefire. In his remarks Friday on Air Force One, he said that he would discuss divisions of territory in his meeting with Putin, though he added, \u201cI\u2019ve got to let Ukraine make that decision.\u201d",
      "In a post on X Friday morning, Zelenskyy wrote in English: \u201cThe key thing is that this meeting should open up a real path toward a just peace and a substantive discussion between leaders in a trilateral format \u2014 Ukraine, the United States, and the Russian side. It is time to end the war, and the necessary steps must be taken by Russia. We are counting on America. We are ready, as always, to work as productively as possible.\u201d",
      "Trump was scheduled to have a working lunch with Putin and a number of top U.S. officials, but after the talks, the two presidents headed directly to the joint appearance instead.",
      "Once a TV showman, Trump seemed well aware of the drama and intrigue surrounding a summit that drew worldwide attention.",
      "\u201cHigh stakes!!!\u201d he wrote in all-caps on his Truth Social platform before departing for Alaska.",
      "By day\u2019s end, the stakes remained high, but a breakthrough seemed all the more elusive."

    "summary": "Dubai chocolate hits Texas, Minnesota, Wisconsin and more state fairs",
    "story": [
      "At the upcoming State Fair of Texas, confectioner Stephen El Gidi will offer up his own Dubai chocolate-inspired dessert \u2014 a base of rich Belgian chocolate and a pistachio spread layered like a sweet lasagna over cheesecake in a cup.",
      "It\u2019s definitely a departure from the typical corn dogs and cotton candy.",
      "From the West Coast to Middle America, dessert creators at state fairs are hawking their own confections based on Dubai chocolate, a milk chocolate shell filled with creamy pistachio, tahini and crispy kataifi, a Middle Eastern pastry.",
      "The offerings derive inspiration from the original Dubai Chocolate, a bar created in 2021 by Sarah Hamouda, the founder of Fix Dessert Chocolatier, an online confectionary shop in Dubai.",
      "The bar quickly went viral, with influencers touting its gooey, crunchy goodness and Hamouda saying she was selling 100 bars per minute. Now, Dubai chocolate-inspired desserts have hit the masses and are popping up at a handful of state fairs for the first time this year.",
      "The Minnesota State Fair will offer a Dubai chocolate strawberry cup in late August. Wisconsin just featured its version of the Dubai chocolate bar. And the Orange County Fair in Southern California debuted a Dubai chocolate brownie last month. In May, the L.A. County Fair also sold a Dubai chocolate strawberry cup.",
      "El Gidi, who owns Drizzle Cheesecakes based in a Dallas suburb, is originally from Libya and moved to the U.S. in 2021 in hopes of becoming a business owner. He said he aims to sell between 15,000 and 20,000 cups this year at the state fair.",
      "\u201cI became an entrepreneur because of my father, who is also a business owner. He inspired me to be my own boss,\u201d El Gidi told NBC News.",
      "Stores like Trader Joe\u2019s, Costco and even mall kiosks have featured their own versions of the chocolate bars for prices of around $3.99 and up. There\u2019s even a Dubai chocolate pistachio shake at some Shake Shack locations featuring pistachio frozen custard with kataifi and a dark chocolate shell for $11.04.",
      "Currently, people in Dubai can order Hamouda\u2019s bar, which she calls \u201cCan\u2019t get knafeh of it,\u201d from her online shop or through a delivery service. It costs a little over $18 per bar. Additionally, chocolate aficionados can find the bar at Dubai International Airport\u2019s duty-free store in Terminal 3.",
      "In May, product sales in the Confectionary category of Dubai Duty Free reached $20.2 million, up 81% thanks in part to Dubai chocolate, according to a press release from the company.",
      "The versions of Dubai chocolate people are buying in the U.S. are more a replication of the flavor profile than the real thing, says Kristie Hang, a food journalist based in Southern California\u2019s San Gabriel Valley.",
      "These products are more wallet-friendly, selling for around $15 at grocery stores, and they\u2019re made using standard ingredients like milk chocolate, strawberries and nut butters.",
      "True Dubai chocolate, Hang says, is an artisanal dessert that\u2019s made in small batches.",
      "\u201cThe pistachios are imported from Turkey and the chocolate is special chocolate with edible gold,\u201d she said.",
      "There\u2019s an element of luxury and craftsmanship to authentic Dubai chocolate, Hang added, noting a Dubai chocolate-covered strawberry confection would have only the finest, perfectly shaped strawberries dipped in high-quality Belgian or dark chocolate, paired with kataifi bits and pistachio cream from finely ground pistachios.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a mass fad at this point, but it\u2019s far removed from what the original Dubai chocolate was intended for, which was an exclusive luxury item. Now, it\u2019s being marketed as a very generic thing that anyone can get,\u201d said Hang.",
      "Texas-based food reviewer Zain Mohammed said he\u2019s not a fan of the Dubai chocolate trend. Mohammed, who was born in Chicago, raised in Saudi Arabia and now reviews restaurants in Houston, said he thinks the proliferation of the dessert is glossing over the culture and the important role food plays in family.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s more to Dubai than just Dubai chocolate. I grew up in Saudi Arabia, and the Arab culture is very family-oriented and Arab hospitality is very unmatched.\u201d",
      "He said he\u2019s also worried about people benefiting from the trend without appreciating the culture. \u201cI believe that there is cultural appropriation because of the fact that so many people are doing it \u2014 they are latching onto the trend and then advertising it as their own.\u201d",
      "Bianca Tamondong, a college student who tried the Dubai brownie dessert from the Mom\u2019s Bakeshoppe stand at the OC Fair, said she thought it was a winning combo. \u201cI\u2019ve tried so many other Dubai chocolate desserts before, such as the actual chocolate bar, ice cream variations and Dubai chocolate-covered strawberries. Ten dollars honestly seemed like such a steal since many other Dubai chocolate desserts cost $15.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe pistachios balanced out the sweetness of the brownie perfectly,\u201d she said.",
      "Confection connoisseur Dominic Palmieri sells a Dubai chocolate strawberry cup at the OC Fair.",
      "\u201cIt has all the components of the Dubai chocolate. However, we\u2019re putting chocolate on top of the strawberries, and it\u2019s got silky cream chocolate that doesn\u2019t harden,\u201d said Palmieri.",
      "It took more than three months to get enough pistachio cream for the fairs he\u2019s participating in due to a pistachio shortage and high demand for pistachio cream. He projects securing around 2,000 gallons of pistachio cream and over 10,000 pounds of raw chocolate this year.",
      "It was rare for anyone to find Dubai chocolate in 2024. \u201cYou had to find it in specialty chocolate shops, sweet shops or different places that were doing dessert,\u201d says Palmieri.",
      "Now, it\u2019s everywhere, he says.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to the fair, you\u2019ll go get your corn dog, turkey leg, funnel cake, and you\u2019ll get your Dubai chocolate strawberry cup. This one is quickly becoming a fan favorite,\u201d Palmieri said."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has promised a \u201cPeace Agreement\u201d to end the war in Ukraine following his summit in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin, dropping his demand for a ceasefire and sparking fears he is moving closer to Putin\u2019s position.",
      "Trump had phone calls overnight with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u2014 who travels to Washington for talks on Monday \u2014 and European leaders.",
      "But the shift in stance has sparked fears that Trump has adopted Putin\u2019s position, as European leaders reiterated that borders cannot change through force and analysts warned of potentially disastrous consequences.",
      "\u201cA great and very successful day in Alaska!\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social early Saturday after he returned to The White House. \u201cIt was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up.\u201d",
      "Ahead of the Alaska summit, Trump told Zelenskyy and European leaders during a call on Wednesday that he was going into the meeting with Putin with the goal of securing a ceasefire, according to two European officials and three other people briefed on the call.",
      "Trump and his counterparts agreed that a ceasefire would have to be implemented before peace negotiations could begin, they said, but that stance seemed to shift dramatically after his discussions with Putin.",
      "Later Saturday, Zelenskyy said following a call with Trump that \u201cwe must achieve a real and lasting peace, not just a pause between Russian invasions.\u201d",
      "A joint statement from European leaders \u2014 including France, Italy, Germany, Britain, Finland and Poland, as well as the presidents of the European Commission and European Council \u2014 did not directly acknowledge Trump\u2019s reversal but said further talks must include Zelenskyy, and that \u201cit will be up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory.\u201d",
      "While the substance of the Alaska summit remains unclear, Trump\u2019s remarks have raised new questions about the direction of the peace process.",
      "\u201cIt does sound very much as though Putin\u2019s arguments have prevailed over those of European leaders, who were insistent that a ceasefire had to be in place for negotiations to begin,\u201d Keir Giles, a senior fellow at London-based think tank Chatham House told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThe danger lies in the possibility that Trump may also have become convinced that Russia\u2019s demands on Ukraine are valid,\u201d he added, calling such an outcome \u201cdisastrous, not only for Ukraine, but also for the security of Europe.\u201d",
      "Those Russian demands remain sweeping.",
      "They include that Ukraine cedes all the territory Putin claims to have annexed and an agreement of permanent neutrality, with a ban on joining NATO. Moscow claims sovereignty over four Ukrainian regions \u2014 Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 in addition to Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.",
      "Russian forces do not fully control the territory in those regions, and Kyiv has repeatedly vowed never to recognize their annexation.",
      "Ukrainian leaders have insisted that any peace deal must include \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d from Western allies to ensure Russia cannot launch another offensive in the future. European leaders said Saturday that Russia \u201ccannot have a veto against Ukraine\u2019s pathway to E.U. and NATO [membership].\u201d",
      "But Peter Watkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House, says Russia has given \u201cno indication\u201d of softening its demands, casting doubt on hopes for peace.",
      "\u201cThe Russian strategic calculus is that they\u2019re better off just continuing to grind away rather than agree to a ceasefire,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the Russian demands haven\u2019t changed, then it is difficult to see how there\u2019s going to be a peace agreement.\u201d",
      "But not all observers see Trump\u2019s shift as entirely negative.",
      "Balazs Jarabik, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argued that it could ultimately be beneficial for both Ukraine and Europe.",
      "\u201cKyiv is losing the war of attrition, while Europe faces a large gap between its strategic posture and its actual capacity to support the war,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cA framework for regulating the conflict could provide all parties, including Russia, with room to stabilize the situation.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, fighting on the ground has not slowed.",
      "Russian drone strikes hit multiple regions of Ukraine overnight, Ukrainian officials said, even as the Trump-Putin summit unfolded in Alaska. \u201cConfirmed strikes include missile and UAV hits: 24 drones struck 12 locations,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s air force said in a statement.",
      "And in the absence of a breakthrough, critics say the optics of the Alaska summit may have played to Putin\u2019s advantage while his nation continues its offensive.",
      "\u201cPutin got his red carpet treatment with Trump, while Trump got nothing,\u201d Wolfgang Ischinger, the head of the Munich Security Conference, wrote on X. \u201cFor the Ukrainians: nothing. For Europe: deeply disappointing,\u201d he added. \u201cA clear 1\u20130 for Putin.\u201d",
      "The Russian delegation in Alaska also appeared pleased with the summit.",

      "\u201cI became an entrepreneur because of my father, who is also a business owner. He inspired me to be my own boss,\u201d El Gidi told NBC News.",
      "Stores like Trader Joe\u2019s, Costco and even mall kiosks have featured their own versions of the chocolate bars for prices of around $3.99 and up. There\u2019s even a Dubai chocolate pistachio shake at some Shake Shack locations featuring pistachio frozen custard with kataifi and a dark chocolate shell for $11.04.",
      "Currently, people in Dubai can order Hamouda\u2019s bar, which she calls \u201cCan\u2019t get knafeh of it,\u201d from her online shop or through a delivery service. It costs a little over $18 per bar. Additionally, chocolate aficionados can find the bar at Dubai International Airport\u2019s duty-free store in Terminal 3.",
      "In May, product sales in the Confectionary category of Dubai Duty Free reached $20.2 million, up 81% thanks in part to Dubai chocolate, according to a press release from the company.",
      "The versions of Dubai chocolate people are buying in the U.S. are more a replication of the flavor profile than the real thing, says Kristie Hang, a food journalist based in Southern California\u2019s San Gabriel Valley.",
      "These products are more wallet-friendly, selling for around $15 at grocery stores, and they\u2019re made using standard ingredients like milk chocolate, strawberries and nut butters.",
      "True Dubai chocolate, Hang says, is an artisanal dessert that\u2019s made in small batches.",
      "\u201cThe pistachios are imported from Turkey and the chocolate is special chocolate with edible gold,\u201d she said.",
      "There\u2019s an element of luxury and craftsmanship to authentic Dubai chocolate, Hang added, noting a Dubai chocolate-covered strawberry confection would have only the finest, perfectly shaped strawberries dipped in high-quality Belgian or dark chocolate, paired with kataifi bits and pistachio cream from finely ground pistachios.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a mass fad at this point, but it\u2019s far removed from what the original Dubai chocolate was intended for, which was an exclusive luxury item. Now, it\u2019s being marketed as a very generic thing that anyone can get,\u201d said Hang.",
      "Texas-based food reviewer Zain Mohammed said he\u2019s not a fan of the Dubai chocolate trend. Mohammed, who was born in Chicago, raised in Saudi Arabia and now reviews restaurants in Houston, said he thinks the proliferation of the dessert is glossing over the culture and the important role food plays in family.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s more to Dubai than just Dubai chocolate. I grew up in Saudi Arabia, and the Arab culture is very family-oriented and Arab hospitality is very unmatched.\u201d",
      "He said he\u2019s also worried about people benefiting from the trend without appreciating the culture. \u201cI believe that there is cultural appropriation because of the fact that so many people are doing it \u2014 they are latching onto the trend and then advertising it as their own.\u201d",
      "Bianca Tamondong, a college student who tried the Dubai brownie dessert from the Mom\u2019s Bakeshoppe stand at the OC Fair, said she thought it was a winning combo. \u201cI\u2019ve tried so many other Dubai chocolate desserts before, such as the actual chocolate bar, ice cream variations and Dubai chocolate-covered strawberries. Ten dollars honestly seemed like such a steal since many other Dubai chocolate desserts cost $15.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe pistachios balanced out the sweetness of the brownie perfectly,\u201d she said.",
      "Confection connoisseur Dominic Palmieri sells a Dubai chocolate strawberry cup at the OC Fair.",
      "\u201cIt has all the components of the Dubai chocolate. However, we\u2019re putting chocolate on top of the strawberries, and it\u2019s got silky cream chocolate that doesn\u2019t harden,\u201d said Palmieri.",
      "It took more than three months to get enough pistachio cream for the fairs he\u2019s participating in due to a pistachio shortage and high demand for pistachio cream. He projects securing around 2,000 gallons of pistachio cream and over 10,000 pounds of raw chocolate this year.",
      "It was rare for anyone to find Dubai chocolate in 2024. \u201cYou had to find it in specialty chocolate shops, sweet shops or different places that were doing dessert,\u201d says Palmieri.",
      "Now, it\u2019s everywhere, he says.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to the fair, you\u2019ll go get your corn dog, turkey leg, funnel cake, and you\u2019ll get your Dubai chocolate strawberry cup. This one is quickly becoming a fan favorite,\u201d Palmieri said."

    "summary": "For famous rappers and aspiring stars alike, strip clubs can be more than dens of debauchery according to a new docu series on Atlanta's famed Magic City.",
    "story": [
      "In the early 1980s, Michael Barney and his wife left his hometown of Camden, N.J., and relocated in Atlanta, where he started working in telecommunications and earned the nickname \u201cMr. Magic\u201d from colleagues. One night out with friends at a popular strip club, he got the inspiration for what would become a cultural hotspot in the heart of the city.",
      "Soon enough, Barney signed the lease for a defunct print shop, repurposed the building and named it \u201cMagic City.\u201d The club opened in 1985 with just one dancer.",
      "After 40 years of deals, networking and hip-hop history at the club, Magic City is the subject of a five-part docuseries executive-produced by producer and rap mogul Jermaine Dupri.",
      "\u201cMagic City: An American Fantasy\u201d premiered Friday on STARZ, showcasing the outsized national impact of the Atlanta strip club and others like it on hip-hop culture and the industry.",
      "\u201cWe would fly back home to go to Magic City from out of town,\u201d Dupri told NBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to Orlando and not going to Disney World \u2014 you have to go.\u201d",
      "To the So So Def producer, there\u2019s more to Mr. Magic\u2019s establishment than the women.",
      "\u201cYou could be standing by the biggest thief in Atlanta, the biggest drug dealer in Atlanta, the biggest rapper in Atlanta, the biggest basketball player in the world, a movie star, a politician, and they\u2019re all in the same area \u2014 treated the same, having the same conversations and you wouldn\u2019t know the difference, because the club doesn\u2019t cater to just one person,\u201d Dupri said.",
      "Strip, as the club is known among regulars, has provided a gauge for hip-hop and R&B hitmaking.",
      "\u201cThe connection is very authentic,\u201d Dupri said. \u201cHearing your song play in a club is like hearing your song on the radio. You feel like you actually made it.\u201d",
      "In some cases, the aspiration for hip-hop fame comes from the people onstage. Bronx-native Nya Lee used the money she made dancing to fund her rap career.",
      "\u201cIn the earlier years, I invested in myself,\u201d she said to NBC News. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t think that being a stripper and a rapper could work.\u201d",
      "But it did, and her story was compelling enough to land her a spot on VH1\u2019s popular show, \u201cLove and Hip-Hop: New York.\u201d Not long after, another dancer was introduced to the world through the series: Cardi B, who has since become a global force in entertainment.",
      "Stripping can have a dark side. Outside of Magic City, some dancers have unionized to fight for better work standards, fairer pay and protection from sexual harassment or abuse. Clubs are, after all, an environment in which men are paying for access to women\u2019s bodies, whether it\u2019s making full contact or at a distance.",
      "And while some perform with the goal of escaping the club and improving their lives, others escape to the club. That was the case for a Memphis, Tennessee, native with two years of undergraduate college credits and a boyfriend who was facing federal charges. Rapper and TV personality Jessica Dime, who is featured in the docuseries,  went to the sprawling King of Diamonds in Miami after two friends advised her to leave Memphis. \u201cIt was so much going on in the streets at the time,\u201d Dime said to NBC News. \u201cWhen I left, it was the best decision I could have made. Dancing was something that saved me. I would have been in jail or probably dead if I wouldn\u2019t have went to Miami.\u201d",
      "Within a few years of performing, she got the attention of Flo Rida and signed to his IMG record label as a rapper.",
      "\u201cWhat they were giving me to sign, I would have made more in one night at King of Diamonds,\u201d Dime said. She said she knew that if she signed the contract, \u201cGod is going to make sure I stay out of here.\u201d",
      "But the people who work in the clubs don\u2019t need to be aspiring rappers to still make an impact on music. Last year, Muni Long\u2019s track \u201cMade for Me\u201d became a hit at Magic City, which Dupri said helped him gauge how well the song would do more broadly, especially since traditional R&B is hard to place in clubs.",
      "\u201cThe dancers were singing the song,\u201d Dupri recalled, and so were the patrons.",
      "Rapper Rick Ross\u2019 debut single, \u201cHustlin,\u201d about the everyday grind in any capacity, was a major success in strip clubs across the country.",
      "\u201cThey was playing my record without my requesting it, and I said, \u2018This is different.\u2019 I believe the record was speaking for everybody that was in the club,\u201d Ross said to NBC News. \u201cYou talking to the parking man, you talking to the dancers, you talking to the DJs.\u201d",
      "In 2005, dancers at Magic City introduced South Carolina rapper Young Jeezy\u2019s music to DJ Nando, who was the club\u2019s resident DJ at the time. With the backing of BMF (Black Mafia Family) and Big Meech, author Joe Cosscarelli says in the docuseries that Jeezy became \u201cthis larger than life, King Pin figure.\u201d",
      "Jeezy\u2019s album \u201cLet\u2019s Get It: Thug Motivation 101\u201d was the go-to record throughout Magic City dancer Gigi Maguire\u2019s career.",
      "During her time at Magic City as a headlining dancer, Maguire became friends with some of the rappers that would frequent the club. She had been testing different stage names when rapper Lil\u2019 Wayne gave her a hand as she sat in on a writing session on his tour bus in Atlanta.",
      "\u201cWayne was a close friend of mine,\u201d she said. The Young Money emcee was testing lyrics and happened to say, \u201cWeezy Maguire, show me the money.\u201d Maguire fired back, \u201c\u2018Gigi Maguire, show me the money,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Yoo! That\u2019s fire. You should keep that.\u2019 Literally, it stuck.\u201d",
      "Maguire also took her roommate Trey Songz\u2019s music to Magic City during her featured spots on Mondays.",
      "\u201cWe still are, to this day, like family,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s literally like my little brother.\u201d",
      "This docuseries will be part of STARZ\u2019s roster of projects on hip-hop culture. The network\u2019s hit drama series, \u201cP-Valley,\u201d is set at a fictional Southern club and includes two cast members from Magic City\u2019s Snack Pack trio of pole dancers, which includes Maguire.",
      "When the retired dancer got a call for a guest appearance for a \u201cP-Valley\u201d episode on featuring icons of strip, there was controversy over who those legends would be.",
      "\u201cThey wanted Cardi B, Blac Chyna and Amber Rose. I used to work with Amber and Chyna and am friends with them. I love Cardi B down. But those are not women that the dance community goes to, to say, \u2018Hey, I aspire for my dance career to be this,\u2019\u201d Maguire said.",
      "To the women who admire Maguire and the stars she mentioned, their accomplishments and influence in the culture and hip-hop extends beyond strip and has allowed them to leverage their popularity into business ventures that wouldn\u2019t have necessarily been available a decade or so ago.",
      "Nya Lee, 32, was 17 when she won a stripping contest two times, using a fake ID at Sin City in the Bronx.",
      "The now-DJ has collaborated with Fabolous, Jadakiss and Ultimate Rap League battle rap legend T-Rex on her projects. Her mixtapes include features with Kash Doll who also started as a Detroit-based stripper.",
      "\u201cGirls seeing me knock down doors made them feel like they could do it too,\u201d Nya Lee said."

      "\u201cI think plumbers are less at risk,\u201d Hinton said. \u201cSomeone like a legal assistant, a paralegal, they\u2019re not going to be needed for very long.\u201d",

      "Last month, Microsoft revealed a list of jobs that could be endangered as Al advances.",
      "Occupations atop the list were interpreters, historians, customer service and sales representatives, and writers. Some roles considered safe included manual jobs like roofers and rail and dredge operators, hazardous material removal workers and painters. In the health care industry, phlebotomists and nursing assistants were also considered safe.",
      "As AI advances, many manual labor jobs figure to be around for the long haul.",
      "\u201cAutomation is a low threat to these jobs because it involves someone manually installing equipment, and many of those who do are getting close to retirement,\u201d said Tony Spagnoli, the director of testing and education for North American Technician Excellence, the country\u2019s largest nonprofit organization for heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration technicians. \u201cAI can\u2019t replace parts or make improvisational decisions.\u201d",

      "Whether or not AI does end up taking many jobs, the idea has been enough to push some people to reconsider their futures. The online platform Resume Builder last month released a survey of more than 1,400 Generation Z adults to understand how economic pressures, rising education costs and concerns about AI were shaping their career paths.",
      "Among the key findings were that 42% of those polled, many of them college graduates, were already working in or pursuing a blue-collar or skilled trade job. Their top motivations included avoiding student debt and reducing the risk of being replaced by AI.",
      "For Gen Zers without a degree, blue-collar work offered a path to financial stability without the burden of student loans; and Gen Z men, regardless of education level, were more likely than women to choose blue-collar careers.",
      "\u201cMore Gen Z college graduates are turning to trade careers and for good reason,\u201d Resume Builder\u2019s chief career adviser, Stacie Haller, wrote in the survey. \u201cMany are concerned about AI replacing traditional white-collar roles, while trade jobs offer hands-on work that\u2019s difficult to automate. Additionally, many grads find their degrees don\u2019t lead to careers in their field, prompting them to explore more practical, in-demand alternatives.\u201d",
      "But AI could be coming for these jobs, too. Advances in mechanical automation \u2014 from humanoid machines to task-specific robots \u2014 combined with AI are making up ground on humans.",
      "\u201cRobotics is really coming up,\u201d said Andrew Reece, chief AI scientist at BetterUP, an online platform that in part uses AI-powered tools to support professional development. \u201cIt\u2019ll start replacing entry level jobs, such as driving trucks and moving equipment, but it may take time to start figuring out the complex work.\u201d",
      "But there\u2019s a big gap between improvements in robotics and a technology that can replace a human in the real world. Most AI is still trained primarily on text data, giving it little if any understanding of the real world. And the robots themselves still have a long way to go.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very wide misconception that we are on the verge of having humanoid robots basically replace workers.

      "The Texas Democratic lawmakers who decamped to Illinois to block a redistricting effort in their state faced threats of arrest and criminal charges if they didn\u2019t return home.",
      "But as their time away from the state dragged on, the threats grew more worrisome.",
      "A group of state legislators who stayed at a hotel in St. Charles, a suburb outside of Chicago, endured two bomb threats on different days. It reached point that the Texas lawmakers quietly switched hotels and made an internal pact to keep those details private.",
      "Even more concerning to them was what their families were dealing with back at home.",
      "Some of the legislators said their homes in Texas received repeated pizza deliveries when they hadn\u2019t made the orders. It\u2019s now considered by law enforcement to be an intimidation tactic after a judge\u2019s son was murdered by an assailant who posed as a delivery driver.",
      "In another instance, state Rep. Diego Bernal said a man wearing a backpack showed up to his family\u2019s residence in San Antonio. Bernal told NBC News in an interview that the individual represented himself as a worker for the water company and started asking for Bernal\u2019s whereabouts, including when he\u2019d be home and how long he had been gone.",
      "The episode was caught on the family\u2019s home surveillance  camera, and Bernal said while he doesn\u2019t know if the person was intent on doing harm, he was certain the man misrepresented himself, as he was not wearing the customary identifiers of a water department employee.",
      "\u201cAlmost everybody has a story like that now. You\u2019ve got him, you\u2019ve got the pizza folks, you\u2019ve got the people online saying to \u2018hunt us down,\u2019\u201d Bernal said. \u201cThe atmosphere online has been really toxic, and one of the real disappointments about this is that when we\u2019re in session, even when we really disagree, when we have big floor debates and fights, there\u2019s still a level of respect, decorum and even personal compassion between members across the aisle. There\u2019s been literally none of that while we faced a bomb threat, or while people are being told to hunt us down, or someone\u2019s address might be leaked online.\u201d",
      "The threats have been weighing on the lawmakers, who have now been away from home for nearly two weeks as they sketch out their plans to return to Texas.",
      "When asked what he was fearful of, state Rep. Gene Wu, chair of the Texas House Democratic Caucus, said one word: \u201cMinnesota.\u201d He was referring to a Minnesota state lawmaker who was shot and killed along with her husband earlier this year when the suspect appeared at their home.",
      "\u201cI have left directions to my family: Do not open the door for anyone. We are deadly afraid there will be another Minnesota incident,\u201d Wu said in an interview. \u201cWe get threats all the time. When the Republicans have people calling us communists and traitors and all these other things, it provokes a certain reaction. And that threat is real. We don\u2019t take this lightly.\u201d",
      "Texas state Rep. Ramon Romero Jr., who leads the Democratic Hispanic Caucus, lamented the ongoing threats and what he described as intimidation tactics from Republicans as a troubling \u201csign of the times.\u201d",
      "He pointed to Roger Stone, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump, posting a map with the location where the lawmakers were staying and GOP state Rep. Mitch Little naming the hotel they were staying in a TV interview where he said, \u201cWhoever wants to go and get them, we fully support that effort.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have people that want to be famous, and because Roger Stone said, \u2018This is where they are,\u2019 the next day there\u2019s a bomb threat at that location,\u201d Romero said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a sign of the times. This is what happens when people use incendiary comments, when they say, \u2018Go get \u2019em.\u2019\u201d",
      "In response Little said in a message to NBC News: \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. I saw their location on social media like everyone else. [The Department of Public Safety] was charged with bringing them back, and that\u2019s exactly who I was talking about.\u201d",
      "And in a text message, Stone said that it was a news organization that first revealed the hotel where the lawmakers were staying.",
      "Apart from security threats, lawmakers\u2019 family members contended with other kinds of disruptions. Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows said earlier this week that the Department of Public Safety had special agents deployed in every region of the state, making clear they were prepared to take the lawmakers into custody at any moment.",
      "\u201cThey are set up outside members\u2019 homes, conducting surveillance, knocking on doors, calling their phones multiple times a day. So far, no one\u2019s home. But the search continues and it will not stop,\u201d Burrows said.",
      "In a statement, Burrows denounced the threats lawmakers have faced. He also received a voicemail threatening his family, according to a copy of the voicemail reviewed by NBC News.",
      "\u201cThreats of violence and intimidation against elected officials have no place in our politics, and it is unfortunate that members on both sides of the aisle have been subjected to harassment,\u201d Burrows said. \u201cThese threats will never be tolerated, and working with law enforcement, we will ensure that anyone targeting a Texas elected official or their family will face the full force of the law.\u201d",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s office also decried the threats against lawmakers and rejected assertions from Democrats that Republicans were fanning the flames.",
      "\u201cFirst and foremost, violence \u2014 or even the threat of it \u2014 is unacceptable and the Governor condemns it without reservation,\u201d Abbott spokesman Andrew Mahaleris said in a statement. \u201cBut to suggest that calling on Democrats to return to Texas and do their jobs somehow inflames threats is absurd.\u201d",
      "On Friday, Burrows gaveled the first special legislative session to a close and Abbott called for another one to begin hours later so lawmakers can consider, among other things, a new congressional map that could net Republicans as many as five more seats.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom countered on Thursday by calling on lawmakers in his state to set a special election that would allow them to pursue their own mid-decade redistricting effort.",
      "A person close to the situation who has knowledge of the plans said Texas Democrats plan to return to their state \u201cas soon as Monday.\u201d They have set two conditions for their return: first, that the special session in Texas come to an end, and second that California Democrats release their own redistricting proposal.",
      "Wu said Friday, \u201cOne of the two conditions have been met when the governor caved. We expect the other condition to be met next week.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "After projections that President Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportations would negatively impact the American economy, the nation is seeing a jump in wholesale vegetable prices and slowdowns in industries that rely on immigrant workers.",
      "Economic measures that are trickling out are leading some to point to the administration\u2019s immigration crackdown, along with tariffs, as at least partly responsible for the slump in some economic sectors and for rising prices.",
      "The latest comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which reported Thursday a whopping 38.9% increase in wholesale dry and fresh vegetable prices from June to July, the biggest since March 2022.",
      "Phil Kafarakis, president of IMFA The Food Away From Home Association, which represents food producers, suppliers, services and industries outside of grocery stores, said the warning signs should be taken seriously.",
      "Because of deportation efforts, \u201cyou are now going to be left with not enough laborers in the fields to pick up and collect product as its coming to harvest,\u201d he said, adding that it is contributing to the current \u201chorribly, incredibly impactful\u201d effect of tariffs.",
      "Combined with drought, excessive flooding and wildfires, the deportations are coming to bear and will become a bigger problem in the late summer and early fall harvests, he said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think people realize\u201d there will be a surge in vegetable costs in restaurants, at grocery stores and other places, Kafarakis said.",
      "While the administration has not yet hit the deportation levels Trump promised in his campaign, the number of people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in June was its highest monthly arrests in at least five years.",
      "This week, the Dallas Federal Reserve issued a report stating Texas\u2019 economy has softened amid uncertainty. Business owners told the Dallas Federal Reserve that uncertainty about tariffs and immigration policy were posing investment and hiring challenges.",
      "\u201cImmigration enforcement actions are also affecting the ability of some firms to recruit and retain workers,\u201d the agency stated in its report.",
      "The federal bank surveys Texas businesses regularly. In its July survey, the inability to hire qualified workers because they lacked permits or legal status \u201cwas the most widespread impact noted among firms experiencing workforce disruption,\" the reserve bank said.",
      "The report quoted a machine manufacturer who said in response to survey questions, \u201cForeign-born laborers get the job done. We need them, we use them, and we like them.\u201d",
      "Immigrant workers are a big part of Texas' workforce. In an April report, the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank said the share of Texas firms reporting on its survey that they rely on workers who moved to Texas from a different country increased from 15% in 2023 to 25% in 2024.",
      "\"The increase has been across all sectors, with about one-third of manufacturing respondents relying on immigrant workers,\" the bank stated then.",
      "In a report released Thursday by the immigrant advocacy group America\u2019s Voice, the authors noted that the cycling of immigrant workers in and out of the country has stopped, mostly because of border restrictions reducing the inflow of immigrants.",
      "\u201cThe country is losing workers without them being replaced, with adverse economic consequences,\u201d the report by Robert Lynch, Michael Ettlinger and Emma Sifre states. Lynch is an economics professor at Washington College. Ettlinger is a founding director of University of New Hampshire Carsey School of Public Policy, and Sifre is a data analyst with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.",
      "Lynch said that the number of workers in agriculture and related industries increased from March to July in 2023 and in 2024. But employment in the industries those same months this year dropped by 155,000 workers, down 6.5%.",
      "In construction, the 10 states with the highest concentrations of unauthorized workers saw employment drop .1% from June 2024 to June 2025, while other states saw it increase 1.9%, according to the report. Additionally, the growth in the states not in the top 10 was lower than a year ago, down from 2.3% growth.",
      "About 7% of the leisure and hospitality workers are undocumented and are mostly focused in restaurant and hotel sectors, Lynch said. States with higher concentrations of unauthorized workers are experiencing slower growth in this area, he said.",
      "Food service employment grew .2% in high immigrant states over the past year compared to 1.5% in other states, the report states.",
      "\u201cA loss of a significant portion of this workforce is likely to be particularly damaging as there were nearly 1 million unfilled jobs in leisure and hospitality in as recently as April of this year,\u201d Lynch said.",
      "The numbers of foreign-born workers in the country fell from 33.3 million in January to about 32.1 million in July, a loss of about 1.2 million workers, according to analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers by the National Foundation for American Policy, a trade and immigration research group.",
      "Stuart Anderson, the foundation's executive director, said thus far there has not been a corresponding increase in U.S. workers\u2019 labor participation.",
      "\u201cThe reason why you see slowdowns is because when employers can\u2019t find enough workers, they are going to invest less,\u201d he said.",
      "Antonio De Loera-Brust, United Farm Workers spokesman, questioned whether there are truly labor shortages in agriculture.",
      "He said workers are frightened and acknowledged raids have occurred in some fields and agricultural related worksites.",
      "But \u201ca lot of workers I talk to are desperate for work. There\u2019s not enough work,\u201d De Loera-Brust said. Hours are being cut and workers are being told to do in six hours what they used to do in eight, he said.",
      "\u201cWe are dead set against deportations,\u201d he said, referring to UFW.",
      "He said that what appears to be happening is that growers are using the disruptions of immigration raids on their businesses \u201cas their latest argument for why Congress should give them their long-standing priority, which is to bring more guest workers and pay them less.\u201d",
      "Trump has been under pressure from businesses that rely on immigrant workers, particularly the agricultural industry, to ensure they have a secure and reliable workforce.",
      "Trump has shifted his plans on how to respond. Initially he paused arrests of workers in the agriculture and hospitality industry, then he restarted the raids, and later he said he was considering creating temporary passes for certain workers."

The bookcase has adjustable shelves so you can move them around according to the height of your shoes \u2014 boots, for example, will need more space than a pair of sandals. But each shelf is only about 11 inches deep (about a size 11 in men\u2019s shoes or a women\u2019s 12), so make sure that works for your shoe collection. There are six shelves, and assuming you can place around three pairs of shoes per shelf, it should fit 18 pairs of shoes.

      "McGreevy said this Large Drop-Front Shoe Box Case from The Container Store made \u201corganization a breeze.\u201d Part of the appeal of a box like this one is that you can keep your shoes safe from external forces while also letting you see them. (And if this particular profile or aesthetic doesn\u2019t fit your closet, The Container Store has lots of other options, too: check out its Tall Side Profile Drop-Front Shoe Box and the Cambridge Drop-Front Shoe Box in Linen.

      "Meck mentioned this 15-Unit Stackable Organizer from ClosetMaid for those who want cubbies, which can be great if you want order and division between pairs of shoes (or single shoes). Because the height of each cubbyhole doesn\u2019t reach very far, the organizer is only good for accommodating flip flops, sandals and other low-profile shoes, it says. ClosetMaid specifically singles out any that measure smaller than 5.75 inches tall by 4.5 inches wide by 11 inches deep. The organizer comes in three colors: white, espresso and dark cherry.",
      "How to decide what shoe storage solution to buy",
      "Organize your shoesBefore buying any kind of shoe storage, McGreevy encourages a shoe cleanse: Categorize all of your shoes first and then place them side-by-side and decide whether to hold on to them, donate them or throw them away. \u201cGoing through this step is important so that you don\u2019t end up organizing extra pairs of shoes or buying more storage than you need,\u201d she said. \u201cCount how many pairs \u2014 and how many of each type \u2014 you have after decluttering. Purchase storage based on those numbers.\u201d",
      "Factor in shoe sizeAfter you assess which shoes need to go in the shoe case, look at your space as a whole. The type of shoe organizer you buy should also depend on the size of your space and how often you wear each pair, McGreevy said.",
      "Wear frequencySolomon agreed and added that the frequency at which you wear your favorite pairs is especially important when searching for shoe storage, since you won\u2019t want to tuck away shoes into individual storage bins if you plan on wearing them frequently. Instead, opt for open storage like a shoe cubby or shoe rack that allows for easy access, Solomon suggested. An over-the-door shoe bag could work for someone who doesn\u2019t need their collection in plain sight, she said. Plus, it frees up floor space.",
      "How to properly store shoes",
      "Generally, you should make sure you\u2019re storing shoes somewhere that isn\u2019t directly hit by sunlight but is well-ventilated and cleaned regularly, according to Meck. This can help prevent shoes from becoming damaged or collecting dust.",
      "For shoes that you want to pack away, Meck explained that wrapping them in tissue paper (and even old clothes) can keep them from scraping or scuffing together.",
      "For those shoes you reach for regularly, Solomon recommended leaving them around an entryway to prevent dirt from traveling further into your house or apartment.",
      "Here are a few other expert-recommended tips to consider when arranging your shoe storage:",
      "Boots: Both McGreevy and Solomon suggested using shapers in order to help maintain their shape and keep them standing straight. The two recommended this affordable option from The Container Store. For seasonal shoes like winter and rain boots, Solomon recommends the best place for storage is in an entryway closet or mudroom, especially if you don\u2019t want to drag in dirt from outside.Sneakers: Avoid sealed storage like storage bins for sneakers since these shoes need to breathe to look fresh and new, Solomon said. She\u2019s a fan of stocking sneakers in shoe cubbies, especially for someone who has a larger collection that they want to show off.Heels: Those who have a bigger selection of high heels should look between the shelves of a shoe shelf. Solomon recommended avoiding shoe racks with slats, as they \u201calways lead to heels getting stuck in between the rungs,\u201d or slanted shelves, as shoes tend to fall off the racks more easily.\u201d",

      "Bob Odenkirk reprises his role as Hutch Mansell, an off-the-books government assassin, in \u201cNobody 2.\u201d",
      "The new film, now out in theaters, is a follow up to Odenkirk's 2021 film \u201cNobody,\u201d which introduced the actor as a middle-class working suburban dad with a lethal past.",
      "In the first film, Hutch\u2019s seemingly domestic life unravels after two intruders break into his home. His decision not to fight back strains his marriage and leaves him questioning whom he has become. When a bus fight puts him up against Russian mobster Yulian Kuznetsov, Hutch enlists help from his father, David (Christopher Lloyd), and brother Harry (RZA) to take down Kuznetsov's crew. The film ends with Hutch and his family moving into a new home \u2014 but their return to normal appears to be short-lived when Hutch receives a phone call that suggests his assassin days aren\u2019t quite over yet.",
      "Now, four years later in \u201cNobody 2,\u201d Hutch is still trying to keep his two worlds apart. \u201cIt\u2019s basically about work-life balance but with an assassin as the worker,\u201d Odenkirk tells TODAY.com in an exclusive interview.",

      "What Happens in 'Nobody 2'?",
      "\u201cNobody 2\u201d opens with Hutch going through the motions of being a contract killer for the government while balancing being an involved dad and devoted husband. Though he feels he's found a way to manage both, Odenkirk tells TODAY.com Hutch knows that's far from the truth.",
      "\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s got a balance in his life, but he knows he\u2019s wrong ... (though) he wishes he did,\u201d Odenkirk says. \u201cHe has his actions, his missions that he\u2019s doing, and he enjoys those. And then he\u2019s got his family, which he is kind of ignoring, and he starts to become very aware of the fact that he\u2019s not staying connected with his family because he\u2019s just too preoccupied.\u201d",
      "In an effort to reconnect with his family, Hutch takes his wife, kids and dad on a summer vacation to a run-down theme park in Plummerville, where his dad once took him and his brother to when they were kids. But his promising family plans quickly unravel when Hutch gets into a dust-up with the local sheriff.",
      "\u201cThe vacation is filled, as most vacations can be, with annoyances and problems and shortcomings, and then that all builds up inside him, and he explodes,\u201d Odenkirk tells TODAY.com.",
      "As tensions mount, Hutch\u2019s instincts take over, and the trip turns into something much more dangerous when he discovers that Plummerville is a base for a massive bootlegging operation. What begins as a chance to bond with his family soon becomes another mission.",
      "In the official trailer, Hutch is seen in brutal physical fights, while his wife Becca (Connie Nielsen) urges him to \u201cfix it\u201d \u2014 a clear sign he\u2019s right back in the kind of high-stakes conflict he can\u2019t seem to avoid.",
      "Though the comedy action film leans more towards \"John Wick\" than \"National Lampoon's Vacation,\" Odenkirk says the film offers relatable moments.",
      "\u201cGetting the garbage out on garbage day and not making it to your son\u2019s basketball games because you are working and trying to plan a vacation,\" Odenkirk explains. \"These are all things I think people can relate to.\u201d",
      "How Does 'Nobody 2' End?",
      "\u201cNobody 2\u201d ends with a blow out fight between Hutch and his crew and the local police force and mobsters who work for Lendina (Sharon Stone) \u2014 the ruthless crime boss who runs the bootlegging operation through Plummerville. Hutch becomes Lendina's target after he meddles in her operation by saving the theme park operator's son, whom she had kidnapped, and burning down her massive fortune.",
      "Odenkirk calls the \u201clast third of the film ... a James Bond film, but with a family involved.\u201d It includes explosions, large-scale action sequences and an ending that circles back to Hutch\u2019s core conflict: protecting his family while accepting who he really is.",
      "In the end, Lendina and her crew are eliminated after a fiery and  intense battle that ultimately brings the family together following their harrowing experience.",

      "\u201cNobody 2\u201d does not have a post-credits scene, but it does have a scene that plays at the beginning of the end-credits.",
      "While most end-credits and post-credits scenes help to wrap up any loose ends from the film or tease the next chapter in a franchise, the final scene in \u201cNobody 2\u201d only offers snapshots of what happened during the family's action-packed vacation in Plummerville. It includes pictures taken by Hutch's daughter that show various moments from their vacation and epic battle at the amusement park.",
      "Will There Be a 'Nobody 3'?",
      "In an exclusive interview with TODAY.com, Odenkirk says he would be down to do another \u201cNobody\u201d sequel, officially reprising his role of Hutch.",
      "\u201cI want a 'Nobody 3' and a 'Nobody 4,'\u201d he says. But, according to Odenkirk, there has yet to be an official conversation to get the ball rolling on it.",
      "\u201cIf the audience likes it \u2026 they decide, not us,\u201d he explains.",
      "On the date of publication, \u201cNobody 2\u201d has already scored a 77% score on Rotten Tomatoes from critics and a 91% audience score.",
      "What Does Bob Odenkirk Say About 'Nobody 3'?",
      "Whether or not a third \u201cNobody\u201d film gets green-lit, Odenkirk already has a specific direction in mind. Just as \u201cNobody 2\u201d is set four years after the first film, he sees the next installment reflecting another time jump, four years after \u201cNobody 2.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow those kids are older, Hutch really needs to reconnect before they split apart,\u201d he says of his on-screen children, Sammy (Paisley Cadorath) and Brady (Gage Munroe). In a potential third film, Odenkirk says his son would now be a 22-year-old adult, which could bring \u201canother level of trying to stay connected and a different set of tensions and challenges.\u201d",
      "Aside from all the action, Odenkirk says the balance of relatable family dynamics is at the heart of the series. \u201cThese films are meant to ... connect with our audience and connect this character on a common shared sense of family tension, and then let them become part of an action movie.\u201d",
      "He also says there could be space for Becca's backstory, which he revealed they filmed for \"Nobody 2.\"",
      "\"We know that backstory. In fact, we wrote it into \u2018Nobody 2,\u2019 but we didn\u2019t shoot it because we didn\u2019t have room in the story,\" Odenkirk tells TODAY.com. \"But we do know who Hutch and Becca are. We do know how they met, and we do know that they both know, if they cast their minds back to how they met, they both know that they are with a kick a-- spouse, and sometimes they forget that.\"",
      "\u201cNobody 2\" is a Universal Pictures film, which shares TODAY.com's parent company, NBCUniversal."

      "\u201cThat was the year that \u2018General Hospital\u2019 really went supercharged,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was this hysteria that surrounded anything to do with \u2018General Hospital.\u2019 It was crazy. Nuts. Dangerously crazy, sometimes.\u201d",
      "He also reflected on playing the same role for many years and his role in developing the character. Rogers recalled a story from his first day on set when he pulled then-executive producer Gloria Monty to the side and said, \u201c\u2018Gloria, this script here \u2014 this is not the way an Australian would react under these circumstances.\u2019\u201d",

      "(Warning: Spoilers from \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d below\u2026)",
      "Nearly 20 years after their last collaboration, Denzel Washington and Spike Lee are teaming up again for a crime thriller that shows the two-time-Oscar-winning actor going to great lengths to protect his family and his music empire.",
      "Lee\u2019s \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d a modern re-imagining of the 1963 film \u201cHigh and Low\u201d by Japanese auteur Akira Kurosawa (which was a loosely based on Ed McBain's 1959 novel \u201cKing\u2019s Ransom\u201d), introduces audiences to Washington\u2019s character, David King, a music mogul at a New York City music label called Stackin\u2019 Hits Records. David intends to thwart a merger at the company so he can buy the label and have complete control of the company he helped build. But on the day of his planned business deal, David receives a call from a mysterious man who says he has abducted him son, Trey (Aubrey Joseph), and will not return him safely until he receives $17.5 million.",
      "David tells the police he will pay the ransom but changes his mind once he learns that the kidnapper accidentally took the son of his driver, Paul, played by Jeffrey Wright. Despite the mix up, the abductor calls again and says he still wants David to fork over the money or Paul\u2019s son, Kyle (Elijah Wright), will die.",
      "The ruthless unknown figure making demands at the other end of the line is played by rapper A$AP Rocky. During the movie\u2019s final act, Washington and A$AP Rocky\u2019s characters come face-to-face for the first time in two intense scenes, exchanging bars and jabs. There\u2019s an effortlessness to the back-and-forth between them, a groove that is also felt in the way Washington carries himself the entire film.",
      "Washington tells TODAY.com that reuniting with Lee and making \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d their sixth film together and first since 2006\u2019s \u201cInside Man,\u201d felt familiar.",
      "\u201cIt was just like (an) old hat, you know, like putting the glove back on,\u201d he says about their reunion. \u201cBang, here we go. There\u2019s a rhythm to it.\u201d",
      "Below, Washington and Wright break down pivotal scenes in \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d and discuss working with each other and A$AP Rocky. Read on to find out what the two co-stars shared and how the \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d ends.",
      "Jeffrey Wright Unpacks Heart-Wrenching Scene With Denzel Washington",
      "After learning that his son is safe, David is reluctant to pay the ransom, knowing that if he does then he won\u2019t have enough money to buy back ownership of Stackin\u2019 Hits Records. During one of the most emotional moments in the movie, Paul goes to his boss and pleads with him to help bring his son home. Wright opens up about shooting the taxing scene to TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the critical question (at the center of the film): \u2018What would you do?\u2019 But in this case, I am in the middle of it,\u201d says Wright. The Academy Award nominee adds that having his son Elijah portray Kyle \u2014 in his feature film debut \u2014 made the scene feel more real.",
      "\u201cAs a father, with my son Elijah playing the role, that helped kind of intensify the stakes for me,\u201d Wright shares. \u201cIt\u2019s also a little bit of this edge in there, this challenge in there, because you\u2019re coming with your hand out in a place of almost helplessness.\u201d",
      "He continues, \u201cSo, I wanted to make sure that that was done, but he was able to maintain his sense of dignity at the same time, being completely exposed to the hard facts of the danger that his son was in.\u201d",
      "Wright explains that the conversation is portrayed differently in Kurosawa\u2019s film \u2014 which follows a wealthy shoe executive named Kingo (Toshiro Mifune) whose family becomes the target of a ruthless kidnapper \u2014 because it represents the differences in social classes specific to Japanese culture.",
      "He says his character\u2019s \u201cHigh and Low\u201d counterpart (Aoki, played by Yutaka Sada) is \u201ccompletely submissive, almost to the point of he\u2019s completely powerless. I wanted to see if I could kind of right the balance there a little bit.\u201d",
      "But David remains unconvinced he should pay the hefty ransom following Paul\u2019s emotional plea and rejects him. It isn\u2019t until the music titan has a harsh heart-to-heart with his own son that he changes his mind.",
      "David agrees to meet A$AP Rocky\u2019s character, later revealed to be aspiring rapper Yung Felon, while working with authorities to set a trap. He rides the subway to the Yankee Stadium stop in the Bronx and accidentally drops the backpack containing the $17.5 million and a tracking device. Through a series of diversions, Yung Felon evades the police and gets away with the cash. He honors his word and sets Kyle free, leaving the teen bloodied and bruised in a park.",
      "What Happens at the End of \u2018Highest 2 Lowest\u2019?",
      "Although David is seen as a local hero, his fellow music executives realize that he used their money for the ransom and threaten to sue him for breach of contract. He leaves his office and decides to stroll the Brooklyn Bridge and listen to songs from artists who sent demos to the label in hopes of receiving a record deal. David, with the self-described \u201cbest ears in the business,\u201d notices that one of the tracks features an artist with the same voice as the kidnapper.",
      "When the police aren\u2019t quick to investigate his theory, David and Paul follow a tip that leads them to Yung Felon\u2019s apartment and later to a studio where he is recording a song. David, armed, goes into the studio alone and confronts Yung Felon. The young artist calls out David for not recognizing his talents sooner, blaming the exec for his lack of success in life.",
      "Washington praises A$AP Rocky\u2019s performance in their scenes together, telling TODAY.com, \u201cHe came in ready, and so did I, and we just hit the ball back and forth across the net. It was simple. It was easy because he was prepared, and so was I.\u201d",
      "The 70-year-old actor adds, \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful young artist. He\u2019s a wonderful young actor, and the sky\u2019s the limit for him.\u201d",
      "Yung Felon fires a gunshot at David before running away and boarding a train. But David is right behind him, and the two fight before the mogul gains the upper hand. Yung Felon is arrested and publicly claims he is innocent as he arrives at a courthouse surrounded by supporters. Privately, he accepts a plea deal to go to prison for a couple decades. He also has a final request: to speak to David one more time.",
      "The two sit down, separated by a glass partition, for another sparring of words. Yung Felon says his popularity has caused his song to skyrocket on charts around the world. He says multiple labels are interested in him, but he wants David to sign him. David rebuffs his offer, revealing that he no longer works for Stackin\u2019 Hits Records and is starting a smaller, independent label. Yung Felon becomes enraged as he is dragged away by guards.",
      "In the final scene, David meets with a new artist named Sula (Aiyana-Lee), discovered by his son, who wants to be a star. She sings an original song for him, titled \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d before David promises to make her dream come true.",
      "At the end of the film it's revealed the David's new label will be a family managed business."

    "summary": "In an exclusive interview with TODAY.com, Bob Odenkirk shares his thoughts about a 'Better Call Saul' return and what it would take to revive the role.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s been three long years since fans saw Bob Odenkirk play the cunning and charismatic character of Saul Goodman in \u201cBetter Call Saul.\u201d Now, the Emmy Award-winning actor is opening up to TODAY.com about what it would take to reprise his iconic role.",
      "Odenkirk\u2019s character, who was first introduced in the Bryan Cranston-led crime drama \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d received a spinoff series in 2015 that served as an origin story for Saul Goodman. It followed the Albuquerque, New Mexico criminal defense attorney, born Jimmy McGill, and his transformation from aspiring lawyer to the ambitious, and at times morally ambiguous, lawyer with ties to the criminal underworld.",
      "Created and executive produced by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, the same team behind \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d ended with Odenkirk\u2019s character serving an 86-year prison sentence after confessing to his crimes, which included supporting Walter White (Cranston)\u2019s drug operation and acknowledging the role he played in his brother Howard\u2019s death.",
      "In an exclusive interview with TODAY.com on Aug. 14, Odenkirk shares his thoughts on a \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d follow-up and details on his character's specific storyline.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not getting out (of prison). If there\u2019s another Saul show, it takes place inside prison,\u201d he says emphatically, noting that the story would follow Saul's life behind bars.",
      "Odenkirk, who has played Saul Goodman for over a decade while on both AMC series, recognizes the impact his character has had on him both personally and professionally. \u201cThat part turned my life around, and I\u2019ve given more to that part than anything I\u2019ve done, \u201c he says.",
      "He's also aware of the strain it's put on him, telling The Hollywood Reporter that after years of playing Saul, in addition to his \u201cNobody\u201d character of Hutch, a highly-skilled assassin, he's \u201cfine with moving on\u201d from them.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re guys who, for different reasons, have pretty big chips on their shoulders, and that\u2019s hard to play after a while,\u201d Odenkirk told the outlet. \u201cYou can\u2019t just carry that guy around all the time.\u201d",
      "But, Odenkirk reveals to TODAY.com, a \"Better Call Saul\" revival is not out of the question. The actor exclusively tells us what it would take for him to reprise his \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d character and jump back into that universe.",
      "\u201cVince Gilligan and Peter Gould created that show. There are some of the best writers who ever worked in TV,\u201d he says. \u201cSo if they were to think of something in that world, of course I would do it.\u201d",
      "Though Odenkirk admits he would be up for the challenge, he feels it might be bit of a long shot.",
      "\u201cBut I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he says of a \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d sequel or spinoff happening. \u201cI think they\u2019ve all moved on to some more amazing projects that you\u2019ll soon see.\u201d",
      "Odenkirk is referring to Gilligan\u2019s new Apple TV+ sci-fi drama called \u201cPluribus,\u201d which stars his \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d co-star Rhea Seehorn.",
      "The series, which has already been picked up for two seasons by Apple TV+, is described as a \u201cpsychological sci-fi drama set in a reimagined version of modern-day Albuquerque.\u201d Though official plot details have not yet been released, Odenkirk tells TODAY.com that the new show is \u201cgoing to be a great one.\u201d",
      "\u201cLook forward to the best written show on TV for years to come,\u201d he teases of the new series.",
      "While fans will have to wait until November 7 to see \u201cPluribus\u201d hit the small screen, Odenkirk\u2019s new action film, \u201cNobody 2,\u201d is now available in theaters nationwide.",
      "(\u201cNobody 2,\u201d a Universal film, is owned by TODAY.com\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.)"

      "An attorney for Priscilla Presley has responded to a lawsuit filed by his client's former business partners earlier this week accusing her of hastening her daughter Lisa Marie Presley's death so she could take control over her ex-husband Elvis Presley's financial estate.",
      "Marty Singer, Priscilla Presley's attorney, called the lawsuit \"a sad and vicious attempt to falsely tarnish the reputation of an eighty-year-old woman\" in a statement to NBC News.",
      "\u201cAccusing a grieving mother of contributing to her daughter\u2019s death is not savvy advocacy; it is malicious character assassination, and should be broadly condemned,\u201d Singer said. \u201cThese fabricated claims have absolutely no validity and we are confident this case will be dismissed.\u201d",
      "Riley Keough, the daughter of Lisa Marie Presley and granddaughter of Priscilla Presley, \"stands behind her grandmother 100% and is equally disgusted with this latest, vicious attempt ... to ruin her grandmother's life,\" Singer said.",
      "Representatives for Keough said in a statement to NBC News her grandmother's attorneys \"say it all.\"",
      "Priscilla Presley's former business partners, Brigitte Kruse and Kevin Fialko, filed a complaint against her in LA County Superior Court on Monday, Aug. 11, accusing her of fraud, breach of contract and other civil misdeeds.",
      "Kruse and Fialko, who were once the heads of Priscilla Presley Partners, say in the suit they had been collaborating with Priscilla Presley to maximize her name, image and likeness.",
      "But once they improved her financial standing, she \u201cabruptly cut ties\u201d with them and denied them brand opportunities related to the movie \u201cPriscilla\u201d and other projects, Kruse and Fialko allege.",
      "Kruse and Fialko also make an explosive allegation regarding the death of Priscilla Presley's daughter in 2023.",
      "Lisa Marie Presley died of a small bowel obstruction on Jan. 12, 2023, in Los Angeles, according to an autopsy report from the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner obtained by NBC News.",
      "According to the complaint, Lisa Marie Presley was \"noticeably ill, complaining to Priscilla about her health\" when they attended the 2023 Golden Globes, just two days before her death.",
      "Instead of caring for her daughter or taking her to a nearby hospital, the lawsuit alleges Priscilla Presley \u201cclasped to the spotlight, going out to the Chateau Marmont for drinks with Lisa, and then sent Lisa on a long drive to her Calabasas home.\u201d",
      "Just over 24 hours later, Lisa Marie Presley was rushed to the hospital after she suffered cardiac arrest, the complaint states.",
      "Priscilla Presley went to the hospital, and \"despite Lisa\u2019s clear directive to \u2018prolong her life\u2019, Priscilla pulled the plug within hours of Lisa being admitted, and before her granddaughter, Riley, was able to get to the hospital,\u201d the complaint alleges.",
      "About a week after her daughter's death, Priscilla Presley allegedly said, \"I'm the queen. I'm in charge of Graceland,\" according to the complaint.",
      "In recent years both parties have filed other lawsuits against each other, including one in which Priscilla Presley accused her former business partners of financial elder abuse.",
      "An attorney for one of the former business partners called that lawsuit \u201cretaliatory\u201d due to another lawsuit they had filed against her the year before. Both lawsuits are still ongoing.",
      "Priscilla Presley was married to Elvis Presley for six years before they divorced in 1973. Elvis Presley died four years later, in 1977."

      "It\u2019s all about the family, isn\u2019t it? At least, that\u2019s what a lot of TV shows and movies show us: Heroes \u2014 and heroines \u2014 fighting for their family.",
      "But sometimes, you learn it\u2019s time to fight for yourself. And Netflix\u2019s new movie, \u201cNight Always Comes,\u201d starring Oscar nominees Vanessa Kirby (\"Pieces of a Woman\") and Jennifer Jason Leigh (\"The Hateful Eight\"), asks exactly that question.",
      "In it, Kirby\u2019s desperate character Lynette has to scrounge up a down payment on a house overnight or risk her whole family being unhoused. But there are secrets that only emerge in the last moments that upend everything.",
      "So what happens in \u201cNight Always Comes,\u201d and what about that quiet shocker of an ending?",
      "What Is \u2018Night Aways Comes\u2019 About?",
      "Lynette is a grown woman living with mom Doreen (Leigh) and older, mentally disabled brother Kenny (Zack Gottsagen).",
      "In order to save the house they\u2019ve lived in for decades, they have to come up with a $25,000 down payment \u2014 or end up on the streets. But Doreen uses that money to buy a new car, which risks not only the loss of the house but also Kenny taken away to live in special care. Lynette now has to find that enormous sum by the next morning.",
      "Her assets? Her own beat-up old car, a sketchy history with a lot of less-than-honorable folks, and a long night ahead.",
      "What Does Lynette Do to Get the Money?",
      "Lynette pulls on as many strings as she can to avoid being unhoused, but each goes wrong in spectacularly different ways. Along the way we learn about Lynette\u2019s difficult history, from living with a man who pimped her out when she was 16, to seeing how she loses it when things become difficult.",
      "During the night, she runs someone down, steals a car and a safe, and faces down every possible low-life you can imagine. There\u2019s no sympathy in the city for her, it seems. Kenny tags along with her for part of the adventure, pointing out regularly that he\u2019s the man of the house, her big brother, and he will always take care of her. Their tight, warm relationship is the one bright spot in Lynette\u2019s extremely challenging life.",
      "Is Lynette Successful in Getting the Down Payment?",
      "After all of that, she does succeed \u2014 but then the story takes a turn. She returns home with Kenny at dawn, bleeding and beaten up, but successful. But as Doreen picks shards of glass out of her back, the truth comes out: Doreen hates the house. Doesn\u2019t want to live there. Never planned to sign the loan to make it their own.",
      "It gets worse: Doreen tells Lynette, \u201cYou\u2019re like that thing at the bottom of a toilet bowl. You just suck everything down.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a moment of clarity for Lynette, who goes upstairs to sleep and gets a voice mail from the landlord who was going to sell them the house \u2014 he\u2019s changed his mind. Suddenly, the $25,000 she\u2019s now begged, borrowed and stolen takes on a new meaning: It\u2019s freedom.",
      "But only for her. Kenny will have to stay with their mother, who refuses to let him go.",
      "How Does \u2018Night Always Comes\u2019 End?",
      "Lynette tells Kenny she has to go away, but will come back to visit. After packing, she slips into her car (we\u2019d kind of hoped she\u2019d take her mom\u2019s brand-new vehicle, but that might get her into serious trouble).",
      "She leaves some money for Kenny and a note for her mother which reads in part, \u201cYou asked me what I did last night. I fought. I fought for this family. The only way I know how. But I guess you said what I needed to hear, so thank you. And now I need to fight for me.\u201d",
      "With that, Lynette drives off into the morning, into an uncertain \u2014 but somehow more hopeful \u2014 future."

      "After 33 episodes (preceded by 94 episodes of \u201cSex and the City\u201d), Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and their assorted pals and fashions closed the wardrobe doors on Aug. 14 with a lot of loose threads tying up, many still left open and so much pie being eaten.",
      "The announcement of \u201cAJLT\u2019s\u201d exit came only a few weeks ago, when renewal buzz was still in the air. As showrunner Michael Patrick King (who developed the follow-up series with \u201cSATC\u201d creator Darren Starr) wrote on Instagram Aug. 1, \u201cWhile I was writing the last episode of \u2018And Just Like That\u2019 season three, it became clear to me that this might be a wonderful place to stop.\u201d He noted that the last two episodes of the series were structured as more of a two-part finale (focusing around Miranda\u2019s challenging Thanksgiving party), but held off on calling it a finale.",
      "So how did things ultimately wrap up? Where do our leading ladies and men leave us? And just how did we go from Cosmos in clubs in the 1990s to pie in the kitchen in 2025? Let\u2019s examine the final episode, appropriately called \u201cParty of One.\u201d",
      "Are Carrie and Aidan Broken Up Forever?",
      "Considering that \u201cCadian\u201d broke up several episodes ago, that the first of the two-part finale was called \u201cForgot About the Boy,\u201d and the episode directly post-breakup skipped ahead to the fall without a reunion \u2014 yeah, it\u2019s safe to say that Aidan (John Corbett) sealed his fate when he declared he still couldn\u2019t trust Carrie.",
      "Who\u2019s next for Carrie, then?",
      "Maybe no one.",
      "The final episode of \u201cAJLT\u201d focuses on Carrie coming up with a new perspective on what it means to be not just out of a relationship, not just with none on the horizon, but what it might mean to not necessarily want one.",
      "\u201cSeriously though, who will I be alone?\u201d she asks Charlotte. \u201cI\u2019ve never lived alone without the thought that I wouldn\u2019t be alone for long.\u201d She confesses that after Big\u2019s death, she thought that Aidan might be her natural next step. Then she\u2019d considered Duncan as a possibility \u2014 but he left New York City, and it\u2019s hard to imagine Carrie picking up and following him.",
      "Then Carrie had her big revelation: \u201cI have to quit thinking, \u2018Maybe a man?\u2019 and start accepting maybe just me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a tragedy, it\u2019s a fact, and I just have to start accepting it full stop.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a throwback to her new novel, whose original ending of a woman being happy being alone triggered her editor, leading to Carrie writing an epilogue in which love is a possibility for the single woman in the future. But in the end, post-Thanksgiving, Carrie returns to her apartment with leftover pie and rewrites the epilogue to read, \u201cThe woman realized she was not alone \u2014 she was on her own.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a solid period on the end of a sentence. The fact is, after many years of the story of Carrie, her friends and lovers, our heroine\u2019s longest-lasting relationship has not been with men. Or fashion. Or even her friends. Carrie\u2019s real love affair has been with herself, and her writing. It is the thing that gives her purpose and sets her apart from nearly everyone else she knows.",
      "What Happens to All the Other Characters?",
      "So where does that leave everyone else?",
      "With their loved ones, actually. As ever, the \u201cSex\u201d-iverse leaves everyone else as ancillary satellites circling Carrie\u2019s world, but we do get some insights as to where everyone else\u2019s mostly-happily-ever-after lives are heading next.",
      "Lisa (Nicole Ari Parker) avoids her affair with her editor and comes home to a still-mourning Herbert (Christopher Jackson) and they promise to get through his political defeat together.",
      "Miranda and Joy (Dolly Wells) undergo a dog surgery and a particularly disgusting post-Thanksgiving bathroom disaster and end up embracing.",
      "Seema (Sarita Choudhury) and Adam (Logan Marshall-Green) work around their differences in tradition and gluten, and have a pie-eating Thursday instead of a traditional Thanksgiving. But not before Carrie determines that the free spirit is in for the long haul with Seema.",
      "Brady (Niall Cunningham) and baby mama-to-be Mia (Ella Stiller, daughter of Ben) are far from reconciled, but Mia and her friends do make Miranda\u2019s Thanksgiving interesting, and Mia decides that Miranda is kind of cool after all.",
      "Charlotte and Harry (Evan Handler) discover there is life after prostate cancer surgery, and celebrate Thanksgiving with their children.",
      "Anthony (Mario Cantone) and Giuseppe (Sebastiano Pigazzi) discuss Giuseppe\u2019s real intentions with Anthony. Guess they really are going to get married.",
      "Aidan is nowhere in sight.",
      "Is 'And Just Like That' Really Over?",
      "Was this a true finale \u2014 or will we see more of Carrie & Co. in the future?",
      "Too soon to tell. There are enough loose threads to create another spin-off. There\u2019s always a scenario where Carrie abandons her newfound sense of self and races off to the UK to chase Duncan. But let\u2019s face it, the end credits roll with a replay of the theme music to \u201cSex and the City.\u201d We think this is probably the end \u2014 for now.",
      "After all, Carrie has reached a point of acceptance of being alone, but not lonely. She has her friends and their offspring. She likes her home, even if it is a little too big. It\u2019s kind of nice to leave her in her beautiful red frock, dancing to Barry White\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re the First, the Last, My Everything,\u201d eating pie direct from the pan with a spoon.",
      "It\u2019s as if the show is saying: This is not a tragedy. This is a victory.",

      "\u201cThen I\u2019m thinking, \u2018OK, if we have kids, is this the woman I want to have kids with and build a family with?\u2019\u201d Justice said. \u201cAt that time, as a young guy \u2014 she don\u2019t cook, don\u2019t clean, don\u2019t really seem, like, motherly. And then we start having issues.\u201d",
      "Berry, a mom of two, appeared to respond to her ex with a cheeky Instagram post. The Oscar winner uploaded a carousel of carefree photos to the social media platform Aug. 14, the day of her 59th birthday, from her vacation with Hunt.",
      "In the slideshow, Berry smiled wide while posing in a yellow bikini, lounged with Hunt on a daybed, enjoyed a glass of wine by the sea, sipped from a coconut and ate some chocolate cake. One photo also showed her holding a birthday card that said \u201cMom\u201d and had a heart drawn on it.",
      "She seemed to address Justice\u2019s criticisms by captioning the post, \u201cPhew\u2026! cooking, cleaning and mothering.\u201d",
      "The \u201cNever Let Go\u201d star is a proud mom to 17-year-old daughter Nahla, whom she shares with former partner Gabriel Aubry, and 11-year-old son Maceo, whom she shares with ex-husband Olivier Martinez.",
      "Berry went public with her relationship with Hunt in September 2020 and frequently shares photos on social media with the singer. He joined her on TODAY with Jenna & Friends in June when the actor was a guest co-host, marking their first interview together.",
      "\u201cI think everybody\u2019s been really happy, at least for me personally, people have been like, \u2018You finally found ... !\u2019 I\u2019ve always wanted what we have,\u201d Berry gushed.",
      "She continued, \u201cI always saw myself in a committed, loving relationship with, like, my best friend, someone that I respect and I love.\u201d",
      "Hunt revealed during their appearance that he proposed to Berry\u2026and is still waiting for an answer.",
      "\u201cSo I put out the proposal, and it\u2019s still on hold as you can see,\u201d he playfully said. \u201cIt\u2019s just out there floating. You know, maybe you can encourage her.\u201d",
      "Berry explained that she hasn\u2019t replied yet because she has been married three times and Hunt was previously married as well. She said that they don\u2019t need to tie the knot to \u201cvalidate\u201d their love.",
      "\u201cBut I think we will get married just because, out of the people I\u2019ve been married to, this is the person I should have married,\u201d she shared. \u201cAnd I feel like I should, we should get married, but it\u2019s not because we feel like we have to. I think it\u2019s something that we would like to do just because we want that expression.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has promised a \u201cPeace Agreement\u201d to end the war in Ukraine following his summit in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin, dropping his demand for a ceasefire and sparking fears he is moving closer to Putin\u2019s position.",
      "Trump had phone calls overnight with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u2014 who travels to Washington for talks on Monday \u2014 and European leaders.",
      "But the shift in stance has sparked fears that Trump has adopted Putin\u2019s position, as European leaders reiterated that borders cannot change through force and analysts warned of potentially disastrous consequences.",
      "\u201cA great and very successful day in Alaska!\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social early Saturday after he returned to The White House. \u201cIt was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up.\u201d",
      "Ahead of the Alaska summit, Trump told Zelenskyy and European leaders during a call on Wednesday that he was going into the meeting with Putin with the goal of securing a ceasefire, according to two European officials and three other people briefed on the call.",
      "Trump and his counterparts agreed that a ceasefire would have to be implemented before peace negotiations could begin, they said, but that stance seemed to shift dramatically after his discussions with Putin.",
      "Later Saturday, Zelenskyy said following a call with Trump that \u201cwe must achieve a real and lasting peace, not just a pause between Russian invasions.\u201d",
      "A joint statement from European leaders \u2014 including France, Italy, Germany, Britain, Finland and Poland, as well as the presidents of the European Commission and European Council \u2014 did not directly acknowledge Trump\u2019s reversal but said further talks must include Zelenskyy, and that \u201cit will be up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory.\u201d",
      "While the substance of the Alaska summit remains unclear, Trump\u2019s remarks have raised new questions about the direction of the peace process.",
      "\u201cIt does sound very much as though Putin\u2019s arguments have prevailed over those of European leaders, who were insistent that a ceasefire had to be in place for negotiations to begin,\u201d Keir Giles, a senior fellow at London-based think tank Chatham House told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThe danger lies in the possibility that Trump may also have become convinced that Russia\u2019s demands on Ukraine are valid,\u201d he added, calling such an outcome \u201cdisastrous, not only for Ukraine, but also for the security of Europe.\u201d",
      "Those Russian demands remain sweeping.",
      "They include that Ukraine cedes all the territory Putin claims to have annexed and an agreement of permanent neutrality, with a ban on joining NATO. Moscow claims sovereignty over four Ukrainian regions \u2014 Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 in addition to Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.",
      "Russian forces do not fully control the territory in those regions, and Kyiv has repeatedly vowed never to recognize their annexation.",
      "Ukrainian leaders have insisted that any peace deal must include \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d from Western allies to ensure Russia cannot launch another offensive in the future. European leaders said Saturday that Russia \u201ccannot have a veto against Ukraine\u2019s pathway to E.U. and NATO [membership].\u201d",
      "But Peter Watkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House, says Russia has given \u201cno indication\u201d of softening its demands, casting doubt on hopes for peace.",
      "\u201cThe Russian strategic calculus is that they\u2019re better off just continuing to grind away rather than agree to a ceasefire,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the Russian demands haven\u2019t changed, then it is difficult to see how there\u2019s going to be a peace agreement.\u201d",
      "But not all observers see Trump\u2019s shift as entirely negative.",
      "Balazs Jarabik, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argued that it could ultimately be beneficial for both Ukraine and Europe.",
      "\u201cKyiv is losing the war of attrition, while Europe faces a large gap between its strategic posture and its actual capacity to support the war,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cA framework for regulating the conflict could provide all parties, including Russia, with room to stabilize the situation.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, fighting on the ground has not slowed.",
      "Russian drone strikes hit multiple regions of Ukraine overnight, Ukrainian officials said, even as the Trump-Putin summit unfolded in Alaska. \u201cConfirmed strikes include missile and UAV hits: 24 drones struck 12 locations,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s air force said in a statement.",
      "And in the absence of a breakthrough, critics say the optics of the Alaska summit may have played to Putin\u2019s advantage while his nation continues its offensive.",
      "\u201cPutin got his red carpet treatment with Trump, while Trump got nothing,\u201d Wolfgang Ischinger, the head of the Munich Security Conference, wrote on X. \u201cFor the Ukrainians: nothing. For Europe: deeply disappointing,\u201d he added. \u201cA clear 1\u20130 for Putin.\u201d",
      "The Russian delegation in Alaska also appeared pleased with the summit.",
      "Kirill Dmitriev, a Putin adviser who heads Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, posted a clip on X Friday showing an encounter with a bear in Alaska that he hoped would provide good omens for the meeting.",

Zelenskyy may be invited to the next round of talks, but for many watching this meeting between Trump and Putin, it may seem clear who has the upper hand.",

      "It was not aware of casualties, and the shots were fired \"hundreds of meters away\" from the GHF site before its opening hours, it said.",
      "Israel also denies there is starvation in Gaza, contradicting medics in the Palestinian enclave, global aid groups and even a close ally, President Donald Trump.",
      "Some Arab leaders dependent on American aid and security guarantees are wary of angering the U.S. and Israel and see little strategic advantage in helping Palestinians, whom they may even see as a threat, experts say.",
      "Arab states have participated in airdrops of aid and food convoys into Gaza, but Palestinians and aid groups say it\u2019s nowhere near enough to ward off a looming famine. Egypt and Qatar have also mediated talks among Israel, the U.S. and Hamas, but they have not led to an end to the conflict.",
      "Several Latin American states, along with Spain, Ireland and Norway, have blasted Israel for its conduct in Gaza and threatened sanctions or a downgrade of diplomatic ties.",
      "And in recent weeks, longtime Israeli allies like France and Australia have pledged to officially recognize Palestine \u2014 a move decried by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government. In late 2023, South Africa filed a case with the United Nations\u2019 top court alleging that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.",
      "Arab states have been much less vocal, with Egypt and Jordan even cracking down on pro-Palestinian protests and activism, fearing they could turn against the country\u2019s leaders, experts say.",
      "\u201cPalestine resonates deeply in the Arab imagination,\" Gerges said. \"Palestine reminds Arabs of the subservience of their governments. Palestine reminds Arabs of the hegemony and domination and the continuing colonialism and imperialism of the West.\"",
      "He added, \u201cI would say that Gaza, the tragedy of Gaza, the destruction of Gaza, could really serve as a time bomb that implodes the Arab political order from within.\u201d",
      "Polling before Oct. 7, 2023, showed that most Arab citizens rejected normalizing ties with Israel, a sentiment subsequent surveys show has only deepened since.",
      "A survey published in June by pollster Arab Barometer found that support for such a move has collapsed, not exceeding 13 percent in the seven countries surveyed.",
      "The Egyptian and Jordanian embassies in the U.S., along with the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this story.",
      "Egypt and Jordan, even with the crackdown, have allowed limited protests, though hundreds of activists have also been arrested, according to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.",
      "The Gulf states rarely allow protests, but they have largely maintained diplomatic and trade links with Israel throughout its devastating offensive in the Gaza strip that began after the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, in which some 1,200 were killed and 250 taken hostage.",
      "Health officials in Gaza say that more than 61,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed in the ensuing war.",
      "Many academics, including Israeli scholars, have in recent months joined rights groups in condemning Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza as genocide, a charge Israel vehemently denies.",
      "\u201cDespite the genocide, in the middle of the genocide, this extraordinary depravity that we see in Gaza, not a single Arab state that has relations with Israel has cut relations with Israel, although other states in other parts of the world have,\u201d said Ussama Makdisi, professor of history and chancellor\u2019s chair at the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were among the Arab states that signed the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020, paving the way for economic and diplomatic ties with Israel. Saudi Arabia had been set to follow, but the Gaza conflict put those plans on hold.",
      "For Gulf Arab states, better ties with Israel have little to do with public attitudes and more to do with realpolitik, experts say. The Gulf states host several U.S. military bases that analysts say help shield them from regional rival Iran and also help maintain Western access to the region\u2019s vast energy supplies.",
      "Access to Israel\u2019s vibrant tech sector has also been a draw for some Arab states, who have used its surveillance technology to stifle dissent, experts and rights groups say.",
      "\u201cThose regimes in the Arab world that depend on the U.S. for their security, they don\u2019t depend on their legitimacy vis a vis their own people. They depend on U.S. protection, U.S. military bases,\u201d Makdisi said.",
      "Houthi rebels, who control large parts of Yemen, have fired missiles and drones at Israel and ships in the region in what they say is an attempt to end Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, but Yemen is alone among Arab states in pressuring Israel militarily. Arab countries could apply economic pressure through oil embargoes or restricting access to the Suez Canal and Arab airspace, but experts say such moves are unlikely.",
      "Arab countries once supplied Palestinian militant groups with weapons, funding and bases from which to attack Israel, but such solidarity proved costly and dangerous.",
      "In Jordan, tensions between Palestinian militant groups and the ruling monarchy exploded into the \u201cBlack September\u201d civil war in 1970, leading to the militants\u2019 eventual expulsion and relocation to Lebanon.",
      "The presence of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon in the 1970s exacerbated the country\u2019s civil war and triggered an Israeli invasion in 1982 to target \u201cPalestinian terrorists.\u201d",
      "More recently, Israel invaded Lebanon last year, heavily bombing southern Beirut in an offensive against the Hezbollah militant group, which had been firing rockets at Israel in solidarity with Hamas.",
      "Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran, which has led some Arab states to distance themselves from both groups.",
      "For Ryan Crocker, former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Lebanon and Kuwait, lukewarm Arab support for the Palestinian cause is less about U.S. and Israeli pressure and more about self-preservation.",
      "\u201cThe Palestinians, both the cause, the PLO and the population, in the Jordanian and Lebanese examples, have both been seen as a threat to the rule of these Arab regimes,\u201d Crocker told NBC News.",
      "The U.S. and Israel had floated plans for Arab countries to accept tens of thousands of Gaza refugees, but the idea was flatly rejected, with those Arab countries fearing both renewed Palestinian militancy and accusations of aiding ethnic cleansing, experts say.",
      "Crocker compared Palestinians to the Kurds, another stateless group in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a saying among the Kurds, who are scattered between Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, that they have no friends but the mountains,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, the Palestinians don\u2019t even have the mountains.\u201d"

      "A second sign declared that Vance \u201cclaps when the plane lands,\u201d referring to a practice mocked by some Britons who see it as very un-British overenthusiasm. Others held placards quoting Vance when he said he \u201cnever liked\u201d President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cCotswolds childless cat ladies say go home,\u201d another read, referring to comments Vance made to former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in 2021 about senior Democrats in Congress that resurfaced during last year\u2019s presidential race.",
      "In the nearby town of Chipping Norton, some locals said they were unprepared for the level of security disruption as some of the already tight roads in the area were closed for Vance\u2019s motorcade.",
      "Design manager Geoff Holliday, 51, said Wednesday he was \u201cgetting bored\u201d with the closures, adding that he was longing for the motorcade to be slowed down by \u201ca disgruntled farmer and a combine harvester.\u201d",

      "Now, invited in from the diplomatic cold, the Russian leader headed for Anchorage full of praise for his American counterpart\u2019s \u201cenergetic and sincere efforts\u201d ahead of the talks, which will see him set foot on U.S. soil for the first time in a decade.",
      "For his part Trump warned en route to Alaska that Putin would face \u201cvery severe\u201d economic consequences unless he agreed to stop the war.",
      "Asked about overnight attacks on Ukraine, Trump told reporters Friday aboard Air Force One that this ongoing aggression actually hurts his Russian counterpart. \u201cHe thinks that makes him \u2014 gives him strength in negotiating. I think it hurts him, but I\u2019ll be talking to him about it later,\u201d Trump said.",

      "\u201cPutin has scored a success already by being invited to meet Trump on U.S. soil,\u201d said  Keir Giles, a senior fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cTrump has facilitated Putin\u2019s acceptance back into international diplomacy, despite the fact that he ought to be finding it difficult to travel, given his status as an internationally wanted war criminal,\u201d Giles told NBC News in a telephone interview Thursday, pointing to the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court in March 2023.",
      "On the streets of Moscow, there was also a sense of positivity about the meeting and confidence in their leader, who has continually served as president or prime minister of Russia since 1999.",
      "Pavel Grebenyuk, 45, told NBC News the summit with Trump was important because \u201cthere should be a connection between Russia and America, two of the most leading powers,\u201d and \u201cthere should remain a dialogue.\u201d",
      "But Grebenyuk, who said he worked at a window manufacturing factory, added that he thought it was \u201cunlikely anything will change dramatically,\u201d after the talks to end the war, which entered its fourth year in February.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t expect anything,\u201d he said.",

      "A recent survey by the independent pollster Levada Center showed that the level of support for Putin's military campaign in Ukraine remained high at 75% in Russia, but that nearly two-thirds of respondents supported peace talks.",
      "The venue for those talks is itself significant.",
      "Trump and Putin will meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a  military base that was crucial to U.S. efforts to counter the then-Soviet Union during the Cold War.",
      "It sits just outside Anchorage, the largest city in the territory,   which the U.S. bought from Russia for $7.2 million in 1867 \u2014 a sale that has since been viewed as na\u00efve by Russians after Alaska was found to contain vast natural resources.",
      "Putin aide Yuri Ushakov signaled Thursday that while the primary focus of the summit would be Ukraine, economic ties between the two nations would also be on the agenda. Putin hinted that a nuclear arms control treaty may also be discussed.",

      "Those demands have previously included Ukraine ceding all the land that Putin claims to have annexed and accepting permanent neutrality, with a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO. Putin claims four Ukrainian regions \u2014 Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 as well as the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which he annexed in 2014, although Russian forces do not fully control all of the territory in each region.",
      "Zelenskyy and Ukrainian officials have long said they would not concede any territory that Russia illegally annexed. Ukraine has also insisted that any agreement must include \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d from its allies so that Moscow is not able to launch future aggression.",

At the funeral on the eve of the talks in Anchorage \u2014 which Ukraine has not been invited to \u2014 Reshetilov urged Trump not to bend to Vladimir Putin\u2019s demands of more Ukrainian land.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have to compromise with the enemy and give up our beloved land because this enemy won\u2019t stop,\u201d said Reshetilov, 46, as hundreds of Ukrainian flags, each marking the grave of a fallen soldier, flapped in the breeze behind him at this cemetery near the major northeastern city of Kharkiv.",
      "Like many who will not be present in Anchorage, he told NBC News he fears Russia could merely use a ceasefire to \u201creturn even stronger\u201d and attack Ukraine and even other countries in Europe.",
      "\u201cWe know Russia and they never keep agreements,\u201d he added.",
      "These fears are not confined just to Ukrainian hearts but shared by governments, experts and people across Europe and beyond who fear what Trump might agree to with Putin in a bid to resolve a war he once promised the American people he could fix in 24 hours.",
      "Hours before the talks Friday, Trump suggested that he and Putin would discuss territorial swaps between Russia and Ukraine \u2014 despite previously assuring European allies that he wouldn\u2019t. But Trump said that \"I've got to let Ukraine make that decision\" and that his aim was to set up future talks between the two warring neighbors.",
      "Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Alaska, Trump said that he would not deal economically with Russia until the war was over. He also said it was possible Ukraine could emerge from negotiations with their much desired \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d against Russia attacking again.",
      "If Russia does not agree to peace the consequences \u201cwill be very severe,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this for my health. I\u2019d like to focus on our country, but I\u2019m doing this to save a lot of lives.\u201d",

      "Alarmed at being frozen out of the talks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his government this week turned to European leaders for a lifeline, hoping to influence the high-stakes summit and prevent a potential disaster for Ukraine.",
      "A flurry of diplomacy culminated Wednesday with an emergency video call between Trump, Zelenskyy and leaders from Britain, France, Germany, the European Union and NATO, all of whom urged the American president not to capitulate to Putin. Trump said afterward that he had assured them there would be \u201cvery severe consequences\u201d if Putin did not agree to end the war.",
      "U.S. allies came away hopeful they had steered the president away from a potential Putin diplomatic trap, but nonetheless remain anxious, European diplomats and former U.S. officials said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s looking better today than it did a week ago,\u201d said William Taylor, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. \u201cThe Ukrainians and the Europeans were all worried that Trump and Putin would get together and make some decisions for Ukraine.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe all are preparing ourselves for an outcome that may be highly problematic,\u201d said one European official who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks.",
      "So far, Ukrainian officials and European allies have tried to tread carefully to avoid antagonizing Trump. But if the talks produce a lop-sided proposal favoring Russia, \u201cthen there is no way that Europe can simply pretend that everything is simply OK,\u201d the European official said.",
      "Asked for a response to these criticisms, the White House directed NBC News to statements Trump has made this week saying that it would be up to Ukraine and Russia to make a deal and that this meeting was merely a \u201clistening exercise\u201d that could lead to an eventual summit between the warring leaders.",
      "What\u2019s caused the most consternation in Ukraine is Trump\u2019s repeated suggestions that he could negotiate a \u201cland swap\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, having previously suggested it would be unrealistic for Ukrainians to expect the return of lands illegally invaded and currently occupied by Russia.",
      "The American president told European leaders this week that he would not discuss territory divisions during his sit-down with Putin, two European officials and three other people briefed on the call told NBC News.",
      "That\u2019s not to say opinion in Ukraine hasn\u2019t shifted. A survey by pollster Gallup this month suggested the public  now favors a negotiated solution \u2014 though the majority still reject Russia\u2019s absolutist terms.",
      "Regardless of what Trump and Putin discuss, Ukraine\u2019s absence renders the entire exercise absurd and insulting for many in the country actually under attack.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump has campaigned for a Nobel Peace Prize, pitching himself as a \"peacemaker\" as he heads into a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the Ukraine war.",
    "story": [
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska \u2014 Toward the end of Donald Trump\u2019s first term, his national security adviser turned to him in the Oval Office and said he should win the Nobel Peace Prize for his work normalizing relations between Israel and some Arab states.",
      "Another aide chimed in, saying the last president, Barack Obama, had won the award \u201cfor nothing.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s attitude was, \u2018Whatever,\u2019\u201d recalled the adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, in an interview. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t concerned about the recognition.\u201d",
      "Any whiff of indifference is now gone. Back in office, Trump and his aides are intensifying a public campaign to snag the award, citing a string of peace deals while making a case that snubbing him again would be an injustice.",
      "Day by day, the White House is amplifying Trump's role in curbing hostilities and putting out the message that this most combative of presidents is at heart a \"peacemaker.\"",
      "Aides have highlighted his role in settling disputes between Israel and Iran, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Cambodia and Thailand, and Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, promoting \"worldwide calls\" from the heads of several of those nations for Trump to win the peace prize.",
      "Trump is also touting his efforts to end a worrying conflict between two nuclear-armed combatants, India and Pakistan. He suggested he used trade as an inducement to stop the fighting, though an Indian official has denied that Trump's mediation made any difference.",
      "Speaking last month, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the president has \u201cbrokered, on average, about one peace deal or ceasefire per month during his six months in office. It\u2019s well past time that President Trump was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d she added.",
      "A difference between this term and the last is that now, \u201che actually wants it,\" a senior official in Trump\u2019s first term said about the Nobel Peace Prize, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t just want to talk about it.\u201d",
      "Now comes his best shot. On Friday, Trump will fly to Alaska for a sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin aimed at ending a war with Ukraine that has produced close to 1.5 million casualties on both sides.",
      "The odds of a breakthrough are tough, but if Trump brokers a truce on terms that are fair to Ukraine, that would be a diplomatic triumph that eluded both Obama and President Joe Biden.",
      "In the run-up to the summit, the Nobel prize has appeared to be top of mind in Trump's circle. Without prompting, Leavitt  portrayed Trump as deserving of the prize in three out of her four press briefings in July. In prior months, she hadn\u2019t brought up the award.",
      "Trump has posted about the prize a total of seven times on his social media site since his second term began, six of them in June and July. A theme of his is that while he\u2019s earned the accolade, he won\u2019t win it.",
      "\u201cThe president feels that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, but does not think he will get it,\u201d a White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe has remarked that it will go to someone who writes a book about how Donald Trump thinks rather than Donald Trump himself.\u201d",
      "In a visit to the White House in April, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re was asked about Trump\u2019s prospects of winning the award, announced annually in Oslo.",
      "He didn\u2019t bite.",
      "\u201cOn that prize, that is a committee taking care of that which is completely working on its own terms and I cannot comment on that,\u201d St\u00f8re said.",
      "Trump smiled and looked across the Cabinet Room table at the prime minister: \u201cI like that question,\u201d he said.",
      "The award is solely in the hands of the Nobel selection committee; politicians don\u2019t pick the winner. But Trump has reportedly raised the issue with Norway before. Last month, he called the country\u2019s finance minister, former NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, to talk tariffs and brought up the peace prize, a Norwegian news outlet wrote Thursday.",
      "The White House official said that the president and Stoltenberg did speak, but could not say that the conversation was focused on the prize. Stoltenberg confirmed in a statement that he spoke to Trump about tariffs but would not go into further details of the call.",
      "Trump is surrounded by reminders of past presidents who\u2019ve won what is arguably humanity\u2019s most prestigious award. Obama, whose portrait hangs in the White House, won it less than a year into his presidency and even he acknowledged at the time that his accomplishments were \u201cslight\u201d in contrast to other Nobel laureates.",
      "Just a few paces from the Oval Office, Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s Nobel Prize is on display, signifying both the challenge and opportunity that Trump faces. Roosevelt won in 1906 for bringing an end to another Russian conflict: a war with Japan.",
      "As much as he aligns himself politically with working Americans, Trump has long been attuned to elite opinion. He takes pride in recounting that his late uncle, John Trump, taught at the acclaimed Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has described his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, as \u201cthe hardest school to get into, the best school in the world.\u201d",
      "In announcing the Kennedy Center honorees on Wednesday, Trump said that he had long wanted one for himself. The president now plans to host the Kennedy Center Honors this year, teasing to reporters, \"maybe ... next year we\u2019ll honor Trump.\"",
      "A Nobel Peace Prize would be the ultimate validation.",
      "\"If the Israel-Hamas/Iran and Russia-Ukraine conflicts get resolved, there\u2019s no way that they can\u2019t give President Trump the Nobel Peace Prize,\" O'Brien said.",
      "\u201cThe Nobel committee may not like Trump,\" he added. \"They may not like his personality. They may not like his populism, but if the award has any meaning, they have to give it to him.\u201d",
      "Of course, the Nobel selection committee has its own ideas about what it takes to win. The five-member body appointed by the Norwegian parliament may be weighing other criteria apart from the peace deals the White House has tallied.",
      "In his will, Alfred Nobel stated that the prize should go to those \u201cwho shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations.\u201d",
      "Since Trump took office, some longtime U.S. allies have seen fraternal bonds fray. Trump has rolled out stiff tariffs in pursuit of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda meant to create more jobs at home. He stunned various world capitals with his calls for acquiring Greenland, Canada and the Panama Canal.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize has become something of a joke in foreign capitals,\u201d a former British diplomat said. \u201cHis claims to Canada, Panama, Greenland, etc., as well as tariff wars and the assaults on America\u2019s democratic institutions, incline governments in the opposite direction.\u201d",
      "What happens in the Nobel committee\u2019s closed-door deliberations is a closely guarded secret. The panel accepts nominations through the end of January and announces the winner in October. It waits 50 years before revealing even a list of nominees.",
      "Handicapping possible winners of the 2025 prize, a Norwegian think tank didn\u2019t mention Trump\u2019s name. The handful of front-runners the group cited included \u201cSudan\u2019s Emergency Response Rooms,\u201d the prime minister of Qatar, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, and the Women\u2019s International League for Peace & Freedom.",
      "It\u2019s far from clear that the Nobel committee is susceptible to persuasion. Pressure, publicity and coalition-building work in politics, the arena Trump knows well. But the Nobel committee is insulated from that world.",
      "The prize \u201cis not something you campaign for,\u201d a Western diplomat said. \u201cThis is a decision made by people who are independent and have their own point of view. You can\u2019t buy it. Norway doesn\u2019t need the money.\u201d",
      "Last week, Trump held a meeting at the White House with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan to mark a rapprochement between the two countries. Questioned by a reporter, both leaders plumped for Trump\u2019s Nobel candidacy.",
      "Nikol Pashinyan, prime minister of Armenia, said, \u201cWe will promote for that.\u201d",
      "Turning to Trump, he said, \u201cHopefully you will invite us\u201d to the award ceremony.",
      "\u201cFront row,\u201d Trump said."

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 The marathon national security trial of pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai is nearing conclusion in Hong Kong as President Donald Trump vowed to \u201cdo everything I can to save\u201d the media tycoon from what critics say is political persecution by Chinese authorities.",
      "Closing arguments in the landmark trial, which began in December 2023, were set to begin this week after a five-month break following the end of Lai\u2019s testimony in March. But they were postponed twice on Thursday and Friday, first due to a severe thunderstorm that closed courts and then to allow time for Lai, who has complained of heart palpitations, to receive medication and a portable heart monitor.",
      "They are expected to resume Monday and last about 10 days, with a verdict by the three handpicked judges coming in October at the earliest.",
      "Lai, a 77-year-old British citizen who is one of the Chinese territory\u2019s most prominent democrats, was arrested in August 2020 under a Beijing-imposed national security law over his role in mass anti-government protests in 2019 that sometimes turned violent. He has since spent almost 1,700 days in solitary confinement, during which time his son says his health has declined significantly.",
      "Lai has pleaded not guilty to two national security charges of conspiring to collude with foreign forces and a third count under colonial-era legislation of publishing seditious materials in Apple Daily, his now-defunct pro-democracy tabloid. If convicted, he could face life in prison.",
      "The U.S. and other governments have criticized the case as politically motivated and called for Lai\u2019s immediate release. Trump said Thursday that he would \u201cdo everything I can to save him\u201d in talks with Chinese officials, even if Chinese President Xi Jinping \u201cwould not be exactly thrilled\u201d to let him go.",
      "Trump appeared to be softening a claim he made about Lai last year, when he said on a podcast that \u201c100%, I\u2019ll get him out\u201d of China and that it would be \u201cso easy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t say 100% I\u2019d save him. I said 100% I\u2019m going to be bringing it up. And I\u2019ve already brought it up,\u201d Trump said Thursday in an interview with Fox News Radio, without giving details.",
      "The government of Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997, said Wednesday that Lai was receiving a fair trial and accused \u201cexternal forces\u201d of trying to interfere in Hong Kong courts. Hong Kong and mainland Chinese officials say the national security law and related local legislation were necessary to restore stability in the international financial hub after the protests.",
      "With a verdict still weeks away, the hearing on Friday drew fewer people than rulings and sentencings in recent cases such as the sedition trial against two Stand News journalists or the subversion trial against 47 pro-democracy politicians and activists.",
      "But members of the public still lined up hours before the hearing amid heavy police presence to secure seats in the main courtroom and catch a glimpse of Lai.",
      "First in line was local activist Lui Yuk-lin, who arrived before 1 a.m. and said she was concerned about Lai\u2019s health.",
      "\u201cHe used to have a big belly. But after many years in jail, it\u2019s now gone,\u201d said Lui, who wore a T-shirt bearing the American flag and the words \u201cLand of the Free.\u201d",
      "Members of the public gallery waved at Lai, wearing a white windbreaker and thick-rimmed black glasses, as he appeared in the courtroom Friday in a glassed-in area surrounded by four guards. Lai smiled and waved back at supporters.",
      "Western diplomats were also in attendance.",
      "During his 52 days of testimony, Lai denied allegations that he lobbied the U.S. to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China. He said that while Apple Daily held anti-communist views, he did not use the media outlet to promote Hong Kong independence.",
      "Lai also referred to himself as a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d at least twice during questioning, drawing fierce rebukes from the bench.",
      "Lai has already been convicted in three separate cases related to unauthorized assembly and is serving five years and nine months in prison over a 2022 fraud conviction, cases that have also been criticized as politically motivated.",
      "Spectators waved again as Lai exited the courtroom on Friday.",
      "\u201cI hope his family can stay strong and bold,\u201d Lui said. \u201cWe support him.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Russia's Vladimir Putin sounded positive Thursday on the eve of  his talks with President Donald Trump in Alaska, saying he believed the American leader was making \"quite energetic and sincere efforts\" toward peace in Ukraine.",
      "A day ahead of their summit, Putin convened a meeting of advisers to inform them \"about how the negotiation process on the Ukrainian crisis is going,\" the Kremlin said in a readout translated by NBC News.",
      "The Russian leader said the Trump administration is making \"quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the fighting, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict.\"",
      "Those efforts are intended \"to create long-term conditions of peace between our countries and in Europe, and in the world as a whole,\" he added, particularly if the negotiations are extended to cover strategic offensive weapons treaties.",
      "This suggests that a deal on nuclear arms control could be part of the talks. Russia suspended its participation in the New START \"reduction in strategic offensive arms\" agreement in 2023.",
      "Earlier Thursday, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov said the summit would start with head-to-head talks between Trump, Putin and their translators at 11:30 a.m. local time (3:30 p.m. ET) and would be followed by a joint news conference. The White House later confirmed this.",
      "Trump \"wants to exhaust all options to try to bring this war to a peaceful resolution,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News.",
      "The top-level Russian delegation will include Putin, Ushakov, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Putin's longtime friend and investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev, Ushakov said on a call with journalists in Moscow.",
      "The primary topic of the meeting will be Ukraine, he said, but he added that he expected the \"huge, and unfortunately hitherto untapped, potential\" of economic ties between the U.S. and Russia would also be discussed.",
      "As well as Putin's openly stated goal of subjugating Ukraine, he also wants to end Russia's exile from the Western financial system following economic sanctions imposed by Washington, the European Union and others. Trump has not yet lifted these punishments but has expressed a desire to end Russia's economic pariah status.",
      "NBC News asked Trump in a press gaggle on Thursday whether he would offer Putin access to rare earth minerals as an incentive to end the war with Ukraine.",
      "\"We\u2019re going to see what happens with our meeting. We have a big meeting. It\u2019s going to be, I think, very important for Russia, and it\u2019s going to be very important for us,\" Trump said, without offering additional details. He later added that the earth minerals are \u201cvery unimportant\u201d compared to \u201ctrying to save lives.\u201d",
      "The talks come as Ukraine marked a grim new record with 286 civilians killed and 1,388 injured in July, according to the United Nations.",
      "\u201cFor the second month in a row, the number of civilian casualties in Ukraine hits a new three-year high,\u201d Danielle Bell, the head of the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cOnly the first three months after the Russian Federation launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine saw more killed and injured than in this past month.\u201d",
      "The Trump-Putin summit has prompted howls of dismay and anxiety across Ukraine and Europe, which have not been invited to the talks and fear what the American president may agree to with his Russian counterpart about the conflict raging on their continent.",
      "They have been confined to their own diplomatic scrambling, including dozens of calls between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other leaders, culminating in a video call between these parties and Trump himself Wednesday.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Putin \u201cis bluffing\u201d in saying he wants peace.",
      "On Thursday, the Ukrainian leader flew to London and met his British counterpart, Prime Minister Keir Starmer, for what both called a \"productive meeting.\" As well as the prospect of Britain financing the small drones that have become central to Ukraine's battlefield defense, the pair discussed the Alaska talks, \"which present a viable chance to make progress as long as Putin takes action to prove he is serious about peace,\" a spokesperson from Starmer's office, No. 10 Downing St., said in a statement.",
      "After Wednesday's call with Zelenskyy, Starmer and others, Trump said he had assured them that there would be \"very severe consequences\" \u2014 without elaborating what those might be \u2014 if Putin did not agree to end the war during their sit-down discussion.",
      "Two European officials and three other people briefed on the call told NBC News that he told them he would not discuss possible divisions of territory with the man flying in from the Kremlin."

      "Trump said on the call, which also included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that he is going into the meeting with Putin with the goal of securing a ceasefire in Ukraine, those sources said.",
      "Trump and European leaders agreed that a ceasefire in Ukraine has to be implemented before peace negotiations can begin, the European officials and two other people briefed on the call said. Some of the European leaders were left with the impression from the call that Trump is not optimistic about the results of his meeting with Putin, they added.",
      "The call on Wednesday took place just days ahead of Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin, which is planned for Friday. European and Ukrainian officials have been nervous about the president\u2019s meeting with the Russian leader since he announced it last week. Among their concerns is that Trump and Putin might agree to the parameters of a peace deal, including territorial divisions, and then try to pressure Ukraine to agree to it. Trump\u2019s comments last week that there would \"be some land swapping\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, in particular, put Zelenskyy and European leaders on edge.",
      "But the two European officials and three other people briefed on Wednesday\u2019s call said all the leaders agreed that Ukraine must be included in negotiations and should be the one to decide what territorial concessions it might be willing to make. They also said the leaders were united in their belief that if Putin does not agree to a ceasefire, Trump will likely levy new sanctions on Russia.",
      "Two additional people familiar with Wednesday\u2019s call said European leaders left feeling positive about Trump\u2019s plans for his meeting with Putin. One of them said achieving a ceasefire is expected to be the priority for Trump in the meeting. The other person expressed confidence that Ukrainian territory would not be negotiated without Ukraine.",
      "A European official said there was still concern that the president could shift his position yet again once he is in the room with Putin, especially as he has so far proven reluctant to put concrete pressure on Russia and follow through on threats of additional sanctions.",
      "\u201cSometimes these positions change and get revised in a matter of hours,\u201d one European official said.",
      "European governments and Ukraine are also anxious about how the aftermath of the meeting would be handled, that European official said, and whether the details of what was discussed or agreed would be clearly explained or addressed in a joint statement.",
      "In response to a request for comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement: \"The White House does not discuss details of the President\u2019s private diplomatic conversations. However, President Trump has been clear that he wants to end this war and stop the killing, and Friday\u2019s meeting with President Putin will serve as an important moment in this process.\u201d",
      "Trump said Wednesday after the call that it was \u201cvery good\u201d and suggested that another meeting involving Zelenskyy could quickly follow his sit-down with Putin.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a very good chance that we\u2019re going to have a second meeting, which will be more productive than the first, because the first is I\u2019m going to find out where we are and what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cI would like to do it almost immediately, and we\u2019ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy and myself, if they\u2019d like to have me there.\u201d",
      "The president also said Russia will face \u201csevere consequences\u201d if Putin doesn\u2019t agree to end the war.",
      "Vice President JD Vance assured Zelenskyy and European allies on the call that the U.S. would not negotiate with Russia about a solution for the war in Ukraine without Ukraine or without Europe, according to two German government officials involved.",
      "Vance said afterward during remarks to U.S. troops at RAF Fairford in the U.K. that \u201cone of our most important shared security goals in Europe\u201d is ending the war in Ukraine."

      "Speaking with a British accent and appearing in a wheelchair, he denied that he was Alahverdian and claimed that he was an Irish orphan who had become a businessman.",
      "In his opening statement, the prosecutor in the Salt Lake County case said that Alahverdian admitted his true identity under oath last year. He accused Alahverdian of raping a 24-year-old woman in 2008 after a whirlwind romance and engagement.",
      "At trial, the victim testified that Alahverdian quickly became controlling and mean after she bought their rings and lent him money for rent. When she removed the ring and told him their relationship was over, they fought and he eventually assaulted her, she testified.",
      "Alahverdian\u2019s defense lawyer, MacKenzie Potter, compared the allegations to an \u201cold puzzle from the thrift store,\u201d saying that \u201cnot all the pieces are there.\u201d",
      "The victim\u2019s story had changed over time, Potter said, and it can\u2019t be verified.",
      "Alahverdian, who was raised in Rhode Island\u2019s foster youth system and later became an outspoken aide in that state\u2019s legislature, was previously accused or convicted in other assault and sex crimes cases involving women with whom he was in relationships.",
      "In a case in Massachusetts in 2010, a woman he was married to at the time told authorities he held her down, grabbed her neck, struck her in the face, and refused to let her leave their home following an argument over a crying baby.",
      "Alahverdian pleaded no contest to misdemeanor domestic assault and was sentenced to probation.",
      "In Ohio in 2008, a woman whom Alahverdian met on MySpace accused him of sexually assaulting her while walking to class at a local community college. He denied the allegation and was charged with public indecency and sexual imposition, a misdemeanor crime indicating sexual contact against a person\u2019s will.",
      "After a trial, Alahverdian was fined and ordered to register as a sex offender.",
      "The second Utah case, also from 2008, involves a woman who said they\u2019d started dating after they met on MySpace. An affidavit in support of an arrest warrant shows that she told authorities that she broke it off after he became increasingly aggressive and borrowed money without paying her back.",
      "On Sept. 13 of that year, she said she went to his home after he said he\u2019d pay her back, according to the affidavit. He instead raped her, according to the document.",
      "A sexual assault kit was completed the next day, authorities have said, but a backlog in testing meant that Alahverdian was not identified as a suspect until a decade later. Alahverdian has pleaded not guilty in that case."

    "summary": "European leaders including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy will hold a video call with President Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "MUNICH \u2014 President Donald Trump joined a video call Wednesday with European leaders and Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who implored him not to capitulate to Russia\u2019s demands during Friday\u2019s high-profile summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska.",
      "During a press conference at the Kennedy Center in downtown Washington, D.C., Trump described the call as a \u201cvery good conversation.\"",
      "Trump said that, after his meeting with Putin on Friday, he would call Zelenskyy as well as European leaders to update them on what was discussed. Trump said there's a \"very good chance\" that he would have a second meeting with Putin if the first one is productive.",
      "\"If the first one goes okay, we\u2019ll have a quick second one,\" he said. \"I would like to do it almost immediately, and we\u2019ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy and myself, if they\u2019d like to have me there.\"",
      "Asked what would happen if Putin doesn't agree to end the war after the meeting on Friday, Trump warned Russia would face \"very severe consequences,\" though he didn't specify what the response could entail.",
      "Despite Russia\u2019s invasion impacting them most directly, European powers and Ukraine have not been invited to the Trump-Putin summit at Anchorage\u2019s Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. There is growing alarm in Europe that the leaders from Washington and Moscow could emerge with an agreement disastrous for Ukraine and the continent\u2019s vulnerability to future Russian attack.",
      "In a week of frantic diplomacy, the virtual summit included Trump alongside the leaders of Ukraine, Germany, France, Britain, Finland, Italy, Poland, the European Union and NATO, according to the German government, which has organized the call.",
      "Zelenskyy attended the meeting in person, having touched down by helicopter in Berlin where he was greeted by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. It is the latest of what Zelenskyy says have been more than 30 conversations with world leaders this week.",
      "After the digital gaggle, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told a news conference in Berlin that the meeting had been \u201cconstructive.\u201d",
      "European leaders had \u201cmade it clear that Ukraine had to be at the table if there were any follow up meetings,\u201d and that a ceasefire had to be implemented before those talks took please, he said.",
      "Ukraine was \u201cwilling to discuss territorial questions,\u201d with Russia but \u201cillegal recognition of Russian occupied territory is not part of the discussion,\u201d he added. \u201cBorders might not be changed by violence.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy accused Putin of \"bluffing\" about his desire to end the war, saying that his Russian counterpart did care about the sanctions that were \"hurting\" his county's economy.",
      "He added that he wanted a meeting with both Trump and Putin and no talks about Ukraine should exclude Kyiv. \"Everything that concerns Ukraine should be discussed exclusively with Ukraine,\" he said.",
      "The White House is yet to comment, but ahead of the talks Trump described his European colleagues as \u201cgreat people who want to see a deal done\u201d in a Truth Social post.",
      "Most European leaders fear that Russia will not stop at the 20% of Ukraine it currently occupies following its 2022 full-scale invasion, and instead may use this land grab from which to launch further attacks on Moscow\u2019s former Soviet vassals. Putin has described the fall of the USSR as a historic tragedy, and believes the Baltic states, which are now members of the E.U. and NATO, should be brought back within his sphere of influence.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s calls are a show of European unity behind Ukraine and other Russian neighbors who fear its next move. E.U. leaders will hold separate telephone discussions before and after the call with Trump, the latter including Canada, indicating the level of coordination between them.",
      "European powers say that there must be a ceasefire before peace talks can begin \u2014 something rejected by Russia \u2014 and that negotiations cannot happen without Ukraine. They argue Ukraine must have \u201csecurity guarantees,\u201d perhaps in the form of Western peacekeepers, so the Kremlin does not use the pause to regroup and attack again."

      "In a separate statement, the Al Jazeera Media Network said al-Sharif and his colleagues were stationed opposite the Al-Shifa Hospital complex.",
      "Calling it \u201canother blatant and premeditated attack on press freedom\u201d by Israel, the statement said it was \u201ca desperate attempt to silence the voices exposing the impending seizure and occupation of Gaza.\u201d It added that it held both Israel\u2019s military and government \u201cresponsible for deliberately targeting and assassinating its journalists.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that al-Sharif was \u201cthe head of a terrorist cell in the Hamas terrorist organization and was responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops.\u201d",
      "It added that it had \u201cpreviously disclosed intelligence information and many documents found in the Gaza Strip\u201d that it said confirm that al-Sharif was a member of Hamas.",

      "\u201cAl Jazeera fear these allegations may serve as a pretext for further violence against the journalists, mirroring the tragic fates of other media professionals targeted and killed by Israeli occupation forces,\u201d the media network said at the time.",

      "This prompted the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists to warn that it was \u201cgravely worried\u201d about al-Sharif. In a statement it said he was \u201cbeing targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign, which he believes is a precursor to his assassination.\u201d",
      "Condemning the death of al-Sharif and his colleagues on Monday, CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah, accused Israel of \"murdering the messengers,\" adding that it \"made no claims that any of the other journalists were terrorists. That\u2019s murder. Plain and simple.\u201d",
      "The Committee to Protect Journalists says that at least 186 journalists have been killed in the conflict since the start of the war.",
      "In a separate statement the Foreign Press Association also said it was \"outraged.\"",
      "The U.N. human rights office also called a \"grave breach of international humanitarian law,\u201d while Philippe Lazzarini of the United Nations refugees agency said he was \"horrified\" by their deaths.",
      "Al Jazeera, a network funded by Qatar\u2019s government, said that 10 of its staff have been killed by Israel since Israel launched the war in Gaza in 2023.",
      "Among the dead was 27-year-old correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul and cameraman Rami al-Rifi, who were killed last summer. Freelancer Hossam Shabat was killed in an Israeli airstrike in March.",
      "Like al-Sharif, Shabat was among the six that Israel accused of being members of militant groups last October.",
      "Blocked in Israel, the country's forces raided Al Jazeera's offices in the occupied West Bank last year, ordering them closed.",
      "And in May 2024, Israel\u2019s government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voted to shut down the channel\u2019s local offices. Netanyahu at the time called it an incitement channel.",
      "Al Jazeera has repeatedly denied the allegations of incitement made by Israel.",
      "Israel launched the offensive in Gaza, targeting Hamas, after the Hamas-led terror attacks against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 251 people were taken hostage. Many of the targets of those attacks were civilians, including people attending a music festival.",

    "summary": "Alternative for Germany has joined France's National Rally and Reform U.K. in becoming the most popular party in its country, according to polls.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 For the first time in modern history, far-right and populist parties are simultaneously topping the polls in Europe\u2019s three main economies of Germany, France and Britain.",
      "A poll Tuesday showed Alternative for Germany \u2014 which is under surveillance by the country\u2019s intelligence services over suspected extremism \u2014 is now the most favored by voters. The survey by broadcaster RTL put the AfD at 26%, ahead of the ruling Christian Democrats at 24%.",
      "This is a high watermark for the European far right, a once fringe movement whose virulently anti-immigration, anti-Islam and culture-war politics were shunned by the mainstream just a decade ago. Today, these parties have developed deep ties with President Donald Trump and his Republican allies, who openly cite nationalists such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n as inspirations on policy and tactics.",
      "For years, France\u2019s National Rally has consistently led polls ahead of the country\u2019s next presidential election in 2027. And Britain\u2019s Reform U.K., led by Trump ally and friend Nigel Farage, has since April topped most polls there.",
      "Far-right parties have been elected over the past few years into the governments of Italy, Hungary and elsewhere. The center right and the center left have hemorrhaged votes amid high inflation, fears over immigration and collapsing faith in institutions \u2014 all familiar issues in America, too.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s polling milestone is \u201ca sign of the power of populism, disinformation and the failure of established parties to understand what is happening,\u201d said Nic Cheeseman, a professor of democracy and international development at England\u2019s University of Birmingham.",
      "Though the far right has been making gains for the past decade, Cheeseman believes the polls showing the far right leading Europe\u2019s top three economies is \u201ca first \u2014 at least in modern times.\u201d",
      "There is no guarantee that London, Berlin and Paris will be ruled by far-right parties; these countries\u2019 next elections are not until 2029, 2029 and 2027 respectively. These groups are all polling in the 20s and 30s percentage-wise, enough to lead polls in Europe\u2019s multiparty systems but not enough to govern alone outside of a coalition.",
      "Most of Europe\u2019s politicians on this former fringe reject the \u201cfar right\u201d label, with its historical connotations of the Nazism that marauded the continent 80 years ago. Many scholars say these parties nevertheless fit the academic model, defined by nativism \u2014 the idea that perceived \u201cnon-native\u201d groups threaten their social fabric \u2014 and harsh punishments for criminality.",
      "The roots of the far-right surge lie in the world financial crisis of 2008, which prompted government to cut budgets for public services and lowered living standards, some experts say, compounded by the Arab Spring of 2011 that birthed civil war in Syria and a mass refugee crisis in Europe four years later.",
      "More recent societal stressors such as the coronavirus pandemic and war in Ukraine have further increased the allure of populism, according to Hans-Jakob Schindler, the senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit international group. But populist parties in Europe have also harnessed social media more powerfully than their more centrist opponents, he said.",
      "\u201cThey are masters of using social media much better than any of the more established parties,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have easy solutions to complex problems\u201d \u2014 as he says populist parties do \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s easier to communicate than complex political issues that the actual parties, who do politics rather than just doing populism, will have to deal with.\u201d"

      "U.N.-backed investigators say they have found significant evidence of \u201csystematic torture\u201d at Myanmar detention centers, where the military government is holding children as young as 2 years old as proxies for their parents.",
      "The Southeast Asian nation of about 54 million people has been mired in turmoil since 2021, when democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi was overthrown by the military. The coup set off mass protests across the country that were violently suppressed, followed by a nationwide armed resistance movement that has displaced millions of people.",
      "Investigators said Tuesday there was evidence of \u201ca continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities\u201d across Myanmar, with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by government security forces and affiliated militias as well as armed opposition groups.",
      "That includes an increase in crimes committed against those in detention, many of whom are being held without due process, said Nicholas Koumjian, head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve documented torture against those in detention, including beatings and electric shocks, strangulations, pulling out fingernails, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,\u201d he told reporters in Geneva as his team released its annual report.",
      "Koumjian said investigators had seen evidence that children as young as 2 years old were being detained, often in place of their parents if they are accused of being associated with the opposition and cannot be found.",
      "\u201cSome of the detained children have been subjected to torture, ill-treatment or sexual and gender-based crimes,\u201d the report says.",
      "Myanmar\u2019s military government has detained about 30,000 people in the past four years, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group that tracks arrests in the country.",
      "The Myanmar military could not be reached for comment. It has denied any atrocities are taking place and blamed \u201cterrorists\u201d for unrest.",
      "The 16-page report, which covers a one-year period up to June 30, draws on more than 1,300 sources, including nearly 600 eyewitness testimonies, photographs, videos, documents, maps and forensic evidence.",
      "Koumjian said the Myanmar military appeared to be increasing its use of airstrikes as it loses control of more territory. They continued even after a devastating earthquake in March, he said, often against \u201cblatantly civilian targets\u201d such as schools, hospitals and places of worship.",
      "\u201cOften there\u2019s no military target that we can identify anywhere in the area that could have been the intent of the airstrike,\u201d he said.",
      "Koumjian said investigators were working to determine how the airstrikes were ordered, who was in the chain of command and who flew the planes.",
      "In addition, he said, there is growing evidence of crimes committed by opposition forces, including summary executions of captured fighters from other armed groups.",
      "The team is also still investigating the 2017 Rohingya refugee crisis, during which more than 700,000 people from the mostly Muslim ethnic minority fled a military crackdown in Buddhist-majority Myanmar for neighboring Bangladesh. Along with other ethnic groups, the remaining Rohingya population is again in danger as they are persecuted by the Arakan Army rebel group that now has effective control of Rakhine state, their ancestral home.",
      "Koumjian said investigators had made progress in identifying some of the people responsible for crimes in Myanmar, including commanders overseeing detention facilities, and that \u201cwe stand ready to support any jurisdictions willing and able to prosecute these crimes.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law,\u201d he said in a news release.",
      "The work of Myanmar investigators is already being used in cases before the International Criminal Court (ICC), the International Court of Justice and in Argentina. In November, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of Myanmar\u2019s military government, for crimes committed against the Rohingya.",
      "Min Aung Hlaing tightened his grip on power last month in an administrative restructuring as the junta said it was ending the state of emergency it declared in 2021. A general election is planned for December but faces a widespread boycott by critics who say it will be neither free nor fair."

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration released its new, drastically scaled-down version of the State Department\u2019s annual human rights report after months of delay Tuesday. The administration\u2019s assessment of human rights abuses in some countries, which is one-tenth as long as last year\u2019s report, reaches notably different conclusions and dedicates no sections to abuses against women or LGBTQ people.",
      "The report also places a new focus on restrictions of freedom of expression by U.S. adversaries and allies alike.",
      "Amanda Klasing, Amnesty International USA\u2019s national director of government relations and advocacy, said the Trump administration had engaged in highly selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries.",
      "\u201cWe have criticized past reports when warranted, but have never seen reports quite like this,\u201d Klasing said in a statement. \u201cNever before have the reports gone this far in prioritizing an administration\u2019s political agenda over a consistent and truthful accounting of human rights violations around the world \u2014 softening criticism in some countries while ignoring violations in others.\u201d",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce defended the administration\u2019s version of the report, which U.S. diplomats have compiled for nearly 50 years under a congressional mandate to measure countries\u2019 adherence to internationally recognized human rights.",
      "\u201cThe Human Rights Report has been restructured in a way that removes redundancy, increases report readability, and is responsive to the legislative mandates that underpin the report, rather than an expansive list of politically biased demands and assertions,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cIndividual reports are more readable, objective, true to their statutory origins, and more useful than ever before.\u201d",
      "Criticism of Europe",
      "In the United Kingdom, France, Germany and other European countries, the Trump administration concluded that the human rights situation \u201cworsened during the year.\u201d The report cited restrictions on freedom of expression, as well as reports of \u201ccrimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.\u201d",
      "In Germany, the report found \u201climits on the speech of groups it deemed extremist.\u201d In France, the State Department found \u201csome limitations on freedom of speech.\u201d And the assessment listed restrictions on political speech in the U.K. it deemed \u201chateful\u201d or \u201coffensive.\u201d",
      "The concerns were similar to those Vice President JD Vance expressed in a speech to the Munich Security Conference in February. Vance accused European Union leaders of suppressing free speech, particularly that off far-right groups.",
      "Asked by reporters about the Trump administration\u2019s review of visa applicants\u2019 social media accounts, Bruce said: \u201cWe consider freedom of expression to be a foundational component of a functioning democracy. Societies are strengthened by free expression of opinion and government censorship is intolerable in a free society.\u201d",
      "Support for Brazil's former president",
      "The human rights situation also declined in Brazil last year, the Trump administration concluded, citing court rulings that it called \u201cbroad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe government undermined democratic debate by restricting access to online content deemed to \u2018undermine democracy,\u2019 disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro as well as journalists and elected politicians, often in secret proceedings that lacked due process guarantees,\u201d the report says.",
      "Bolsonaro is currently on trial for allegedly plotting to assassinate his rivals to remain in office despite his loss in the 2022 election.",
      "The report also criticizes Supreme Federal Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who has overseen Bolsonaro\u2019s court case, saying he \u201cpersonally ordered the suspension of more than 100 user profiles on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), disproportionately suppressing the speech of advocates of former president Jair Bolsonaro.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently sanctioned de Moraes, revoking U.S. visas for him and members of his family.",
      "Questioning a South African law",
      "The report found the human rights situation had \u201csignificantly worsened\u201d in South Africa, which Trump has repeatedly criticized since he returned to office. That was in sharp contrast with the State Department human rights report the Biden administration issued last year, which found no significant changes in human rights in South Africa.",
      "The report called the Expropriation Act, a law that attempts to address the disparity in land ownership between white and Black South Africans, \u201ca substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has publicly decried the law, which allows the South African government to expropriate land \u2014 in some cases without compensation \u2014 in instances where it is unused or there is a public interest in its redistribution. Earlier this year, the administration resettled 59 white South Africans as refugees in the United States as it blocked refugee admissions from almost all other countries.",
      "\u201cThe government did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,\u201d the report said, \u201cincluding inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.\u201d",
      "No 'significant' abuses in El Salvador",
      "The report said that in El Salvador, which imprisoned hundreds of migrants from the United States at the request of the Trump administration, there were \u201cno credible reports of significant human rights abuses.\u201d",
      "But several Venezuelan migrants who had been imprisoned in El Salvador\u2019s notorious CECOT prison told NBC News they had experienced physical and psychological torture. One man said he was sexually assaulted.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s human rights report on El Salvador last year was four times longer than the Trump administration\u2019s. It listed several significant human rights issues in the country, including credible reports of \u201cunlawful or arbitrary killings; enforced disappearance; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by security forces and harsh and life-threatening prison conditions.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s report also removed the section on Indigenous peoples and made no mention of elections or political participation in El Salvador.",
      "Shorter passages on Israel, the West Bank and Gaza",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s reports on Israel, the West Bank and Gaza were also dramatically shorter and had significantly less documentation of abuses by the Israeli government, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas than the Biden administration reports did last year.",
      "In assessing Israel, the Trump administration cited reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, enforced disappearance and degrading treatment of Palestinians by Israeli officials but emphasized that they resulted from the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas. The State Department\u2019s findings also concluded that the Israeli government \u201ctook several credible steps to identify officials who committed human rights abuses, with multiple trials pending at year\u2019s end.\u201d",
      "The report listed significant human rights abuses by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, including \u201carbitrary or unlawful killings; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; arbitrary arrest or detention; serious restrictions on freedom of expression and trafficking in persons, including forced labor; and existence of the worst forms of child labor.\u201d",
      "The report also included a detailed description of abuses by Hamas in Gaza, including, \u201cunlawful killings, severe physical abuses and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d",
      "Regarding human rights abuses by Israeli security forces in the West Bank and Gaza, the report said simply that \u201cthere have been reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings; and serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom.\u201d But it again added that \u201cIsraeli authorities took steps to identify and punish officials or civilians accused of committing human rights abuses.\u201d And it did point out that human rights groups \u201cfrequently criticized authorities for not adequately pursuing investigations and disciplinary actions.\u201d",
      "The report made no direct mention of the Israeli government\u2019s restrictions on humanitarian aid into Gaza or documented reports of starvation among some Palestinians this year. But it did highlight that in the West Bank, incidents of Israeli violence against Palestinians and their property reached their highest daily average figure since the United Nations started recording data in 2005.",
      "War crimes allegations against Russia",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s assessment of human rights in Russia is less than half as long as the same assessment in the Biden administration\u2019s report. Both reports cited allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity and abuses by Russian forces and officials in the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "The assessment also pointed to human rights groups\u2019 concerns domestically, among them that Russian officials used new laws to punish dissent and limit independent expression. It did not dedicate a section to Russian government corruption as the Biden administration did.",
      "The new report said that \u201cRussia\u2019s occupation and purported annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and four oblasts in eastern Ukraine affected significantly and negatively the human rights situation there.\u201d It also described \u201ccredible reports of politically motivated arrests, detentions, and trials of Ukrainian citizens in Russia, many of whom claimed to have been tortured.\u201d",
      "It also called the deportation of thousands of civilians to Russia, including children, a crime against humanity."

      "Heartbreaking images of children starving in Gaza have caused what some Jewish Americans call a \u201crupture\u201d between supporters of Israel\u2019s offensive in its current form and those who oppose how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government is managing the war.",
      "Frustrated by the bloodshed, pressure is mounting on the United States and the international community to take better control of chaotic food distribution sites.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing not only divisiveness, but hatred between us, and that\u2019s not a good thing for the future,\u201d said Rabbi Erez Sherman of Sinai Temple, a Conservative synagogue in Los Angeles. \u201cSo how do we not solve it? How do we work on that?\u201d",
      "But support for Israel remains ironclad among many American Jewish groups and rabbis, who argue that Hamas is preventing humanitarian aid from reaching innocent civilians.",
      "\u201cIsrael has facilitated an extraordinary amount of aid to Palestinians in Gaza, in wartime, and that\u2019s really an unprecedented situation,\u201d said Belle Etra Yoeli, spokesperson for the American Jewish Committee, which recently ran a full-page ad in The New York Times with the image of an Israeli hostage who remains in Hamas custody.",
      "\u201cThe Palestinian civilians who have been caught in the crossfire throughout this entire war because of Hamas\u2019 actions should not be suffering,\u201d she added. \u201cIsrael doesn\u2019t want that.\u201d",
      "Nearly 1,400 people have been killed and more than 4,000 have been injured seeking food in Gaza, the United Nations\u2019 Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said last week.",
      "At least 859 people have been killed near sites operated by Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, or GHF, a controversial American- and Israeli-backed organization, the United Nations said.",
      "The foundation's executive director, Johnnie Moore, said Hamas is largely responsible for the killings and dismissed news reports about people dying by Israeli gunfire.",
      "\u201cWe have not seen the Israeli military do anything that remotely aligns with some of these accusations,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt is a quite evident fact that Hamas has killed intentionally probably hundreds of people in proximity not to just our sites, to U.N. distribution sites, as a means of sort of misattributing those attacks either to the IDF or to being in proximity to GHF,\u201d he added, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "To address escalating concerns over the humanitarian crisis, synagogues across Jewish movements in the United States have organized roundtables with the executive director of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "At an event with GHF hosted last month by Sinai Temple in Los Angeles, reactions were mixed, according to Sherman, the rabbi, who led the discussion.",
      "Some people were shocked that an organization that has come under so much criticism was allowed to present its case. Others appreciated hearing directly from people on the ground.",
      "\u201cHow do you block evil from your midst while also feeding the hungry and supporting the orphan and widow?\u201d Sherman said after the roundtable, referring to Psalm 146. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s an impossible task, and I give credit to somebody who is at least trying to do that.\u201d",
      "Polling suggests Jewish Americans are divided over Netanyahu\u2019s handling of the war. According to a Pew Research Center report, 53% of Jewish Americans say they lack confidence in his leadership, while 45% say they have confidence. About 6 million Jews live in the United States, or 2% of the population, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "The poll was conducted in April, before GHF began its operations in Gaza.",
      "Supporters of Netanyahu\u2019s government, including several Jewish American organizations, have said Hamas is spreading misleading information about who is to blame for ongoing violence at aid sites, a claim Hamas has repeatedly denied. They have also criticized detractors for losing focus on the remaining Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas.",
      "\u201cAll of this can just be stopped anytime if Hamas puts down its weapons,\u201d said Orthodox Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization that supports Netanyahu\u2019s government.",
      "An emerging concern echoed by several organizations and rabbis is that Netanyahu\u2019s position is not creating a safer Israel or global environment for Jewish people. Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of nonprofit advocacy organization J Street, said the ongoing violence is exposing Israelis and Palestinians to unnecessary bloodshed.",
      "J Street, which supports a two-state solution, opposed Netanyahu years before the war.",
      "\u201cIf you say to people you must be pro-Palestinian or pro-Israel, then we\u2019re condemning ourselves and our kids to a never-ending conflict,\u201d Ben-Ami said Monday.",
      "But according to Rabbi Ari Lev Fornari of Kol Tzedek, a Reconstructionist synagogue in Philadelphia, the war is creating an \u201cexistential rupture\u201d that is pitting friends and family members against one another.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s catastrophic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re wrestling with the very question \u2018Do we belong to each other?\u2019\u201d",
      "Fornari was among more than 40 people arrested outside Trump Tower in a rally organized by IfNotNow, a group that opposes the war in Gaza Strip, in New York City earlier this month as they shouted for the United States to stop arming Israel and feed Gaza. He was arrested for investigation of blocking traffic and obstruction, his third arrest since the war started on Oct. 7, 2023, he said.",
      "Some posters and signs displayed outside Trump Tower referred to an ancient maxim about the moral obligation to speak out against injustice, Fornari said.",
      "\u201cIt says anyone who has the power to speak out and chooses not to do so is responsible for it,\u201d he said.",
      "Rabbi Jill Jacobs, the CEO of T\u2019ruah, a rabbinic human rights organization, said she supported Israel\u2019s military response to Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack in 2023, which killed 1,200 people and led to the taking of 250 hostages. The strike, the worst one-day attack on Jews since the Holocaust, shocked the world.",
      "Since then, more than 61,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, and much of the territory has been destroyed.",
      "Jacobs began questioning Netanyahu\u2019s strategy as more and more civilians in Gaza were killed, she said. In July, she denounced American Jewish leaders who had not spoken out against the humanitarian crisis unfolding thousands of miles away.",
      "\u201cPrivately, Jewish lay leaders are anguished over Gaza. Publicly, they fear being labeled antisemitic,\u201d she wrote in an opinion column in The Forward, a Jewish American newspaper.",
      "Jacobs has been called antisemitic by other Jewish people who support Netanyahu and shunned by legacy Jewish organizations, she said. Some of it, she said, comes from a legitimate fear of prejudice.",
      "In May, two Israeli Embassy staffers were killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., and a Colorado pro-Israeli hostages group was attacked with two Molotov cocktails in June. There have also been reports of anti-Jewish slurs and signs at college campuses and pro-Palestinian protests across the country.",
      "The cultural fallout has been playing out in living rooms and across kitchen tables. Sonya Meyerson-Knox, a spokesperson for the anti-Zionist group Jewish Voice for Peace, which has opposed the war since 2023, said a member was uninvited to Shabbat family dinners because of differing opinions about the war.",
      "The group was suspended from several campuses, including Columbia University\u2019s, over allegations it intimidated Jewish students and made them feel unsafe during pro-Palestinian protests last year. Jewish Voice for Peace maintains that its views are not antisemitic.",
      "\u201cIt is not unique in Jewish history for Jews to be in fierce disagreement with each other,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is unique is that there seems to be an effort to weaponize one-half of our community against the other.\u201d"
