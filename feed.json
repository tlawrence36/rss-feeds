      "The largest-ever exhibition of Queen Elizabeth II's fashion is set to open at Buckingham Palace next year to mark her birth centenary",
      "LONDON -- The largest-ever exhibition of the late Queen Elizabeth II's fashion, including the opulent gowns she wore for her wedding and coronation, will go on display at Buckingham Palace next year to mark the centenary of her birth, officials said Tuesday.",
      "The landmark royal exhibition will feature some 200 items \u2014 about half of them never publicly displayed before \u2014 that chart the monarch's life and her historic 70-year reign.",
      "Elizabeth, who died in September 2022 at 96, was the longest-reigning monarch Britain has ever known, and her clothing archive is considered one of the most important collections of 20th-century British fashion. She would have celebrated her 100th birthday on April 21, 2026.",
      "Highlights include a tulle bridesmaid dress worn by an 8-year-old Princess Elizabeth in 1934 and many beautifully tailored couture dresses by the monarch's most influential designer, Norman Hartnell.",
      "Hartnell was the man behind an apple-green gown the queen wore for a state banquet given for U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower in Washington, D.C. in 1957; a pastel blue gown with matching jacket that Elizabeth wore for her sister Princess Margaret's 1960 wedding; as well as the queen's own wedding and coronation dresses.",
      "Visitors to the exhibition will also see items from Elizabeth's private, off-duty wardrobe, from her riding clothes and Harris tweed jackets to raincoats and headscarves, as well as design sketches and fabric samples that give an insight into the process of dressing her.",

      "\u201cQueen Elizabeth II\u2019s wardrobe is one of the most significant living archives in modern fashion history.

      "In the last few years, the Grammy Awards have made a concerted effort to diversify its electorate",
      "NEW YORK -- In the last few years, the Grammy Awards have made a concerted effort to diversify its electorate. In 2024, the Recording Academy revealed significant changes to its evolving voting body, saying 66% of voters joined in the previous five years, a number of whom were women and people of color. This year, there's even more movement: For the first time ever, all Latin Grammy voting members were invited to join the Recording Academy as part of its 2025 new member class.",
      "The Latin Grammys are a licensee of the Grammys and follow a similar voting process. But while the Grammys focus on the U.S. market, the Latin Grammys have global considerations, according to Latin Recording Academy CEO Manuel Abud. The Recording Academy also has a number of members on the Latin Grammys board.",
      "The results are notable: There are 3,800 new Recording Academy members in 2025. Half \u2014 50% \u2014 are 39 and under, 58% are people of color and 35% identify as women.",
      "And in that group, there are approximately 2,900 new Grammy voting members. Nearly half, 49%, are 39 and under; 60% are people of color and 30% identify as women.",
      "Over the last few years, Latin music has been skyrocketing in popularity, routinely celebrated as one of the fastest growing streaming genres in the United States.",
      "\u201cThe addition of many Latin Recording Academy voting members underscores that music has no borders and that our mission to serve music people, regardless of where they are from, is stronger than ever,\u201d Harvey Mason jr., academy president and CEO, wrote in a statement. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for our members\u2019 passion and hard work to shine through in this year\u2019s nominations.\u201d",

      "In 2024, Mason jr. told The Associated Press that the Recording Academy sought to increase its voting body by reaching out to different, underrepresented communities. \u201cLet\u2019s take the time to understand why those people aren\u2019t engaging with us, figure out how we can fix that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd once we fixed it, then let\u2019s invite them or ask them if they would like to be a part of our organization.

      "Lee Soo Man spent three decades trying to bring K-pop into the global market, often bending but never breaking his vision",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Lee Soo Man resisted the title at first. \u201cKing of K-pop\u201d sounded too brash, too nightclub-esque \u2014 like something you\u2019d see on a neon sign in Itaewon, a nightlife neighborhood in the South Korean capital Seoul once popular with U.S. soldiers and foreign visitors. \u201cI asked them, \u2018Couldn\u2019t it be Father of K-pop?\u2019\u201d the 73-year-old recalled during a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "He was discussing the title of Amazon Prime's documentary about his career. The producers insisted the bolder moniker would resonate better with American audiences. After some back-and-forth, Lee relented. \u201cI had to follow their decision.\u201d",
      "The compromise speaks to Lee\u2019s pragmatic approach to breaking South Korean acts into the American mainstream \u2014 a three-decade quest that often required him to bend but never break his vision. Now, as the founder of SM Entertainment and widely credited as the architect of K-pop\u2019s global expansion, Lee will be inducted into the Asian Hall of Fame on Saturday alongside basketball legend Yao Ming, Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan, and rock icon Yoshiki, among others.",
      "Lee remains a prominent but controversial figure in K-pop history. His label pioneered the industry\u2019s intensive training system, recruiting performers as young as elementary school age and putting them through years of rigorous preparation. Some of his artists have challenged their contracts as unfair, sparking broader debates about industry practices.",
      "The recognition arrives as Lee reemerges into the spotlight after a contentious, high-profile departure from the agency he founded in 1995 \u2014 a management battle that included a public feud with his nephew-in-law and a bidding war over his shares. He\u2019s been keeping busy since, debuting a new band, A2O MAY, in both China and the U.S. He's also investing in a boutique Chinese firm\u2019s high-tech production technologies.",
      "Born in South Korea, Lee studied computer engineering in the U.S. for his master's degree. That technical background would later inform his approach to everything from visualization and cutting-edge production technologies \u2014 he said he\u2019s been rewatching \"The Matrix\u201d to revisit filming techniques \u2014 to pioneering elaborate \u201cworldviews\u201d and virtual avatars for his K-pop bands.",
      "For Lee, the Hall of Fame honor \u201cconfirms that K-pop has become a genre that the mainstream is now paying attention to\u201d \u2014 an acceptance that came after costly lessons and years of trial and error.",
      "Lee invested about $5 million in BoA\u2019s 2009 American debut with \u201cEat You Up,\u201d one of the first songs by a South Korean artist to be primarily written and produced by Western producers \u2014 a bold early attempt to bring K-pop into the U.S. mainstream. But with few widely recognized Asian artists in American pop culture at the time, the market wasn\u2019t ready. After nearly two years, BoA \u2014 already a megastar in Korea and Japan \u2014 decided to return home. The experience, Lee has said, left him with lasting regrets.",
      "\u201cWhen I asked the songwriter(s) to revise \u2018Eat You Up,\u2019 they refused,\u201d Lee recalled. \u201cIf we had changed it, I believe it would have achieved much better results.\u201d",
      "That setback taught Lee that K-pop needed to source global talent while maintaining creative control to adapt songs for the worldwide market. His quest for the perfect tracks took him worldwide.",
      "\u201cI once heard a song that was so good I couldn\u2019t let it go,\u201d he said, recalling the track that would later become \u201cDreams Come True\u201d for S.E.S., the late-1990s girl group. \u201cI could\u2019ve bought the license to the song in South Korea, Hong Kong, or Sweden. But I wanted to play it safe, so I found the Finnish address, went to meet the songwriter directly, wrote up a contract, and brought it back.\u201d",
      "At the time, top Western songwriters prioritized Japan, the world\u2019s second-largest music market. \u201cEuropean songwriters were willing to sell to Asia,\u201d Lee explained. \u201cThat\u2019s how we eventually built a system where music from Europe, Asia, and America could come together.\u201d",
      "That fusion became K-pop\u2019s signature. Lee also helped to pioneer another innovation: elaborate fictional universes, or \u201cworldviews,\u201d for groups like EXO and aespa \u2014 a storytelling approach that would later be adopted across the industry, including by groups like BTS.",
      "The concept emerged during his time in the U.S., where he witnessed MTV transform music into a visual medium. \u201cBut we only have three or four minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we express dramatic, cinematic elements in such a short time?\u201d",

      "The documentary also addressed darker aspects of K-pop close to Lee\u2019s heart, including the suicides of SM Entertainment artists.",
      "He traces the problem to anonymous and malicious online comments that often evade accountability, especially when posted on servers outside South Korea\u2019s jurisdiction, calling it a global issue requiring international cooperation. Lee advocates for worldwide standards on user verification and mediation systems where victims could identify attackers without expensive legal battles.",
      "But Lee resists the media\u2019s focus on K-pop\u2019s problems. \u201cShould we always weigh the dark side equally with the bright side, the future?\u201d he asked. \u201cMedia should consider whether K-pop represents more future or more past that holds us back. Rather than just discussing the dark side and dragging us down by clinging to the past, shouldn\u2019t we talk more about the future?\u201d",
      "After more than three decades, Lee\u2019s definition remains straightforward: \u201cK-pop is a new language of communication that transcends barriers. These languages move around naturally \u2014 what you can\u2019t stop is culture.\u201d",

      "No one is bigger than the monarchy. Not even the king\u2019s brother.",
      "In the end, that reality spelled the end of Andrew\u2019s life as a prince of the realm.",
      "As details of Andrew\u2019s links to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein continued to dribble out and Parliament raised questions about his rent-free residence at a sprawling country house near Windsor Castle, King Charles III moved Thursday to shield the monarchy from any further revelations.",
      "In a statement issued by Buckingham Palace, the king said he had taken steps to strip his brother of all his titles and honors, including the one he has held since birth \u2014 prince. From now on, the scandal-plagued British royal will be known simply as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.",
      "Andrew is also being forced to move out of Royal Lodge, the 30-room mansion near Windsor Castle where he has lived for more than 20 years.",
      "\u201cThe monarchy needed to draw the thickest line they could between Andrew and the rest of the royal family,\u2019\u2019 said Craig Prescott, an expert on constitutional law and the monarchy at Royal Holloway, University of London. \u201cAnd he\u2019s precisely done that.\u201d",
      "The king\u2019s decision came after the announcement earlier this month that Andrew had agreed to stop using the titles failed to stanch the flood of tawdry stories that threaten to weaken support for the monarchy. Far from ending the media frenzy, the earlier move spurred calls from some members of Parliament that Andrew be formally stripped of his titles and evicted from Royal Lodge.",
      "That raised the prospect of a parliamentary debate on Andrew\u2019s conduct that would have subjected the royal family to even more unwanted publicity.",
      "Andrew\u2019s disgrace comes as Charles, who is 76 and undergoing treatment for an undisclosed form of cancer, works to resolve stubborn problems and buttress the foundations of the monarchy for his elder son, Prince William, to inherit.",
      "\u201cThis, I think, was a very clear statement of what had to be done to get the house in order (now) and also going forward for the future,\u201d said George Gross, a royal expert at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThat makes life easier for Prince William \u2026 I think that\u2019s also part of it. But it felt inevitable.\u201d",
      "While the king\u2019s decision may help shield the monarchy from the fallout from the scandal, it won\u2019t end Andrew\u2019s problems.",
      "The latest round of stories about Andrew was triggered by the publication of a memoir written by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that she was trafficked by Epstein and had sex with Andrew when she was 17. Giuffre, an American living in Australia, took her own life earlier this year.",
      "Her brother, Sky Roberts, on Thursday lauded his sister\u2019s long fight to expose Epstein and Andrew, but continued to call for the king\u2019s brother to be prosecuted.",
      "Andrew has repeatedly denied having sex with Giuffre or committing any crimes.",

The buyer was reported to be Timur Kulibayev, son-in-law of Nursultan Nazarbayev, then-president of Kazakhstan, raising concerns that the deal was an attempt to buy influence in Britain.",

      "That became untenable in November 2019, after Andrew gave a disastrous interview to the BBC in an effort to counter media reports about his friendship with Epstein. He was widely criticized for failing to show empathy for Epstein\u2019s victims and for offering unbelievable explanations for his friendship with the disgraced financier.",

    "story": [
      "Florence Welch explores her desire for greatness and the constraints she faces as a female artist in Florence + the Machine's sixth album, \"Everybody Scream.\"",
      "During his acceptance speech for best actor at this year\u2019s Screen Actors Guild Awards, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet made known his desire to be remembered as \u201cone of the greats.\u201d A few years earlier, Chalamet starred in Greta Gerwig\u2019s adaptation of \u201cLittle Women,\u201d in which his character demonstratively asks his future wife, \u201cWhat women are allowed into the club of geniuses, anyway?\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody Scream,\u201d Florence + the Machine\u2019s sixth album, is a response to that familiar, gendered notion. Across its 12 tracks, Florence Welch contends with both her desire for greatness and the constraints she understands to have been put on her as a female artist.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if Welch had Chalamet\u2019s viral speech in mind when writing, \u201cOne of the Greats,\u201d the album\u2019s lead single. But what is apparent in her brooding feminist treatise are grievances about sexism and male entitlement. \u201cIt must be nice to be a man and make boring music just because you can,\u201d she belts over gothic synths and strings. But it's a bit funny, too: \"Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m a fan, you\u2019re my second favorite frontman.\u201d",
      "Welch collaborated with Mark Bowen of IDLES for much of the record, as well as Mitski and Aaron Dessner of The National. Sometimes the collaborations create a haunting sound, but most of \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d is packed with the band's signature orchestral pop, an ornate arrangement of strings, synths, guitars, pianos and percussion.",
      "Perhaps to a fault, \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d isn\u2019t sonically dissimilar from what fans of Florence + the Machine have come to expect. But in a lyrical shift, Welch meditates heavily on mysticism and witchcraft throughout, something she turned to after suffering a nearly fatal ectopic pregnancy in 2023. The 39-year-old later revealed that she performed with a burst fallopian tube during her last tour and had to undergo emergency surgery.",
      "\u201cI sit in salt water/Call in a vision of my daughter/Light a candle/Place my grief upon the altar,\u201d her voice vibrates over haunting background vocals and an eerie electric guitar on \u201cYou Can Have It All.\u201d",
      "The record is reminiscent of Halsey\u2019s 2021 concept album, \u201cIf I Can\u2019t Have Love, I Want Power,\u201d where femininity and motherhood are juxtaposed with influence, respect and violence.",
      "There\u2019s a similar rawness to Welch\u2019s poetry, as she grapples with mortality and ambition. But, like life, it\u2019s also accompanied by the mundane. \u201cDownloading \u2018Revelations of Divine Love\u2019 on my phone/Trying to read but getting distracted/Trying to live but feeling so damaged,\u201d she sings on \u201cPerfume and Milk,\u201d one of the more austere songs on the album.",
      "As a concept, \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d is stellar. There\u2019s a sonic and thematic unity to the album and its Halloween release makes perfect sense.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The head of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s drug center abruptly resigned Sunday after federal officials began reviewing \u201cserious concerns about his personal conduct,\u201d according to a government spokesperson.",
      "Dr. George Tidmarsh, who was named to the FDA post in July, was placed on leave Friday after officials in the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of General Counsel were notified of the issues, HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard said in an email. Tidmarsh then resigned Sunday morning.",
      "\u201cSecretary Kennedy expects the highest ethical standards from all individuals serving under his leadership and remains committed to full transparency,\u201d Hilliard said.",
      "The departure came the same day that a drugmaker connected to one of Tidmarsh\u2019s former business associates filed a lawsuit alleging that he made \u201cfalse and defamatory statements,\u201d during his time at the FDA.",
      "The lawsuit, brought by Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, alleges that Tidmarsh used his FDA position to pursue a \u201clongstanding personal vendetta\u201d against the chair of the company\u2019s board of directors, Kevin Tang.",
      "Tang previously served as a board member of several drugmakers where Tidmarsh was an executive, including La Jolla Pharmaceutical, and was involved in his ouster from those leadership positions, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Messages placed to Tidmarsh and his lawyer were not immediately returned late Sunday.",
      "Tidmarsh founded and led a series of pharmaceutical companies over several decades working in California's pharmaceutical and biotech industries. Before joining the FDA, he also served as an adjunct professor at Stanford University. He was recruited to join the agency over the summer after meeting with FDA Commissioner Marty Makary.",
      "Tidmarsh\u2019s ouster is the latest in a string of haphazard leadership changes at the agency, which has been rocked for months by firings, departures and controversial decisions on vaccines, fluoride and other products.",
      "Dr. Vinay Prasad, who oversees FDA\u2019s vaccine and biologics center, resigned in July after coming under fire from conservative activists close to President Donald Trump, only to rejoin the agency two weeks later at the behest of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "The FDA\u2019s drug center, which Tidmarsh oversaw, has lost more than 1,000 staffers over the past year to layoffs or resignations, according to agency figures. The center is the largest division of the FDA and is responsible for the review, safety and quality control of prescription and over-the-counter medicines.",

      "McConnell, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, said the Trump administration must either make a full payment by that day or, if it decides to tap $3 billion in a contingency fund, figure out how to do that by Wednesday.",
      "The delay in SNAP payments, a major piece of the nation's social safety net that serves about 42 million people, has highlighted the financial vulnerabilities that many face. At the Bronx food pantry, the Rev. John Udo-Okon said \u201cpeople from all walks of life\u201d are seeking help now.",

      "The government shutdown has been a source of anxiety for educators, wondering how long grant money will last and who can help them interpret federal laws",
      "WASHINGTON -- The government shutdown has been a source of anxiety for school leaders wondering how long grant money will last and who can help them interpret federal laws. For Education Secretary Linda McMahon, it offers a preview of what she hopes to make permanent.",
      "Much of the department\u2019s work has gone completely cold. No new grants are being awarded, and civil rights investigations have been halted. Money is still flowing for key programs, but in many respects, schools and states are on their own.",
      "That\u2019s the vision President Donald Trump has promoted since his presidential campaign \u2014 a world where states fully have the reins of education policy with little or no influence from the federal government.",
      "Even before the shutdown, mass layoffs had left the agency with 2,400 employees, down from 4,100 when Trump took office. Remaining workers have mostly been furloughed during the budget impasse, leaving some 330 who are responsible for carrying out duties that are deemed essential.",
      "In a recent social media post, McMahon said the shutdown proves her department is unnecessary. \u201cTwo weeks in, millions of American students are still going to school, teachers are getting paid, and schools are operating as normal,\u201d McMahon wrote.",
      "She offered a more direct assessment days later, after the agency hit its 46th year: \u201cWe don\u2019t need a birthday cake,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe need an eviction notice.\u201d",
      "Some say the shutdown's impact has been more significant. They warn that funding for preschool centers and school meals is running out, and students with disabilities might not be getting the help they need.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the impact so far.",
      "Most of the billions of dollars the Education Department steers to schools each year went out the door in October, leaving schools funded until July.",
      "Other programs that aren\u2019t funded in advance face more uncertainty. That includes federally funded Head Start preschool centers and school nutrition programs funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said Julia Martin, director of policy and government affairs at the Bruman Group, an education law firm.",
      "Districts are required to cover the cost of school meals and then seek reimbursement from the Department of Agriculture, but the agency said it only has two months of reimbursements left amid the shutdown.",
      "\u201cDistricts are really worried that they\u2019re going to have to dig deep into their pockets to fund meals,\u201d Martin said.",
      "The last remnants of federal COVID-19 aid are still being released by the Education Department, but reimbursements have slowed with fewer staff reviewing the requests, Martin said.",
      "America\u2019s public schools are primarily funded by states and cities, but federal funding plays an important role. The billions sent already to schools include grants to help low-income students, those with disabilities and other populations.",
      "Grant competitions to award smaller amounts of money have largely frozen. Schools and states that already received grants can keep spending them down, but all new grantmaking has ceased, the department said. At the college level, federal Pell grants for low-income students are still flowing, and the FAFSA financial aid form is still being processed.",
      "Ordinarily, states and schools rely on the department to answer questions on a wide range of topics \u2014 from special education laws to statewide academic assessments to laws requiring public schools to provide certain services to students at private schools.",

It maintains \u201cvery regular\u201d communication with states to field questions on coordinating aid to families and eliminating waitlists, said Katy Neas, CEO of The Arc of the United States, a disability rights group.",

In August, the department rescinded 2015 guidance explaining schools\u2019 legal obligations to students who are learning English. But with no new guidance replacing it before the government shutdown, schools have questions about their responsibilities, said Martin, of the Bruman law firm.",

      "Two new deaths and seven more illnesses have been reported in an expanding outbreak of listeria food poisoning tied to recalled pasta meals sold at grocery stores including Walmart and Trader Joe's in many states.",
      "In total, at least six people have died and 27 have been sickened in 18 states in the outbreak that began in August 2024. The latest illnesses occurred in September and October, with the most recent on Oct. 16, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The new deaths were reported in Hawaii and Oregon, the CDC said. Previous deaths were reported in Illinois, Michigan, Texas and Utah. One person who became ill was pregnant and it resulted in the death of a fetus.",
      "The outbreak has been traced to precooked pasta produced by Nate's Fine Foods of Roseville, California. In September, the company recalled nearly 245,000 pounds (111,130 kilograms) of pasta, including cases of linguine, fettuccine, penne and other products sold to large producers of heat-and-eat meals and pasta salads.",
      "The move came after tests showed that pasta made by Nate's Fine Foods contained the same strain of listeria found in chicken fettuccine Alfredo and meatball linguine products identified in the outbreak. FreshRealm, the San Clemente, California, company that produced those meals, used genetic sequencing to confirm the link to the outbreak.",
      "Several national grocery stores have recalled dozens of products made with the affected pasta. People should check their refrigerators and freezers for the recalled foods and throw them away or return them to stores for a refund, officials said.",

      "Bill Swick, who has a rare degenerative brain disease, has lost access to virtual speech therapy due to the federal government shutdown",
      "MINOOKA, Ill. -- Bill Swick has a rare degenerative brain disease that inhibits his mobility and speech. Instead of the hassle of traveling an hour to a clinic in downtown Chicago to visit a speech therapist, he has benefited from virtual appointments from the comfort of his home.",
      "But Swick, 53, hasn\u2019t had access to those appointments for the last month.",
      "The federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week, halted funding for the Medicare telehealth program that pays his provider for her services. So, Swick and his wife are practicing old strategies rather than learning new skills to manage his growing difficulties with processing language, connecting words and pacing himself while speaking.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because we want to continue with his journey, with his progress,\u201d 45-year-old Martha Swick, a caregiver for her husband since his diagnosis three years ago, said during an interview at their home in Minooka, Illinois. \u201cI try to have all his therapy and everything organized for him, to make his day easier and smoother, and then everything has a hitch, and we have to stop and wait.\u201d",
      "Their experience has become common in recent weeks among the millions of patients with Medicare fee-for-service plans who count on pandemic-era telehealth waivers to attend medical appointments from home.",
      "With Congress unable to agree on a deal to fund the government, the waivers have lapsed, even with support from Republicans and Democrats. As a result, medical providers are deciding whether they can continue offering telehealth services without the guarantee of reimbursement or whether they need to halt virtual visits altogether.",
      "That\u2019s left a patient population of mostly older adults with fewer options to seek specialists or get help when they can\u2019t physically travel far from home.",
      "Swick, whose corticobasal degeneration causes symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease, can\u2019t feed or dress himself anymore and struggles with balance and walking. Add on the logistical nightmare of driving to the city in traffic, and in-person speech therapy appointments aren\u2019t a worthwhile ordeal for him and his wife.",
      "But missing even a few appointments can impede progress for patients with dementia and other degenerative conditions who depend on continuity of care, experts said.",
      "It \u201cfeels like you\u2019re taking a step back,\u201d Swick said in the interview.",
      "Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Medicare only paid for virtual medical appointments under narrow circumstances, including in designated rural areas and when patients logged in from eligible sites, like hospitals and clinics.",
      "That changed in 2020, when Trump\u2019s first administration dramatically expanded telehealth coverage in response to the public health emergency. Medicare started reimbursing a wide range of telehealth visits, stripping the geographic requirement, and allowing patients to take calls from their homes.",
      "Congress has routinely extended the telehealth flexibilities and was poised to do so again before their Sept. 30 expiration. But when budget negotiations stalled and the government shut down Oct. 1, the vote never happened, leaving the program temporarily unfunded.",
      "With more than 4 million Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries using telehealth in the first half of 2025, according to Brown University\u2019s School of Public Health, the pause has had a major impact on an already vulnerable population.",
      "Swick\u2019s speech therapy services are provided by the Chicago-area business Memory and Aphasia Care. Owner Becky Khayum said many of her clients are in different cities and states and sought her therapists out because they specialize in frontal temporal dementias.",
      "\u201cNow suddenly without telehealth services, they do not continue to have the support to participate in those activities that are so important to them,\u201d Khayum said. \u201cThe risk is we could see social withdrawal; we could see depression and anxiety increased.\u201d",

Dr. Faraz Ghoddusi, a family medicine provider in Tigard, Oregon, said he uses telehealth to check in and help his patients manage their conditions, like diabetes and chronic lung disease. He said that in the current Medicare telehealth pause, one of his patients wasn\u2019t having regular check-ins and ended up in the emergency room.",
      "Susan Collins, 73, in Murrieta, California, said Medicare-reimbursed telehealth appointments were a \u201ctremendous relief\u201d to her when she was a full-time caregiver for her late husband, Leo. Before he died last year from progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare brain disorder, she struggled to lift him from his wheelchair in and out of the car for his in-person doctor visits 60 miles from their home.",
      "\u201cHe was much safer at home,\u201d Collins said, noting that telehealth was a useful resource when her husband needed a medication or symptom consultation but not a complete physical exam.",
      "The latest guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services does not ban medical providers from providing telehealth services during the lapse \u2013 but it stops short of promising they\u2019ll be reimbursed if they do.",
      "In response, providers are deciding whether they can absorb the risk of continuing care without assurance that they\u2019ll be paid for it when the government reopens.",
      "Khayum in Illinois said she had to stop providing telehealth services to Medicare patients because her small business couldn\u2019t handle the volatility of potentially losing out on payments. Ghoddusi, the family medicine provider, said his Oregon practice is honoring telehealth appointments made before Oct. 1 but not scheduling additional ones for Medicare patients until the funding is restored.",
      "Genevieve Richardson, owner of a speech pathology business in Austin, Texas, has stopped providing telehealth services to her Medicare clients who are spread across the country. She has been referring them to outpatient clinics in their areas who can provide stopgap services in person.",
      "Major hospitals are also grappling with whether to provide virtual care to Medicare patients. Dr. Helen Hughes, medical director of the Office of Telemedicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said the hospital initially continued the care, but paused scheduling more Medicare telehealth visits as of Oct. 16 as the shutdown continued.",
      "She said the uncertainty surrounding the waivers has been \u201ca total roller coaster.\u201d",
      "The government shutdown is in its fifth week with no clear end on the horizon. Meanwhile, Medicare telehealth flexibilities and a separate Medicare program offering patients hospital-level care at home both remain paused.",
      "Mei Kwong, executive director of the Center for Connected Health Policy, said the simplest solution to renewing the telehealth waivers would be for Congress to vote separately on them.",
      "The hands of federal health care administrators \u201care kind of tied,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, you really do need Congress to act.\u201d",
      "But with lawmakers divided and looking for leverage, hopes for such action are low.",
      "Martha Swick, practicing word exercises with her husband in their home on a recent morning, said if a solution isn\u2019t found soon, \u201cmy resource collection is going to run out.\u201d",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The Alaska Supreme Court is weighing a case that is expected to determine who can provide abortion care in the state.",
      "The court heard arguments Wednesday in a 2019 case challenging the constitutionality of a law that states only a doctor licensed by the State Medical Board can perform an abortion in Alaska.",
      "The law, dating to the 1970s, was struck down as unconstitutional by Superior Court judge Josie Garton last year, a victory for the group that brought the challenge, Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky. The state appealed Garton's ruling.",
      "Planned Parenthood has argued there is no medical justification for the restriction and that it unfairly burdens those seeking an abortion by limiting the pool of those qualified to provide care. In 2021, Garton granted the group\u2019s request to allow advanced practice clinicians \u2014 health care workers, such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants \u2014 to provide medication abortion pending her decision in the underlying case. They have continued to do so and since the 2024 ruling also have been able to provide procedural abortions, Planned Parenthood says.",
      "Advanced practice clinicians routinely provide care similar in risk and complexity to that of providing abortion services, and in 25 states can provide medication abortion, attorneys for Planned Parenthood said in court documents. Planned Parenthood's advanced practice clinicians seek to provide abortion care in just the first trimester, the attorneys said.",
      "Since Garton's 2021 decision, advanced practice clinicians have been providing \u201cnearly all\u201d medication abortions in Alaska, and Planned Parenthood clinics in the state have been able to offer medication abortion each day they've been open, the attorneys wrote. Before that, doctors hired by Planned Parenthood on a per diem basis \u2014 at the clinics on limited days \u2014 were able to offer medication abortions perhaps once or twice a week at each clinic, they wrote.",
      "A vital statistics report released by the state this year shows that the total number of abortions in Alaska has been fairly consistent \u2014 1,229 in 2021, 1,247 in 2022, 1,222 in 2023 and 1,224 last year. The report says that could include cases where medication was provided to manage a miscarriage, but without providing a number. It also says reasons for ending pregnancies are not reported to the state.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned a federal right to abortion, leaving it up to each state to regulate.",

      "\u201cEven if an occasional patient were prevented from getting an abortion, the physician-only law is not unconstitutional as applied to all women who are not significantly affected by the law because the law has a plainly legitimate sweep,\u201d the filing states.",

      "The compensation was negotiated with Germany\u2019s finance ministry and is the largest budget for frail and vulnerable Holocaust survivor home care in the organization\u2019s history.",
      "\u201cThis historic increase to home care funding reflects the complex and growing needs of Holocaust survivors worldwide,\u201d said Gideon Taylor, the president of the New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, also referred to as the Claims Conference.",
      "\u201cWhile we are losing survivors at a rapid pace each year, those who remain are older, frailer and in greater need than ever before,\u201d Taylor said in a written statement. \"This budget is critical in providing each of them the opportunity to age in place, a dignity that was stolen from them in their youth.\u201d",
      "The average age of survivors receiving home care through Claims Conference funding has increased from 86 in 2018 to 88.5 in 2024. Data collected by the organization show that survivors are experiencing more complicated health needs and increased disability, with the number of survivors who qualify for full-time assistance due to extreme disability \u2014 such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia \u2014 has nearly doubled during that time period.",
      "Additionally, the Hardship Fund Supplemental payments, which were previously guaranteed to be paid annually to eligible Holocaust survivors until 2027, have been extended through 2028 at an amount of \u20ac1,450 per survivor, impacting more than 127,000 Holocaust survivors globally.",
      "The Claims Conference projected in April that approximately 200,000 survivors are still alive, most of them living in Israel, the United States and Europe, but also scattered all over the globe.",
      "Also, righteous rescuers \u2013 non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust - currently receiving a monthly pension from the Claims Conference, will be eligible to receive home care similar to that provided to Jewish survivors, allowing them to live their final years with dignity in their own homes, the group announced.",

      "\u201cYou\u2019re not only doing carbon expensive activities like buying a larger house and a larger car and diapers and all that,\" said Rieder. \u201cYou\u2019re also creating someone who is going to have their own carbon footprint for the rest of their lives.\u201d",
      "That child might have children, and those children might have children, creating an impact that lasts generations, Rieder added. Of course, the logical extreme of minimizing an environmental footprint means having no children, Rieder said, which he is not advocating.",
      "It's tricky to quantify the impact of a child. That's because there's no consensus on what percentage of their impact is the parent's responsibility, and partly because the impact of that child depends on their parents' lifestyle.",
      "\u201cOne of the best predictors of how carbon-expensive they\u2019ll be is how wealthy you are,\u201d Rieder said.",
      "For example, the U.S. emits 123 times more carbon emissions than Ghana, according to the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research. Adjusted for population size, that means the average American emits more than 12 times as much as the average Ghanan.",
      "Procreation might have the largest climate impact, but when it comes to actions people can take to reduce their personal contribution to global warming, having fewer children often isn't discussed.",
      "Researchers who study climate change and family planning give two reasons.",
      "\u201cIf a person tells you that they\u2019re expecting or that they are pregnant, the immediate response is to offer some kind of support, congratulate them, that sort of thing,\" said Trevor Hedberg, who teaches moral philosophy at the University of Arizona.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth praised South Korea's plans to raise its military spending, saying Tuesday that the Asian ally will take a larger role in defending itself from North Korean aggressions as the allies must brace for regional contingencies.",
      "Modernizing the decades-long alliance between the U.S. and South Korea is a key issue between the U.S. and South Korea, as the U.S. apparently wants South Korea to increase its conventional defense capabilities so that Washington can focus more on China.",
      "After annual security talks with South Korean Defense Minister Ahn Gyu-back in Seoul, Hegseth told reporters that he was \u201cgreatly encouraged\" by Seoul's commitment to increase defense spending and make greater investments in South Korean capabilities. He said the two agreed the investments would bolster South Korea's ability to lead its conventional deterrence and defense against North Korea.",
      "In a speech at parliament earlier Tuesday, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung asked lawmakers to approve an 8.2% increase in defense spending next year, which he said would help modernize the South Korean military's weapons systems and reduce its reliance on the United States.",
      "\u201cWe face, as we both acknowledge, a dangerous security environment but our alliance is stronger than ever, \"Hegseth said.",
      "Hegseth said that he and Ahn agreed to demonstrate works to maintain and repair U.S. warships in South Korea, a move that he said will harness South Korea's world-class shipbuilding capabilities and also \u201censure our most lethal capabilities remain ready to respond to any crisis.\u201d",
      "Hegseth said the South Korea-U.S. alliance is primarily aimed at coping with potential North Korean provocations but must also keep other regional threats in view.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt flexibility for regional contingencies is something we would take a look at but we are focused on standing by our allies here and ensuring the threat of the DPRK is not a threat to the Republic of Korea and certainly continue to extend nuclear deterrence as we have before,\u201d he said.",
      "DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea \u2014 North Korea's official name \u2014 while Republic of Korea is South Korea's formal name.",
      "In recent years, the U.S. and South Korea have been discussing how to integrate U.S. nuclear weapons and South Korean conventional weapons in various contingencies. South Korea has no nuclear weapons and is under the U.S. \u201cnuclear umbrella\u201d security commitment.",
      "Ahn denied speculation that South Korea could eventually seek its own nuclear weapons program or is pushing for redeployment of U.S. tactical weapon weapons that were removed from South Korea in the 1990s. He stressed that Seoul remains committed to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.",

      "Hegseth and Ahn did not issue a joint statement after the meeting, leaving the details of their agreements unclear. It's unusual for the two countries' defense ministerial talks to end without an immediate joint statement. But Hegseth said there was \u201cno daylight or differences\u201d between the two countries, only \u201ca bigger deal which takes a little more time.\u201d",

      "Typhoon Kalmaegi was blowing over the city of Bacolod in central Negros Occidental province before noon with sustained winds of up to 140 kilometers (87 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 195 kph (121 mph) after making landfall around midnight in the town of Silago in the eastern province of Southern Leyte.",

      "In Eastern Samar, one of the east-central provinces first lashed by Kalmaegi early Tuesday, fierce wind either ripped off roofs or damaged about 300 mostly rural shanties on the island community of Homonhon, which is part of the town of Guiuan, but there were no reported deaths or injuries, Mayor Annaliza Gonzales Kwan said.",

      "Zohran Mamdani is leading the New York City mayor's race, and people in his native Uganda say they are watching with pride",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- In the Ugandan newsroom where he appeared one day as an intern, Zohran Mamdani looked shy and unassuming. His father had arranged for him to spend time at the Daily Monitor newspaper with hope that the teenager would show more interest in current affairs.",
      "\u201cHe told me himself: He had to go every evening and have a conversation with his dad about the current affairs of the day,\u201d recalled Angelo Izama, the journalist who was tasked with mentoring Mamdani in 2007 in the capital of his native Uganda, Kampala.",
      "Mamdani wanted to be a \u201ctop reporter,\u201d which is how Izama recalled saving the young man\u2019s number in his cellphone. While sports was the teen's passion, he also \u201chad insatiable curiosity about the world\u201d around him.",
      "\u201cHe was very, very curious as a young person,\u201d said Izama, who remained in touch with Mamdani for years after his months-long experience as a journalist. \u201cThis is something that will stay with him forever.\u201d",
      "Now the 34-year-old Mamdani, who has kept his Ugandan citizenship, could become New York City\u2019s first Muslim mayor and the first of Indian descent. Tuesday is the final day of voting as he faces Republican Curtis Sliwa and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent.",
      "Izama told The Associated Press he was not surprised by Mamdani's rise in U.S. politics and described him as a role model not just for fellow Ugandans and other Africans but young people everywhere.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s basically global, not so much Ugandan and not so much American,\u201d Izama said.",
      "Mamdani was born in Kampala in 1991. His father is Mahmood Mamdani, a Columbia professor who taught for many years at Uganda\u2019s top public college, Makerere University, and whose academic writings are influential in the field of postcolonial studies. His mother is filmmaker Mira Nair, whose work has been nominated for an Academy Award. He is an only child.",
      "The Mamdanis split their time among the U.S., India and Uganda, where they have a hillside home in a wealthy area of Kampala. In July, the family gathered here to celebrate Zohran Mamdani\u2019s marriage, underscoring their Ugandan roots.",
      "Some Ugandans who have known Mamdani over the years say that while he may not be fluent in the local Luganda dialect, he understands the language and is proud of his local background.",
      "\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t just be proud of Mamdani,\u201d said Joseph Beyanga, a media manager who is among those who mentored Mamdani at the Daily Monitor. \u201cWe should be very excited.\u201d",

They include Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who has led the country since 1986.",
      "Izama said Mamdani \u201cbrings a role-model charge that would electrify Africa, which is full of talent,\" adding that \u201cthere is reason for us to be very proud.\u201d",
      "Mamdani left Uganda as a child but regularly returned. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2018. Before he became a New York assemblyman in 2021, the self-described democratic socialist was a community organizer in the New York borough of Queens, helping vulnerable homeowners facing eviction.",
      "Mamdani\u2019s win over Cuomo in the Democratic mayoral primary sent a shockwave through the political world. His campaign has focused on lowering the cost of living, promising free city buses, free childcare, a rent freeze for people living in rent-stabilized apartments and government-run grocery stores, all paid for with taxes on the wealthy.",
      "His candidacy has attracted the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who alleged without evidence that Mamdani was in the U.S. \u201cillegally.\u201d Some Republicans have called for Mamdani's denaturalization and deportation.",
      "Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama has reportedly offered to be a sounding board for Mamdani, and endorsements have come in from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul.",
      "Yet Mamdani\u2019s rocketing success would not be easily replicated in Uganda, said Nicholas Sengoba, an independent political analyst in Kampala.",
      "His rise shows \u201cthat America is a land of opportunity for the free and the brave,\u201d he said. \u201cThe irony is that in Uganda you would have to put in a big fight for it. You would have to blast your way into the door.\u201d",

      "A global hunger monitoring group reports that famine has spread to two regions in war-torn Sudan",
      "CAIRO -- Famine has spread to two regions of war-torn Sudan, including a major city in Darfur where paramilitary fighters have been rampaging the past week, a global hunger monitoring group said Monday, marking the latest crisis in a war that has created the world\u2019s largest humanitarian disaster.",
      "The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said famine has been detected in the Darfur city of el-Fasher and the city of Kadugli in South Kordofan province. Twenty other areas in Darfur and Kordofan, where fighting intensified in recent months, are also at risk of famine, according to the IPC report.",
      "El-Fasher had been under siege by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces for 18 months, cutting off much of the food and other supplies to tens of thousands of people inside. Last week, RSF fighters seized the city, reportedly unleashing a wave of killings and attacks on its population that killed hundreds, though the scope of the violence is still unclear, with communications to the region poor.",
      "Kadugli, as well, has been under RSF siege for months with tens of thousands of people trapped inside, as the paramilitary group tries to seize further territory from its rival, the Sudanese military.",
      "Sudan has been torn apart since April 2023 by the fight for power between the military and RSF. More than 40,000 people have been killed, according to U.N. figures, but aid groups say that is an undercount and the true number could be many times higher. The war has driven more than 14 million people from their home, fueled disease outbreaks and pushed parts of the country into famine.",
      "In its latest report, the second in less than a year, the IPC said famine \u2013 or IPC Phase 5 -- has been announced in el-Fasher and Kadugli, which it said experienced \u201ca total collapse of livelihoods, starvation, extremely high levels of malnutrition, and death.\u201d The IPC is considered the leading international authority on hunger crises.",
      "In total, about 375,000 people have been pushed into famine in Darfur and Kordofan as of September, the report said. Another 6.3 million people across the country are in IPC Phase 4, meaning they face extreme levels of hunger, it said.",
      "Save the Children said in September that food supplies had run out in Kadugli, where it said fighting had escalated. It said tens of thousands have been driven from their homes, many fleeing to other parts of the city because of roadblocks blocking escape.",
      "Famine, or IPC Phase 5, is determined in areas where at least one in five people or households severely lack food and face starvation and destitution, at least 30% of children under 5 suffer from acute malnutrition and deaths from malnutrition-related causes reach at least two people, or four children under 5, per 10,000.",
      "The IPC has only confirmed famine a few times in the past, most recently in northern Gaza earlier this year amid Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas. The other locations have been in Somalia in 2011, and South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and last year in parts of Sudan\u2019s western Darfur region.",
      "Another Kordofan town, Dilling, has reportedly experienced the same conditions as Kadugli, but the IPC didn\u2019t announce famine there for lack of data, the report said. Since the military retook the capital Khartoum earlier this year, the RSF has turned its focus to completing its hold on the Darfur region in the west and on taking Kordofan to secure supply lines toward the country\u2019s center.",

Since the city fell, reports and videos have circulated of RSF atrocities against civilians including beatings, killings and sexual assaults, according to testimonies by civilians and aid workers. The dead included at least 460 killed in the hospital, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "Across the country, the IPC said more than 21 million people, or 45% of the population, faced acute food insecurity as of September, a 6% drop from the previous report which covered the period from December 2024 til May this year.",
      "The drop was due to reduced conflict and improved humanitarian access in Khartoum, neighboring Gezira province and the eastern province of Sennar. The military retained control of Khartoum and Gezira earlier this year, allowing more than a million displaced people to return home.",
      "However, the report warned that the improvements remained limited given that the war continues to \u201cseverely impact the economy, service delivery and productive infrastructure.\u201d",

Three of them were sprawling refugee camps near el-Fasher that have since been vacated as RSF troops advanced, with most of the residents fleeing into el-Fasher itself or Tawila and other nearby towns.

      "In his speech at the National Assembly, Lee highlighted his APEC diplomacy and a bilateral meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, which he said eased uncertainties facing South Korea\u2019s trade-dependent economy by securing lower tariffs on automobiles and computer chips, two of the country\u2019s key exports.",
      "He said the country was still facing a critical moment for \u201cnational survival\u201d amid rapid changes in the global trade order and a \u201chuge, transformative wave of AI.\u201d",

      "\u201cJust as President Park Chung-hee paved the highway for industrialization and President Kim Dae-jung built the highway for the information age, we must now construct the highway for the AI era to open a future of progress and growth,\u201d Lee said, referring to major development drives under Park\u2019s dictatorship in the 1960s and \u201970s and Kim\u2019s presidency from 1998 to 2003, which focused on expanding South Korea\u2019s internet infrastructure.",

      "Key legal principles at the heart of conservative challenges to major initiatives in the Biden years are driving the arguments in the fight against Trump\u2019s tariffs, which is set for arguments at the high court on Wednesday.",
      "The businesses and states that sued over the tariffs are even name-checking the three Trump-appointed conservative justices whose votes they hope to attract to stop a centerpiece of Trump\u2019s economic agenda in a key test of presidential power.",
      "Trump imposed two sets of tariffs, determining that sustained trade deficits had brought the United States to \u201cthe precipice of an economic and national-security crisis\u201d and that hundreds of thousands of deaths from imported fentanyl had created a crisis of its own, the administration told the justices.",
      "Until this year, no president had used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs since its enactment in 1977.",

      "A separate group of small businesses cited Justice Amy Coney Barrett's opinion in the student loan case to make the point that in relying on IEEPA for the tariffs, Trump \u201casserts \u2018highly consequential power ... beyond what Congress could reasonably be understood to have granted.\u2019\u201d",
      "The businesses also invoked a dissenting opinion by Justice Brett Kavanaugh in another pandemic case about the dangers of easily accepting emergency declarations. \u201cThis Court\u2019s history is littered with unfortunate examples of overly broad judicial deference to' assertions of \u2018emergency powers,\u2019\u201d lawyers for the businesses wrote.",

      "Presidents have wide latitude when it comes to foreign affairs and national security, and it would be odd for the emergency powers law to be as limited as the challengers say it is, Judge Richard Taranto wrote in his dissent, which was joined by three other judges.",
      "\u201cSuch a limitation would be especially out of place in an emergency statute like IEEPA,\u201d Taranto wrote, explaining that it was intended to give presidents flexibility to cope with crises.",

      "Kavanaugh expressed a similarly expansive view of presidential power in an opinion in June about congressional authority.",
      "The major questions doctrine has never been invoked in a case about foreign policy or national security, Kavanaugh wrote. \u201cOn the contrary, the usual understanding is that Congress intends to give the President substantial authority and flexibility to protect America and the American people,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Taranto's opinion drew from a 1981 Supreme Court decision in a case relating to the Iranian hostage crisis that upheld President Jimmy Carter's invocation of the emergency powers law to unfreeze Iranian assets.",
      "Justice William Rehnquist, five years before becoming chief justice, wrote the court's opinion. One of his clerks that term was the current chief justice, John Roberts.",

      "PARIS -- French authorities have warned they may block access to Shein after it emerged that the online fast fashion giant had been selling sex dolls with a childlike appearance.",
      "France\u2019s consumer watchdog, the Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF), said last week it had discovered the dolls on Shein\u2019s website, noting that their descriptions and categorization left little doubt as to their child-pornographic nature.",

The company has faced criticism over its labor practices and environmental record.",

      "The government shutdown is triggering a wave of closures of Head Start centers, leaving working parents scrambling for child care and shutting some of the nation's neediest children out of preschool.",
      "Dozens of centers are missing out on federal grant payments that were due to arrive Nov. 1. Some say they'll close indefinitely, while others are staying afloat with emergency funding from local governments and school districts. The closures mean Head Start students \u2014 who come from low-income households, are homeless or are in foster care \u2014 are missing out on preschool, where they are fed two meals a day and receive therapy vital to their development.",
      "\u201cChildren love school, and the fact that they can\u2019t go is breaking their hearts,\u201d said Sarah Sloan, who oversees small-town Head Start centers in Scioto County, Ohio. Staff told families they planned to close Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s hampering our families\u2019 ability to put food on the table and to know that their children are safe during the day.\u201d",
      "A half-dozen Head Start programs never received grants that were anticipated in October, but there are now 140 programs that have not received their annual infusion of federal funding. All told, the programs have capacity to assist 65,000 preschoolers and expectant parents.",
      "Among the preschools closing as of Monday are 24 Migrant and Seasonal Head Start centers spread across five states. Those centers, created to assist the children of migrant farmworkers, typically operate on 10- to 12-hour days to accommodate the long hours parents work on farms.",
      "Children attending the centers in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama and Oklahoma recently came home with fliers warning of possible closures, along with other parent notifications. Those centers serving more than 1,100 children will now remain closed until the shutdown ends, said East Coast Migrant Head Start Project CEO Javier Gonzalez. About 900 staff members across the centers also have been furloughed.",
      "In the absence of other options for child care, some parents\u2019 only option may be to bring their young child to the fields where they work, Gonzalez said.",
      "Many of the families that qualify for the federal preschool program also depend on food aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP or food stamps. That program also was on track to run dry of money due to the shutdown, although a pair of federal judges on Friday ordered the Trump administration to keep the program running with emergency reserve funds.",
      "That means many Head Start families have been worried about food aid, along with the child care they rely on to make ends meet. A day without child care means a day without work for many parents \u2014 and a day without pay.",
      "In Kansas City, Missouri, Jhanee Hunt teaches toddlers at a Head Start site, the Emmanuel Family and Child Development Center, where her 6-month-old son is cared for in another classroom. The center said it can scrape up enough money to stay open for a few weeks, but the money won\u2019t last much beyond November.",
      "At dropoff, she said, parents often are wearing uniforms for fast food restaurants like Wendy\u2019s and McDonald\u2019s. Some work as certified nurse assistants in nursing homes. None have much extra money. The most urgent concern right now is food, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of the parents, they\u2019re, you know, going around trying to find food pantries,\u201d she said. \u201cA parent actually asked me, do I know a food pantry?\u201d",

      "\u201cThe demand for power is going to go up and up and up,\" Burgum said. \"Today\u2019s the day to announce that there is no energy transition. There is only energy addition.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, OPEC+ met and decided to increase its production by an additional 137,000 barrels of oil beginning in December. However, it said other adjustments planned in January, February and March of next year would be paused \u201cdue to seasonality.\u201d",
      "OPEC+ includes the core members of the cartel, as well as nations outside of the group led by Russia.",
      "Benchmark Brent crude sold Monday around $65 a barrel, down from a post-COVID high of some $115 a barrel after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It had fallen to $60 a barrel in recent days over concerns that the market had too much production.",
      "\u201cYes, OPEC+ is blinking, but it\u2019s a calculated move,\u201d said Jorge Le\u00f3n, the head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy. \u201cSanctions on Russian producers have injected a new layer of uncertainty into supply forecasts, and the group knows that overproducing now could backfire later. By pausing, OPEC+ is protecting prices, projecting unity and buying time to see how sanctions play out on Russian barrels.\u201d",
      "Suhail al-Mazerouei, the Emirates' energy and infrastructure minister, however, dismissed any idea long-term of too much oil being in the market.",

Those sanctions targets included Rosneft and the Russian oil company Lukoil, whose red-and-white logo hung over the annual oil conference. The UAE has maintained close ties to Russia despite the war, but has served as a key interlocutor between Kyiv and Moscow to negotiate prisoner exchanges.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump says he &ldquo;won&rsquo;t be extorted&rdquo; by Democrats to reopen the government, making clear that he has no plans to negotiate as the government shutdown will soon enter its sixth week",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says he \u201cwon\u2019t be extorted\u201d by Democrats to reopen the government, making clear that he has no plans to negotiate as the government shutdown will soon enter its sixth week",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says he \u201cwon't be extorted\u201d by Democrats to reopen the government, making clear that he has no plans to negotiate as the government shutdown will soon enter its sixth week.",
      "In an interview on CBS's \u201c60 Minutes\" that aired on Sunday, Trump said that Democrats who are demanding an extension in health care subsidies \u201chave lost their way\" and predicted that they will eventually capitulate to Republicans who have said they won't negotiate until they vote to reopen the government.",
      "\u201cI think they have to,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd if they don't vote, it's their problem.\u201d",
      "Trump's comments signal that the shutdown could continue to drag on for some time as federal workers, including air traffic controllers, are set to miss additional paychecks and as there is uncertainty over whether 42 million Americans who received federal food aid will be able to access the assistance. Senate Democrats have now voted 13 times against reopening the government, insisting that they need Trump and Republicans to negotiate with them first on an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Instead of negotiating, the president reiterated his pleas to Republican leaders to change Senate rules and scrap the filibuster. But Senate Republicans have rejected that idea, arguing that the rule requiring 60 votes to overcome any objections in the Senate is vital to the institution and has allowed them to stop Democratic policies when they are in the minority.",
      "\u201cRepublicans have to get tougher,\u201d Trump said in the CBS interview. \u201cIf we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want.\u201d",
      "With the two parties at a standstill, the shutdown, now in its 33rd day, appears likely to become the longest in history. The previous record was set in 2019, when Trump demanded that Congress give him money for a U.S.-Mexico border wall.",
      "Trump\u2019s push on the filibuster could prove a distraction for Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Republican senators who have opted instead to stay the course as the consequences of the shutdown have become more acute.",
      "Republicans are hoping that at least some Democrats will eventually give them the votes they need as moderates have been in weekslong talks with rank-and-file Republicans about potential compromises that could guarantee votes on health care in exchange for reopening the government. Republicans need five additional Democrats to pass their bill.",
      "\u201cWe need five with a backbone to say we care more about the lives of the American people than about gaining some political leverage,\u201d Thune said on the Senate floor as the Senate left Washington for the weekend on Thursday.",
      "Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday that there is a group of people talking about \u201da path to fix the health care debacle\u201d and a commitment from Republicans not to fire more federal workers. But it\u2019s still unclear if those talks could produce a meaningful compromise.",
      "Trump said in the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview that the Affordable Care Act, often known as Obamacare because it was signed and championed by former President Barack Obama, is \"terrible\" and that if the Democrats vote to reopen the government, \u201cwe will work on fixing the bad health care that we have right now.\u201d",
      "Democrats feel differently, arguing that the marketplaces set up by the ACA are working as record numbers of Americans have signed up for the coverage. But they want to extend subsidies first enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic so that premiums won't go up for millions of people on Jan. 1.",
      "\u201cWe want to sit down with Thune, with (House Speaker Mike) Johnson, with Trump, and negotiate a way to address this horrible health care crisis,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said last week.",
      "As Democrats have pushed Trump and Republicans to negotiate, Trump has showed little interest in doing so. He immediately called for an end to the Senate filibuster after a trip to Asia while the government was shut down.",
      "White House Spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d on Fox News that the president has spoken directly to both Thune and Johnson about the filibuster. But a spokesman for Thune said Friday that his position hasn\u2019t changed, and Johnson said on Sunday that Republicans traditionally have resisted calling for an end to the filibuster because it protects them from \u201cthe worst impulses of the far-left Democrat Party.\u201d",

      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d that there have already been delays at several airports as air traffic controllers aren\u2019t getting paid \u201cand it\u2019s only going to get worse.\u201d",

      "The movie exhibition business is wrapping up one of its slowest Octobers in over 25 years with a sluggish Halloween weekend",
      "The movie exhibition business is closing out one of its slowest Octobers in over 25 years with a sluggish Halloween weekend. Studios avoided opening any major new films with the holiday falling on a Friday. Instead, there were several re-releases including \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d which is celebrating its 40th anniversary, and the Netflix phenomenon \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "But even with a top 10 in which no films earned more than $10 million, there was still a bit of excitement as two studios claimed the No.1 spot Sunday. Universal\u2019s horror sequel \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d was largely expected to top the charts in its third weekend in theaters, and the studio reported that it was going to be in first place with an estimated $8 million. About 30 minutes later, Paramount reported that its romantic drama \u201cRegretting You\u201d had earned an estimated $8.1 million, which would place it in the top spot instead. Box office tracker Comscore went by the numbers and gave the first place title to \u201cRegretting You.\u201d Sunday numbers are based on estimates and projections, however, and sometimes Monday actuals tell a different story.",
      "\u201cRegretting You\u201d is the latest Colleen Hoover adaptation to open in theaters since \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d became a runaway hit in theaters. With a running domestic total of $27.5 million, this newest film is not going to match its predecessor, which made $50 million its first weekend.",
      "In three weekends \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d has made $61.5 million domestically and $104.7 million globally. Universal also handled the nationwide re-release of Robert Zemeckis\u2019s \u201cBack to the Future\u201d which earned $4.7 million from 2,290 theaters \u2013 enough to snag a fifth-place spot on the North American charts. The 1985 time travel classic now has a domestic total of $221.7 million.",
      "Though there were plenty of HUNTR/X costumes on the streets this weekend, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d didn\u2019t do as well as it did when it played in theaters in August. That weekend, the streaming hit sold between $16 and $20 million in movie tickets. This weekend, it\u2019s estimated to have earned somewhere in the $5 million range from 2,890 screens. Two distribution executives shared numbers on the condition of anonymity because Netflix has a policy of not reporting ticket sales.",
      "Sony Pictures and Crunchyroll\u2019s \u201cChainsaw Man \u2013 The Movie: Reze Arc\u201d dropped a steep 67% in its second weekend and is projected to add $6 million from 3,003 locations, bringing its total to $30.8 million.",
      "Focus Features also launched \u201cBugonia\u201d into wide release after several weeks in limited. With an estimated $4.8 million from 2,043 theaters, it marks filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s best wide break to date. The darkly comedic thriller stars Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons and is expected to be an awards season player.",
      "\u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere\u201d landed in sixth place, behind \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d and down 57% in its second weekend. It earned $3.8 million, putting its domestic total at $16.3 million and its global tally at $30.6 million.",
      "\u201cThis was a truly scary weekend,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s head of marketplace trends. \u201cIt was this imperfect storm of Halloween on a Friday and the World Series on Friday and Saturday. But the studios and theaters knew this was on the horizon and they planned for it.\u201d",
      "The weekend may net out to be one of the lowest grossing of the year, closing out an unusually slow October. With the exception of October 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the month\u2019s total ticket sales ($443 million) have not been this low since 1998 ($455.5 million).",
      "The next two weekends may bring some energy back to multiplexes, however, with releases like \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d and \u201cNow You See Me: Now You Don\u2019t,\u201d but the industry will likely have to wait until closer to Thanksgiving for a real blockbuster when \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d and \u201cZootopia 2\u201d enter the mix.",
      "\"This was always going to be a tough weekend. The audience was truly fragmented,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cThere are weekends where the movie theaters are the focus of the attention, and those are coming.\"",

      "Profits improved thanks to a mild hurricane season and more paper investment.",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The profits of Warren Buffett's company improved 17% thanks to a relatively mild hurricane season and more paper investment gains this year as Berkshire Hathaway continues to prepare for the legendary 95-year-old investor to relinquish the CEO title in January.",
      "But last month's $9.7 billion investment in OxyChem won't do much to diminish the $381.7 billion cash pile that Berkshire was sitting on at the end of September even though it is the biggest deal the company has made in years.",
      "The biggest thing on most investors' minds right now is that Buffett Vice Chair Greg Abel is set to succeed him as CEO in January, although Buffett will remain chairman at Berkshire. The Class A stock is well off its peak of $812,855, set just before Buffett surprised shareholders at the annual meeting in May by announcing he will step back. It closed Friday at $715,740, but Berkshire still didn't buy back any of its own stock in the quarter, which suggests Buffett thinks it is still overvalued.",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said she expects investors will clamor for more details from Berkshire after Abel takes over, and that calls for the company to finally pay a dividend if it can't find better uses for all that cash will also grow louder. But with Buffett remaining chairman there may not be any immediate changes.",
      "\u201cThe lack of discussion and disclosure \u2014 I think has a lot of the investment community frustrated,\u201d Seifert said. Berkshire has never had public or investor relations departments, and the company skips the quarterly investor calls that nearly every public company holds. Buffett has long said he prefers to share results with every investor at the same time, on Saturdays, and give them the weekend to digest the results before the markets reopen.",
      "Berkshire said Saturday that it earned $30.796 billion, or $21,413 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's up from last year's $26.251 billion, or $18,272 per A share.",
      "But those bottom-line figures are always distorted by the current value of Berkshire's massive investment portfolio and any stock sales, which this year added $17.3 billion to the company's profits.",

      "On that measure, Berkshire's operating profit jumped to $13.485 billion, or $9376.15 per Class A share, thanks to a strong rebound in its insurance companies. A year ago, Berkshire reported operating earnings of $10.09 billion, or $7,023.01 per Class A share.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted Berkshire would report operating earnings of $8,573.50 per Class A share.",
      "Berkshire said fewer catastrophic losses from hurricanes this year compared to when Hurricane Helene ravaged the southeast a year ago helped its insurance underwriting profit jump $1.6 billion to $2.369 billion. The bottom line was also helped by $331 million in gains on debt held in foreign currencies this year, compared to a $1.1 billion loss on those holdings a year ago.",
      "Most of Berkshire's other companies performed well in the quarter although profits did decline nearly 9% at its utilities to $1.489 billion.",

      "\u201cHonestly, the black vulture is one of the ugliest things I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re easy to hate.\u201d",
      "Black vultures, scavengers that sometimes attack and kill sick or newborn animals, didn't used to be a problem here. But now Bryant frequently sees the birds following a birth. He hasn't lost a calf in several years, but they've killed his animals before. So now he takes measures to stop them.",
      "In some of his fields, he erects a scarecrow of sorts \u2014 a dead black vulture \u2014 aimed at scaring off the birds. It's a requirement of his depredation permit through the Kentucky Farm Bureau, which allows him to shoot a few birds a year. The dead bird keeps the live birds away for about a week, but they eventually come back, he said.",
      "It\u2019s a problem that may grow worse for cattle farmers as the scavenging birds\u2019 range expands northward, in part due to climate change. Lobbying groups have been pushing for legislation that would allow landowners to kill more of these birds, which are protected but not endangered. But experts say more research is needed to better understand how the birds impact livestock and how their removal could affect ecosystems.",
      "Black vultures used to mainly live in the southeastern U.S. and farther south in Latin and South America, but over the past century they've started to rapidly stretch northward and also west into the desert Southwest, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration.",
      "Warmer winters on average, fueled by climate change, are making it easier for the birds to stay in places that used to be too cold for them. What's more, the human footprint in suburban and rural areas is enriching their habitat: development means cars, and cars mean roadkill. Cattle farms can also offer a buffet of vulnerable animals for vultures that learn the seasonal calving schedule.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from a lot of different studies of birds, it\u2019s that they are very good at taking advantage of food resources and remembering where those things are,\u201d Farnsworth said.",
      "Although black vultures are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, they aren't really a migratory species, he said. Instead, they breed, and some disperse to new areas and settle there.",
      "After losing a calf to a black vulture a decade ago, Tom Karr, who raises cattle near Pomeroy, Ohio, tried to move his fall calving season later in the year in hopes the vultures would be gone by then. But that didn't help \u2014 the birds stay all year, he said.",
      "Until newborn calves are a few days old, \u201cwe try to keep them up closer to the barns,\u201d said Joanie Grimes, the owner of a 350-head calf-cow operation in Hillsboro, Ohio. She said they've been dealing with the birds for 15 years, but keeping them out of remote fields has helped improve matters.",
      "Annette Ericksen has noticed the black vultures for several years on her property, Twin Maples Farm in Milton, West Virginia, but they haven't yet lost any animals to them. When they expect calves and lambs, they move the livestock into a barn, and they also use dogs \u2014 Great Pyrenees \u2014 trained to patrol the fields and the barnyard for raptors that might hurt the animals.",

Farmers said calves can be worth hundreds of dollars or upward of $1,000 or $2,000, depending on the breed.",
      "In March, lawmakers in Congress introduced a bill that would let farmers capture or kill any black vulture \u201cin order to prevent death, injury, or destruction to livestock.\u201d Many farmers and others in the cattle industry have supported the move, and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association in July commended the House Natural Resources Committee for advancing the bill.",

      "\"Pretty immediately we just said we\u2019ve got to go back soon,\" Mayer said. \u201cWe had success beyond anything we could have ever dreamed of. To fill the Cotton Bowl just absolutely showed us that Dallas fans are into this, will come in droves and it was awesome.\u201d",
      "Conversations with the Cowboys continued over the past several years, and the Stars made three consecutive trips to the Western Conference final. AT&T Stadium has a capacity of 85,000 but can get past 100,000 with standing room only, putting the league's record attendance of 105,491 from Michigan Stadium in 2014 within reach, if everything comes together correctly.",
      "\"We\u2019re going into this with our eyes wide open, and that is absolutely a possibility,\" Mayer said. \u201cWe\u2019re very aware of the capacity, and standing room is a thing. It\u2019s actually unique to that stadium. I would say that we would have a chance.\u201d",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Tuesday called for tripling the government spending on projects for expanding artificial intelligence infrastructure and technology in a budget speech.",
      "Lee also called for lawmakers to approve a planned 8.2% increase in defense spending next year, which he said would help modernize the military\u2019s weapons systems and reduce its reliance on the United States, as the allies\u2019 military chiefs met in Seoul for annual security talks.",
      "Most conservative opposition lawmakers boycotted Lee\u2019s speech amid an ongoing rift over a criminal investigation into former President Yoon Suk Yeol's brief imposition of martial law in December.",
      "Lee\u2019s speech came after South Korea last week hosted the leaders of major Pacific Rim nations for this year\u2019s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings, which his government used to showcase its ambitions for AI and advance an effort at a trade deal with the U.S.",
      "In his speech at the National Assembly, Lee highlighted his APEC diplomacy and a bilateral meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, which he said eased uncertainties facing South Korea\u2019s trade-dependent economy by securing lower tariffs on automobiles and computer chips, two of the country\u2019s key exports.",
      "He said the country was still facing a critical moment for \u201cnational survival\u201d amid rapid changes in the global trade order and a \u201chuge, transformative wave of AI.\u201d",
      "Lee said the proposed budget of 728 trillion won ($506 billion), which would represent an all-time high for government spending, would be the country\u2019s \u201cfirst budget to open the AI era.\u201d",
      "He called on the liberal-led legislature to approve 10.1 trillion won ($6.9 billion) in AI-related spending \u2014 more than triple this year\u2019s level \u2014 to advance the country\u2019s AI computing and manufacturing capabilities, with a particular focus on industries such as semiconductors, automobiles, shipbuilding and robotics.",
      "\u201cJust as President Park Chung-hee paved the highway for industrialization and President Kim Dae-jung built the highway for the information age, we must now construct the highway for the AI era to open a future of progress and growth,\u201d Lee said, referring to major development drives under Park\u2019s dictatorship in the 1960s and \u201970s and Kim\u2019s presidency from 1998 to 2003, which focused on expanding South Korea\u2019s internet infrastructure.",
      "Lee said South Korean companies would have little difficulty securing the chips for their AI projects, citing a deal for Nvidia, whose GPUs power much of the global AI industry, to supply 260,000 graphics processing units for AI infrastructure projects with major South Korean businesses and the government. The deal was announced following a meeting during APEC between Lee and Jensen Huang, the Silicon Valley company\u2019s chief executive.",
      "It isn\u2019t immediately clear when Nvidia \u2014 which agreed to deliver 50,000 GPUs each to the government, chipmakers Samsung and SK, and automaker Hyundai, and another 60,000 to internet company Naver \u2014 will deliver those chips. Huang told reporters in South Korea that AI data centers and power networks must first be established before the company can begin shipping the GPUs.",

      "Lee proposed a defense budget of 66.3 trillion won ($46 billion) next year, which he said will be focused on modernizing the military\u2019s weapons systems, including through the adoption of AI technologies, to make the armed forces more self-reliant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national pride that South Korea, which spends 1.4 times North Korea\u2019s annual GDP on defense and is perceived as the world\u2019s fifth most powerful military, continues to depend on others for its security,\u201d Lee said.",
      "During his meeting with Trump, Lee reaffirmed South Korea\u2019s commitment to increase defense spending and called for U.S. support for South Korean efforts to acquire nuclear-powered submarines.",
      "Trump later said on social media that the United States will share closely-held technology to allow South Korea to build a nuclear-powered submarine, and that the vessel will be built in the Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia, which was bought last year by South Korea\u2019s Hanwha Group.",
      "Lee\u2019s speech came as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and South Korean Defense Minister Ahn Gyu-back were meeting in Seoul for the allies\u2019 annual security talks.

      "Lambert, a critically endangered African penguin, has moved to a special geriatric island at the New England Aquarium in Boston",
      "BOSTON -- When Lambert started losing his vision and slowing down a few steps, it became clear that he needed to be relocated to a place where he could age safely and still be with his friends.",
      "But he couldn't be placed in just any nursing home \u2014 because he is a critically endangered African penguin. Instead, the New England Aquarium in Boston, where the 33-year-old Lambert was born and has lived his entire life, decided in February to open a geriatric island for him and its six other aging penguins.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it sort of started off as a joke. It\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, well, why don\u2019t we give them an old folks home?\u2019\u201d Eric Fox, associate curator of penguins at the aquarium, said. \u201cBut the more we were looking at their welfare data and understanding what ailments they go through, what physical limitations they have, we started to realize that we were on to something.\u201d",
      "The rocky island near the aquarium entrance is set apart from the rest of the 38-bird colony, ensuring the older penguins don't have to compete for territory with their often aggressive, younger peers. These penguins, with their trademark black and white feathers, stand about 2 feet (0.6 meters) tall and weigh about as much as a large house cat.",
      "The enclosure has some flatter topography and a carpeted path down to the water, which allows Lambert and the other penguins to better navigate up and down the island. The aquarium has built a stand in front of the island, which makes it easier for the penguins to hop out of the water.",
      "As a result, Mia Luzietti, a senior penguin trainer at the aquarium, said she has seen Lambert become more active since moving to the new island \u2014 swimming more with his mate and getting off the island more often.",
      "The concept was inspired by a larger concern that is confronting zoos and aquariums around the world \u2014 what to do when their animals are surviving far longer than their counterparts in the wild. In the case of these African penguins, some are in their 30s and one lived into its 40s. That is twice as long as they would live in the wilds of South Africa and Namibia, due to threats like pollution and lack of food from humans\u2019 overfishing.",
      "\u201cIt's really important that, as we learned how long these animals could live, if given an optimal environment, that we evolved with that,\u201d Luzietti said.",
      "\u201cSo learning on an individual level, how can we best set our animals up for success is really what led to the idea of creating our geriatric island, a place where our oldest penguins have a more comfortable, slower way of life as they live out their days here,\u201d she added.",

      "Caring for the aging penguins goes far beyond a safer enclosure.",
      "The older birds get more checkups than their younger counterparts, and veterinarians offer them treatment for ailments that might be familiar to older humans \u2014 such as supplements and anti-inflammatory drugs for arthritis and joint pain, and eye drops for glaucoma. There are also more cameras around the island, so staff can better monitor the birds.",
      "\u201cWe are just keeping a little closer of an eye on some of these older birds,\u201d Luzietti said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we\u2019re picking up on those \u2014 from how someone\u2019s hips are moving, how they\u2019re walking, how they are acting, if someone\u2019s squinting. The smallest change day to day can be hiding a really big secret.\u201d",
      "On a recent day, Luzietti was in the geriatric enclosure tending to Lambert \u2014 who seemed content to stand at the top of the island with his mate Dyer III, preening one another and occasionally letting out a loud call that sounded like a donkey's bray. He previously had his left eye removed due to an infection and has glaucoma in his right eye. He also suffers from chronic inflammation.",
      "Luzietti coaxed him down from his perch, and soon he was sitting on her lap, getting ready for his daily dose of eye drops.",
      "A crowd had formed around the enclosure to watch, including Terri Blessman, a 69-year-old tourist from Canton, Illinois, who was being pushed in a wheelchair by her friend Lou Ann Delost. Hearing about Lambert's age and the care he gets, Blessman said she could relate.",
      "\u201cThat's wonderful,\u201d Blessman said. \u201cAll of us older people need extra care as we get older.\u201d",

      "The recent escape of several research monkeys after the truck carrying them overturned on a Mississippi interstate is the latest glimpse into the secretive world of animal research",
      "The recent escape of several research monkeys after the truck carrying them overturned on a Mississippi interstate is the latest glimpse into the secretive industry of animal research and the processes that allow key details of what happened to be kept from the public.",
      "Three monkeys have remained on the loose since the crash on Tuesday in a rural area along Interstate 59, spilling wooden crates labeled \u201clive monkeys\u201d into the tall grass near the highway. Since then, searchers in masks, face shields and other protective equipment have scoured nearby fields and woods for the missing primates. Five of the 21 Rhesus macaques on board were killed during the search, according to the local sheriff, but it was unclear how that happened.",
      "Mississippi authorities have not disclosed the driver's name, the company involved in transporting the monkeys, where the monkeys were headed or who owns them. While Tulane University in New Orleans has acknowledged that the monkeys had been housed at its National Biomedical Research Center in Covington, Louisiana, it said it doesn't own them and won't identify who does.",
      "The questions surrounding the Mississippi crash and the mystery of why the animals were traveling through the South are remarkable, animal advocates say.",
      "\u201cWhen a truck carrying 21 monkeys crashes on a public highway, the community has a right to know who owned those animals, where they were being sent, and what diseases they may have been exposed to and harbored simply by being caught up in the primate experimentation industry,\u201d said Lisa Jones-Engel, senior science adviser on primate experimentation with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.",
      "\u201cIt is highly unusual \u2014 and deeply troubling \u2014 that Tulane refuses to identify its partner in this shipment,\u201d Jones-Engel added.",
      "Transporting research animals typically requires legally binding contracts that prevent the parties involved from disclosing information, Tulane University said in a statement to The Associated Press. That's done for the safety of the animals and to protect proprietary information, the New Orleans-based university said.",
      "\u201cTo the best of Tulane\u2019s knowledge, the 13 recovered animals remain in the possession of their owner and are en route to their original destination,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The crash has drawn a range of reactions \u2014 from conspiracy theories that suggest a government plot to sicken people to serious responses from people who oppose experimenting on animals.",

The center has been funded by NIH since 1964, and federal grants are a significant source of income for the institution, it said.",

This fall, the facility's name was changed from the Tulane National Primate Research Center to the Tulane National Biomedical Research Center to reflect its broader mission, university officials announced.",
      "The Mississippi crash is one of at least three major monkey escapes in the U.S. over the past four years.",
      "Last November, 43 Rhesus macaques escaped from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research after an enclosure wasn't fully locked. Employees from the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, South Carolina, set up traps to capture them. However, some spent two months that winter living in the woods and weathering a rare snowstorm. By late January, the last four escapees were recaptured after being lured back into captivity by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.",
      "In January 2022, several cynomolgus macaque monkeys escaped when a truck towing a trailer of about 100 of the animals collided with a dump truck on a Pennsylvania highway, authorities said. The monkeys were headed to a quarantine facility in an undisclosed location after arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on a flight from Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation, authorities said. A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said all of the animals were accounted for within about a day, though three were euthanized for undisclosed reasons.",

      "GYEONGJU, South Korea -- Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia plans to supply hundreds of thousands of its graphics processing units for projects with South Korean businesses and the government to advance the country\u2019s artificial intelligence infrastructure and technologies.",
      "The plan was announced Friday by the government, Nvidia, and some of South Korea\u2019s biggest companies, including chipmakers Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and auto giant Hyundai Motor, after President Lee Jae Myung met with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.",
      "At a news conference, Huang said he hopes to export Nvidia\u2019s most advanced AI chips to China, following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on loosening U.S. chip restrictions as the two leaders pledged to reduce trade tensions.",
      "However, he acknowledged that it was up to Trump to decide, and said there were no current plans to sell the next generation Blackwell chips to China.",
      "Huang has gotten rockstar treatment reminiscent of Apple\u2019s Steve Jobs since arriving in South Korea on Thursday to attend meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Gyeongju. As APEC host, South Korea is using the gathering of world leaders to showcase its ambitions in AI.",
      "According to Lee\u2019s office and the companies, Nvidia will supply around 260,000 GPUs to support South Korea\u2019s AI computing and manufacturing capabilities.",
      "About 50,000 of the GPUs will be used to support a government project to build a national cloud computing center for AI and Nvidia will provide the same number of GPUs each to Samsung and SK to help them enhance their manufacturing processes through AI and accelerate the development of advanced semiconductors.",
      "Hyundai and Nvidia said they plan to collaborate on developing technologies related to self-driving cars, smart factories and robotics, a process that will be powered by 50,000 of Nvidia\u2019s advanced Blackwell GPUs.",
      "Speaking to business leaders, Huang highlighted how AI and advanced computing are driving a profound transformation across industries, adding to the need for more infrastructure and capacity. South Korea\u2019s strengths in software, technical expertise and manufacturing give it an edge, he said.",

      "Nvidia has argued that U.S. export controls hinder American competitiveness in one of the world\u2019s largest technology markets and warned that such limits could push other countries toward China\u2019s AI technology. Talking to reporters in South Korea, Huang said he hopes to eventually sell Blackwell chips to China, \u201cbut that\u2019s a decision for the president to make.\u201d",

And so I\u2019m hopeful that both governments will arrive at a conclusion someday where Nvidia\u2019s technology could be exported to China.\u201d",
      "Huang acknowledged U.S. security concerns about Nvidia technology being used by China\u2019s military but argued that China already has ample AI capabilities, making the use of Nvidia chips for military purposes largely unnecessary.",
      "In August, Trump announced a deal with Nvidia and AMD, another chipmaker, to lift export controls on sales of advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenue, despite concerns among national security experts that such chips will end up in the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services.",
      "Nvidia earlier this week confirmed that it has become the first $5 trillion company, just three months after the company broke through the $4 trillion mark. The milestone underscores the upheaval driven by the AI craze, widely seen as the biggest technological shift since Apple co-founder Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago.",

The tech executives clinked glasses, took bomb shots, and at one point, Huang stepped outside to hand baskets of chicken and fried cheese to the crowd waiting outside.",

      "The International Space Station is marking 25 years of nonstop human presence in orbit",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- It\u2019s an unprecedented space streak: 25 years of people living off-planet without even a moment\u2019s pause.",
      "The International Space Station marks a quarter-century of continuous occupancy this weekend, boasting a guest list of nearly 300 \u2014 mostly professional astronauts but also the occasional space tourist and movie director. The first full-time residents opened the hatch on Nov. 2, 2000.",
      "With only five years left at the scientific outpost, NASA is counting on private companies to launch their own orbiting stations with an even bigger and wider clientele.",
      "Here's a look at what has been and what is ahead:",
      "NASA\u2019s Bill Shepherd and Russia\u2019s Sergei Krikalev and Yuri Gidzenko took off in a Russian Soyuz rocket from Kazakhstan on Oct. 31, 2000. They reached the dark, humid, three-room station two days later and spent almost five months on board, making the place not only functional but hospitable.",
      "Shepherd, a former Navy SEAL who retired in 2002, serves on a space station advisory committee with Krikalev, now a high-ranking Russian space official.",
      "While relations between the U.S. and Russia are \u201cquite bad\u201d on the national level, \u201cperson to person and even space agency to space agency, they're actually quite good,\u201d Shepherd told The Associated Press.",
      "By NASA\u2019s count, 290 people from 26 countries have visited the space station. Seven are up there right now, representing the U.S., Russia and Japan.",
      "Most of the visitors have flown courtesy of their homelands.",
      "The first to pay his own way \u2014 California businessman Dennis Tito \u2014 launched with the Russians in 2001 over NASA\u2019s objections. Hungry for cash, Russia continued flying private clients, including a Russian movie crew in 2021.",
      "NASA now embraces space tourism, inviting private crews for two-week stays. Dropping by the station a few months ago were the first astronauts in decades from India, Poland and Hungary, accompanied by the station's first female commander, Peggy Whitson. \u201cSpace brings people together,\u201d she noted.",
      "Operations may look easy and ho-hum as astronauts come and go, but \u201cthere\u2019s nothing routine about it,\u201d former NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said at a recent presentation.",
      "Among the more serious stumbles: a spacewalker\u2019s near-drowning, a docking that sent the station into a wild spin, persistent cracks and air leaks, and the ever-growing threat of space junk.",
      "Shepherd is surprised it\u2019s still going strong. \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s more than twice its design life on a lot of things is pretty remarkable,\u201d he said.",
      "Space station life has improved drastically since Shepherd and his crew toughed it out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a four-star hotel now,\u201d he said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t ask for better accommodations, at least in space.\u201d",

      "Astronauts have gotten married and welcomed newborn children while serving on the space station. One of the new space dads \u2014 Mike Fincke \u2014 is up there again, more than 20 years after he dialed in from orbit to his wife\u2019s delivery room.",
      "Station residents have also dealt with heartbreak. An astronaut\u2019s mother was killed in a car accident in 2007. And in 2011, Scott Kelly was midway through a five-month stay when his sister-in-law, U.S. Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, was shot in the head and survived.",
      "Others have had to cope with delayed returns, the most recent and extreme case involving stuck astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.

      "Researchers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute are developing tiny drones inspired by bats for search and rescue missions",
      "WORCESTER, Mass. -- Don't be fooled by the fog machine, spooky lights and fake bats: the robotics lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute lab isn't hosting a Halloween party.",
      "Instead, it\u2019s a testing ground for tiny drones that can be deployed in search and rescue missions even in dark, smoky or stormy conditions.",
      "\u201cWe all know that when there\u2019s an earthquake or a tsunami, the first thing that goes down is power lines. A lot of times, it\u2019s at night, and you\u2019re not going to wait until the next morning to go and rescue survivors,\u201d said Nitin Sanket, assistant professor of robotics engineering. \u201cSo we started looking at nature. Is there a creature in the world which can actually do this?\u201d",
      "Sanket and his students found their answer in bats and the winged mammal's highly sophisticated ability to echolocate, or navigate via reflected sound. With a National Science Foundation grant, they\u2019re developing small, inexpensive and energy-efficient aerial robots that can be flown where and when current drones can\u2019t operate.",
      "Last month, emergency workers in Pakistan used drones to find people stranded on rooftops by massive floods. In August, a rescue team used a drone to find a California man who got trapped for two days behind a waterfall. And in July, drones helped find a stable route to three mine workers who spent more than 60 hours trapped underground in Canada.",
      "But while drones are becoming more common in search and rescue, Sanket and researchers elsewhere want to move beyond the manually operated individual robots being used today. A key next step is developing aerial robots that can be deployed in swarms and make their own decisions about where to search, said Ryan Williams, an associate professor at Virginia Tech.",
      "\u201cThat type of deployment \u2014 autonomous drones \u2014 that is effectively nil,\u201d he said.",
      "Williams tackled that problem with a recent project that involved programming drones to choose search trajectories in coordination with human searchers. Among other things, his team used historical data from thousands of missing person cases to create a model predicting how someone would behave if lost in the woods.",
      "\u201cAnd then we used that model to better localize our drones, to search in locations with higher chances of finding someone,\u201d he said.",
      "At WPI, Sanket\u2019s project addresses other limitations of current drones, including their size and perception capabilities.",
      "\u201cCurrent robots are big, bulky, expensive and cannot work in all sorts of scenarios,\u201d he said.",

      "By contrast, his drone fits in the palm of his hand, is made mostly from inexpensive hobby-grade materials and can operate in the dark. A small ultrasonic sensor, not unlike those used in automatic faucets in public restrooms, mimics bat behavior, sending out a pulse of high-frequency sound and using the echo to detect obstacles in its path.",
      "During a recent demonstration, a student used a remote control to launch the drone in a brightly lit room and then again after turning off all but a faintly glowing red light. As it approached a clear, Plexiglas wall, the drone repeatedly halted and backed away, even with the lights off and with fog and fake snow swirling through the air.",
      "\u201cCurrently, search and rescue robots are mainly operational in broad daylight,\u201d Sanket said. \u201cThe problem is that search and rescues are dull, dangerous and dirty jobs that happen a lot of times in darkness.\u201d",
      "But development didn\u2019t go completely smoothly. The researchers realized that the noise of the bat robot\u2019s propellers interfered with the ultrasound, requiring 3D printed shells to minimize the interference. They also used artificial intelligence to teach the drone how to filter and interpret sound signals.",
      "Still, there\u2019s a long way to go to match bats, which can contract and compress their muscles to listen only to certain echoes and can detect something as small as a human hair from several meters away.",
      "\u201cBats are amazing,\u201d Sanket said. \u201cWe are nowhere close to what nature has achieved. But the goal is that one day in the future, we will be there and these will be useful for deployment in the wild.\u201d",

      "A Yup'ik community near the Bering Sea in southwest Alaska was spared the widespread devastation other communities experienced from the remnants of Typhoon Halong earlier this month",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- A fragment of a mask that was preserved for hundreds of years in permafrost sat in the muck of a low tide in the western Alaska community of Quinhagak. Wooden spoons, toys, a fishing lure and other artifacts were strewn, in some cases for miles, along the beach.",
      "The Yup'ik community near the edge of the Bering Sea was spared the widespread devastation wrought by the remnants of Typhoon Halong on its neighbors further west earlier this month. But it suffered a different kind of blow: The lashing winds and storm surge devoured dozens of feet of shoreline, disrupting a culturally significant archaeological site and washing away possibly thousands of unearthed artifacts.",
      "About 1,000 pieces, including wooden masks and tools, were recovered in Quinhagak after the storm ravaged parts of southwest Alaska on Oct. 11 and 12. But many more pieces \u2014 perhaps up to 100,000 \u2014 were left scattered, said Rick Knecht, an archaeologist who has worked on the Nunalleq, or old village, project for 17 years. That's roughly the number of pieces previously recovered from the archaeological site.",
      "Meanwhile, freezing temperatures and ice have settled into the region, stalling immediate efforts to find and recover more displaced artifacts on searches done by four-wheeler and foot.",
      "Knecht called what happened a major loss. The site has yielded the world's largest collection of pre-contact Yup'ik artifacts. Much of what's known about Yup'ik life before outsiders arrived stems from the project, said Knecht, an emeritus senior lecturer in archaeology at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.",
      "\u201cWhen there are holes or disturbances in the site, it\u2019s like trying to read a book with holes in the pages. You're going to miss a few things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the bigger those holes are, the weaker the story gets. There\u2019s a few holes in the book right now.\u201d",
      "While the name of the original village isn't known, it was attacked by another village and burned around 1650, he said. Knecht has worked with elders and others in Quinhagak to combine their traditional knowledge with the technology and techniques used by the archaeology teams to study the past together.",
      "Quinhagak has about 800 residents, and subsistence food gathering is critically important to them.",
      "The storm dispersed artifacts from a site long preserved by permafrost, Knecht said. A longstanding concern has been the threat that climate change \u2014 melting permafrost, coastal erosion, the potential for more frequent or stronger storms \u2014 has posed to the site, he said.",
      "It poses risks to the community itself. Erosion threatens major infrastructure in Quinhagak, including a sewage lagoon, homes and fish camps. Thawing permafrost is also unsettling and undermining buildings, according to a 2024 report from the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.",
      "The excavation project itself began after artifacts began appearing on the beach around 2007. Part of the site that washed out had been excavated previously.",

      "When he left in July, there was a roughly 30-foot buffer to the sea. The storm took out the buffer and another 30 feet of the site, he said. It also left what Knecht described as piano-sized clumps of tundra on the tidal flats.",
      "Knecht didn't recognize the site at first after Halong.",
      "\u201cI just drove right by it because all the landmarks I\u2019m used to on the beach and at the site were gone or changed,\u201d he said.",
      "Work to preserve the rescued artifacts has included soaking the marine salts from the wood and placing the pieces in special chemicals that will help them hold together when they dry out, he said. If one were to just take one of the wooden artifacts off the beach and let them dry, they'd \u201ccrack to pieces, sometimes in a matter of hours.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Producing and manufacturing electric vehicles and their batteries uses a lot of energy, leading many to be skeptical about the environmental benefits of going electric",
      "DETROIT -- Making electric vehicles and their batteries is a dirty process that uses a lot of energy. But a new study says that EVs quickly make up for that with less overall emissions through two years of use than a gas-powered vehicle.",
      "The study also estimated that gas-powered vehicles cause at least twice as much environmental damage over their lifetimes as EVs, and said the benefits of EVs can be expected to increase in coming decades as clean sources of power, such as solar and wind, are brought onto the grid.",
      "The work by researchers from Northern Arizona University and Duke University, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS Climate, offers insight into a transportation sector that makes up a big part of U.S. emissions. It also comes as some EV skeptics have raised concerns about whether the environmental impact of battery production, including mining, makes it worthwhile to switch to electric.",
      "\u201cWhile there is a bigger carbon footprint in the very short term because of the manufacturing process in creating the batteries for electric vehicles, very quickly you come out ahead in CO2 emissions by year three and then for all of the rest of the vehicle lifetime, you\u2019re far ahead and so cumulatively much lower carbon footprint,\" said Drew Shindell, an earth science professor at Duke University and study co-author.",
      "The researchers evaluated several harmful air pollutants monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as emissions data, to compare the relative impact over time of EVs and internal combustion engines on air quality and climate change.",
      "Their analysis said that EVs produce 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than gasoline vehicles in their first two years. That can be attributed to the energy-intensive production and manufacturing processes involved in mining lithium for EV batteries.",
      "They also sought to account for how the U.S. energy system might develop in coming years, assuming growth in clean energy. And they modeled four different scenarios for EV adoption, ranging from the lowest \u2014 a 31% share of vehicle sales \u2014 to the highest, 75% of sales, by 2050. (EV sales accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2024.)",
      "The researchers said the average of those four models found that for each additional kilowatt hour of lithium-ion battery output, carbon dioxide emissions drop by an average of 220 kilograms (485 pounds) in 2030, and another 127 kilograms (280 pounds) in 2050.",
      "The consistent decrease in CO2 emissions from EVs is \u201cnot only driven by the on-road vehicles, but also reduction that has been brought due to electricity production,\u201d said lead author Pankaj Sadavarte, a postdoctoral researcher at Northern Arizona University.",
      "Greg Keoleian, a University of Michigan professor of sustainable systems who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, called it a \u201cvaluable study\u201d that echoes other findings and \u201cconfirms the environmental and economic benefits\u201d of EVs.",
      "\u201cAccelerating the adoption of battery electric vehicles is a key strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector which will reduce future damages and costs of climate change,\u201d he said.",
      "Shindell, the Duke researcher, said the grid will evolve to have more solar and wind power.",
      "\u201cWhen you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody\u2019s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the grid just overall becomes much cleaner in both the terms of carbon emissions for climate change, and for air pollution.\"",
      "Outside experts agreed \u2014 as long as the policy landscape supports it. That hasn't been the case under President Donald Trump, who has worked to boost fossil fuels and restrain solar and wind power development.",

But Trump reversed that policy, and Congress has terminated federal tax credits for an EV purchase.

After wide bipartisan majorities in Congress passed \u2014 and President Joe Biden signed \u2014 a law that would ban TikTok in the U.S. if it did not find a new owner in the place of China's ByteDance, the platform was set to go dark on the law's January deadline. For a several hours, it did. But on his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order to keep it running while his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.",
      "Three more executive orders followed, as Trump, without a clear legal basis, continued to extend the deadline for a TikTok deal. The second was in April, when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement. The third came in June, then another in September, which Trump said would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States in a way that meets national security concerns.",

    "story": [
      "That could mean calling the House back in session for the first time in weeks.",
      "For several weeks now, the Senate has tried, and failed, on 13 separate occasions to advance a short-term funding bill to reopen the government. But now, according to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, that bill has one pretty big problem: If it were to pass the Senate in the coming days, it wouldn't reopen the government for a long enough time.",
      "\"The date is going to have to change,\" Thune said Monday.",
      "If the Senate had approved the House-passed short-term government funding bill on or before the beginning of the shutdown, it would have extended the funding deadline for seven weeks -- until Nov. 21 -- buying congressional appropriators nearly two months to continue their work on full-year funding bills before another funding deadline.",
      "But that was 34 days ago. And now, on Nov. 3, that seven weeks of runway that the short-term bill would have given appropriators has shortened to two-and-a-half weeks.",
      "Thune said that the Nov. 21 funding deadline that's in the House bill will not give lawmakers enough time to work on full-year appropriations before staring down yet another shutdown. So, the Senate's new strategy for government funding is going to involve some sort of change to the date, he said.",
      "\"That date is lost,\" Thune told reporters Monday. \"So, it's a question now of what the next date is.\"",
      "Thune said he was open to ideas on new deadlines, including shifting the short-term funding bill to keep the government open until early 2026.",
      "There are a number of ways that the Senate could go about changing the date if a bill like the one that Republicans are backing ever had the necessary Democratic support to advance.\u00a0Thune kept a range of possibilities on the table: The Senate could approve the House bill and then amend it, or it could start in on a brand new bill.",

The Senate bill won't be able to simply head right to President Donald Trump's desk. And that means Speaker Mike Johnson may have to call the House back to Washington for the first time in weeks if the Senate does eventually act.",
      "There's still no clear path out of the shutdown. Democrats continue to insist that Republicans need to engage in negotiations on health care in order to keep the government funded.",
      "But after a weekend of talks between some rank-and-file members, Thune said he's optimistic things could be shifting.",
      "\"Based on sort of my gut on how these things operate, I think we're getting close to an off-ramp here,\" Thune said. \"But I again, I don't know what -- this is unlike any sort of government shutdown in terms of the way Democrats are reacting to it.\"",
      "Thune suggested that little has changed about what Republicans are willing to offer Democrats in exchange for the remaining votes they need to reopen the government. The offers remain about process and not about health care, as Democrats have demanded, so it's not yet clear if this will be enough to secure the votes to move forward.",

    "summary": "Newsom is a leader running miles ahead of others, experts explained to ABC News.",
    "story": [
      "Newsom has discarded Democrats' \"when they go low, we go high\" mantra.",
      "At the beginning of the year, California Gov. Gavin Newsom's tenure was marked by devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, a steady stream of ridicule from the White House, and backlash from within the Democratic Party for siding with conservatives on transgender athletes in women's sports.",
      "Not to mention, in the summer of 2021, Newsom weathered a blistering attempt to recall him from office -- his starpower at risk.",
      "Yet the twice-elected governor has pulled off a reputational heel turn, marked by viral Trump-mocking social media posts and parody MAGA merch coupled with a statewide redistricting measure that would level Republican's attempt to get an edge ahead of next year's midterms.",
      "Now, Newsom is a leader running miles ahead of others, experts explained to ABC News.",
      "One of the most noticeable transformations was the rebrand of Newsom's official governor social media account. A senior Newsom official told ABC that the weekend of June 6, when the team learned the president was federalizing the National Guard into Los Angeles, was when the \"red line\" was crossed, and a more defiant version of the Democratic governor debuted.",
      "\"That is when everything changed, with the governor, with our social media,\" the official said.",
      "On June 10, Newsom's @GovPressOffice account shared a TikTok video, where a voiceover, in the style of a Star Wars villain, mimicked Trump's TruthSocial post announcing the federalization of troops. That post generated over 800,000 views.",
      "The salvo continued. The same day, Newsom, on Instagram, responded to Trump mocking him as \"Newscum\" on Truth Social with a diss-video set to the Taylor Swift (another common Trump target) song \"You Need To Calm Down,\" dismissing Trump as \"keyboard warrior.\" That short video has 11.3 million views.",
      "The mocking never let up.",
      "'Newsom Derangement Syndrome'",
      "A non-exhaustive list of the incoming includes: accusing Trump of having \"Newsom Derangement Syndrome,\" a play on Trump's oft-referred \"Trump Derangement Syndrome;\" likening Trump adviser Stephen Miller to Voldemort, the villain from the Harry Potter series, and calling him submissive; calling Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \"Kosplay Kristi\" and urging followers to \"hide yo dogs,\" a reference to Noem's infamous tale of shooting and killing her own dog, Cricket; mocking Vice President JD Vance over a debunked rumor that he performed sex acts with a couch; and comparing White House border czar Tom Homan to an uncooked ham.",
      "Since then, Newsom's social media accounts have skyrocketed. Follower counts across multiple platforms for his non-government account, @GavinNewsom, ballooned -- growing to more than 11 million followers collectively. Nearly half of those followers were new this year.",
      "One of the official accounts, @GovPressOffice, has seen nearly 1 billion impressions on X since those first provocative posts in June, per Newsom's campaign.",
      "Newsom even launched his own \"patriot\" merchandise shop, repurposing Trump's Make America Great Again slogan -- Make America Gavin Again -- and selling REAL PATRIOT hats NEWSOM WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING! And REAL PATRIOT hats, and kneepads marked with Trump's signature.",
      "A key mark in Newsom's success is upending the \"when they go low, we go high\" mantra coined by Michelle Obama in 2016, suggested Parker Butler, the former director of Kamala Harris' presidential campaign's buzzy social media channel, @KamalaHQ. \"That is not where we are right now.\"",
      "'It feels very unrestrained'",
      "\"When we see democracy hanging by a thread, we have to take risks. It feels very unrestrained, that's the kind of energy that I think Democrats need,\" said Butler, now a digital strategist and co-founder at Luminary Strategies.",
      "\"We need to throw the sort of old rulebook out the window,\" Butler added.",
      "When Newsom launched his new solo podcast \"This is Gavin Newsom\" in March, he said he wanted to \"debate without demeaning\" and engage with people most members his party wouldn't dare to speak to. He called the Democratic brand \"toxic.\" He's positioned himself as a lefty alternative in the GOP-de-jour manosphere space. His interview with Charlie Kirk, for instance, has 1.3 million YouTube views.",

Julianna was outraged with Newsom at the start of the year, in part due to his right-wing podcast guests, but she now considers herself a huge fan -- she's even bought his merch.",
      "\"I did not take Gavin Newsom seriously until he made it clear that he was ready to take action,\" Julianna added.",
      "'Holding a mirror to the clown show'",
      "Newsom's longtime speechwriter and former deputy chief of staff Jason Eliott described the online mockery as a strategy of \"holding up a mirror to the clown show that is the Trump administration. We're not doing anything differently than what they are doing.\"",
      "Elliott said the buzz around Newsom's posts creates space for the \"actual substantive work,\" like Proposition 50, the ballot initiative that, if approved by voters on Tuesday,\u00a0will temporarily adopt a new congressional map that redraws five districts to be more Democratic-leaning, potentially flipping five existing Republican seats in the midterms. Elliott said that since the office has sharpened its tone, donations have poured in from millions of supporters.",
      "\"How do you get 1.2 million people from all 50 states all across the country to buy into this defense of democracy? You do it by getting attention,\" Eliott said.",
      "Newsom, in a recent interview with ABC News' Jonathan Karl, concurred.",
      "\"We're trying to have a little humor in this process as well, and we're fighting fire with fire, not just rhetorically, in the context of that back and forth, but substantively, we can get into the 43 lawsuits, we can get in the work we're trying to do on Prop 50,\" Newsom explained.",
      "John Dennis, former chair of the San Francisco Republican Party, said Newsom's tactic is the latest iteration of what he and other critics call a history of \"shapeshifting.\"",
      "\"He doesn't know who he is. So he's trying to be everybody else,\" Dennis said.",
      "But he admits it appears to be working.",
      "\"This Prop 50 move is a very clever move for the Democrats. And he's got good people around him,\" Dennis said. \"They know that Trump is the center of the universe right now so he's just keeping his name alive and positioning himself as the Trump fighter -- and he's going to run that all the way into the Democrat primaries.\"",
      "Dan Schnur, a longtime California political analyst and UC-Berkeley professor, called the Proposition 50 campaign \"a self-delivered political gift for Newsom.\"",
      "Newsom's successes put him in a solid position to launch a presidential bid, an ambition Californians are under no illusions about.",
      "\"Every governor looks in the mirror and sees a president looking back at them, and Newsom probably whistles \"Hail to the Chief\" when he's in the shower every morning,\" Schnur said. \"It's hard to predict exactly how the race plays out, but the governor of the largest state in the country, who is also the most visible and impactful Trump critic, and who has access to tremendous amounts of fundraising dollars could be a pretty formidable contender.\"",

      "\"We have winners. We have good stars.\"",
      "Democrats, in the throes of rebuilding their party can agree, at least, on one thing: they are fed up with being portrayed as losers.",
      "Several ABC News interviews with Democratic strategists, current and former national staffers, and state-level officials raise several questions from within the party of how to best shift perceptions ahead of the midterms: does the party go full bore on anti-Trump messaging as the navigate the politics of the ongoing government shutdown and voters feel the pinch? Do they focus, instead, on boosting progressive rising stars even as Republicans paint the party as too-radical?",
      "Some less conventional Democrats question whether the party should bother relying on the traditional leadership structure, who may lean too much on outdated tactics, in Washington at all. While other, more traditional members, argue they're not in as much disarray as their critics claim.",
      "Democrats in Washington point to recent wins as proof that their brand is not as toxic as some critics claim: two Republican legislative district flips in Iowa; electing a Democrat in a Pennsylvania state senate seat for the first time in 130 years; elevating a Democratic mayor to lead Omaha's blue dot, for example.",
      "They're banking on likely successes in the days-away gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey (and to a lesser extent, dominance in New York City's mayoral race) as reputational defibrillators a year out from the midterms.",
      "\"We have the momentum, certainly, heading into this final stretch,\" Democratic National Committee chairman Ken Martin told ABC News in a recent interview, of anticipated wins in New Jersey, Virginia, and Pennsylvania's supreme court races.",
      "Yet a\u00a0recent\u00a0ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll\u00a0found that more Americans say the Democratic Party is \"out of touch with the concerns of most people in the United States today\" (68%) than Trump (63%) and the Republican Party (61%).",
      "Asked on Sunday why more Americans feel this way about Democrats than the president -- even amidst the East Wing demolitions or a White House Halloween party hosted during the shutdown -- Martin suggested Republicans were in hotter water and disapproved of by Americans more.",
      "But pressed on what Democrats are doing to try to get more in touch with voters -- or why he thinks, even if there is a swing away from Trump, people still see the Democrats as out of touch -- Martin said he's confident the party is making strides regardless of what the polls say.",
      "\"I can't speak to that because I've seen a lot of other polls that suggest just the opposite, right? People are starting to put their trust and faith back in with the Democratic Party. And you know, I can tell you right now that you know, we've been out there having conversations with voters, growing our coalition,\" Martin said, adding that Trump's policies and actions are creating an opening for Democrats to have conversations with disillusioned voters.",
      "Democrats also hope to mine several lessons from their soon-to-be-released election analysis (don't call it a postmortem, members joke).",
      "One of Martin biggest takeaways from the report, he told ABC News, is that \"everyone just started their campaign way too late, and we had already been defined before we ever had a chance to define ourselves ... we cannot wait to talk to voters until the final few months before an election.\"",
      "Yet, some Democrats see their party's lower approval numbers (32%, per a recent Associated Press survey)\u00a0and believe they should pivot away from the traditional party apparatus.",
      "\"We are a party without a leader, and so there is no one to set the tone,\" a former DNC staffer and Democratic strategist told ABC News.",
      "They argue that there are vulnerabilities beyond the DNC, but also from more classical candidate recruitment from congressional leadership's political operation, who they suggested are not taking necessary risks on non-traditional picks. Sen. Chuck Schumer is reportedly facing resistance to his leadership among potential Senate candidates.",
      "A second former DNC staffer, who has since worked on presidential campaigns, put it more bluntly: \"The current iteration of the DNC has weakened itself out of relevance and should not be seen as anything but a fundraising vessel.\"",
      "Libby Schneider, deputy executive director of the DNC, concedes that it's typical after an election loss to be heartbroken and upset, and understands there may be some criticism in its wake. Despite that, she argues the committee is laser-focused on winning and wishes to be a tool to help candidates succeed.",
      "\"People can feel what they need to feel and grieve how they need to grieve about this loss, and we will change the things that we need to change in order to continue to perform well. But to me, people complaining tells me that they care a whole lot, and I think that that's valuable. And also, frankly, we can listen to that stuff and still do our jobs every day to elect Democrats,\" said Schneider.",
      "\"We went from being the party of cool with Barack Obama to turning into the party of nerds and dweebs and losers, right? What is really annoying about all of it is that we have winners. We have good stars,\" the second staffer continued. told ABC News.",
      "Obama has aligned himself, and whatever residual it-factor he possesses, with marquee political fights over the last few months: rallying Texas Democrats who broke quorum, in-person campaigning for both the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races, boosting Democrats in Pennsylvania's supreme court elections, to cutting ads for Gov. Gavin Newsom's redistricting proposition.",

At the same time, if we're serious about telling voters we're moving forward -- she can't be our nominee in 2028. Is she a leading voice in the party, yes?

      "\"We have to be a tent that wins by addition and not subtraction,\" Schneider said. She feels confident ahead of Tuesday's elections, and believes that there's a strong case to be made to voters about Trump's impact on their bottom line, their health care premiums, their overall cost of living, as well as voters' souring on the president's handling of the economy and immigration.",
      "Per a new ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, roughly 6 in 10 Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of the job.",
      "And despite worries of disinterested donors and shrinking voter registration, the campaign arms of the party, taking cues from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, are outraising their Republican counterparts, even as the national party heavily lags in that arena. The DSCC raised nearly $20 million in Q3, versus the NRSC's $18 million, and the DCCC currently has a slight cash-on-hand edge, with $46.6 million to the NRCC's $45.8. A DNC official says the committee",
      "Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who rebuilt the DNC as chair after the party's devastating losses in 2001, is bullish on his party's chances to sweep over the next year, as he believes droves of voters will reject Trump due to rising costs, shrinking access to health care, and negative impacts of the government shutdown, and trickle back to Democrats after this off-cycle election day.",
      "\"T\u200b\u200bhe Democratic Party is poised to take off like a booster rocket,\" said McAuliffe, who, a few weeks ago, hosted a packed fundraiser for Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Abigail Spanberger, at his home alongside the Clintons on behalf of the Democratic Governors' Association.",
      "McAuliffe said the 400-or-so attendees raised $2.2 million in one night -- proof, he argues, of his party's unquestionable desire to win. His message to hand-wringers and eye-rollers, even some within the party, echoes from what many at the top tell ABC: \"We need to be encouraged, people are counting on us to fight. I'm tired of the whining, complaining, the party of lemon suckers. Get in the game.\"",
      "Jaime Harrison, Martin's most recent predecessor at the DNC, realized the extent of his party's vulnerabilities during his 2020 Senate bid to unseat Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. (Santa Claus could run on Christmas as a Democrat and lose, he jokes.)",
      "Harrison worries about the perceptions of disjointedness, and suggested that various groups like the DGA, members of Congress, and the DNC convene for a joint-policy retreat \"so that people see we're all in alignment on our message, on our mission.\"",
      "Harrison also said he hopes the party seriously considers hosting a midterm convention, which could amplify their talent and hammer home their priorities. Schneider said a potential event is \"in the mix.\"",
      "\"The Democrats are looking for a unity of purpose, a unity of message, a unity of strategy. And it's important that the leadership right now provides that,\" said Harrison, who says he trusts Martin and believes support, from donors and otherwise, will return after Democratic wins on Tuesday.",
      "\"I'm not overly concerned. If we were in June of '26 and we're still not getting major donors, then I'm concerned. But we're not there yet,\" he added, expressing confidence in the continued grassroots support.",
      "Some Democrats also point to Martin's tenure as one that prioritizes infrastructure. For example, state parties now get major influxes of cash, to the tune of a million dollars a month, to hire staff, set up programs, and fortify their ranks. \"Party changing money,\" adds Schneider. Lauren Nechochea, chair of the Idaho Democrats, told ABC News her chapter now has steady, monthly financial support.",
      "Texas Rep. Gene Wu, chair of the Lone Star State House Democratic caucus, said Jefferies and Martin gave his cohort full support to break quorum and attempt to block Republican redistricting efforts, a move that kicked off the party's more aggressive opposition to redistricting nationwide.",
      "Wu acknowledges that the perception of the Democratic Party is in peril, and is anxious for politicians to openly fight for the working class. He says voters, friends see Democrats as message-less, scolding hall monitors.",
      "\"People who would rather be right than win; people who would rather spend the time to tell other people how they're wrong instead of telling people what they would do about it and how they're going to fix it,\" Wu told ABC News.",
      "Wu said candidates need to be firmer on their beliefs, and his party must run candidates willing to take Republicans to task (like California's Gov. Newsom in his push to draw Democratic friendly maps) or face total failure.",
      "\"I think that the reality of where we are today and what the cost of failure will mean, I don't think people are under any illusion of where we are at this moment,\" said Wu, who added, \"this is not time for us to screw around ... I don't give a crap that you think Democrats are wimpy or whatever else. But if you want America to not suck anymore, you better join us.\"",

      "Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran citizen with an American wife and child who has lived in Maryland for years. He immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager to join his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, where he faces danger from a gang that targeted his family.",
      "While he was allowed to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision, he was not given residency status. Earlier this year, he was mistakenly deported and held in a notoriously brutal Salvadoran prison despite having no criminal record.",
      "Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, Trump's Republican administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges and asked Crenshaw to dismiss them.",
      "Abrego Garcia is charged with human smuggling and conspiracy to commit human smuggling, with prosecutors claiming he accepted money to transport within the United States people who were in the country illegally.",
      "The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Body camera footage from a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer shows a calm exchange with Abrego Garcia. There were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security agent testified at an earlier hearing that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration must work to bring back Abrego Garcia.",

      "In support, court filings say the state trooper who pulled him over stated that the speed limit was 65 mph (105 kph) when it was actually 70 mph (113 kph). The trooper accused him of driving at 75 mph (120 kph), but there is no record that the trooper used a radar gun or pacing to gauge the speed. Abrego Garcia said he was driving at 70 mph, correctly noting the speed limit.",
      "Attorneys for the government argue that the trooper made an honest mistake. The speed limit decreases to 65 mph about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) farther down the interstate. The attorneys also note that Abrego Garcia was driving in the left lane \u201cconsistent with an individual traveling in excess of the posted speed limit.\u201d And the trooper, they said, had \"no reason or motivation to manufacture a traffic violation against him.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia currently can't be deported to El Salvador thanks to the 2019 settlement that found he had a \u201cwell founded fear\u201d of danger there. However, the Trump administration has said he cannot stay in the U.S. Over the past couple of months government officials have said they would deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.",
      "The administration\u2019s deportation agreements with so-called third countries have been contested in court by advocacy groups, which have noted that some immigrants are being sent to countries with long histories of human rights violations. But in June, a divided Supreme Court allowed the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands and with minimal notice.",
      "Abrego Garcia sued the Trump administration in a Maryland court over his earlier deportation, and the judge in that case has temporarily barred his removal. If the judge decides to lift that order, government attorneys have said they are ready to deport him right away.",
      "Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia has applied for asylum in the U.S. in immigration court.",

      "For President Donald Trump, tariffs \u2014 or the threat of them \u2014 can bend nations to his will",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump sees tariffs \u2014 or the threat of them \u2014 as a powerful tool to bend nations to his will.",
      "He has used them in an unprecedented way, not only as the underpinning of his economic agenda, but also as the cornerstone of his foreign policy in his second term.",
      "He has wielded the import taxes as a threat to secure ceasefiresfrom countries at war. He has used them to browbeat nations into promising to do more to stop people and drugs from flowing across their borders. He has used them, in Brazil\u2019s case, as political pressure because its judicial system prosecuted a former leader who was a Trump ally, and in a recent blowup with Canada, as punishment for a television ad.",
      "This week, the Supreme Court hears arguments on whether the Republican president has overstepped federal law with many of his tariffs. A ruling against him could limit or even take away that swift and blunt leverage that much of his foreign policy has relied on.",
      "Trump increasingly has expressed agitation and anxiety about the looming decision in a case he says is one of the most important in U.S. history.",
      "He has said it would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the United States if the justices fail to overturn lower court rulings that found he went too far in using an emergency powers law to put his tariffs in place.",
      "Trump had said he wanted to take the highly unusual step of attending the arguments in person, but on Sunday said he had ruled it out, saying he didn't want to be a distraction. \u201cI wanted to go so badly \u2014 I just don\u2019t want to do anything to deflect the importance of that decision,\" he told reporters on Air Force One.",
      "The Justice Department, in its defense of the tariffs, has highlighted the expansive way Trump has used them, arguing that the trade penalties are part of his power over foreign affairs, an area where the courts should not second-guess the president.",
      "Earlier this year, two lower courts and most judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that Trump did not have power under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to set tariffs \u2014 a power the Constitution grants to Congress. Some dissenting judges on the court, though, said the 1977 law allows the president to regulate imports during emergencies without specific limitations.",
      "The courts left the tariffs in place while the Supreme Court considers the issue. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to wield them as he has tried to pressure or punish other countries on matters related \u2014 and unrelated -- to trade.",
      "\u201cThe fact of the matter is that President Trump has acted lawfully by using the tariff powers granted to him by Congress in IEEPA to deal with national emergencies and to safeguard our national security and economy,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to ultimate victory on this matter with the Supreme Court.\u201d",
      "Still, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the Trump trade team is working on contingency plans should the high court rule against the Republican administration.",
      "\u201cWe do have backup plans,\u201d Leavitt said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\" \u201cBut ultimately\u2026we are hopeful that the Supreme Court will rule on the right side of the law and do what\u2019s right for our country. The importance of this case cannot be overstated. The president must have the emergency authority to utilize tariffs.\u201d",
      "Modern presidents have used financial sanctions such as freezing assets or blocking trade, not tariffs, for their foreign policy and national security aims, said Josh Lipsky, a former Obama White House and State Department staffer who is now the international economics chair at the Atlantic Council.",
      "There are other laws that presidents can use to impose tariffs. But they require a monthslong process to justify the rates.",
      "Trump, citing the IEEPA, moves faster and more dramatically. He signs executive orders imposing new rates and fires off social media posts threatening additional import taxes, as he did in late October when he was angered by an anti-tariff television ad aired by the province of Ontario.",

      "\u201cPresidents have typically treated tariffs as a scalpel, not a sledgehammer,\u201d Lipsky said.",
      "In contrast, Trump has used tariffs as the backbone of his national security and foreign policy agenda, Lipsky said. \u201cAll of it is interconnected and tariffs are at the heart of it,\u201d he said.",
      "For example, earlier this year Trump had threatened a 30% tariff on European imports, a major increase from 1.2% before he took office. Seeking to secure Trump's support for the NATO military alliance and for security guarantees for Ukraine in its war with Russia, the European Union struck a deal to settle for 15% tariffs.",
      "The EU Commission faced criticism from businesses and member states for giving away too much. But Trade Commissioner Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d argued the settlement was \u201cnot only about the trade. It\u2019s about security. It\u2019s about Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Trump has been able \"to use it in specific circumstances to get better deals \u2014 not just trade deals \u2014 but better deals overall than he might otherwise,\u201d Lipsky said. \u201cOn the other hand, you would say there\u2019s probably some backlash.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff strong-arming has rattled relationships with America\u2019s friends and foes. Some have responded by becoming more protectionist or looking to foster relations with China, which has tried to be seen as a promoter of free trade.",
      "There also is the impact on pocketbook. Some businesses have passed on some of the costs to consumers by raising prices, while others have waited to see where tariff rates end up.",
      "Tariffs traditionally have been used just as a tool to address trade practices.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s literally no precedent for the manner that President Trump is using them,\u201d said Emily Kilcrease, who was a deputy assistant U.S. trade representative and earlier worked on trade issues at the National Security Council as a career civil servant during the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations,",
      "\u201cThe use of tariffs the way that President Trump is using them is like \u2014 just broadscale attack on an economy as a way to incentivize a foreign government to change their posture,\u201d said Kilcrease, now a director at the Center for a New American Security think tank.",
      "But she said the case is not clear-cut. Kilcrease said she thinks there is a \u201cdecent chance\u201d the Supreme Court could side with Trump because IEEPA gives the president \u201cbroad, flexible emergency powers.\u201d",
      "The case is also coming before a Supreme Court that has thus far been reluctant to check to Trump\u2019s wide-ranging use of executive powers.",
      "If the court constrains Trump, it could leave foreign governments questioning whether to try to renegotiate trade agreements recently struck with the Trump administration, experts said. But there are political realities at play too, because reneging on deals could affect other foreign policy or economic priorities.",
      "The administration could pivot to try to use other laws to justify the tariffs, though that could mean a more complex and bureaucratic process, Kilcrease said.",
      "\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t take tariffs off the table,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just makes them a little bit slower.\u201d",

      "Millions of low-income families may face delays in receiving home heating aid due to the ongoing federal government shutdown",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- Jacqueline Chapman is a retired school aide who relies on a $630 monthly Social Security check to get by. She was navigating the loss of her federal food aid benefits when she learned the assistance she receives for heating her Philadelphia apartment may also be at risk.",
      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019m living in scary times. It\u2019s not easy to rest when you know you have things to do with limited accounts, limited funds. There isn\u2019t too much you can do,\u201d said Chapman, 74.",
      "Chapman relies on the $4.1 billion Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps millions of low-income households pay to heat and cool their homes.",
      "With temperatures beginning to drop in areas across the United States, some states are warning that funding for the program is being delayed because of the federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week.",
      "The anticipated delay comes as a majority of the 5.9 million households served by the federally funded heating and cooling assistance program are grappling with the sudden postponement of benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries. Money is running out for other safety net programs as well and energy prices are soaring.",
      "\u201cThe impact, even if it\u2019s temporary, on many of the nation\u2019s poor families is going to be profound if we don\u2019t solve this problem,\u201d said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which represents state directors of the program. Commonly called LIHEAP, it serves all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and federally recognized tribes.",
      "\u201cThese are important income supports that are all potentially heading toward a cliff at the same time,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t point to a similar time in recent history where we\u2019ve had this.\u201d",
      "LIHEAP, created in 1981, assists families in covering utility bills or the cost of paying for fuels delivered to homes, such as home heating oil. It has received bipartisan congressional support for decades.",
      "States manage the program. They receive an allotment of federal money each year based on a formula that largely takes into account state weather patterns, energy costs and low-income population data.",
      "While President Donald Trump proposed zero funding for the program in his budget, it was anticipated that Congress would fund LIHEAP for the budget year that began Oct. 1. But since Congress has not yet passed a full 2026 spending bill, states have not gotten their new allocations yet.",
      "Some states, including Kansas, Pennsylvania, New York and Minnesota, have announced their LIHEAP programs are being delayed by the government shutdown.",
      "In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro\u2019s administration said it cannot front the $200 million-plus in federal LIHEAP aid it had expected to help pay heating bills for some 300,000 low-income households. It is predicting payments will not go out until at least December, instead of November, as is customary.",
      "Minnesota\u2019s energy assistance program is processing applications but the state\u2019s Department of Commerce said federal LIHEAP dollars will likely be delayed by a month. The agency does not plan to pay recipients\u2019 heating bills until the shutdown ends.",
      "\u201cAs temperatures begin to drop, this delay could have serious impacts,\u201d the agency said. The program services 120,000 households, both homeowners and renters, that include many older adults, young children and people with disabilities.",
      "Connecticut has enough money to set aside to pay heating bills through at least the end of November or December, according to the group that helps administer LIHEAP. But the program faces uncertainty if the shutdown persists. Connecticut lawmakers are considering covering the cost temporarily with state budget reserves.",
      "\u201cThe situation will get much more perilous for folks who do need those resources as we move later into the heating season,\u201d said Rhonda Evans, executive director of the Connecticut Association for Community Action. More than 100,000 households were served last year.",

      "Chapman, the retired school aide, may be eligible for a program through her gas utility to prevent being shut off this winter. But the roughly 9% of LIHEAP recipients who rely on deliverable fuels such as heating oil, kerosene, propane and wood pellets, typically do not have such protections.",
      "Electric and natural gas companies are usually regulated by the state and can be told not to shut people off while the state waits to receive its share of the LIHEAP money, Wolfe said. But it is different when it involves a small oil or propane company, fuels more common in the Northeast.",

      "He has been approved this year for $500 in assistance but he has a half tank of oil left and cannot call for more until it is nearly empty. By that point, he is hoping there will be enough federal money left to fill it. He typically needs three deliveries to get through a winter.",
      "Bains said he can \u201cget by\u201d if he does not receive the help this year.",
      "\u201cI would turn the heat down to like 62 (degrees) and throw on another blanket, you know, just to get through,\u201d he said.",

      "HANOI, Vietnam -- U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was in Vietnam on Sunday, reaffirming a partnership built on healing the scars of the Vietnam War in a trip that will test whether Washington can reassure a vital but wary partner.",
      "Hegseth said addressing the legacies of the war, which ended 50 years ago in April, remains the foundation and a top priority of the countries' defense relationship.",
      "At the end of his talks with Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang, Hegseth handed over a leather box, a belt and a small knife \u2014 wartime artifacts once taken by U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War.",
      "Such returns have become part of broader reconciliation efforts between the two countries, with similar relics \u2014 including letters, identification tags and photographs \u2014 handed back to the U.S. in recent years.",

      "The nation\u2019s largest police fleet of Tesla Cybertrucks is set to begin patrolling the streets of Las Vegas in November",
      "LAS VEGAS -- The nation's largest police fleet of Tesla Cybertrucks is set to begin patrolling the streets of Las Vegas in November thanks to a donation from a U.S. tech billionaire, raising concerns about the blurring of lines between public and private interests.",
      "\u201cWelcome to the future of policing,\u201d Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill said during a recent press conference, surrounded by the Cybertrucks while drones hovered overhead and a police helicopter circled above him.",
      "The fleet of 10 black-and-white Cybertrucks of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department with flashing lights and sirens are wrapped with the police department\u2019s logo. About 400 officers have been trained to operate the trucks that will use public charging stations.",
      "The all-electric vehicles are equipped with shotguns, shields and ladders and additional battery capacity to better handle the demands of a police department, McMahill said.",
      "The donation has raised concerns from government oversight experts about private donors\u2019 influence on public departments and the boost to the Tesla brand. The department is the latest U.S. city to turn to Tesla models even as Elon Musk \u2019s electric vehicle company has faced blowback because of his work earlier in the year to advance the president\u2019s political agenda and downsize the federal government.",
      "McMahill noted the trucks will help keep officers safer because they are bulletproof, while Metro\u2019s other squad cars are not. Each Cybertruck is valued at somewhere between $80,000 and $115,000 and will be used to respond to calls like barricades and shootings in addition to regular patrols.",
      "The Cybertrucks also offer unique benefits such as a shorter turn radius, he said.",
      "\u201cThey look a little bit different than the patrol cars that we have out there, but they represent something far bigger than just a police car,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cThey represent innovation. They represent sustainability, and they represent our continued commitment to serve this community with the best tools that we have available, safely, efficiently and responsibly.\u201d",
      "The fleet comes amid a roller coaster year for Tesla that has dealt with multiple recalls.",
      "In March, U.S. safety regulators recalled virtually all Cybertrucks on the road.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s recall, which covered more than 46,000 Cybertrucks, warned that an exterior panel that runs along the left and right side of the windshield can detach while driving, creating a dangerous road hazard for other drivers, increasing the risk of a crash. Tesla offered to replace the panels free of charge in notification letters sent out in May.",
      "In late October, Tesla announced another recall of more than 63,000 Cybertrucks in the U.S. because the front lights are too bright, which may cause a distraction to other drivers and increase the risk of a collision.",
      "Las Vegas officer Robert Wicks with the department\u2019s public information office said all of Tesla\u2019s recalls will have been dealt with before the Cybertrucks patrol the streets. The March recall regarding panel issues was handled before the department received the trucks, he said.",
      "Federal regulators also have opened yet another investigation into Tesla\u2019s self-driving feature after dozens of incidents in which the cars ran red lights or drove on the wrong side of the road, sometimes crashing into other vehicles and causing injuries.",
      "The Cybertrucks modified for the Las Vegas police fleet do not have any kind of self-driving feature.",
      "Laura Martin, executive director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada Action Fund, said the imposing trucks with their sharp angles \u201cseems like they\u2019re designed for intimidation and not safety.\"",

    "story": [
      "Diane Ladd, the actress known for her Oscar-nominated roles in \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,\" \"Wild at Heart\" and \"Rambling Rose,\" has died, her representative confirmed to CBS News on Monday. She was 89.",
      "Her daughter, Laura Dern, said in a statement that she was by Ladd's side when she passed at her home in Ojai, California.",
      "\"She was the greatest daughter, mother, grandmother, actress, artist and empathetic spirit that only dreams could have seemingly created,\" Dern said. \"We were blessed to have her. She is flying with her angels now.\"",
      "Dern's statement didn't immediately cite a cause of death.",
      "In 2023, the mother and daughter told \"CBS Sunday Morning\"\u00a0that the two began taking daily walks in Santa Monica after learning that Ladd had developed a lung disease, believed to be caused by exposure to pesticides. Dern was told her mother only had six months to live.",
      "That's when the two had conversations that eventually filled the pages of \"Honey, Baby, Mine,\" their joint memoir named for an old folk song Ladd's father used to sing. They discussed everything, starting with Ladd's marriage and divorce from Laura's father, actor Bruce Dern, to her efforts to discourage Laura from joining the family business.",
      "\"She was only, like, 11 years old, and I said, 'Don't be an actress. Be a doctor, be a lawyer,'\" Ladd said. \"Nobody cares if you put on weight or your chin points when you cry if you're a doctor. They just want you to be the best you can be. But an actress? They care, care, care, care, care.\"",
      "But Dern said there was no stopping her from being in movies: \"No. It is all I knew.\"",
      "A native of Laurel, Mississippi, Ladd was apparently destined to stand out. In her 2006 memoir, \"Spiraling Through the School of Life,\" she remembered being told by her great-grandmother that she would one day be in \"front of a screen\" and would \"command\" her own audiences.",
      "By the mid-1970s, she had lived out her fate well enough to tell The New York Times that she no longer denied herself the right to call herself great.",
      "\"Now I don't say that,\" she said. \"I can do Shakespeare, Ibsen, English accents, Irish accents, no accent, stand on my head, tap dance, sing, look 17 or look 70.\"",
      "A gifted comic and dramatic performer, Ladd had a long career in television and on stage before breaking through as a film performer in Martin Scorsese's 1974 release \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.\" She earned an Oscar nomination for supporting actor for her turn as the acerbic, straight-talking Flo, and went on to appear in dozens of movies over the following decades.",
      "Her many credits included \"Chinatown,\" \"Primary Colors\" and two other movies for which she received best supporting nods, \"Wild at Heart\" and \"Rambling Rose,\" both of which co-starred her daughter. She also continued to work in television, with appearances in \"ER,\" \"Touched by an Angel\" and \"Alice,\" the spinoff from \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,\" among others.",
      "Through marriage and blood relations, Ladd was tied to the arts. Tennessee Williams was a second cousin, and first husband Bruce Dern, Laura's father, was himself an Academy Award nominee. Ladd and Laura Dern achieved the rare feat of mother-and-daughter nominees for their work in \"Rambling Rose.\"",

    "summary": "The former Prince Andrew is set to lose his final military title, as King Charles continues shunning his younger brother over historic ties to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, Duke of York, appears set to be stripped of his last honorary military title as the British royals continue their efforts to distance themselves from King Charles III's younger brother over his links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"We've seen Andrew surrender the military positions that he's had and we're looking now at the one remaining position he has, which is the honorary vice admiral position, and we've got a process underway for that\" to be removed, Defense Secretary John Healey told Britain's Sky News on Sunday.",
      "In a separate interview on the same subject with CBS News' partner network BBC News, the defense chief said \"it's a move the king has indicated we should take.\"",
      "Mountbatten Windsor is the late Queen Elizabeth II's third child. He spent decades in public life as a working member of the royal family, but revelations of his historical ties to Epstein have turned him into a pariah figure. In 2016, he was named in a civil lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Epstein paid her to have sex with the former prince on several occasions. Mountbatten Windsor has repeatedly denied the claims, but he settled the case out of court with Giuffre in 2022, for an undisclosed sum.",
      "That settlement failed to stanch criticism of the former prince and the resulting pressure on the royal family, however, as new information continued to emerge about his historic connections with Epstein in the wake of a damning 2019 interview\u00a0with the BBC's Newsnight, in which he defended his ties to the disgraced financier.",
      "In the years after that interview, right up until this year, amid revelations about correspondence between Epstein and the then-prince, the royal family appeared reluctant to intervene, allowing him to step away from public duties and to give up many of his titles and privileges of his own volition.",
      "Last week, however, in a landmark move, King Charles announced that his younger brother would be deprived of the title of prince and told to leave his 30-room, tax-payer-funded Royal Lodge home in Windsor.",
      "One of the few titles Andrew Mountbatten Windsor still holds is honorary Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy, which he received on his 55th birthday in 2015. It is unclear how long the process to remove that title, which defense chief Healy has now confirmed is underway, might take.",
      "The former prince had a 22-year career in the Royal Navy, including serving as a helicopter pilot during the Falklands War, and commanding the anti-mine vessel HMS Cottesmore.",
      "Asked about the ongoing scandal, President Trump told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in an interview that aired Sunday on 60 Minutes that \"it's a terrible thing that's happened\" to the royal family.",
      "\"That's been a tragic situation,\" he said. \"And, I mean, I feel badly for the family.\"",

      "Waving to fans, he's asked if that ever gets normal. \"No,\" he replied.",
      "Clooney has practice navigating this kind of attention. He's made about 50 films, picking up a couple of Academy Awards along the way (as an actor for \"Syriana,\" and as a producer for \"Argo\"). And for his latest, \"Jay Kelly,\" he plays one of the world's biggest movie stars \u2013 a familiar role.",
      "He says it's true that he said yes to the film within 24 hours. \"Well, I read it, and I was like, Well, if I take time to think of it, they might go get Brad. And I can't have that. I can't have that, man! When you read something, you know.\"",
      "Co-starring Adam Sandler and Laura Dern, the Netflix film \u2013 part comedy, part drama \u2013 critiques the cult of celebrity, as Clooney's character embarks on a journey to reconcile his professional success and personal failings.",
      "I asked, \"There's this kind of mind-bending experience where you're watching the film and you're wondering how much is the character and how much is George Clooney. Did you feel that making it?\"",
      "\"I really didn't,\" Clooney said. \"You know, what I know in life is you can live with failure. I tried this, it didn't work out. What you can't live with is regret. Jay Kelly is filled with regret. I mean, if I get hit by a bus tomorrow, I have no regrets. I've certainly made mistakes. I've certainly done some dumb things. But I took a big bite at the apple, and I really took big swings.\"",
      "\"Were there things that felt autobiographical?\"",
      "\"I mean, there's things that we would laugh about, you know, playing a guy who no one says 'no' to.\"",
      "\"And that's the case for you?\"",
      "\"Well, I designed it so that that's not the case.\"",
      "How? \"I pay people!\" he laughed. \"No, I designed it by surrounding myself with the same friends that I met when I was 20 years old \u2026 I talk to them every day.\"",
      "\"Do you go out of your way to understand that there is this perceived gap between you and others?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Clooney said. \"I didn't grow up around fame. I mean, my father was a newscaster in Cincinnati, Ohio. My aunt [Rosemary Clooney] was a famous singer, but I'd met her three times. So, when I met someone famous, I was always like, Oh my God! And so, I always try to remind people that, honest to God, this is the job that I do and that, you know, we're all fairly normal.\"",
      "\"Why is that so important to you?\" I asked.",
      "\"I think because I was raised not only that you treat everyone equally, but that everyone treats you equally as well.\"",
      "Clooney is pretty disarming, as we saw while setting up the interview. Asked if he wanted to check how he looked in the camera, he smiled: \"No, I don't care. I'm too old to give a s*** anymore.\"",
      "\"You are, for many, kind of the poster man of aging gracefully.\"",
      "\"That's why I'm wearing these glasses,\" Clooney said, \"because for the record, I have a horrible sinus infection. If I take these off ...\" He demonstrated for us. \"You see the problem?\"",
      "\"How much does aging factor in \u2026 Do you see parts changing?\"",
      "\"I see parts on my body changing,\" he replied. \"I'm like, that fell off? How'd that fall off?\"",
      "\"I didn't mean that.\"",
      "\"Oh sure, parts have changed significantly.\"",
      "He's 64 now, married to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin. The two juggle Hollywood glamour with social justice work through their foundation. They have eight-year-old twins, and the actor (once famously single) says family life suits him \u2013 another thing that sets him apart from this character. \"Fame, [Jay] actually does really well. And I'm kind of the opposite of that in a way.\"",
      "What do you mean? \"I feel I'm a better parent, I hope, certainly husband. And fame, if there was one of the two, that would be the one I'm least comfortable with.\"",
      "\"Wow, you seem to be quite comfortable with fame and celebrity,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, you know, you got to put on your famous outfit when you come here to do a film premiere.\"",
      "\"But you know everywhere you go, people watch you. Is it performative?\"",
      "\"Sometimes it's performative,\" Clooney replied. \"I mean, listen, you don't get caught picking your nose, you know? You have to be more aware than other people would be.\"",
      "I asked, \"You seem to have this desire to keep some things for yourself, but then you can also be very political and really stick yourself out there.\"",
      "\"Sometimes, yeah,\" Clooney said. \"I try to do it when I think I have a responsibility to it. My father always told me to challenge people with more power than you, and protect people with less power. One of the things you understand is, you can't take on every fight. You have to pick things. I worked on trying to help solve some of the problems in Darfur in the early 2000s. Failed. You fail more often than you succeed. But it doesn't mean you don't keep trying. We still work there, we're still involved.\"",
      "He also does not regret writing that opinion piece in The New York Times, urging President Biden to drop out. \"To not do it would be to say I'm not going to tell the truth,\" he said.",
      "While Clooney does not shy from public activism, he gets some help guarding his private life at the family's place in Italy: \"Italian towns adopt you, Like, people come up and say, 'Which house is George Clooney's?' They go, 'Hey, he doesn't live here, he doesn't.' They protect you.\"",
      "Right now, Clooney considers France home. \"We live on a 750-acre farm, and our kids run around. We wanted them to have something of a normal existence.\"",
      "\"And you find that on a 750-acre ranch?\"",
      "\"Well, you find it on a farm, and you find on a very small school and very sort of farming community. We found a real peace there.\"",
      "He prizes that peace. In the film, Jay Kelly is searching for what George Clooney already has: a sense of self and balance. Clooney really does seem to have it all.",
      "I said, \"If people say, What was it like being with George Clooney? One of the things I'm going to say is, well, I was sitting here sweating, and somehow he didn't seem to sweat.\"",
      "\"I don't sweat!\" Clooney laughed. \"It's a funny thing. I don't sweat much when I'm on camera, funnily enough. I don't know why. I put ice cubes under my arms!\"",
      "But like the rest of us, he still has to contend with the passing of time. \"I want to work, but I don't want to fill my life with work,\" he said. \"When I turned 60, Amal and I talked about it, and I said, 'Look, I can still play basketball with the boys, I can still hang out. But in 25 years I'll be 85. And that's a real number.'",
      "\"And things change, and it doesn't matter how many granola bars you eat; it catches you. So, we have to focus on making sure we work. We also have to have focus on spending time with the people we love. More time, because at the end of your life, you don't go, I wish I'd worked more.\"",

      "Salman Rushdie recently turned up at a McNally Johnson bookstore near South Street Seaport in Manhattan. \"It's actually not particularly close to where I live, but I come here a lot,\" he said.",
      "He was browsing for his own books. His newest one, \"The Eleventh Hour,\" is his 23rd \u2013 a collection of short stories and novellas.",
      "Life has changed since the 2022 attack that nearly killed him. \"I think what has changed is, for public-facing things, then there has to be security in a way that there wasn't for 20 years,\" he said.",
      "On August 12, 2022, Rushdie was on stage in Chautauqua, N.Y., ready to speak, ironically about America as a safe haven for writers. A man lunged at him with a knife.",
      "His account of the attack, \"Knife,\" was published in 2024: \"I raise my left hand in self-defense. He plunges the knife into it. ... After that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere. I feel my legs give way, and I fall.\"",
      "Rushdie lost the sight in his right eye. \"I can still read,\" he said, \"but I do find that I use iPads in a way that I never used to. Because there's light, and because I can adjust the size of the type. So, I never, ever, read a book on an iPad, but now I do.\"",
      "His left hand and liver were badly damaged, but he lived, which he considers \"a miracle.\"",
      "In May of this year, Rushdie's attacker, Lebanese-American Hadi Matar, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Prosecutors argued he was acting on the fatwa, the 1989 order by Iran's leader, the late Ayatollah Khomeini, to kill the author, claiming passages in his fourth novel, \"The Satanic Verses,\" insulted Islam.",
      "Recognized just for his fiction before, suddenly Rushdie was world famous (to some, infamous) for the fatwa. After nearly a decade in hiding, protected 24/7 by British security, Rushdie emerged and moved to New York, thinking times had changed. But he was wrong.",
      "Yet the author does not seem bitter or angry. \"I think that's who I am,\" he said.",
      "I suggested, \"Most people would say, well, this is a clear recipe for a life with PTSD.\"",
      "\"Well, I do have a therapist,\" Rushdie said, \"and I asked him at one point to list for me the symptoms of PTSD. And I said, 'But I don't seem to be having those symptoms, so what's wrong with me?' And he said, 'Well, it's because you're a bad-ass, that's the technical term.'\"",
      "The new book is the first fiction he's published since the attack.",
      "So, why \"The Eleventh Hour\"? \"Well, for a start, I'm 78,\" he said. \"For another thing, I had a fairly intimate encounter with death, you know, and got away with it. But it makes you think, you know? So, I thought this idea of running out of time was something I had on the brain.\"",
      "\"It's a hard time in America\"",
      "\"Now you have entered the magic space of my childhood,\" the fictional narrator of one story says, as he takes a last walk up the hill to the neighborhood where the real Salman Rushdie grew up, in Mumbai, India (which he still calls Bombay). \"My relationship with the place is kind of elegiac now,\" Rushdie said. It's a relationship about something that has passed.",
      "He left India for an English boarding school at the age of 13. He left Britain after nearly 40 years there. He became an American citizen in 2016. Rushdie sees his place in the world through the eye of an immigrant.",
      "Asked what he felt after becoming a U.S. citizen, Rushdie said, \"I remember getting into a cab, leaving the office where I'd been sworn in, and being driven back through the streets of the city, and it felt different. I thought, Oh, I can belong. And it felt very good.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did the feeling that you had when you were sworn in as a citizen become fractured or altered based on what's happened since, both in public life in the United States, and to you?\"",
      "\"It's a hard time in America, but it's a hard time all over,\" he replied. \"If you think of countries as people, there is their better self and their less-good self. And it would be nice if this country were to remember its better self.\"",
      "\"The Eleventh Hour\" includes a ghost story, characters who get even, a writer who disappears. But the book is also political. He writes: \"Words such as good and bad or right and wrong are losing their effect, emptying of meaning, and failing anymore to shape society.\"",
      "The meaning of words matters to Rushdie, who has spent his entire career advocating for free speech, even though exercising it nearly got him killed.",
      "He said, \"The final story in the collection, 'The Old Man in the Piazza,' is kind of an allegory of that. In fact, free speech, to my great surprise, language itself, turned into a character, a female character. She just walked into the story and sat down in a corner, and I hadn't expected her at all.\"",
      "\"She is in fact a very old language, one of the oldest and richest\u2026\" he writes, in a story about what happens when speech is restricted. \"It's even possible, though it's hard for her to admit this, even to herself, that she may die. Nobody's listening. Nobody cares.\"",
      "Language abandons her corner, leaving people no longer able to speak:\u00a0\"We are at a loss to know how things will proceed. Our words fail us.\"",
      "\"That's pretty startling and scary,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah,\" Rushdie agreed. \"It's supposed to be.\"",

      "From \"In the South\"",
      "The day Junior fell down began like any other day: the explosion of heat rippling the air, the trumpeting sun\u00adlight, the traffic's tidal surges, the prayer chants in the distance, the cheap film music rising up from the floor below, the pelvic thrusts of an \"item number\" dancing across a neigh\u00adbor's TV; a child's cry, a mother's rebuke, unexplained laughter, scarlet expectorations, bicycles, the newly plaited hair of school\u00adgirls, the smell of strong coffee, a green wing flashing in a tree. Senior and Junior, two very old men, opened their eyes in their bedrooms on the fourth floor of a sea-green building on a leafy lane, just out of sight of Elliot's Beach, where, that evening, the young would congregate, as they always did, to perform the rites of youth, not far from the village of the fisherfolk, who had no time for such frivolity. The poor were puritans by night and day. As for the old, they had rites of their own and did not need to wait for evening. With the sun stabbing at them through their window blinds, the two old men struggled to their feet and lurched out onto their adjacent verandas, emerging at the same moment, like characters in an ancient tale, trapped in fateful coincidences, unable to escape the consequences of chance.",
      "Almost at once they began to speak. Their words were not new. These were ritual speeches, obeisances to the new day, of\u00adfered in call-and-response format, like the rhythmic dialogues or \"duels\" of the virtuosi of Carnatic music during the annual December festival.",
      "\"Be thankful we are men of the south,\" said Junior, stretch\u00ading and yawning. \"Southerners are we, in the south of our city in the south of our country in the south of our continent. God be praised. We are warm, slow, and sensual guys, not like the cold fishes of the north.\"",
      "Senior, scratching first his belly and then the back of his neck, contradicted him at once. \"In the first place,\" he said, \"the south is a fiction, existing only because men have agreed to call it that. Suppose men had imagined the earth the other way up! We would be the northerners then. The universe does not under\u00adstand up and down; neither does a dog. To a dog there is no north and south. And in the second place, you're not that warm a character, and a woman would laugh to hear you call yourself sensual\u2014but you are slow, that is beyond a doubt.\"",
      "This was how they were: they fought, going at each other like ancient wrestlers whose left feet were tied together at the ankles. The rope that bound them so tightly was their name. By a curious chance\u2014which they had come to think of as \"des\u00adtiny,\" or, as they more often called it, a \"curse\"\u2014they shared a name, a long name like so many names of the south, a name neither of them cared to speak. By banishing the name, by re\u00adducing it to its initial letter, V., they made the rope invisible, which did not mean it did not exist. They echoed each other in other ways\u2014their voices were high, they were of similarly wiry build and medium height, they were both nearsighted, and, after lifetimes of priding themselves on the quality of their teeth, they had both surrendered to the humiliating inevitabil\u00adity of dentures\u2014but it was the unused name, that symmetrical V., the Name That Could Not Be Spoken, that had joined them together for decades.",
      "The two old men did not share a birthday, however. One was seventeen days older than the other. That must have been how \"Senior\" and \"Junior\" got started, even though the nicknames had been in use for so long that nobody could now remember who originally thought them up. V. Senior and Junior they had become, Junior V. and Senior V. forevermore, quarreling to the death. They were eighty-one years old. If old age was thought of as an evening, ending in midnight oblivion, they were well into the eleventh hour.",
      "\"You look terrible,\" Junior told Senior, as he did every morn\u00ading. \"You look like a man who is only waiting to die.\"",
      "Senior\u2014nodding gravely, and also speaking in accordance with their private tradition\u2014responded, \"That is better than looking, as you do, like a man who is still waiting to live.\"",

      "I'd opened my share of graves before finding something of value: a pendant in the shape of a fishhook, carved from greenstone. Greenstone only came from Aotearoa, the land our people had fled before we ended up on this island. The pendant, when held to the sun, glowed soft and green as dawn through miro trees. I was of the third generation born on this island, but the pendant was from our ancestors, from before. My father said a fishhook necklace had a special meaning: it ensured seafarers safe passage over water. To wear the pendant, I braided a cord from the inner bark of a hibiscus branch, which produced a fiber so strong, even parrots couldn't bite through it.",
      "Unpleasant as it was, and offensive to our ancestors, I was ready to open more graves.",
      "Still, I had other duties to perform. I was up each morning before dawn to hunt birds. Pigeons in planting season, t\u016b\u012b birds when the flax blossomed. This time of year, it was parrots. They arrived on our island in closely bonded flocks, and it was these social connections we'd exploit to ensnare them. When our ancestors landed on this island, it was so full of birds, they named it Manumotu, or Bird Island. If only that were still the case. These days, we'd quietly crouch all morning, ready to trigger our snares, in the hopes of catching a bird or two. The worst part was the silence. I'm the talkative type. My mother says I was born speaking, which is why she named me K\u014drero. Only after hours of silent birding was I free to open graves with my best friend Hine. The two of us could talk all day.",
      "Hine's duties, unlike mine, were endless. She'd been but a girl when her mother died and she was given to an older, childless woman named Tiri. But after a few years, when Tiri went blind, it was Hine who became the caretaker. Tiri was one of the most amazing persons in the world \u2014 I admit I only knew eighty-four people \u2014 but Hine, like me, was sixteen years old, and nobody likes it when they have to do something. And Hine had to do everything for Tiri.",
      "After birding on the morning this story begins, I arrived at our island's cove to continue digging. Many people trapped on this island before us were buried around the cove. This was considered a good resting place because of the view and the breeze and because this was where birds landed after open-water voyages. Where'd the birds come from? I always wondered. Where'd they fly off to?",
      "I tethered my parrots to a branch. One was named Aroha \u2014 it was she who lured the wild parrots into our traps. I'd tug on Aroha's tether, she'd squawk in distress, and wild parrots would come to her aid.",
      "\"I ohiti r\u0101,\" I said to Aroha. \"I ohiti p\u014d.\"",
      "This was a fisherman's adage, shortened to fit a bird's memory. Alert by day, the saying went. Alert by night. My father was a fisherman.",
      "I knew from old stories that parrots could be made to talk, though I'd had no luck at it.",
      "The other parrot was freshly caught. We'd named her Kanokano \u2014 the complications she caused are soon to be described.",
      "With only a digging stick and a basket, I picked a likely spot on the upper beach and began moving sand. If only our ancestors had thought to mark their graves. But I suppose they didn't imagine being exhumed by their great-granddaughters. I ran into a lot of mangrove roots, which I hacked with the jagged edge of a mussel shell. By the time Hine and Tiri arrived, I was sweating.",
      "\"What's the ocean like today?\" Tiri asked. Her pearled-over gaze was directed at nothing.",
      "Hine rolled her eyes and helped the old woman onto a mat before handing her her weaving.",
      "\"It's blue, it's wet,\" Hine said impatiently. \"The waves go up and down.\" I described for Tiri how late-morning light penetrated the cove, illuminating the humps of mullet, how the distant reef-break frothed like coconut pulp, how sputtering waves reached up the beach before fingering all the little shells in retreat.",
      "Hine half-heartedly stabbed at some sand with her stick.",
      "I asked, \"Did you hear the Toki brothers found an earring in a grave?\" I was arm-deep in the hole, fighting roots.",
      "\"The Toki brothers are insufferable,\" Hine said. She made a gesture to help me, but looking in the hole saw I was already to the point where smelly water was seeping in.",
      "\"The earring was greenstone,\" I said. \"From the old world. I bet one of the brothers brings it to you. Will it be the big, handsome, doltish one? Or the big, handsome, inane one?\"",
      "\"Don't make fun of me,\" Hine said. \"You'll have to marry the one I reject. And have his baby.\"",
      "The Toki brothers were slow-witted, trusting, and humorless. But their father was charismatic and funny, and the truth was, Hine had a parent-crush on him. It was quite possible that when the marriage ban was lifted, she'd marry a Toki brother just to become the daughter of Papa Toki.",
      "Tiri took a breath. She always did that before beginning a story. While Hine had no patience for the old tales, I could hear them all day. Today was the story of Paikea, who was one of the navigators who discovered Aotearoa. He was from a place called Hawaiki. Tiri didn't start in the obvious places, like Paikea's departure from Hawaiki or his arrival at Aotearoa. She didn't start with Paikea sinking a canoe and drowning his seventy enemies. Nor with him being saved by a whale. Instead, she started that epic tale with a little moment: Paikea, succumbing both to vanity and shame, as he groomed his hair with a forbidden comb.",
      "All the while, Tiri did her weaving \u2014 her fingers displaying their own kind of sight.",
      "My hole reached the point where sand fell in as fast as I scooped it out. Hine scrunched her nose. It's probably clear that Hine's heart really wasn't into digging up graves. She could barely bring herself to touch any bones, and when she did, she was afraid they might belong to her mother, even though we knew her mother was buried up the hill, above the k\u016bmara fields. We'd both been there when she was put in the ground. Still, one person's bones can look like another's, which can look like anybody's, which might as well be your mother's. I hoped Hine would change her outlook when she finally found something of value in a grave.",
      "That's when my digging stick made the unmistakable knock of wood striking bone.",
      "Tiri paused her story. I reached into the dark water and felt something in the muck. Hine winced, afraid of what I'd pull out. \"I'm sorry, ancestor,\" I said. Then, with a sucking sound, I tugged out a dog skull. I reached back for its jaw, but the mud offered only bird bones and broken shells.",
      "\"Another junk pit,\" Hine said, and started pushing sand back into the hole.",
      "I contemplated the skull. Since we'd begun digging up the dead, I'd come across many dog remains. Did they happen to die at the same time as our ancestors? Were they slain and buried alongside? Or was it something else altogether? No living person on the island had ever seen a dog, and before we started digging, it was thought that dogs had never even been here.",
      "\"What is it?\" Tiri asked.",
      "\"Another dog skull,\" Hine said. \"Look at those teeth. Who'd want to get close to one of those things, let alone share the afterlife with it?\"",
      "\"Dogs had white fur, soft as t\u016b\u012b feathers,\" Tiri said. \"The old stories say they'd lick your face.\"",
      "\"They supposedly had long tongues,\" I said, marveling at the skull. Hine shook her head. \"You don't believe every story you hear, do you?\" Hine knew that I did, indeed, believe every story I heard.",
      "\"There's only one thing we know for sure about dogs,\" Hine said. \"They must've tasted good.\"",
      "What interested me was the size of a dog's eye sockets. K\u0101k\u0101 parrots also had large eyes. In fact, the eyes of a parrot were quite intelligent and expressive. \"Ancestors are supposed to be wise,\" I said. \"But they didn't leave us a single dog.\"",
      "Hine eyed its fangs. \"I'm glad they're gone.\"",
      "\"Parrots have sharp beaks,\" I said. \"And they're friendly.\" Hine took the skull and threw it.",
      "\"One of these days, you'll lose a finger to those birds,\" she said.",
      "Already, I've forgotten some stuff. That's how bad a storyteller I am. I should've mentioned that I was absolutely forbidden from teaching my parrots human words, that Hine had a father who was alive and walking around our island \u2014 we just didn't know his identity. That Papa Toki had lost an arm, with my mother and Tiri being the ones who cut it off.",
      "But it's too late, the story's begun. Aroha looked toward the cove, spread her wings, and began screeching. We turned. Drifting in past the reef was the largest waka canoe imaginable. It had two hulls and rocked silently with the waves. Most canoes in the old stories were waka taua, war canoes. This one seemed empty \u2014 not a person or a paddle or a sail was visible. We beheld its pitched bows and soaring mast. Most ominously, the symbol of a death-bringing frigate bird was carved down its side. Then we heard it: upon the spar was a large parrot with a crimson body. It had spread its wings and was screeching back.",
      "\"What is it?\" Tiri asked. \"What's going on?\"",
      "\"We have visitors,\" Hine said. She took my hand in hers, and then she screamed.",
      "It seemed to me that, at the sound of Hine's voice, dozens of warriors would sit up in the waka and reveal themselves. I took hold of my fishhook necklace because, like the waka before me, it felt both ancient and startlingly new.",
      "Did I mention that in all our years on the island, we'd never had a visitor? As Hine's scream echoed off the cliffs, the hum of island life stopped.",
      "Silenced were the sounds of flax being beaten on the leeward shore and of our fathers excavating burial sites on the south-facing bluffs.",
      "Our fathers \u2014 all the men of Bird Island \u2014 would be here in no time.",
      "I should say the waka wasn't a total surprise. We knew something was coming. There'd been signs.",

      "Dear Reader,",
      "You are eighteen years old. Cast out by your father, shunned by society, you have fled to Geneva with your lover and your sister. The closeness of their relationship makes you furious, but if you protest, your lover will abandon you. Confined by terrible storms, you find yourself in a house with your lover, your sister and Lord Byron, an infamous and magnetically attractive poet. You know he is dangerous, but you find yourself drawn to him. When he sets a challenge to write a ghost story, all the turmoil that has boiled within you finds a voice.",
      "The anger pours from your pen in a roar of rage. Even as the monster that emerges terrifies you, you understand that it belongs to you. This creature that crawls across the page is the woman you were always meant to be. And in Byron, this furious beast that you have kept hidden for so long may have found a mate. You are eighteen years old. The creature you have created will howl its way onto page and stage and screen, burning its path across history in its desire to be seen, to be known, to be loved. The monster will never be silenced. Neither will you.",
      "Prologue",
      "Geneva, 1816",
      "At dusk, the sky over Lake Geneva is the colour of blood in a glass of water. The ash fragments falling over the city form a strange fog \u2013 a thickening of the air, which swirls through the deserted streets, past the spire of the old cathedral and over the walls of the new Protestant church. Inside, people are on their knees, praying for the uncanny cloud to lift. It is a judgement, they fear, a punishment from God, or else a curse.",
      "This night, like so many before it, the choking dust has driven the residents of the city into the shelter of shuttered houses and places of prayer. Outside, there is no one to witness the way the ash gleams as it settles on the lake. The water flickers and shimmers, each tiny filament glowing like a candle, sinking into the silence, quickly snuffed out.",
      "The lake is chill and dark and deep \u2013 not even the fishermen have fathomed its depths, or the small children who, on any other evening, would be taking turns to dive beneath the surface, competing to see who could swim down the furthest, stay under the longest.",
      "No one is standing on the lake's stony shores to watch the water's surface glow, red as the strange sky above. No one is there to see the darkness beneath the water shift and stir and coalesce, parting for a breath, like two slick thighs, which fall back into the darkness with a gasp that is almost human.",
      "Above, half masked by cloud, a thin slash of moon hangs hazy and indifferent. A lone figure stumbles down to the lake and scrambles into a small rowboat that one of the fishermen has left bobbing at the end of a long line. Looking right, then left, the man leans forward over the rope. Flash of steel from the blade in his hand. A quick tug and the boat is free. The man settles himself on the rocking boards, tugging the oars. No one will see him on this cloud-deadened, mist-muffled night. No one will stop him. Still, his breath stutters and stumbles. He must be quick. His hands ache, his chest burns. His eyes feel gritty as the mist parts before him, then closes around him, giving him the strange sensation of being swallowed.",

      "From the storeroom hidden under the stairs, Ma fetched a cup of rice and a sack of eggs speckled gray like the moon, then cooked, standing before the stove's blue fire, her eye upon the window and its dusk, in which bats swooped and the neem tree shivered and a figure down on the road pedaled a bicycle, whistling, as if everything was all right.",
      "Thief, thought Ma. Who else but a person who had chanced upon fresh vegetables or fruit would wander the city of Kolkata in this ruined year, the heat a hand clamped upon the mouth, the sun a pistol against one's head, and recall a song? She watched to see what the thief would do. He pedaled past. But Ma saw a different reality shimmer into being, in which he leaned his bicycle against the wall, climbed the pipes like a toddy tapper, and appeared at her window. In that picture, the thief was a collector of local information, dutiful in his neighborhood eavesdropping, shrewd in following what he heard about the bins of onions and carrots, the sacks of lentils and rice, the bags of raisins and cashews hidden in the dark fist of the house, stolen by Ma from donations made to the shelter where she worked, while the city outside wept for a handful of something to eat.",
      "There was \u2014 in the label accepted by the region \u2014 a shortage.",
      "In the year prior to this day, farmers across the region had fallen, their bodies running fevers in air that no longer cooled. In the croplands, among stilled machines, pests had traveled from acre to new acre, savage in their feeding of grains. In the west a drought had cleaved riverbeds and in the east salt water had tainted the paddy fields. In the city, those who walked to the neighborhood markets with umbrellas in their hands and wishful lists in their pockets, broad corners torn from the newspaper with writing in Bengali \u2014 cabbage, ginger, lychees if they were good, ice cream, half loaf of bread \u2014 found the roads alongside which the markets usually sat, its baskets and tarps invading, rickshaws and cars sounding their horns, slow shoppers inspecting the purple shine of eggplant and pressing guavas hard as hail, instead completely empty, nothing but some onion peel scattered at the edges where the pavement gave way to earth, where on most days goats and cows might have nudged the soil for something to eat. But those animals were gone too.",
      "It had happened before. 1770, when crops failed and smallpox plagued the enfeebled. 1876, when drought struck the Deccan Plateau and the British continued to export what grain remained. 1943. Those black-and-white newspaper photos, in which people appeared as sunken eyes and twig-thin limbs, facing a photographer who could do nothing for them, their fullness \u2014 their love, their humor, their annoyance, their preference \u2014 pared by the lens to reveal what remained, which was hunger.",

      "One of the victims allegedly warned one of the five suspects arrested that the drugs they had sold her caused her to overdose, and\u00a0 she told him \"just warn customers in batch might be extra strong,\" according to federal court documents.

We know there are thousands of families like ours who understand the nightmare of losing a child or loved one to fentanyl poisoning.",
      "The recent indictments in relation to the wrongful deaths of Victim #1 (whose name has not been made public at this time), Akira Stein, and Leandro De Niro Rodriguez is yet another painful reminder of an epidemic that has risen to plague proportions in the U.S. In 2023, there were 100,000 overdose related deaths. Out of over 2,400 New Yorkers who died of fentanyl-related overdose deaths, approximately 75 of them were teenagers and young adults between the ages of 15 and 24.",

    "story": [
      "Billie Eilish wants billionaires to donate more.",
      "As the Grammy and Oscar winner accepted the music award at this year's WSJ. Magazine Innovator Awards on Wednesday night, she urged the ultra-wealthy to address more of the world's issues.",
      "\"We're in a time right now where the world is really, really bad and really dark and people need empathy and help more than, kind of, ever, especially in our country,\" Eilish said to an audience that included Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, as well as \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas. \"I'd say if you have money, it would be great to use it for good things, maybe give it to some people that need it.\"",
      "Late-night host Stephen Colbert\u00a0introduced Eilish onstage at New York's Museum of Modern Art by announcing that she would donate $11.5 million of the proceeds from her Hit Me Hard and Soft tour to causes dedicated to food equity, climate justice and reducing carbon pollution.",
      "In accepting the award, the \"Bad Guy\" singer added a polite but direct call to others in the room, saying a lot of people, especially in the U.S., could use some help right now.",
      "\"Love you all, but there's a few people in here who have a lot more money than me,\" she said, to a smattering of applause. \"And if you're a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? And no hate, but give your money away, shorties.\"",
      "Through her Changemaker Program, Eilish has worked with the nonprofit Reverb for years on its Music Decarbonization Project and its Music Climate Revolution initiative, alongside artists ranging from Dead & Company to Harry Styles.",
      "Chan was also honored at the event, receiving the \"Philanthropy of Science Innovator of the Year\" award. A spokesperson for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Brandi Hoffine Barr, said Zuckerberg and Chan have committed to giving away 99% of their Meta shares to philanthropy over the course of their lifetimes and have already granted out $7 billion. According to Forbes, Zuckerberg's current net worth is around $224 billion.",
      "Eilish's comments come as the number of billionaires worldwide continues to grow, with 204 new billionaires added in 2024, according to a January report from\u00a0Oxfam International titled \"Takers Not Makers.\"",
      "The report found that the billionaires grew wealthier three times faster in 2024 than in 2023, pointing to an increased concentration of resources globally.",
      "Oxfam predicted that at least five people will become trillionaires in the next decade, up from one person the year before. The group called for higher taxes on the rich and other measures to break up monopolies, cap CEO pay and require companies to pay living wages.",
      "The wealthiest Americans have a long history of calling on each other to give away more of their money. In 1889, the steel magnate and industrialist Andrew Carnegie argued in the essay \"The Gospel of Wealth\" that the richest should give away their fortunes within their lifetimes, in part to lessen the sting of growing inequality.",
      "In 2010,\u00a0Bill Gates,\u00a0Melinda French Gates\u00a0and\u00a0Warren Buffett\u00a0took up that call by creating the\u00a0Giving Pledge, a commitment for billionaires to give away more than half their wealth in their lifetimes or when they die.",
      "Fifteen years on, some 256 billionaires have taken the pledge, with 110 of them coming from the U.S., according to a recent\u00a0report by the Charity Reform Initiative\u00a0of the Institute for Policy Studies. Those U.S. billionaires represent 13% of the total 876 billionaires in the U.S., according to the report, revealing the small portion of the wealthiest people who have publicly committed to giving away their fortunes.",
      "The report found that of the 22 billionaires who have died since taking the pledge, only one gave away his fortune before he died. Meanwhile, only eight of the 22 deceased pledgers fulfilled the commitment by giving away half of their wealth or more at their death, though some of their estates are still being resolved.",
      "Chuck Collins, one of the authors of the report and an expert at the Institute for Policy Studies, said Eilish's comments are part of a growing realization that the rules of the economy favor those with assets over those who earn wages.",
      "He thinks the Giving Pledge has created an expectation and competition for the wealthiest to give away their money, but the fortunes of many of the pledgers have increased over time, meaning they will need to move even more aggressively if they are to fulfill the commitment.",
      "\"In the end, philanthropy is not a substitute for a fair and effective tax system,\" Collins said. \"The level of extreme inequality will require some form of restoring progressivity to the tax system, a wealth tax as well as progressive income tax.\"",

      "Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" one of the most influential rock songs ever recorded, was released 50 years ago.",
      "It broke records and soared to the top of the British charts. It was No. 1 twice in the U.K. and also made history with the first ever promotional rock video.",
      "But in the U.S., the song took 17 more years and being featured in the movie \"Wayne's World\" to turn into a mega hit. Today, it has almost 3 billion streams on Spotify, which is the most for any 20th century song.",
      "\"It changed the dynamics of music\"",
      "The hit song came to life in the Welsh countryside at Rockfield Studios, which was set up in the 1960s by two farmers and musicians, Charles and Kingsley Ward.",
      "Queen's band members \u2014 Freddie Mercury, John Deacon, Roger Taylor and Brian May \u2014 lived at Rockfield for two weeks in 1975, working on their fourth album, \"A Night at the Opera.\"",
      "\"I don't think anybody realized at the time that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' would end up the iconic record it was,\" said Kingsley Ward, who's now 85 years old.",
      "In the main studio, which is still in use, Queen laid down the song in three sections \u2014 choral, hard rock and opera. The sound was revolutionary, as was the length of the track at almost six minutes.",
      "\"It's probably the greatest record ever made, a rock record, because it changed the dynamics of music, and people now realize they can do anything with music,\" Ward said.",
      "Ward remembers Queen's leader, Mercury, as \"very quiet, unassuming and just a genuinely nice person, wasn't flamboyant at all.\"",
      "He said Mercury kept the band waiting for the song they then knew only as \"Freddy's thing.\"",
      "\"Brian and John were playing frisbee. I remember talking to Brian and saying, 'You've been here a long time, five days, you haven't done much.' And I think Brian said, 'Freddy's in there writing something.'\"",
      "Ward explained Mercury was inside what is now an office and in the corner of the office was an old piano. Out the window, Kingsley said Mercury would have been able to see the old farm wind vane.",
      "\"Now, the odd thing is, a lot of people ask me, 'did Freddy get the idea of that iconic line, 'any way the wind blows,' looking at the weathercock?' We don't know, because Freddy's not here to tell us, but it's a great story, isn't it?\"",

      "\"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,\" the statement said.",
      "Andrew has come under intense scrutiny over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and accusations from\u00a0Virginia Giuffre\u00a0that she was trafficked to engage in sex with the prince while she was underage.

      "In 2022, Andrew gave up his military affiliations, royal patronages and official public duties. He also stopped using the title \"His Royal Highness.\"",
      "Andrew had faced heavy criticism from the British public over his living arrangements, with many voicing concern that he continued to live in his mansion on a royal estate despite the accusations leveled against him and his retreat from royal duties.",
      "His 75-year lease for Royal Lodge, signed in 2003, included an up-front payment of around 8 million pounds (around $10.5 million) and an annual rent described as a \"peppercorn,\" meaning an extremely small amount, according to\u00a0BBC News. Part of that payment was for renovations to the property, which at the time was in a state of disrepair, and Buckingham Palace felt that having Andrew pay the cost to upgrade the property was better than using public funds, BBC reported.",
      "The lease had previously been referred to as \"cast iron,\" and Buckingham Palace said it needed to negotiate with Andrew in order to remove him, but did not provide further information about the details of those negotiations.",

      "The source of the Salmonella was traced to a single lot of organic moringa leaf powder imported from Vallon Farm Direct in Jodhpur, India, according to an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration.

      "Travelers heading to airports this week may face more flight disruptions as air traffic controllers missed their first full paycheck late last month and with the\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0on the cusp of becoming the longest in U.S. history.",
      "Almost 6,000 U.S. flights were delayed on Sunday, Nov. 2, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking service. Newark Liberty Airport on Sunday had a four-hour ground delay, while staffing triggers \u2014 a Federal Aviation Administration alert system to indicate an air traffic control facility is understaffed \u2014 were reported at airports including Nashville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; Austin, Texas; and Denver, Colorado.",
      "Airport delays are \"going to get worse,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday.",
      "The shutdown on Tuesday is set to become the longest in history, when it would eclipse the 2018-2019 funding lapse. In the meantime, air traffic controllers and workers for the Transportation Security Administration \u2014 both considered essential workers \u2014 are required to show up at their jobs even though their pay is halted until lawmakers agree on a new deal to fund the federal government.",
      "The longer the shutdown stretches on, the more likely it is to cause flight delays and snarls at security checkpoints, Katy Nastro, a travel expert at Going.com, told CBS News.",
      "\"We're over a month into this shutdown, and in the last few days is really when we've started to see that the seams are ripping,\" Nastro said. \"It's not just in air traffic control staffing triggers, but we're seeing TSA lines hit the 3-4 hour mark.\"",
      "Some Houston travelers faced waits of about an hour to get through airport security lines this weekend, according to CBS affiliate KHOU. Only two out of five security checkpoints are open at Houston's Bush airport, the station noted, while the Houston Chronicle\u00a0reported\u00a0that some people faced waits of three hours to get through the airport's security.",
      "Thanksgiving outlook for air travel",
      "If the shutdown drags longer into November, the real pain point could come during Thanksgiving week, when a record number of Americans are expected to travel for the holidays, Nastro said.",
      "\"I would be cautious if this continues into Thanksgiving \u2014 we're likely to see multiple days of 3 million-plus travelers,\" she said. \"At that point, we would be coming into almost two months of a shutdown.\"",
      "Some holiday travelers might be better off driving to their destinations given the potential for flight disruptions, Nastro added. Booking early morning flights, such as those that depart between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m., can also help minimize delays because these departures are more likely to be on time than flights that are scheduled later in the day, travel data shows.",

      "A plan announced Monday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide partial\u00a0food stamp benefits for November during the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0could offer a measure of relief to millions of Americans. Yet the move still leaves participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in the dark on exactly when they will get the funds.",
      "In a\u00a0declaration\u00a0submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said $4.6 billion in contingency USDA funds will be used to cover 50% of SNAP recipients' benefits.",
      "However, the USDA declaration said that procedural changes U.S. states must make in order to issue partial benefits could take \"anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months.\"",
      "It's unclear how long it will take some states to issue the benefits since this is an unprecedented situation, said Victoria Negus, a senior economic justice advocate at the nonprofit Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. The timing will depend on how fast states can adjust to issue\u00a0partial SNAP benefits and relay that information to EBT vendors, she added.",
      "\"I would hope that states will move heaven and Earth to get SNAP benefits flowing as quickly as possible,\" she said.",
      "Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey recently\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0that it could take days for SNAP cards to be loaded up again if the funds were to be released for use.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The White House referred CBS News to the Office of Management and Budget, which also did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "With questions continuing to swirl around the SNAP program, CBS News spoke with three people on food stamps about how losing access to the payments could affect them. They reside in states that have committed to sending emergency funds to local food banks to assist families enrolled in SNAP.",

      "Buffalo, New York, resident Shatika Griffin, 45, said she relies on both SNAP and the Women, Infants and Children program,\u00a0to support herself and seven children, including an 11-year-old son who is autistic.",
      "\"I'm a single mom, so it's very frightening,\" Griffin said of missing out on federal nutrition assistance. \"All the kids know is, 'I'm hungry.'\"",
      "Griffin said she typically uses the $1,100 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to pay for food staples she can stretch out for the month, such as spaghetti and canned goods. Without the money, she plans to turn to a local food bank.",
      "Although her mother helps with child care, Griffin said her support network is limited. \"Everything is falling on my shoulders,\" she told CBS News.",

      "In May of 2024, however, a hit-and-run accident required multiple surgeries and left the 64-year-old Lennox unable to work. Without a stable source of income, Lennox said she relies on SNAP, disability and Social Security retirement benefits to pay the bills. She plans to return to work as soon as she's physically capable, saying she needs a job to help cover her medical expenses.",
      "\"Because it was a hit-and-run, I have all these medical bills to pay,\" she said.",
      "The $192 she gets in monthly food stamps helps her buy fresh produce at the farmer's market, Lennox said.",
      "After learning that SNAP funding was under threat because of the shutdown, Lennox said she pulled back on buying food by conserving the remaining food stamps on her electronic benefits card. She currently has $240 in food stamp payments, but plans on visiting a local food bank to make ends meet.",
      "\"I'm going to have to make use of the pantries and work with their schedule, because if I use actual money for food, it takes away money I need to pay for my residential parking permit, gas and union dues,\" she told CBS News.",

      "She receives roughly $390 in monthly food stamps, which Hurd said she uses to buy staples such as hamburgers, rice and potatoes. High food prices in recent years mean the payment is insufficient to cover the family's food budget, Hurd told CBS News, noting the demands of feeding her 15-year-old grandson.",
      "With her SNAP payments temporarily suspended, Hurd said she's trying to take it day by day. \"I'm really trying hard not to stress out about it,\" she said.",
      "Hurd, who has arthritis and lupus, said she has used food banks in the past when money was tight. But more recently, long lines and her health issues have made it harder for her.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Nov 2025 16:36:58 -0500",
    "summary": "In 2026, premiums for a typical health insurance plan sold through the ACA marketplaces are projected to jump an average of 26%.",
    "story": [
      "The Affordable Care Act marketplaces opened for enrollment on Nov. 1, with the average premium for a mid-level insurance plan surging 26% this year to $625 per month, according to nonprofit health research firm KFF.",
      "That jump \u2014 the biggest increase in ACA plan rates since 2018 \u2014 is causing sticker shock for some people who rely on the program for health insurance coverage.",
      "\"I've been hearing stories about the price increases, so I've been dreading this week,\" Jeremy Tolbert, a 47-year-old web developer in Lawrence, Kansas, told CBS News. When he logged into his state's marketplace, he was dismayed to find out that his current plan's monthly premium is set to rise to $2,600 a month next year, up from $2,200 a month in 2025.",
      "That doesn't include higher cost-sharing for his family, such as a larger out-of-pocket maximum for 2026, meaning he's facing higher costs on both ends for the same coverage for himself, his wife and their 11-year-old son.",
      "\"I already pay a significant portion of my income for this insurance,\" he noted. \"What the hell am I paying for at this point?\"",
      "Roughly 24 million Americans get their health insurance through an ACA plan.",
      "The 26% premium hike for so-called ACA silver plans reflects what insurers are charging consumers buying plans via the marketplaces. Millions of Americans currently pay below the ACA's market rates because of\u00a0premium tax credits, KFF said. Those credits are set to expire at the end of 2025 \u2014 a looming deadline that has contributed to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, as Democratic lawmakers push for Republicans to agree to an extension.",
      "The roughly 22 million people who currently rely on the premium tax credits could see their ACA plan costs more than double in 2026, KFF estimates.",
      "Even those who don't qualify for the credits, as in Tolbert's case, face sharply higher health insurance costs next year, KFF said. The main factors behind that increase are increased demand for costly treatments, such as\u00a0GLP-1 drugs\u00a0for weight loss; higher prices from hospitals and other providers; and insurer projections that millions of people could drop their coverage next year when the premium tax credits expire, said Cynthia Cox, vice president and director of KFF's program on the ACA.",
      "\"The biggest factor is that health care costs for everybody are going up,\" Cox told CBS News. \"That's driven by the underlying health care costs, hospital costs, doctor visits and drugs.\"",
      "\"The last time we saw premium increases like this was 2017, going into 2018, when we were talking about ACA 'repeal and replace,'\" a period during President Trump's first term when he\u00a0sought to roll back the Affordable Care Act, she added.",
      "Higher ACA insurance costs could spur some people to go without coverage, said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and a former official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Biden administration.",
      "\"Some will have to go to skimpier plans,\" she noted in a recent conference call organized by left-leaning economic advocacy group Groundwork Collaborative to discuss the ACA premium tax credit expiration. \"Deductibles are going up as well ... [consumers] will be heading into next year with bigger out-of-pocket expenses.\"",
      "For some people, going without health coverage might seem like a financial necessity in the face of sharply higher ACA plan costs in 2026, but ultimately could prove ruinous, KFF's Cox said. \"It's like gambling with your health and your wallet,\" she added. \"You don't know what will happen.\"",
      "In the meantime, Tolbert expressed concern that ACA insurance may become unaffordable for his family if premiums continue to increase at the same pace. That could push him or his wife, who currently stays at home with their son, to look for a job with a bigger employer to secure health insurance, he noted.",
      "\"At this rate, I have one to three more years before I can no longer afford a plan,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. Department of Agriculture told a federal court that it will tap into a contingency fund to allow states to issue partial November benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the government shutdown.",
      "In a declaration submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said the administration \"intends to deplete SNAP contingency funds completely and provide reduced SNAP benefits for November 2025.\"",
      "There is roughly $4.6 billion in the contingency fund that can be used to cover November benefit payments, according to Penn. Officials have said fully covering those benefits would require roughly $9 billion. The $4.6 billion will be used to \"cover 50% of eligible households' current allotments,\" Penn said.",
      "More than 42 million Americans rely on SNAP to buy food, and the program ran out of funding over the weekend due to the ongoing shutdown. The federal government funds SNAP by sending money to the states, which oversee food stamp programs for their residents.",
      "Justice Department lawyers separately told the court that the administration will \"fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds\" by providing states with information on Monday that they can use to calculate benefits due to each eligible household.",
      "The administration said it will \"have made the necessary funds available and have authorized the states to begin disbursements\" once the material has been issued.",
      "Still, relief to food-aid recipients may not be immediate. Penn wrote in his declaration that there could be \"payment errors and significant delays\" because of variations among state eligibility systems, which have to be adjusted for the reduced payments.",
      "\"For at least some States, USDA's understanding is that the system changes States must implement to provide the reduced benefit amounts will take anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months,\" he said.",
      "Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy group that is representing a group of municipalities and nonprofit organizations that sued the Trump administration, said in a statement it is \"considering all legal options to secure payment of full funds.\"",
      "\"It shouldn't take a court order to force our president to provide essential nutrition that Congress has made clear needs to be provided. But since that is what it takes, we will continue to use the courts to protect the rights of people,\" Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, pushed the administration to transfer money from other programs to fully fund November benefits, saying the courts \"have made it clear\" that the government has the authority to do so.",
      "\"It is not enough to do the bare minimum \u2014 the administration should stop playing politics with hunger and use all available resources to ensure Americans can put food on the table,\" Klobuchar said in a statement.",
      "The USDA filing came in response to an order issued by Judge John McConnell, who is overseeing the case brought by nonprofits and municipalities in Rhode Island. Last Friday, McConnell ordered the Trump administration to tap into the fund to cover the lapse in SNAP funding caused by the shutdown. The judge gave the government until Monday to file a status update about the distribution of the funds.",
      "In a separate case in Massachusetts, two dozen states and the District of Columbia filed suit to get the administration to use the contingency funds. The judge in that case agreed with their argument that the government is required to use the money and likewise asked for an update by Monday.",
      "The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress had argued that the contingency fund couldn't legally be used to pay SNAP benefits because the underlying appropriation for the program had lapsed. Both judges disagreed with that argument and said the fund must be used to cover part of the shortfall.",
      "\"There is no question that the congressionally approved contingency funds must be used now because of the shutdown,\" McConnell wrote in the written version of his order on Saturday.",
      "He also said the government should \"find the additional funds necessary (beyond the contingency funds) to fully fund the November SNAP payments.\" The $5 billion in the contingency fund does not fully cover the $9 billion needed to pay out benefits for the month, and the administration had argued that calculating partial payments would be \"exceedingly difficult, highly disruptive, and delayed.\"",
      "The judge said the government could choose to issue partial payments instead of finding other sources of funding, but added that \"under no circumstances\" could those payments be delayed beyond Wednesday.",
      "The USDA warned late last month that federal food benefits would not go out to roughly 42 million recipients on Nov. 1 after it declined to tap into contingency funds to keep food stamp payments flowing during the shutdown. The agency pinned the blame for the pause on congressional Democrats for failing to back a GOP-backed stopgap measure that would fund federal agencies.",
      "The shutdown entered its 34th day Monday and is poised to become the longest shutdown in U.S. history if lawmakers fail to reach agreement on a spending measure by late Tuesday.",
      "The initial decision to halt the food aid appeared to be a shift from the USDA's plan for a lapse in federal funding that was issued Sept. 30. The agency said in its plan that multi-year contingency funds could be used for state administrative expenses to ensure states could continue SNAP operations during a shutdown and were also available \"to fund participant benefits\" in the event of a funding lapse.",
      "But the USDA wrote in a memo to states late last month that the reserve funds were \"not legally available to over regular benefits,\" and said the money was meant for priorities like assisting people in disaster areas.",
      "Faced with the looming cutoff of food stamp payments, half the states and the District of Columbia, as well as the municipalities, sought relief from the federal courts. Some states said they would work to continue providing assistance to food-aid beneficiaries. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans receive food stamps.",

      "Kenvue shareholders will receive $3.50 per share in cash and 0.14625 Kimberly-Clark shares for each Kenvue share held at closing. That amounts to $21.01 per share, based on the closing price of Kimberly-Clark shares on Friday.",
      "Kimberly-Clark shareholders are expected to own about 54% of the combined company. Kenvue shareholders will own about 46%.",
      "The combination merges two businesses that own a number of major consumer health brands, such as Kimberly-Clark's Kleenex and Scott lines and Kenvue's Band-Aid, Benadryl, Listerine and Neutrogena products.",
      "\"We will serve billions of consumers across every stage of life,\" Kimberly-Clark CEO Mike Hsu said in a statement. He will serve as chairman and chief executive of the combined company.",
      "Recently, Kenvue's Tylenol has drawn headlines after President Trump announced the Food and Drug Administration believes the use of the pain medication's active ingredient, acetaminophen, during pregnancy can be associated with an increased risk of autism. Medical experts and Kenvue say Tylenol is safe.",
      "The deal is expected to close in the second half of next year. It still needs approval from shareholders of both companies.",
      "Kenvue said in July that CEO Thibaut Mongon was leaving as part of a strategic review of the company's business. Board member Kirk Perry is serving as interim CEO.",

      "New York Times financial columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin's \"1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History - and How It Shattered a Nation\" (Viking) looks back to the nation's most catastrophic market collapse.",
      "Read an excerpt below.",
      "\"1929\" by Andrew Ross Sorkin",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Charles Mitchell strode up the steps of 55 Wall Street, determined to project his usual sense of confidence and certitude. It had been a crushing afternoon. As he returned to his office, he knew that the eyes of Wall Street were on him \u2014 everyone from the traders in the street to his own secretary was assessing his gait and searching his face, trying to read meaning into every twitch, every line, every wrinkle.",
      "In his gray three\u2011piece suit, shoulders back, Mitchell kept up his smile as he passed through the glass\u2011domed central hall of his National City Bank. With its eighty\u2011three\u2011foot ceiling and two solid bronze doors protecting a safe weighing some three hundred tons, the bank was the largest in the country.",
      "It was just past 5:30 p.m. on Monday, October 28, 1929. Hours earlier, the stock market had closed with a sharp, dizzying drop of 13 percent after a week of downward convulsions; today was by far the greatest fall. The darkening downtown streets still teemed with anxious brokers in their fedoras and flat caps, messenger boys and switchboard girls, all gossiping and speculating about the collapse. What caused the fall? How much further might it go tomorrow? Would the markets even open?",
      "As Mitchell made his way to his office, the teller windows he passed reflected the weary puffiness under his eyes and his disheveled, graying eyebrows. He collapsed into the chair behind his mahogany desk. The room was furnished with the high formality befitting an eighteenth\u2011century statesman: antique wood chairs, a grandfather clock that stood against the cream\u2011white woodwork flanked by portraits of George Washington orchestrating the newly independent nation with the purpose and resolve that Mitchell sought to emulate in his own life.",
      "The athletic fifty\u2011two\u2011year\u2011old bank chairman \u2014 an unusually optimistic man whom the press called \"Sunshine Charlie\" \u2014 had spent the afternoon in emergency meetings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, puzzling over how to calm the market. It was a moment for which a self\u2011consciously Great Man like Mitchell should have been utterly prepared. He had the experience, the stature, and the steely nerves necessary to steer Wall Street through these tough times.",
      "Yet he felt exposed, vulnerable.",
      "But he didn't have time to consider his emotional state.",
      "He walked upstairs to confer with Hugh Baker, who ran National City's stock\u2011trading unit.",
      "Baker, a tall, bald man with piercing eyes, began to explain to Mitchell, calmly, if somewhat obliquely, what had taken place while Mitchell had been at the Federal Reserve.",
      "\"Our portfolio today has been tremendously increased in our holdings of National City Bank stock,\" Baker told him.",
      "Mitchell stared at him, waiting to hear exactly what he meant.",
      "Baker finally blurted out: \"We purchased seventy\u2011odd thousand shares.\"",
      "Mitchell, who could calculate numbers instantly in his head, immediately grasped the nature and scale of the problem. That is unbelievable, he thought. The bank didn't have the cash to pay for so many shares. He was outraged \u2014 and terrified. Everything he had built was suddenly at grave risk of collapse.",
      "Barely a month earlier, Mitchell had been on top of the world. He had finalized an agreement to take over the Corn Exchange Bank, a bold acquisition that would turn National City from the largest bank in the country into the largest in the world, stealing the mantle from London and helping New York finally eclipse its rival city as the world financial center. This was history in the making, an overthrow of the established order, the kind of gambit that made Mitchell a king among men.",
      "But to pull off the deal, Mitchell had made a big \u2014 and risky \u2014 bet on the strength of his own stock. Corn Exchange shareholders could take $360 in cash for each of their shares, or four fifths of a share in National City Bank. On paper, the stock was the better deal: As long as National City stock stayed above $450, four fifths of a share was worth more than $360 in cash. At the time the deal was struck, it was comfortably higher, trading at $496 a share. Mitchell needed it to stay there until the deal could be completed, likely in the next month \u2014 because, in truth, National City didn't have the cash to pay everyone, a crucial detail he kept to himself.",
      "So he quietly instructed his traders to buy the bank's shares whenever the price slipped.",
      "In a relatively stable market, this posed no problem. Big publicly traded companies bought back their own shares all the time. In a rapidly falling market, however, doing so could quickly become like shoveling money into a furnace, which was what had been happening that afternoon. In the chaos of all that selling pressure, National City's bids had been accepted so quickly that they lost track of how many they had amassed. By the time traders got a handle on the situation, National City had committed to buy seventy\u2011one thousand of its own shares, far more than it could afford to hold.",
      "\"With that news,\" he told Baker, \"I could be knocked over with a feather.\"",
      "There were very few good options. To fund their daily operations, big banks like National City had to constantly borrow against their assets. But banking law prevented them from offering their own stock as collateral. Thus, those seventy\u2011one thousand shares \u2014 which cost about $32 million \u2014 were a deadweight that could possibly take down the whole bank.",
      "\"It would be embarrassing for us to attempt to borrow on that stock in other banks,\" Mitchell said, knowing full well that his rivals would seize on any such move as a sign of vulnerability. With the market in free fall, short sellers \u2014 traders who bet that stocks would go down \u2014 were lining up targets, probing for weakness.",
      "The stock market was at the breaking point. Sales volume had overwhelmed the human apparatus of the trading floor to such an extent that, on the previous Thursday, the ticker had fallen four hours behind in reporting stock prices, more than twice the longest previous delay.",
      "What this meant was that the big board of prices that loomed over the floor of the New York Stock Exchange was hopelessly inaccurate. Trading stocks in this environment was like being a gambler at a baseball game in the eighth inning and looking at a scoreboard that hadn't been updated since the third, while everybody around you was shouting conflicting opinions about which team was ahead and by how much. The prices of stocks sold privately \u2014 known as \"off\u2011exchange,\" which was the case with National City shares \u2014 were even further behind because they were tied to the broader market's movements without being fully updated in real time, exacerbating the delay. For Wall Street traders, the only prudent decision was to sell and get the hell out of the market. Which is exactly what they were doing.",
      "Mitchell knew that if he tried to unload even a small fraction of National City's position back into such a weak market, rumors would begin to fly about the bank's solvency, and that could easily turn into a vicious cycle that would be impossible to stop. If prices declined fast enough, it could trigger a much larger crisis: A \"lack of confidence might bring a run,\" Mitchell told Baker, envisioning depositors lining up outside every one of its fifty\u2011eight branches around the country.",
      "A run on the country's largest bank. There was nothing bankers feared more.",

      "\"We felt Dubai was the perfect place for our investment,\" Sagsoz said.",

      "Several factors are driving this increase. First, volatile weather, including both heavy rain and droughts in major coffee-producing countries, such as Brazil and Colombia, is depressing crop yields, Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News.",
      "Lempert also said American tariffs on foreign imports are having an impact on domestic coffee prices. As of 2023, the U.S. imported about 80% its unroasted beans from Latin America,\u00a0according\u00a0to the USDA, with Hawaii and Puerto Rico the only U.S. states or territories that produce much coffee.",
      "The Trump administration this year has imposed new tariffs on several major coffee producers that export to the U.S. That includes a 50% levy on Brazil, which has led producers there to withhold shipments as they negotiate with American roasters over who will absorb the added costs, according to investment bank UBS.",
      "In a September\u00a0report, the International Coffee Organization cited uncertainty around coffee tariffs as one catalyst impacting supply in the U.S. Coffee \"cannot be produced in the U.S. on a large enough scale to meet domestic demand,\" the trade group noted.",

    "summary": "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" said one mother of two about a looming freeze in food aid.",
    "story": [
      "Roughly 42 million Americans rely on food stamps that arrive every month on their electronic benefit transfer cards. On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, potentially leaving households scrambling to figure out how to put food on the table.",
      "People enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, told CBS News they're bracing for some tough financial choices. Kasey McBlais, a 42-year-old single mother living in Buckfield, Maine, said she's planning to delay paying her electric and credit card bills to make sure her two children have enough to eat.",
      "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" McBlais, who works for a Maine social services agency and who draws about $600 a month in SNAP benefits, said. \"My children won't go hungry.\"",
      "The suspension of food aid comes as Democratic and Republican lawmakers continue to trade blame over the\u00a0government shutdown, which now stands as the second-longest funding lapse in U.S. history. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds the SNAP program, warned earlier this month that there would be insufficient funding to pay full November benefits if the shutdown continued, prompting local governments to post notices on their websites about the potential interruption in payments.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the USDA said in a memo\u00a0posted Sunday on its website. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.\"",
      "A stoppage in SNAP payments on Saturday isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday, Oct. 31, that the Trump administration is required by law to\u00a0use contingency funds\u00a0to pay at least partial SNAP benefits.",
      "The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have asked the USDA to use contingency funds to cover most of next month's SNAP benefits, but an agency memo surfaced on Friday that says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "That means beginning Nov. 1, the government will halt about $8 billion in monthly SNAP payments, cutting off food assistance for the one in eight Americans who are enrolled in the program. Recipients, who include households in every state, typically get about $187 a month on a prepaid card to help cover the cost of groceries.",
      "Unused benefits on SNAP recipients' cards will roll over into November.",
      "\"That's money that's already been appropriated. It's been put on their card,\" Mackenzie Libbey, a staff attorney with Community Legal Services, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"So we definitely do not want people rushing out to try to use up their benefits at the end of October thinking they're not going to be able to buy anything in November.\"",
      "The USDA said it is incumbent on Democrats in Congress to end the government shutdown.",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely\" SNAP benefits and other federal food aid, the agency said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Some U.S. states, including Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia, have vowed to continue disbursing SNAP benefits even if the federal government suspends payments. New York on Monday\u00a0pledged $30 million in emergency food assistance, while also recently committing to provide millions more in support for food banks. The USDA memo stipulates that states won't be reimbursed for temporarily providing food aid to residents, raising questions about the viability of that approach.",
      "Other states are taking legal action.",
      "A coalition of 25 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday\u00a0sued the Trump administration, alleging that the suspension of food stamps is unlawful and threatens the health and well-being of millions. The states are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the USDA to provide SNAP benefits in November by tapping into a contingency fund, which is estimated to hold around $5 billion.",
      "\"Where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sharlene Sutton, a 45-year-old single mother of four in Dorchester, Massachusetts, who left her job as a security officer last month to care for one of her children, who has epilepsy, said she relies on the $549 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to feed her family.",
      "\"I was freaking out because I'm like, 'Oh my god, now I don't have a job,'\" she told CBS News. \"I'm not worried about myself that much. It's about the kids. Like, where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sutton said she's looking for a food bank to help fill the gap if her food aid is cut off. But experts warn that the non-profit organizations alone aren't capable of filling the $8 billion monthly hole left by a looming SNAP suspension.",
      "\"The charitable food system and food banks don't have the resources to replace all those food dollars,\" John Sayles, CEO of Vermont Foodbank in Barre, Vermont, told CBS News.",
      "Already, food banks are getting an influx of calls from SNAP recipients who are worried about the payment freeze, and food shelves could see long lines next month if the shutdown persists, Sayles said.",
      "\"There is no safety net after SNAP other than the food shelf,\" he added.",
      "Albuquerque, New Mexico's Roadrunner Food Bank, which typically serves 83,000 households per week, is \"seeing panic\" among residents due to the SNAP halt, said Katy Anderson, vice president of strategy, partnerships and advocacy at the nonprofit organization.",
      "George Matysik, executive director of the Share Food Program in Philadelphia, has also noticed an uptick in demand. He told CBS News in a text message that some of the pantries the hunger relief nonprofit works with have reported 12-fold increases in new registrations week to week.",
      "Even before this new surge in demand, food banks were already facing pressures because of the growing number of people seeking their services, aggravated this year by\u00a0persistent inflation\u00a0and funding constraints. In March, the\u00a0USDA said it was nixing $420 million in funding\u00a0for a program that allows food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "Broader economic impact",
      "A temporary halt in $8 billion in monthly food aid could also impact local businesses, from grocers to farm stands, said Sayles of Vermont Foodbank. Each $1 in SNAP benefits provides an economic benefit of $1.60, he said, referring to the so-called\u00a0multiplier effect\u00a0in which dollars flowing through the local economy help support spending, jobs and growth.",
      "\"SNAP is the foundation of economic support for a lot of food retailers, like those smaller places in rural areas and the corner store in our cities,\" said Kate Bauer, an associate professor of nutritional services at the University of Michigan. \"So this has far-reaching impacts beyond just the people who get SNAP.\"",
      "SNAP is designed to provide supplemental aid for a family's grocery budget, but some families depend on it as their main source of income to buy food, Bauer noted. For those living paycheck to paycheck, even a short disruption in benefits can have immediate consequences, experts said.",
      "The loss of SNAP funding threatens some of the most vulnerable people in the U.S., with the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities noting that two-thirds of food-stamp recipients are children, seniors or people with disabilities.",
      "For McBlais, the single mom, the issue isn't political. Rather, it's about making sure families can eat in an economy where many are already struggling to afford rent, utilities and basic groceries, she told CBS News.",
      "\"Everybody needs food \u2014 SNAP recipients are Democratic, Republicans and everything in between,\" McBlais said.",

      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, stated in a memo on Sunday that no benefits will be issued on Nov. 1, leaving the program's roughly 42 million beneficiaries uncertain about how they'll pay for groceries next month.",
      "SNAP recipients receive an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card, and many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. Many of those registered with the program are asking if they will still be able to use the remaining dollars on their cards once funding is suspended and if they'll receive their November benefits retroactively, should lawmakers reach a deal to reopen the government.",
      "A stoppage in SNAP payments on Nov. 1 isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday, Oct. 31, that the Trump administration is required by law to\u00a0use contingency funds\u00a0to pay at least partial SNAP benefits.",
      "The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "With just days to go before a potential suspension in SNAP funding, here's what to know.",
      "Will current SNAP benefits roll over to November?",
      "While SNAP benefits will not be disbursed as scheduled in November, program recipients can use existing funds on their EBT cards to make purchases. If someone enrolled in the program hasn't spent all their October EBT dollars, for example, those benefits would roll over into November.",
      "Some states are advising recipients to use their remaining food stamps wisely, given the stalemate over funding the federal government.",
      "\"If you have remaining balances from previous months, we encourage you to plan your shopping carefully and purchase essential food items when needed,\" Hawaii's Department of Human Services said on its website.",
      "Will SNAP recipients get paid retroactively for missed payments?",
      "The USDA hasn't indicated whether SNAP benefits would be paid retroactively once the government shutdown ends.",
      "But social service experts who spoke with CBS News said they expect the USDA to pay the delayed November benefits once federal funding resumes.",
      "\"It is our understanding that SNAP benefits will be issued retroactively when the shutdown ends,\" said Lizbeth Ginsburg, a managing attorney in the welfare law unit at Greater Boston Legal Services.",
      "Federal rules\u00a0governing the food-stamp program stipulate that SNAP recipients are entitled to their benefits, and that they should receive them if there's a disruption, said Gina Plata-Nino, interim SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on ending hunger.",
      "\"That's why many state agencies have done a very good job of saying, 'Your benefits will be delayed,' versus, 'You are not getting benefits,'\" she told CBS News.",
      "Can states step in to fund SNAP?",
      "While SNAP is federally funded and overseen by the USDA, each state is responsible for administering the program to its residents.",
      "Some states are taking action, with Democratic lawmakers\u00a0urging\u00a0Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to tap into an estimated $5 billion in contingency funds to cover SNAP benefits next month. On Tuesday, a coalition of officials from 25 states and the District of Columbia\u00a0sued the Trump administration\u00a0over the suspension of benefits, arguing that it is unlawful. The\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0notes that this would mark the first delay in SNAP benefits in the program's history.",
      "In recent days, several states have pledged to step in to ensure SNAP recipients can afford food in November. Their approaches vary, with some states promising to dispatch troops to support food banks, while others are allocating funds for general hunger relief.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry\u00a0signed an emergency declaration on Oct. 24 intended to fund SNAP benefits for people who rely on the program, while Vermont lawmakers on Oct. 29 approved a plan to cover its residents' food stamp benefits through Nov. 15.",
      "Other states say they plan to ramp up support for local food banks by providing on-site personnel and additional funding. California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0said\u00a0last week he would deploy National Guard troops to assist food bank operations and fast-track $80 million to keep the state's food banks stocked.",
      "In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she is providing $30 million in state funding to support 16 million meals. Roughly 3 million people in New York are on food stamps.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are sliding toward a financial cliff as the\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0stretches into a second month, with four federal assistance programs for low-income families set to run out of funding on Nov. 1.",
      "Some families could lose access to multiple sources of government support. Ashley Trent, a 37-year-old single mother of six, expressed concern she could soon be without aid provided under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), better known as food stamps, and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, which provides food aid for mothers of young children.",
      "\"I'm wondering how I'm going to be able to afford everything,\" Trent, a Bloomington, Ill., resident who works full-time as a housing navigator, told CBS News. \"It's very stressful \u2014 what bills will I have to put off? I have a car note, I have insurance, I have clothes I have to get my kids because it's getting colder.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds SNAP and WIC, has said it will halt payments for the anti-hunger programs on Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown. Head Start programs serving 65,000 low-income children will also lose federal funding on Saturday, potentially disrupting preschool for thousands of families,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Head Start Association.",
      "The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps struggling households heat their homes, could be next to run short of funding.",
      "Halting funding for these programs \u2014 which help cover food, education, and energy costs \u2014 could have lasting consequences for poor families already strained by high grocery and utility prices, said Ailen Arreaza, executive director of the advocacy group ParentsTogether Action.",
      "Although funding will resume once Congress passes legislation to reopen the government, she warned that the damage to households could persist.",
      "\"What we are hearing from parents is desperation \u2014 parents going without meals, making impossible decisions about not paying bills or going without medication,\" Arreaza told CBS News. \"This has so many implications, because these kids need these programs to get ahead.\"",
      "Experts note that hunger can hinder children's ability to learn, while parents who fall behind on bills may face utility shutoffs or other lasting setbacks.",
      "Food stamps",
      "The USDA is set to\u00a0halt SNAP payments on Nov. 1, leaving about 42 million Americans uncertain how they'll afford groceries next month. Recipients receive an average of about $187 a month on prepaid cards that can be used to buy food at grocery stores, farmers' markets and other retailers.",
      "A prolonged cessation in food-stamp funding isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday that the Trump administration is required by law to use contingency funds to pay at least partial SNAP benefits. The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "Meanwhile, more than a dozen states are trying to fill the gap by using state funds to support food aid or local food banks. But food bank leaders say charities can't make up for a cutoff in food stamps.",
      "\"It's going to hurt us really bad,\" said Taylour Grant, 29, a Tampa medical assistant who relies on $970 a month in SNAP benefits to feed her four children, plus WIC support for her youngest, who is 1-year-old. \"It's really scary because I know I'll go without to make sure my kids are fed.\"",
      "Grant said many people misunderstand who relies on SNAP. \"We're not on it because we want to be \u2014 no one makes enough to live off these days. That help is really needed,\" she said.",
      "WIC",
      "Nearly 7 million low-income pregnant women, new mothers and children under 5 who receive WIC could lose federal aid in November because of the government shutdown.",
      "Unlike food stamps, WIC provides funds specifically to purchase formula and nutritious foods for pregnant women and young children, though many families rely on both programs, said Georgia Machell, CEO of the National WIC Association.",
      "\"None of these programs operate in a vacuum,\" she said. \"Often, if a family is participating in WIC, they're also participating in SNAP.\"",
      "WIC continued paying benefits in October after the Trump administration tapped\u00a0$300 million\u00a0in leftover tariff revenue from the previous fiscal year. But with the stalemate in Congress continuing into November, that funding could run out.",
      "The USDA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it could tap additional tariff revenue to fund the program. At this point, the program is set to delay payments on Nov. 1, according to the National WIC Association.",
      "WIC has been able to maintain funding during previous shutdowns in its 50-year history, according to the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on stopping hunger. \"The disruptions we're concerned about would be fairly historic,\" Machell said.",
      "Some states have pledged to use their own funds to keep WIC running, but many lack the budget, according to FRAC.",
      "Head Start",
      "About 140 Head Start programs in 41 states and Puerto Rico will lose federal funding with the shutdown set to extend past Nov. 1, affecting roughly 65,000 children, according to the National Head Start Association. Nationwide, about 750,000 children are enrolled in Head Start.",
      "Some programs may not be able to stay open, regional program directors warn.",
      "\"Everybody is trying to do everything they can to keep children in classrooms and families at work,\" Michelle Haimowitz, executive director of the Massachusetts Head Start Association,\u00a0told CBS News Boston. \"But it is incredibly difficult to operate without those federal funds.\"",
      "Minnesota mother Jaycee Chrudimsky said she fears that the closure of her local Head Start program could force her to miss work and affect her 4-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It would impact her, and that's the thing I worry about the most, because she looks forward to coming to school every single day and seeing her friends and being a part of the program,\" Chrudimsky\u00a0told\u00a0CBS News Minnesota this week.",
      "LIHEAP",
      "Another program threatened by the shutdown is the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). The program helps about 6 million low-income households pay their energy bills.",
      "\"We are now at a point where the government shutdown is going to cause serious delays in the release of LIHEAP funds,\" Wolfe told CBS News.",
      "The delay could leave millions of families behind on utility bills and facing power shutoffs just as\u00a0energy prices are skyrocketing, he added.",
      "NEADA projects the\u00a0average cost for people to heat a home this winter\u00a0will rise nearly 8%.",

      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol took the helm in September 2024, inheriting a company facing its first revenue decline in four years amid customer complaints about high prices and long wait times. A year later, the coffee giant has halted the slide but faces fresh pressures, from surging coffee bean costs to store closures.",
      "Coffee prices\u00a0jumped 30% from January through September, squeezing Starbucks' profit margins even as Niccol vowed not to raise menu costs this year. The restaurant chain said last month it would spend $1 billion to close underperforming stores and cut 900 jobs.",
      "As Niccol told CBS News' Jo Ling Kent, the retail chain can't rule out price hikes in 2026 due to rising coffee prices, although he described this step as a \"last resort.\" At the same time, Niccol noted that Starbucks has no plans to introduce a value menu like McDonald's and other fast-food chains appealing to budget-conscious patrons.",
      "\"We have a huge point of difference and that is, I think, that customer connection and the experience you get in our stores,\" Niccol told CBS News. \"I just believe, at the end of the day, the experience sets us apart from everybody else.\"",
      "He added, \"Pricing would be one of those things that we do as a last resort, and we do it very surgically. To say never, you know, I don't think you can do that in this environment.\"",
      "\"Human-to-human\"",
      "Starbucks' reboot involves what the company calls its \"Green Apron service model,\" which aims to hire more baristas, improve customer service and cut down on customer wait times.",
      "\"What we're doing right now is making sure that we're staffed correctly,\" Niccol said. \"The teams are trained correctly for the demand that we know we have in the morning, and we know that we're growing in the afternoon.\"",
      "While other companies are turning to artificial intelligence to replace some workers, Niccol said he doesn't envision AI supplanting baristas. He said the technology could be useful for behind-the-scenes tasks, such as managing the company's supply chain.",
      "\"I don't see [AI] replacing our baristas \u2014 that human-to-human experience is just too important,\" Niccol said. \"And I think it really separates our experience from everybody else.\"",
      "While Starbucks is bolstering its barista ranks, it also faces the threat of strikes from Starbucks Workers United, which represents 9,500 workers in some 550 Starbucks cafes across the country. Overall, the company has roughly 201,000 employees working in 10,000 stores across North America.",
      "Niccol said he's open to talking with union members, but also described his company's pay and benefits as generous, adding that their demands \"to date have been unreasonable.\"",
      "\"We already give them the best job in retail. We have the lowest turnover in the industry \u2014 it's below 50%,\" Niccol told CBS News. \"We also have the best benefits in the industry, and we actually have the best wages in the industry.\"",
      "Although other companies have noted a pullback from low- or middle-income consumers as inflation continues to tick upwards, Niccols said Starbucks patrons are still opening their wallets.",
      "\"Transactions are up, our sales are up,\" Niccol said. \"What we hear from them is they love the experience and they think it's a great value proposition, so I think they're being much more judicious in where they want to spend their money.\"",
      "He added, \"And I think it's really important that you give them a great experience so that it justifies why they chose to spend money with you.\"",

      "Powder supplements sold at Sam's Club stores are linked to at least 11 cases of Salmonella in seven states, federal health authorities said Friday.",
      "Member's Mark Super Greens Powder Supplements, which were sold at the discount chain's stores nationwide and online, have been pulled from store shelves because they contain moringa leaf powder that may be contaminated with Salmonella bacteria, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an alert posted on its website.",
      "\"If you have any of the products listed below in your home, throw them out or return them to the store,\" the agency said, while noting that the product has not been recalled.",
      "Three of the people who contracted Salmonella were hospitalized, according to the agency. Illnesses, which were reported between May and September, were confirmed in Florida, Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, New York, South Carolina and Virginia.",
      "The source of the Salmonella was traced to a single lot of organic moringa leaf powder imported from Vallon Farm Direct in Jodhpur, India, according to an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration. State health officials in Virginia and Michigan collected and tested samples of the product from the homes of people who fell ill.",
      "The CDC said it may add other Vallon Farm products with moringa leaf powder to avoid as the agency's investigation continues.",
      "Moringa is a plant native to India and other countries prized for essential nutrients including protein, amino acids, vitamins and minerals, according to research published by the National Institutes of Health. Its leaves can be dried and powdered.",
      "People infected with the Salmonella bacteria can experience symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and fever. Rarely, Salmonella can result in more serious ailments, including arterial infections, endocarditis, arthritis, muscle pain, eye irritation and urinary tract symptoms.",
      "Infections can be severe in young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems, who may require hospitalization.",

    "story": [
      "Thousands of Starbucks workers are gearing up to vote on whether to go on strike next week.",
      "The strike authorization vote is set to begin Friday and will remain open for several days, with Starbucks Workers United expected to share results after voting ends. Employees represented by the union have staged two national strikes over the last year, most recently in May to protest Starbucks' new dress code. Thousands of workers\u00a0also walked off the job\u00a0in December 2024.",
      "As the voting gets underway, the union is also planning a series of rallies and pickets over the weekend outside Starbucks stores in dozens of U.S. cities.",
      "Starbucks Workers United originated in Buffalo, New York, in 2021 and now represents 9,500\u00a0workers in approximately 550 Starbucks cafes across the country.",
      "A union spokesperson confirmed that contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in May 2024 but fell apart in December. The group entered mediation in February, which ended two months later with Workers United rejecting Starbucks' contract proposal. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are noneconomic proposals.",
      "The union spokesperson said the coffee giant has since refused to come to the table with a new proposal that meets workers' demands, which is why negotiations have stalled.",
      "For its part, Starbucks says it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations but claims that Workers United ultimately presented union members with an incomplete outline of single-store contracts to vote on.",
      "\"Workers United only represents around 4% of our partners but chose to walk away from the bargaining table,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News in an email statement. \"If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",
      "What workers want",
      "The workers' demands are threefold, according to the union \u2014 increased hours and\u00a0higher take-home pay, as well as a resolution from Starbucks for what the union refers to as \"unfair labor practice charges\" for union busting.",
      "\"Too many baristas still aren't getting enough hours to pay the bills or meet the threshold for benefits,\" the union says in its statement of demands on its website.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board, including over its dress code.",
      "The union has not specified the size of the pay increase it is seeking. Starbucks said employees receive $30 an hour in pay and benefits. Store managers, or \"coffeehouse leaders\" as they're referred to by the retailer, are salaried. The company contends that nearly 85% of its employees work their preferred hours.",
      "Limited impact",
      "Susan Schurman, a distinguished professor at Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said previous Workers United strikes have had a limited effect on persuading the company to return to the bargaining table.",
      "\"The basic problem is that not enough Starbucks stores are organized yet so that a strike inflicts serious financial or publicity damage to the company,\" Schurman said in an email.",
      "Last month, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company was shuttering certain locations and cutting about 900 jobs. The closures affected 59 union stores, according to Starbucks Workers United.",
      "In a letter to employees at the time, Niccol framed the decision to close stores as part of a \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, an effort he initiated in 2024 to revitalize sales and foot traffic at the chain's coffee shops. The plan includes adding more personal touches to the customer store experience, like handwritten notes on Starbuck's cups.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has\u00a0openly questioned whether Niccol's strategy is working, whereas Starbucks has painted the plan as a success.",
      "\"The facts show that 'Back to Starbucks' is making the experience better for both customers and partners,\" Anderson said. \"We've invested more than $500M to improve our coffeehouse staffing, training, and support on top of offering the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging over $30 per hour for hourly partners.\"",

      "Reynolds was also instructed to call a phone number she was led to believe would provide her with tech support. Instead, she was connected to a\u00a0scam artist\u00a0who claimed that hackers had obtained access to her bank account. The only way to protect her money was to convert the funds into bitcoin, the person told Reynolds.",
      "She withdrew her entire bank account balance, which totaled $13,100, and followed the scammer's directions to go to a bitcoin ATM at a nearby gas station. The ATM was operated by Athena Bitcoin, which has more than 4,000 such terminals across the U.S.",
      "Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb said such incidents highlight the surge in cryptocurrency scams linked to bitcoin ATM providers, resulting in the theft of millions of dollars.",
      "\"Bitcoin ATMs are a tool that scammers, that criminals, are using to separate people, including D.C. residents, from their hard-earned money,\" Schwalb told CBS News. \"Athena, as a bitcoin operator, knows that its kiosks are being used by this element, and yet [has] failed to put proper anti-fraud prevention systems in place to keep it from happening.\"",
      "He added, \"What makes it worse is they are profiting from this because they're charging very substantial fees.\"",
      "Schwalb in September filed a lawsuit against Athena, alleging that it charges \"undisclosed fees on deposits that it knows are often the result of scams, and for failing to implement adequate anti-fraud measures.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Athena Bitcoin said it \"strongly disagrees with the allegations\" and that it will contest the charges in court.",
      "\"We employ aggressive safety protocols to protect the financial interests of our customers. ...Our kiosks employ multiple safeguards, from prominent warnings and daily transaction limits to five separate verification screens designed to stop coerced transactions,\" the company said.",
      "Reynolds is also suing Athena Bitcoin. Her attorney, Vaught Stewart, accused the company of \"not just allowing the fraud to happen \u2014 they're profiting from it.\"",
      "In Washington, D.C., Athena Bitcoin charged fees of up to 26% per transaction, while 93% of all deposits made through the company's ATMs are linked to scams, Schwalb alleged in his suit.",

      "\"We're in a time right now where the world is really, really bad and really dark and people need empathy and help more than, kind of, ever, especially in our country,\" Eilish said to an audience that included Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, as well as \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas. \"I'd say if you have money, it would be great to use it for good things, maybe give it to some people that need it.\"",
      "Late-night host Stephen Colbert\u00a0introduced Eilish onstage at New York's Museum of Modern Art by announcing that she would donate $11.5 million of the proceeds from her Hit Me Hard and Soft tour to causes dedicated to food equity, climate justice and reducing carbon pollution.",
      "In accepting the award, the \"Bad Guy\" singer added a polite but direct call to others in the room, saying a lot of people, especially in the U.S., could use some help right now.",
      "\"Love you all, but there's a few people in here who have a lot more money than me,\" she said, to a smattering of applause. \"And if you're a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? And no hate, but give your money away, shorties.\"",
      "Through her Changemaker Program, Eilish has worked with the nonprofit Reverb for years on its Music Decarbonization Project and its Music Climate Revolution initiative, alongside artists ranging from Dead & Company to Harry Styles.",
      "Chan was also honored at the event, receiving the \"Philanthropy of Science Innovator of the Year\" award. A spokesperson for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Brandi Hoffine Barr, said Zuckerberg and Chan have committed to giving away 99% of their Meta shares to philanthropy over the course of their lifetimes and have already granted out $7 billion. According to Forbes, Zuckerberg's current net worth is around $224 billion.",
      "Eilish's comments come as the number of billionaires worldwide continues to grow, with 204 new billionaires added in 2024, according to a January report from\u00a0Oxfam International titled \"Takers Not Makers.\"",
      "The report found that the billionaires grew wealthier three times faster in 2024 than in 2023, pointing to an increased concentration of resources globally.",
      "Oxfam predicted that at least five people will become trillionaires in the next decade, up from one person the year before. The group called for higher taxes on the rich and other measures to break up monopolies, cap CEO pay and require companies to pay living wages.",
      "The wealthiest Americans have a long history of calling on each other to give away more of their money. In 1889, the steel magnate and industrialist Andrew Carnegie argued in the essay \"The Gospel of Wealth\" that the richest should give away their fortunes within their lifetimes, in part to lessen the sting of growing inequality.",
      "In 2010,\u00a0Bill Gates,\u00a0Melinda French Gates\u00a0and\u00a0Warren Buffett\u00a0took up that call by creating the\u00a0Giving Pledge, a commitment for billionaires to give away more than half their wealth in their lifetimes or when they die.",
      "Fifteen years on, some 256 billionaires have taken the pledge, with 110 of them coming from the U.S., according to a recent\u00a0report by the Charity Reform Initiative\u00a0of the Institute for Policy Studies. Those U.S. billionaires represent 13% of the total 876 billionaires in the U.S., according to the report, revealing the small portion of the wealthiest people who have publicly committed to giving away their fortunes.",
      "The report found that of the 22 billionaires who have died since taking the pledge, only one gave away his fortune before he died. Meanwhile, only eight of the 22 deceased pledgers fulfilled the commitment by giving away half of their wealth or more at their death, though some of their estates are still being resolved.",
      "Chuck Collins, one of the authors of the report and an expert at the Institute for Policy Studies, said Eilish's comments are part of a growing realization that the rules of the economy favor those with assets over those who earn wages.",
      "He thinks the Giving Pledge has created an expectation and competition for the wealthiest to give away their money, but the fortunes of many of the pledgers have increased over time, meaning they will need to move even more aggressively if they are to fulfill the commitment.",
      "\"In the end, philanthropy is not a substitute for a fair and effective tax system,\" Collins said. \"The level of extreme inequality will require some form of restoring progressivity to the tax system, a wealth tax as well as progressive income tax.\"",

      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",

      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",

    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to open their wallets this holiday season, increasing their gift budgets even as a slowing job market and stubborn inflation weigh on consumer confidence, according to a new analysis from Visa Business and Economic Insights.",
      "U.S. consumers are forecast to spend an average of $736 each on holiday gifts, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year, Visa said in its 2025 holiday spending outlook.",
      "Inflation partly explains this year's projected sales growth, with the Consumer Price Index showing that prices rose 3% on an annual basis in September. But Americans are also planning on upping their gifting, especially older consumers, with baby boomers forecasted to boost their holiday spending by 21%, the study found.",
      "The robust spending outlook highlights consumers' resilience, even as confidence surveys paint a more cautious picture.",
      "\"We are clearly seeing consumers spend in a far better, more robust way than what we're seeing in the consumer sentiment and confidence data,\" Michael Brown, a principal U.S. economist at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Visa tapped retail sales data from the U.S. Department of Commerce \u2014 excluding automobiles, gas stations and restaurants \u2014 for its holiday spending projections.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, changes in consumer spending corresponded more closely with consumer sentiment, Visa's analysis shows. But that link has weakened in recent years. In April, for example, when consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since the pandemic, real consumer spending increased 3.1% on an annual basis, the Visa report points out.",
      "Consumers continue to express dour views about the economy, with sentiment falling for a third consecutive month\u00a0in October due to worries about a weaker job market and rising inflation, according to the latest University of Michigan sentiment index. Another measure from the Conference Board, a nonprofit group, also shows confidence in the economy edged down slightly this month.",
      "What explains the disconnect? Steady wage gains have kept spending aloft, with many Americans continuing to shop despite higher prices because their take-home pay remains solid, Brown said.",
      "Other holiday outlook forecasts from groups like Abode for Business and polling firm\u00a0Gallup point to the same conclusion as Visa's: Americans are planning to dish out billions on holiday gifts, travel and food despite their gloomy views on the economy.",
      "Still, some are exercising caution in their purchasing, Brown said, noting that low- and middle-income households will face the biggest tradeoffs this holiday season. Higher costs for essentials such as groceries are leaving them with less room for discretionary spending, he added.",
      "\"There is absolutely an undercurrent of trying to make the dollar stretch, given some of those necessities are costing a bit more this season,\" Brown said.",

      "\"Cinnamon comes from the inner bark of several tree species and can absorb lead from the soil in which it's grown, and the soil can be contaminated with lead from industrial byproducts,\" he explained. \"Lead can also enter cinnamon from processing equipment, storage containers or packaging.\"",
      "To protect against contamination, the FDA monitors and regulates lead levels in foods. In 2023, the agency launched an investigation to find the source of tainted cinnamon in applesauce pouches that caused hundreds of children to get lead poisoning. The products, which were eventually recalled, were sold by brands WanaBana, Weis and Schnucks.",
      "In a separate move last year, the FDA issued three alerts identifying ground cinnamon products with elevated levels of lead. The agency launched a third alert in August 2024, which it continues to update.",
      "\"Overall, it's troubling that these elevated lead levels continue to be found in cinnamon,\" Ronholm said. \"It's also reassuring that the FDA is continuing to scrutinize these products given all of the budget and staffing uncertainty they are experiencing.\"",
      "The FDA in March announced\u00a0plans to cut 3,500 employees, although some dismissals\u00a0have since been reversed.",
      "Thousands of FDA-regulated products, ranging from food to drugs to cosmetics, are recalled each year in an effort to protect the public from potential harm.",
      "Lead's impact on health",
      "According to the FDA, there is no known safe level of contact with lead. The agency says that continued exposure to elevated levels of lead for months or longer can lead to a range of adverse health effects, particularly in young children.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted Thursday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on countries around the world, the third in a trio of rebukes of the president's trade policy this week.",
      "In a 51 to 47 vote, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve the resolution. Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, along with Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, supported the resolution. It was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation, requiring just a simple majority.",
      "The resolution is largely symbolic since it almost certainly won't be taken up by the House, where GOP leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs. Senate Democrats forced a vote on the resolution, which was led by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, by bypassing GOP leadership using a provision of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the law that the president invoked to impose the tariffs.",
      "In April, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency, citing \"structural imbalances in the global trading system.\" The president then announced the U.S. would impose a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, dubbing it \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "Wyden, speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, said the president's \"actions clearly go beyond what the law allows, which is why I'm urging passage of this bill to finally end the president's unlawful tariffs.\"",
      "\"The Senate is not a spectator to the workings of the federal government,\" Wyden said. \"When it comes to international trade, and tariffs in particular, the United States Congress has clear authority.\"",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, spoke out against the resolution, saying \"at this juncture, this resolution is counterproductive to helping American families and businesses of all sizes.\"",
      "\"It's no secret that for decades, countries around the globe have raised tariff and non-tariff barriers against Americans and against American business, and have raised the cost for Americans and American businesses without response from the United States. President Trump is now responding,\" Crapo said. \"The president's negotiations are bearing fruit.\"",
      "The vote came after Mr. Trump announced overnight that he would cut tariffs on Beijing after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. China was part of the \"Liberation Day\" tariffs and has been embroiled in a months-long trade war with the U.S.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, who met with Senate Republicans earlier this week on the issue, defended the tariffs, telling reporters that \"tariffs give us the ability to put American workers first.\"",
      "\"They force American industry to reinvest in the United States of America, instead of a foreign country,\" the vice president said. \"They're also incredible leverage for the president of the United States in negotiating these trade deals overseas.\"",
      "The Senate on Tuesday approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure. Then, on Wednesday, the Senate approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada, with support from four Republicans.",
      "Thursday's vote also marked the second time the chamber has weighed in on the issue, after the Senate voted in April on a resolution to Mr. Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs. The effort fell short at the time, with two senators who had previously voiced opposition to the tariffs measure absent from the vote.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Oct 2025 14:52:49 -0400",
    "summary": "With the Treasury Department no longer minting the one-cent coin, some businesses are offering perks to customers who bring in pennies.",
    "story": [
      "Businesses around the U.S. are desperate for pennies.",
      "President Trump's decision to stop producing the penny earlier this year is leaving some merchants short of the one-cent coin and struggling to give customers exact change. Unable to order fresh supplies of pennies, banks are also rationing them.",
      "Some retailers are pulling out all the stops just to scrounge up some pennies. Pennsylvania-based grocery chain Giant Eagle is holding a one-day event this weekend where customers can exchange their pennies for gift cards worth double the value of the coins, CBS News Pittsburgh reports.",
      "Sheetz, a convenience store chain, is also running a promotion offering a free soda to customers who bring in 100 pennies.",
      "Troy Richards, president and chief operations officer at Louisiana-based Guaranty Bank & Trust Co., said he's had to scramble to have enough pennies on hand for his customers since August.",
      "\"We got an email announcement from the Federal Reserve that penny shipments would be curtailed. Little did we know that those shipments were already over for us,\" Richards said.",
      "Richards said the $1,800 in pennies the bank had were gone in two weeks. His branches are keeping small amounts of pennies for customers who need to cash checks, but that's it.",
      "The lack of pennies has also become a legal minefield for stores and retailers. In some states and cities, it is illegal to round up a transaction to the nearest nickel or dime because doing so would run afoul of laws that are supposed to place cash customers, as well as debit and credit card customers, on an equal playing field when it comes to item costs.",
      "To avoid lawsuits, retailers are rounding down. While two or three cents may not seem like much, that extra change can add up over tens of thousands of transactions. A spokesman for Kwik Trip, the Midwest convenience store chain, said it has been rounding down every cash transaction to the nearest nickel.",
      "That's expected to cost the company roughly $3 million this year. Some retailers are asking customers to give their change to local or affiliated charities at the cash register, in an effort to avoid pennies as well.",
      "Costs more than they're worth",
      "To be sure, retailers and banks aren't clamoring for pennies to stick around. Pennies, especially in bulk, are heavy and largely used to give customers change.",
      "\"We have been advocating abolition of the penny for 30 years. But this is not the way we wanted it to go,\" said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.",
      "The penny, which dates from the\u00a0early days of the U.S. Mint\u00a0after its establishment in 1792, now costs more to manufacture than the coin is worth. One penny cost about 3.7 cents to manufacture and distribute in 2024, according to the U.S. Mint's 2024\u00a0annual report.",
      "\"Let's rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a Feb. 9 post on his Truth Social social media platform.",
      "The Treasury Department said in May that it was placing its last order of copper-zinc planchets \u2014 the blank metal disks that are minted into coins. In June, the last pennies were minted, and by August those pennies were distributed to banks and armored vehicle service companies.",
      "Despite their coppery look, pennies are mostly made of zinc, with their distinctive appearance coming from a copper overlay. Zinc's cost per metric ton is more than double what it was in 2000, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Piling up in jars",
      "The U.S. Mint issued 3.2 billion pennies in 2024, the last full year of production, more than double that of the second-most minted coin in the country: the quarter. But the problem with pennies is they are issued, given as change and rarely recirculated back into the economy. Americans store their pennies in jars or use them for decoration. This requires the Mint to produce significant sums of pennies each year.",
      "The government is expected to save $56 million by not minting pennies, according to the Treasury Department. Despite losing money on the penny, the Mint is profitable for the U.S. government through its production of other circulating coins as well as coin proof and commemorative sets that appeal to numismatic collectors.",
      "In 2024, the Mint made $182 million in seigniorage, which is its equivalent of profit.",
      "Besides Americans' penny-hoarding habit, a logistical issue is also preventing pennies from circulating.",
      "The distribution of coins is handled by the Federal Reserve system. Several companies, mostly armored carrier companies, operate coin terminals where banks can withdraw and deposit coins. Roughly a third of these 170 coin terminals are now closed to both penny deposits as well as penny withdrawals.",
      "Bank lobbyists say these terminals being closed to penny deposits is exacerbating the penny shortage, because parts of the country that may have some surplus pennies are unable to get those pennies to parts of country with shortages.",
      "\"As a result of the U.S. Department of the Treasury's decision to end production of the penny, coin distribution locations accepting penny deposits and fulfilling orders will vary over time as (penny) inventory is depleted\" a Federal Reserve spokeswoman said.",
      "The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment on whether they had any guidance for retailers or banks regarding the penny shortage, or the issues regarding penny circulation.",
      "\"We don't want the penny back\"",
      "The U.S. isn't the first country to transition away from small denomination coins or discontinue out-of-date coins. But in all of these cases, governments wound down the use of their out-of-date coins over a period of, often, years.",
      "For example, Canada announced it would eliminate its one-cent coin in 2012, transitioning away from one-cent cash transactions starting in 2013 and is still redeeming and recycling one-cent coins a decade later. The \"decimalization\" process of converting British coins from farthings and shillings to a 100-pence-to-a-pound system took much of the 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "The U.S. removed the penny from commerce abruptly, without any action by Congress or any regulatory guidance for banks, retailers or states. The retail and banking industries, rarely allies in Washington on policy matters related to point-of-sale, are demanding that Washington issue guidance or pass a law fixing the issues that are arising due to the shortage.",
      "\"We don't want the penny back. We just want some sort of clarity from the federal government on what to do, as this issue is only going to get worse,\" said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.",

      "New Jersey Republican Jack Ciattarelli may have a chance in the race against Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill to win back the governor's office from Democrats after a surprisingly close election four years ago.",
      "But a national political environment that may serve as a referendum on Republican President Trump's first year in office could close that window for the GOP.",
      "Mr. Trump has supported Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, and backed him as he faced a competitive primary, even going as far as to hold a telephone rally for him recently. Ciattarelli is running for governor for a third time, after falling short in a surprisingly close race against Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in 2021.",
      "Sherrill says Ciattarelli has shown \"zero signs of standing up\" to Trump",
      "On the Democratic side, Sherrill, who represents New Jersey's 11th District in Congress, has a favorable national political environment, but is contending with potential political fatigue within the state about her party's back-to-back terms controlling the governor's office. Sherrill has been adamant about tying Ciattarelli to President Trump and focusing her campaign on affordability.",
      "\"He's shown zero signs of standing up to this president. In fact, the president himself called Jack 100% MAGA,\" Sherrill said during a debate.",
      "Ciattarelli faults Democrats for being \"out of touch and ruining our state\"",
      "Ciattarelli has faulted Sherrill for relying on generalities and platitudes while also centering his argument for change on New Jersey Democrats' lengthy tenure in control of state government.",
      "\"Trenton Democrats: out of touch and ruining our state. They push offshore wind while our electric bills skyrocket. They raise tolls and fees but haven't fixed our roads and they care more about pronouns than property taxes,\" Ciattarelli said in one campaign advertisement. \"Had enough? Me too.\"",
      "Sherrill was not the most progressive candidate in this year's New Jersey primary race, and she may also have to contend with the Democratic brand issues that have haunted national Democrats in the wake of 2024, due to her career in Congress.",
      "Democrats' winning streak in the state could also give Republicans an anti-incumbency argument, and it wasn't long ago that a Republican led the state. From the 1970s onwards, neither party has been able to win the New Jersey governor's race three straight times.",
      "The final stretch",
      "Sherrill's campaign received a boost days before Election Day from former President Barack Obama, who joined her at a rally Saturday.",
      "\"You have a candidate worth being excited about,\" he told the crowd. Referring to Sherrill as an \"inspiration,\" the former president told the crowd that \"we need that inspiration \u2014 because let's face it, our country and our politics are in a pretty dark place right now.\"",
      "He said of Mr. Trump, \"Every day, this White House offers up a fresh batch of lawlessness and carelessness and mean spiritedness, and just plain old craziness.\"",
      "On the Republican side, Mr. Trump held a tele-rally for Ciattarelli on the eve of the election,\u00a0as Republicans look to return a GOP candidate to the governor's office for the first time since Chris Christie led the state.",
      "Back in 2021, Ciattarelli narrowly lost the New Jersey governor's race to incumbent Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. The race, occurring early in Democratic President Joe Biden's tenure, was far closer than was expected, given the state's more reliable Democratic lean, with Murphy winning out over Ciattarelli by around three points.",
      "In a close race, New Jersey's Latino voters may also play an influential role for either candidate. Democrats have a voter registration advantage over Republicans in the state, although their numbers have dipped as of late. Statistics show that since the start of the year the number of registered Democrats in New Jersey has fallen by more than 12,000 but remains above 2.5 million in the state. Republican voter registration has grown by close to 29,000 but still trails Democrats by more than 855,000, with around 1.67 million registered to the GOP.

Today, school board members, county clerks, and even mail carriers face similar dangers.\"",
      "While federal officials remain the most frequent targets, threats against local officials are growing and now make up roughly one-third of all documented threats, researchers found.",

    "summary": "The 2025 Virginia governor's race between Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears offers both parties a chance to start charting a path forward.",
    "story": [
      "This fall's race for Virginia governor offers Democrats a chance to start recovering from stinging losses in last year's presidential election.",
      "It also brings the risk that the party could slip further into the doldrums that hurt its brand with voters around the country in 2024.",
      "The Nov. 4 election for governor of Virginia \u2014 pitting former Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger against Republican Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears \u2014 will serve as one of Democrats' first major opportunities to rebound from the setbacks they suffered in the 2024 presidential election, when they also lost control of the Senate and failed to retake control of the House.",
      "Spanberger rallies with Obama",
      "Spanberger\u00a0held a rally with former President Barack Obama on the weekend before Election Day. President Trump, however, has had little involvement as Earle-Sears looks to succeed Gov. Glenn Youngkin and become the first GOP candidate since 1997 to succeed a fellow Republican as governor of the commonwealth.",
      "Mr. Trump has not formally endorsed Earle-Sears. In a telephone rally on the eve of the election, the president attacked Spanberger and encouraged people to vote for Republicans up and down the ballot, but he didn't mention Earle-Sears by name.",
      "Under Virginia law, a governor cannot serve for two consecutive terms, which has resulted in open races for the office without the advantage of incumbency. Regardless of who wins between the two in November, Spanberger or Earle-Sears will become the Commonwealth's first ever female governor.",
      "The Trump administration's impact on the federal workforce and the ongoing shutdown may also be on voters' minds in the coming days, as they get their say in a contest that historically has been fraught with prospect of serving as a rebuke to the incumbent in the White House.",
      "\"It is because of the trade wars and the retaliatory tariff policies and the attack on Virginia, our economy and our people, that we recognize the possibility of November 4, that we recognize how important it is to have a governor who will stand up for Virginians,\" Spanberger said at a recent event.",
      "State of the race",
      "Spanberger headed into the start of early voting in September with a clear advantage in the contest. That momentum threatened to be impacted, however, by a controversy that has made its way through Virginia politics. She has faced difficult political questions in attempting to respond to violent text messages, authored by Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee in the Virginia Attorney General's race, about a Republican leader.",
      "\"I'm asking my opponent to please, ask him to get out of the race,\" Earle-Sears said during the lone debate between the two candidates. \"Have some political courage. What you have done is you are taking political calculations about your future as governor. Well as governor, you have to make hard choices, and that means telling Jay Jones to leave the race.\"",
      "Spanberger has denounced Jones' words, which were made public after the start of early voting, where he wrote in the past about a fantasy hypothetical situation involving the shooting of a Virginia state House Republican leader.",
      "Jones however has not left the race, and is still running as the Democratic attorney general candidate in the Nov. 4 election.",
      "That dynamic has provided Virginia Republicans with an issue against Democrats that could alienate moderates and independents at a time where concerns about political violence are rampant. Virginia Democrats are also mounting a last-minute effort to redraw congressional districts in the state to help the left counter Mr. Trump's successful push in a series of red states to undertake an overhaul of district maps in hopes of helping Republicans hold on to the House in next year's midterm elections.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Nov 2025 19:18:47 -0500",
    "summary": "After his recent remarks about resuming nuclear testing, President Trump told \"60 Minutes\" \"we're the only country that doesn't test.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's comments about restarting weapons tests are not likely to lead to mushroom-cloud explosions over the New Mexico desert or seismic shaking underground in Nevada, according to the nation's foremost experts.",
      "But questions about\u00a0what kind of testing Mr. Trump does have in mind have been rippling through the nuclear nonproliferation community. In an interview on \"60 Minutes,\" the president elaborated on remarks he made last week announcing a plan to resume U.S. testing of nuclear weapons. \"Other countries are testing,\" he said. \"We're the only country that doesn't test, and I don't want to be the only country that doesn't test.\"",
      "The president did not clarify what type of testing he envisions. The U.S. has not conducted above-ground nuclear tests since the 1960s, and the last underground detonation of a nuclear device in the U.S. occurred in 1992. That test, at the Nevada Test Site, was the final nuclear weapons test before the current testing moratorium was put in place.",
      "Asked if he was announcing that after more than 30 years, the United States planned to start detonating nuclear weapons for testing, Mr. Trump replied that \"we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes.\"",
      "\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,\" he said. \"You know, we're an open society. We're different. We talk about it... We're going to test, because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea's been testing. Pakistan's been testing.\"",
      "On Monday, CIA Director John Ratcliffe posted a brief statement on his personal X account that said President Trump \"is right,\" and showed images related to public U.S. assessments from 2019 by the Defense Intelligence Agency that Russia and China were carrying out low-yield nuclear tests.",
      "Low-yield tests involve very small nuclear explosions that can help researchers study a weapon's efficacy, but are generally banned under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The U.S., China and Russia are signatories to that treaty, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1996, but have not ratified it.",
      "There was no mention in Ratcliffe's post of actions by Pakistan or North Korea.",
      "The CIA declined to comment beyond the director's post.",
      "The White House referred a question about clarifying the president's comments on nuclear testing to what Mr. Trump has said.",
      "Nine countries \u2014 the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, India and Israel \u2014 currently possess a combined total of more than 12,000 nuclear warheads, with the U.S. and Russia accounting for nearly 90% of the global stockpile, according to the Federation of American Scientists.",
      "The U.S. intelligence community's 2025 worldwide threat assessment said Russia's nuclear stockpile was the world's \"largest and most diverse,\" noting that it, in combination with an array of delivery systems, \"could inflict catastrophic damage to the Homeland.\"",
      "The assessment also said China \"remains intent\" on expanding its nuclear posture.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters during a press briefing Monday that as a \"responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always ... upheld a self-defense nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.\" And a senior Pakistani security official told CBS News, \"Pakistan was not the first to carry out nuclear tests and will not be the first to resume nuclear tests.\"",
      "George Perkovich, a senior fellow in the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace's Nuclear Policy Program, said experts on nuclear weapons testing believe the president was referencing \"subcritical\" tests, rather than tests that register on the Richter Scale or yield a visible display.",
      "\"These don't produce an explosion. They can be done in laboratories,\" Perkovich said.",
      "Subcritical nuclear tests involve perfecting the final steps in triggering a chain reaction in the lab, and then using computing power to conduct simulations of an actual detonation.",
      "\"Because he kept insisting that everyone else is doing it, I am assuming he means those types of tests that don't involve explosions,\" Perkovich said. \"If these countries have been doing [explosive] tests, then the president just released very highly classified intelligence.\"",
      "Sigfried Hecker, who served as director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1986 to 1997, said the Russians, Chinese and the U.S. all perform subcritical experiments. But another type of nuclear test that the U.S. stopped conducting, called Hydronuclear experiments, involves a tiny amount of explosive \u2013 not enough to be detected by seismic monitors.",
      "\"These are where you barely tickle the bomb, and you get small nuclear reactions,\" Hecker said. \"No mushroom cloud. You're just doing enough to produce a reaction in the plutonium. No risk, no hazard, easily contained. No safety issues.\"",
      "Hecker said he did not know if the president might be referring to that type of test.",
      "\"Whether the president and his advisers are steeped in all of this, I don't know,\" he said.",
      "Samantha Vinograd, a national security expert and CBS News consultant who served as assistant secretary for counterterrorism and threat prevention at the US Department of Homeland Security said \"there are various kinds of tests that the president could be referring to so there are currently a lot of hypotheticals.\"",
      "The White House referred a question about clarifying the president's comments about nuclear testing to what Mr. Trump has said.",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright tried to clarify Mr. Trump's nuclear comments in an appearance on Fox News, saying the president was referencing \"systems tests.\"",
      "\"These are not nuclear explosions,\" Wright said. \"These are what we call noncritical explosions, so we're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "As energy secretary, Wright is helping oversee the modernization of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, which he said the president has made a \"critical priority.\"",
      "\"A lot of our weapons are very old and President Trump has been adamant about we have to be on the forefront, we need to be ahead of our adversaries, we need to keep our weapon stockpile modern and upgraded,\" Wright said.",
      "If the U.S. does begin nuclear testing again, China would benefit the most, according to Heather Williams, the director of the Project on Nuclear Issues and a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "\"The United States has conducted 1,054 tests, and Russia has conducted 715. China only conducted 47 nuclear tests, both above ground and underground,\" Williams said on Saturday.",
      "\"This asymmetry in test data has been a sore spot for Chinese officials who felt disadvantaged by arms control agreements, such as the Partial Test Ban Treaty. If one country returns to nuclear testing, others are likely to follow \u2014 in which case, China would stand to gain the most in terms of weapons design and warhead information, further contributing to its nuclear buildup,\" said Williams.",
      "However, Williams also underscored that both political and scientific leaders have repeatedly said that the U.S. has no technical need to return to nuclear testing.",
      "Olivia  Gazis, \n                                                  \n                                  James  LaPorta and \n                                                  \n                                  Camilla  Schick\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut said she \"found no credible evidence\" that protests in the city grew out of control before the president federalized the troops.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Oregon on Sunday barred President Trump's administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, until at least Friday, saying she \"found no credible evidence\" that protests in the city grew out of control before the president federalized the troops earlier this fall.",
      "The city and state sued in September to block the deployment.",
      "It's the latest development in weeks of legal back-and-forth in Portland, Chicago and other U.S. cities as the Trump administration has moved to federalize and deploy the National Guard in city streets to quell protests.",
      "The ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, an appointee of Mr. Trump, followed a three-day trial in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law.",
      "In a 16-page filing late Sunday, Immergut said she would issue a final order on Friday due to the voluminous evidence presented at trial, including more than 750 exhibits.",
      "The Trump administration on Monday appealed the ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "The purpose of the deployment, according to the Trump administration, is to protect federal personnel and property where protests are occurring or likely to occur. Legal experts said that a higher appellate court order that remains in effect would have barred troops from being deployed anyway.",
      "Immergut wrote that most violence appeared to be between protesters and counter-protesters and found no evidence of \"significant damage\" to the immigration facility at the center of the protests.",
      "\"Based on the trial testimony, this Court finds no credible evidence that during the approximately two months before the President's federalization order, protests grew out of control or involved more than isolated and sporadic instances of violent conduct that resulted in no serious injuries to federal personnel,\" she wrote.",
      "The complex case comes as Democratic cities targeted by Mr. Trump for military involvement \u2014 including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue \u2014 seek to push back. They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states' sovereignty. The administration argues that it needs the troops because it has been unable to enforce the law with regular forces \u2014 one of the conditions set by Congress for calling up troops.",
      "Immergut issued two orders in early October that blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. She previously found that Mr. Trump had failed to show that he met the legal requirements for mobilizing the National Guard. She described his assessment of Portland, which Mr. Trump has called \"war-ravaged\" with \"fires all over the place,\" as \"simply untethered to the facts.\"",
      "One of Immergut's orders was paused Oct. 20 by a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit. But late Tuesday, the appeals court vacated that decision and said it would rehear the matter before an 11-judge panel. Until the larger panel rehears the case, the appeals court's initial order from early October \u2014 under which the National Guard is federalized but not deployed \u2014 remains in effect.",
      "During the Portland trial, witnesses including local police and federal officials were questioned about the law enforcement response to the nightly protests at the city's ICE building. The demonstrations peaked in June, when Portland police declared one a riot. The demonstrations typically drew a couple dozen people in the weeks leading up to Mr. Trump's National Guard announcement.",
      "The Trump administration said it has had to shuffle federal agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the Portland protests, which it has characterized as a \"rebellion\" or \"danger of rebellion\" \u2014 another one of the conditions for calling up troops under federal law.",
      "Federal officials working in the region testified about staffing shortages and requests for more personnel that have yet to be fulfilled. Among them was an official with the Federal Protective Service, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that provides security at federal buildings, whom the judge allowed to be sworn in as a witness under his initials, R.C., due to safety concerns.",
      "R.C., who said he would be one of the most knowledgeable people in DHS about security at Portland's ICE building, testified that a troop deployment would alleviate the strain on staff. When cross-examined, however, he said he did not request troops and that he was not consulted on the matter. He also said he was \"surprised\" to learn about the deployment and that he did not agree with statements about Portland burning down.",
      "Attorneys for Portland and Oregon said city police have been able to respond to the protests. After the police department declared a riot on June 14, it changed its strategy to direct officers to intervene when person and property crime occurs, and crowd numbers have largely diminished since the end of that month, police officials testified.",
      "Another Federal Protective Service official whom the judge also allowed to testify under his initials said protesters have at times been violent, damaged the facility and acted aggressively toward officers working at the building.",
      "The ICE building closed for three weeks over the summer due to property damage, according to court documents and testimony. The regional field office director for ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, Cammilla Wamsley, said her employees worked from another building during that period. The plaintiffs argued that was evidence that they were able to continue their work functions.",
      "Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Scott Kennedy said that \"without minimizing or condoning offensive expressions\" or certain instances of criminal conduct, \"none of these incidents suggest ... that there's a rebellion or an inability to execute the laws.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, who was nominated to the bench by President Trump, said he expects the trial to last no more than two days \"because it's the simplest case in the world.\"",
    "story": [
      "Throwing a sandwich at a federal agent turned Sean Charles Dunn into a symbol of resistance against President Trump's law-enforcement surge in the nation's capital. This week, federal prosecutors are trying to persuade a jury of fellow Washington, D.C., residents that Dunn simply broke the law.",
      "That could be a tough sell for the government in a city that has chafed against Mr. Trump's federal takeover, which is entering its third month. A grand jury refused to indict Dunn on a felony assault count before U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro's office opted to charge him instead with a misdemeanor.",
      "Securing a trial conviction could prove to be equally challenging for Justice Department prosecutors in Washington, where murals glorifying Dunn's sandwich toss popped up virtually overnight.",
      "Before jury selection started Monday, the judge presiding over Dunn's trial seemed to acknowledge how unusual it is for a case like this to be heard in federal court. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, who was nominated to the bench by Mr. Trump, said he expects the trial to last no more than two days \"because it's the simplest case in the world.\"",
      "A video that went viral on social media captured Dunn hurling a \"submarine-style sandwich\" at a Customs and Border Protection agent outside a nightclub on the night of Aug. 10. That same weekend, Mr. Trump announced his deployment of hundreds of National Guard troops and federal agents to assist with police patrols in Washington.",
      "When Dunn approached a group of CBP agents who were in front of a club hosting a \"Latin Night,\" he called them \"fascists\" and \"racists\" and chanted \"shame\" toward them. An observer's video captured Dunn throwing a sandwich at an agent's chest.",
      "\"Why are you here? I don't want you in my city!\" Dunn shouted, according to police.",
      "Dunn ran away but was apprehended. He was released from custody but rearrested when a team of armed federal agents in riot gear raided his home. The White House posted a highly produced \"propaganda\" video of the raid on its official X account, Dunn's lawyers said. They noted that Dunn had offered to surrender to police before the raid.",
      "Dunn worked as an international affairs specialist in the Justice Department's criminal division. After Dunn's arrest, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced his firing in a social media post that referred to him as \"an example of the Deep State.\"",
      "Pirro, the U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., also issued a\u00a0video announcing the arrest, saying her office is \"going to back the police to the hilt. So there, stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else.\"",
      "Before trial, Dunn's lawyers urged the judge to dismiss the case for what they allege is a vindictive and selective prosecution.\u00a0They argued\u00a0that the posts by Bondi and the White House prove Dunn was impermissibly targeted for his political speech.",
      "Julia Gatto, one of Dunn's lawyers, questioned why Mr. Trump's Justice Department is prosecuting Dunn after the Republican president issued pardons and ordered the dismissal of assault cases stemming from a mob's attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "\"It's an obvious answer,\" Gatto said during a hearing last Thursday. \"The answer is they have different politics. And that's selective prosecution.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Pakistani official told CBS News that the country \"will not be the first to resume nuclear tests\" in response to President Trump's assertion in an\u00a0interview with 60 Minutes that the country has conducted nuclear weapons tests, along with Russia and China.",
      "\"Pakistan was not the first to carry out nuclear tests and will not be the first to resume nuclear tests,\" the senior Pakistani security official told CBS News.",
      "China was the first of the nations accused by Mr. Trump in his interview with CBS News correspondent Norah O'Donnell to deny any secret nuclear testing.",
      "\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,\" Mr. Trump said, explaining his recent announcement that the U.S. would carry out tests of its nuclear weapons. \"We're gonna test, because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea's been testing. Pakistan's been testing.\"",
      "Trump made the assertion to O'Donnell during an interview that was broadcast just days after the president's own nominee to lead STRATCOM \u2014 the U.S. military command in charge of nuclear weapons \u2014 told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that neither China nor Russia were conducting nuclear explosive tests.",
      "North Korea is the only nation known to have conducted a nuclear detonation since the 1990s. China's last known nuclear explosive test was in 1996.",
      "Pakistan's last known nuclear explosive test was in 1998, and it since then its government says it has observed a \"unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing,\" despite not being a signatory to the international Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).",
      "The U.S. is among almost 180 nations that have signed the CTBT, which bans all atomic test explosions.",
      "Along with China and several other nuclear powers, however, the U.S. has never ratified the treaty, a situation that President Vladimir Putin highlighted two years ago when he decided to revoke Moscow's ratification.",
      "While Russia has stepped up its own tests of nuclear-capable weapons systems, it has not said it will resume nuclear detonations.",
      "On its website, the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs says that \"despite being a non-signatory state, Pakistan been supporting the objectives and purposes of the Treaty,\" and that in addition to its moratorium on nuclear tests, it \"will not be the first to resume testing of nuclear weapons in South Asia.\"",
      "Asked about Mr. Trump's claims on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters during a press briefing that as a \"responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always ... upheld a self-defense nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.\"",
      "She said China hoped the U.S. would \"take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and maintain global strategic balance and stability.\"",
      "There was no immediate reaction from Moscow to Mr. Trump's claim that Russia has also conducted secret nuclear tests.",
      "What does Trump mean by U.S. resuming nuclear tests?",
      "President Trump has not been clear about whether his stated plan to have the U.S. military test its nuclear arsenal include conducting actual atomic explosions, which have not been carried out in the U.S. more than 30 years, or just expanded testing of the weapons systems used to deliver nuclear warheads.",
      "U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, downplayed the notion on Sunday that the U.S. was about to start setting off nuclear explosions.",
      "\"I think the tests we're talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions,\" Wright told Fox News. \"These are what we call 'non-critical explosions,' so you're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry and they set up the nuclear explosion.\"",

    "summary": "According to the Unidos Bipartisan Poll of Hispanic Voters: The Road to 2026, 53% of Latino voters cite the cost of living and inflation as their leading concern.",
    "story": [
      "A sweeping new survey of 3,000 registered Latino voters across the country finds that economic anxiety continues to dominate the political mood heading into the 2026 midterm elections, with cost of living, jobs, and housing far outpacing other issues as top priorities for the nation's second-largest voting bloc.",
      "The new survey finds that while immigration is still important to this increasingly swing electorate, it's not the top issue. It ranks fifth, behind affordability, jobs and other kitchen table issues.",
      "According to the Unidos Bipartisan Poll of Hispanic Voters: The Road to 2026, first obtained by CBS News, 53% of Latino voters cite the cost of living and inflation as their leading concern, followed by jobs and the economy (36%), housing (32%), health care (30%) and immigration reform (20%). More than one-third say the economy is worse than it was a year ago, while just 14% believe it has improved.",
      "Pocketbook concerns dominate nearly every measure of voter sentiment. Nearly two-thirds (65%) of Latino voters surveyed say President Trump and congressional Republicans are not doing enough to improve the economy \u2014 a 5-point increase since April \u2014 and half of respondents believe Mr. Trump's economic policies will make them personally worse off next year.",
      "The perception of declining economic stability is fueling discontent with Washington: 81% of Latino voters say Congress is failing to fulfill its checks-and-balances role, and 62% disapprove of how the Republican Party is leading Congress. A similar share, 61%, blame Republicans for the recent government shutdown, compared to just 22% who fault Democrats.",
      "\"Hispanic voters keep stressing the need to address low wages and the rising cost of living, yet feel that the administration and Republicans whom they hold most responsible for the shutdown are not focusing enough on this,\" Clarissa Martinez de Castro, vice president of UnidosUS, told CBS News.",
      "\"Making matters worse, Hispanic voters also feel that civil rights and freedoms, and their personal safety or that of their loved ones are at risk. Perhaps that is why an overwhelming 81% are concerned that Congress is giving the president too much authority and power.\"",
      "In the new poll by the nation's largest Latino advocacy organization, 64% of Latinos disapprove of Mr. Trump's job performance, with 13% of his 2024 supporters saying they would not vote for him again and another 9% uncertain. The issues most shaping opinions of the president include cost of living and inflation, immigration arrests and deportations, jobs, and cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs.",
      "For the president, the results mark a sharp contrast with his 2024 performance among Hispanic voters \u2014 a constituency that helped fuel his return to the White House. Now, economic pessimism and disapproval of congressional Republicans could reshape Latino turnout and partisan alignment heading into the next midterm cycle.",
      "If the midterms were held today, 52% of Latinos surveyed say they would vote for the Democratic House candidate, compared to 28% for the Republican \u2014 underscoring a widening partisan gap since 2024, when Mr. Trump carried 48% of Latino voters overall and 54% of Latino men in his successful presidential bid, according to Pew Research.",
      "By and large, Latino voters stand by their 2024 presidential vote choices, however, including those who supported the president a year ago. Asked if they had to do it over again, would they still vote for President Trump or former Vice President Harris, 78% of Trump supporters said they would and 93% of Harris supporters also responded in the affirmative.",
      "\"The fascinating part is that the Democrats haven't really lost Latino voters, but they're not winning them back,\" Daniel Garza from the right-leaning LIBRE initiative said in an interview with CBS in response to the poll. \"We're at this inflection point. And they're waiting for somebody to win them over with something positive, productive that's going to move us forward. And right now, I don't think that Trump is meeting expectations, but Democrats have done nothing. They're worse off, actually.\" Garza described them as \"obstructionists\" in the ongoing government shutdown.",
      "Garza predicts that if the economy improves by the spring under the Trump administration's economic policies, \"Democrats may lose (Latino voters) forever.\"",
      "According to the poll, Latino voters are leaning towards Democrats on a range of issues, with 55% saying the Democratic Party cares \"a great deal\" about the Latino community, compared to just 29% who say the same of Republicans. One in three view the GOP as \"hostile\" to Latinos.",
      "When asked which party they trust most on key policy areas, Democrats hold advantages on several key issues including health care. However, the GOP maintains an edge on border security.",
      "The bipartisan survey  was conducted across the country with over samples of 400 registered Latino voters in Arizona, California, Florida, Colorado, Texas and Georgia.",
      "In California, which is holding a special election on Tuesday to decide on a California ballot measure that would allow state Democrats to redraw several congressional districts to make them more favorable to their party, Latino voter turnout could wield outsized influence on how this contest plays out. California has the largest Latino-eligible electorate. Both sides of the Proposition 50 debate have been appealing to the Hispanic populations. The Democratic National Committee announced earlier this fall a bilingual organizing initiative that targets these potential voters and includes 41,000 volunteers canvassing and phone banking traditionally Latino communities in California.",
      "On the subject of immigration, the survey captures deep unease about civil liberties and public safety: 72% of those surveyed oppose a recent Supreme Court decision allowing immigration agents to use a person's language, appearance and work location as grounds for making a stop, 59% say their rights and liberties feel less secure than before, and about half oppose deploying U.S. troops to cities for crime or immigration enforcement.",
      "The high court froze a district court's temporary restraining order that prevented federal immigration authorities from stopping people in southern California by relying solely on four factors: apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or speaking English with an ascend, being at a specific location like a day laborer pickup site, and a person's occupation. In the survey, 41% of the respondents said they fear they or someone close to them might be arrested by federal immigration agents despite having legal status.",
      "Nearly half (49%) also said they are \"very concerned\" that they or someone close could become a victim of political violence, with 44% blaming the rise in such violence mostly on Republican rhetoric.",
      "The UnidosUS survey was conducted Oct. 8 through Oct. 22 by BSP Research and Shaw & Company Research, the head of which, Daron R. Shaw, serves as part of the polling team for Fox News. BSP Research conducted polls for Democrats in 2024.",
      "CBS News polling throughout the 2024 campaign pointed to dissatisfaction with the economy and rising prices as key drivers of voting decisions. This year, CBS News polling also indicated that many voters are still unhappy with the direction of the country and the economy specifically.",
      "According to a CBS News national survey last month, most Latinos rank either the economy/jobs (26%) or inflation (25%) as the most important issue facing the country. Two-thirds of Latinos rate the national economy negatively. And Mr. Trump's job approval rating has slid to 38% among Latinos, from a high of 49% at the start of his term.",
      "Mr. Trump's approval rating on handling inflation has fallen to a 32% among Latinos, and majorities say his policies are costing the U.S. jobs and making them worse off financially. Nationwide, most Latinos now say whether or not they support him, they believe that Mr. Trump is not following through on the promises he made during his campaign.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. Department of Agriculture told a federal court that it will tap into a contingency fund to allow states to issue partial November benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the government shutdown.",
      "In a declaration submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said the administration \"intends to deplete SNAP contingency funds completely and provide reduced SNAP benefits for November 2025.\"",
      "There is roughly $4.6 billion in the contingency fund that can be used to cover November benefit payments, according to Penn. Officials have said fully covering those benefits would require roughly $9 billion. The $4.6 billion will be used to \"cover 50% of eligible households' current allotments,\" Penn said.",
      "More than 42 million Americans rely on SNAP to buy food, and the program ran out of funding over the weekend due to the ongoing shutdown. The federal government funds SNAP by sending money to the states, which oversee food stamp programs for their residents.",
      "Justice Department lawyers separately told the court that the administration will \"fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds\" by providing states with information on Monday that they can use to calculate benefits due to each eligible household.",
      "The administration said it will \"have made the necessary funds available and have authorized the states to begin disbursements\" once the material has been issued.",
      "Still, relief to food-aid recipients may not be immediate. Penn wrote in his declaration that there could be \"payment errors and significant delays\" because of variations among state eligibility systems, which have to be adjusted for the reduced payments.",
      "\"For at least some States, USDA's understanding is that the system changes States must implement to provide the reduced benefit amounts will take anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months,\" he said.",
      "Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy group that is representing a group of municipalities and nonprofit organizations that sued the Trump administration, said in a statement it is \"considering all legal options to secure payment of full funds.\"",
      "\"It shouldn't take a court order to force our president to provide essential nutrition that Congress has made clear needs to be provided. But since that is what it takes, we will continue to use the courts to protect the rights of people,\" Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, pushed the administration to transfer money from other programs to fully fund November benefits, saying the courts \"have made it clear\" that the government has the authority to do so.",
      "\"It is not enough to do the bare minimum \u2014 the administration should stop playing politics with hunger and use all available resources to ensure Americans can put food on the table,\" Klobuchar said in a statement.",
      "The USDA filing came in response to an order issued by Judge John McConnell, who is overseeing the case brought by nonprofits and municipalities in Rhode Island. Last Friday, McConnell ordered the Trump administration to tap into the fund to cover the lapse in SNAP funding caused by the shutdown. The judge gave the government until Monday to file a status update about the distribution of the funds.",
      "In a separate case in Massachusetts, two dozen states and the District of Columbia filed suit to get the administration to use the contingency funds. The judge in that case agreed with their argument that the government is required to use the money and likewise asked for an update by Monday.",
      "The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress had argued that the contingency fund couldn't legally be used to pay SNAP benefits because the underlying appropriation for the program had lapsed. Both judges disagreed with that argument and said the fund must be used to cover part of the shortfall.",
      "\"There is no question that the congressionally approved contingency funds must be used now because of the shutdown,\" McConnell wrote in the written version of his order on Saturday.",
      "He also said the government should \"find the additional funds necessary (beyond the contingency funds) to fully fund the November SNAP payments.\" The $5 billion in the contingency fund does not fully cover the $9 billion needed to pay out benefits for the month, and the administration had argued that calculating partial payments would be \"exceedingly difficult, highly disruptive, and delayed.\"",
      "The judge said the government could choose to issue partial payments instead of finding other sources of funding, but added that \"under no circumstances\" could those payments be delayed beyond Wednesday.",
      "The USDA warned late last month that federal food benefits would not go out to roughly 42 million recipients on Nov. 1 after it declined to tap into contingency funds to keep food stamp payments flowing during the shutdown. The agency pinned the blame for the pause on congressional Democrats for failing to back a GOP-backed stopgap measure that would fund federal agencies.",
      "The shutdown entered its 34th day Monday and is poised to become the longest shutdown in U.S. history if lawmakers fail to reach agreement on a spending measure by late Tuesday.",
      "The initial decision to halt the food aid appeared to be a shift from the USDA's plan for a lapse in federal funding that was issued Sept. 30. The agency said in its plan that multi-year contingency funds could be used for state administrative expenses to ensure states could continue SNAP operations during a shutdown and were also available \"to fund participant benefits\" in the event of a funding lapse.",
      "But the USDA wrote in a memo to states late last month that the reserve funds were \"not legally available to over regular benefits,\" and said the money was meant for priorities like assisting people in disaster areas.",
      "Faced with the looming cutoff of food stamp payments, half the states and the District of Columbia, as well as the municipalities, sought relief from the federal courts. Some states said they would work to continue providing assistance to food-aid beneficiaries. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans receive food stamps.",

      "President Trump weighed in on the closely watched race for New York City mayor in an exclusive interview with 60 Minutes, again suggesting he may withhold federal funding to New York if Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani is elected.",
      "The 34-year-old Queens assemblyman has proposed policies he says address affordability in the city, like free child care, a rent freeze and free buses.",

      "\"He will be President Trump and Mayor Trump \u2026 he's going to take over New York [City] and send tanks down Fifth Avenue,\" Cuomo said.",
      "Trump bristled when O'Donnell read the quote back to him.",

    "story": [
      "Election Day 2025 is almost here, with closely watched races in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia, as well as a redistricting ballot measure in California \u2014 all of which may be viewed as early bellwethers for next year's midterm elections.",
      "Here are the races to watch Tuesday:",
      "New York City",
      "New York City's highly watched mayoral election is a rare three-person race that has attracted the attention of a former New Yorker, President Trump.",
      "Democrats chose Queens state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani as their nominee in the June primary, a democratic socialist whose campaign on affordability has been embraced by the grassroots. New York City is heavily Democratic, so the winner of the party's primary is generally considered the favorite to win in November. Mamdani defeated former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who led polls early in the mayoral race.",
      "Mayor Eric Adams, who was indicted on federal corruption charges in September 2024, which were dropped in the early days of the Trump administration, skipped the June Democratic primary, instead opting to be on the ballot as an independent candidate. But facing a lack of funds and polling in the single digits, Adams dropped out in September and later\u00a0threw his support behind Cuomo.",
      "Cuomo has remained in the race, and although he lagged in raising money earlier in the race, his fundraising improved in October after Adams dropped out. Mamdani, meanwhile, has shattered fundraising expectations, with his campaign saying it reached the $8 million spending cap for New York City matching funds in early September.",
      "A trio of polls released on Oct. 30 showed Mamdani with a commanding lead, though others earlier in the week showed an uptick in support for Cuomo. Early voting has substantially risen compared to 2021. Since Oct. 25, more than 730,000 New Yorkers\u00a0have cast their ballots early, compared to the\u00a0nearly 170,000 who cast their ballots early in 2021.",
      "If Mamdani, 34, wins, he will become the second-youngest mayor in New York City history as well as the first Muslim mayor. He was first elected to the state Assembly in 2020 to represent Astoria, Queens \u2014 one of the most progressive parts of New York City. Mamdani said he will ask New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch to stay on if he wins. She has not yet said whether she will accept.",
      "Cuomo, who was elected New York governor three times before resigning amid sexual misconduct allegations, has tried to paint Mamdani as an elitist, since his father is a Columbia University professor and his mother is a film director. Cuomo's father, Mario Cuomo, was a three-term governor of New York. Andrew Cuomo has also attacked Mamdani for living in a rent-stabilized apartment, even as Cuomo himself moved to his daughter's apartment in New York City before he ran for mayor.",
      "Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee in 2021, is back on the ballot on the GOP line, although some Republicans have called on him to drop out to help Cuomo's candidacy. Mr. Trump has called Sliwa \"not exactly prime time\" and suggested Cuomo would be a better mayor.",
      "All 51 seats of the New York City Council are also on the ballot. There is also a voter initiative on moving local elections to presidential election years.",
      "New Jersey governor",
      "Former GOP New Jersey state Rep. Jack Ciattarelli is making his third run for governor, after losing to Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in 2021. He's facing off against Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who's trying to deliver Democrats a third consecutive term in the governor's mansion, a feat that has not been accomplished by either party since the 1970s.",
      "Sherrill, who flipped a Republican congressional seat in 2018, is running as a moderate and trying to tie Ciattarelli to Mr. Trump. But Ciattarelli is promoting his ties to the president, and accused Sherrill in a September debate of blaming Mr. Trump for everything.",
      "Both Ciattarelli and Sherrill are appealing to voters' concerns about the high cost of living: Ciattarelli is touting a \"Make New Jersey Affordable Again\" pitch, while Sherrill features an \"Affordability Agenda\" on her campaign website.",
      "In September, CBS News reported that a branch of the National Archives released a mostly unredacted version of Sherrill's military records to an ally of Ciattarelli in error. Republicans allied with Ciattarelli have been examining Sherrill's record in the Navy, looking for information about a Naval Academy cheating scandal that implicated over 100 midshipmen. Sherrill was not accused of wrongdoing but did not walk in her graduation, which she said was because she \"didn't turn in some of my classmates.\" Sherrill had an unblemished career in the Navy and, as a midshipman, received a Navy Achievement Medal in 1991 for saving the life of a classmate.",
      "Virginia governor's race",
      "Virginia governors may not run for consecutive terms under state law, so Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin is not on the ballot.",
      "Virginia's gubernatorial election is often seen as a potential referendum on the incumbent president. The president's party often loses the Virginia governor's race, which always falls in the year following a presidential election. In recent history, Terry McAuliffe bucked that trend when he won the election in 2013, a year after President Barack Obama's reelection.",
      "The Trump administration's broadsides against the federal workforce hit Virginia hard, since the state has hundreds of thousands of civilian federal employees and thousands of government contractors and active-duty military. Most are going without pay during the government shutdown that's now stretching into its second month.",
      "Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is running against former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger in the race. Either Spanberger or Earle-Sears will make history as the commonwealth's first female governor, and if Earle-Sears wins, she will become the first female Black governor.",
      "One of Youngkin's paths to victory in 2021 was tying McAuliffe, who was running for a non-consecutive term, to unpopular progressive social issues, which Earle-Sears has tried to replicate in the race against Spanberger. But Spanberger, a former CIA operations officer, has run as a centrist and has touted endorsements from the Virginia Police Benevolent Association, which backed Youngkin in 2021, as well as former Republican Reps. Barbara Comstock and Denver Riggleman.",
      "Mr. Trump has not endorsed Earle-Sears.",
      "Virginia attorney general",
      "Democrat Jay Jones was leading incumbent Jason Miyares in a Washington Post poll in early October in the Virginia attorney general's race, but before the poll was released, text messages Jones had sent in 2022 resurfaced involving fantasies of violence against Todd Gilbert, who was then the Republican speaker of the House of Delegates.",
      "In a statement to CBS News when the messages resurfaced, Jones said he took full responsibility for his actions.",
      "But Republicans, including the president, have called on Jones to drop out. Miyares has seized on the controversy, running ads saying, \"Can you trust Jay Jones to protect your children?\"",
      "In a Washington Post poll conducted from Oct. 16-21 \u2014 after the text messages were released \u2014 Jones and Miyares were statistically tied with 46% each.",
      "California's Proposition 50",
      "Proposition 50 would allow California Democrats to temporarily change the boundaries of U.S. House districts and make them more favorable to the party. The initiative is their response to Mr. Trump's push for Republican-controlled states, like Texas, to change their congressional maps so the GOP has a better chance at holding on to its narrow House majority next year.",
      "California has 52 congressional districts, 43 represented by Democrats and nine by Republicans. The five GOP-led districts targeted under Proposition 50 are District 1, represented by Rep. Doug LaMalfa; District 3, represented by Rep. Kevin Kiley; District 22, represented by Rep. David Valadao; District 41, represented by Rep. Ken Calvert; and District 48, represented by Rep. Darrell Issa.",
      "A recent CBS News poll found that among voters who plan to support Proposition 50, one reason they're doing so is to oppose the Trump administration \u2014 which they also feel generally treats California worse than other states \u2014 and oppose national Republicans.",
      "Prop 50, according to the poll, has 62% support among likely voters.",
      "In total, more than $167.9 million has been raised in support of Prop 50 as of Oct. 28, according to the California Secretary of State's office. According to the Secretary of State's office, Top donors supporting Prop 50 include the House Majority PAC for Proposition 50, with $46 million in contributions, and billionaire investor George Soros' Fund for Policy Reform, with $10 million.",

      "\"China's testing 'em too,\" Mr. Trump told CBS News correspondent Norah O'Donnell in an interview for 60 Minutes. \"You just don't know about it.\"",
      "\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it. You know, we're a open society. We're different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it, because otherwise you people are going to report \u2014 they don't have reporters that going to be writing about it. We do.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made the claim in the interview with O'Donnell that aired just days after the president's own nominee to lead STRATCOM \u2014 the U.S. military command in charge of nuclear weapons \u2014 told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that neither China nor Russia were conducting nuclear explosive tests.",
      "North Korea is the only nation known to have conducted a nuclear detonation since the 1990s. China's last known nuclear explosive test was in 1996.",
      "\"They don't go and tell you about it,\" continued Mr. Trump. \"You know, as powerful as they are, this is a big world. You don't necessarily know where they're testing. They \u2014 they test way under \u2014 underground where people don't know exactly what's happening with the test.",
      "\"You feel a little bit of a vibration. They test and we don't test. We have to test. And Russia did make a little bit of a threat the other day when they said they were gonna do certain forms of a different level of testing. But Russia tests, China \u2014 and China does test, and we're gonna test also.\"",
      "Asked about Mr. Trump's claims on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters during a press briefing that as a \"responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always ... upheld a self-defense nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.\"",
      "She said China hoped the U.S. would \"take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and maintain global strategic balance and stability.\"",
      "What does Trump mean by U.S. resuming nuclear tests?",
      "President Trump has not been clear about whether his stated plans to have the U.S. military test its nuclear arsenal include conducting actual atomic explosions, or just expanded testing of the weapons systems used to deliver nuclear warheads.",
      "U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, downplayed the notion on Sunday that the U.S. was about to start setting off nuclear explosions.",
      "\"I think the tests we're talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions,\" Wright told Fox News. \"These are what we call 'non-critical explosions,' so you're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry and they set up the nuclear explosion.\"",
      "The U.S. is among almost 180 nations that have signed the international Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions.",
      "Along with China and several other nuclear powers, however, the U.S. has never ratified the treaty, a situation that President Vladimir Putin highlighted two years ago when he decided to revoke Moscow's ratification.",

The 2025 shutdown is a day shy of the record set by the 2018-2019 shutdown, which lasted 35 days and took place during President Trump's first administration.",
      "On Sept. 19, the House passed a measure that would have kept the government running through Nov. 21, but the bill failed to make it out of the GOP-led Senate the same day. Since government funding lapsed on Oct. 1, the Senate has held a number of votes, but Republicans have not been able to garner the support they need from Democrats to advance the bill.",
      "Here's the government shutdown by the numbers:",

      "Since just before the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the Senate has voted 13 times on a House-passed resolution to fund the government until Nov. 21. There are 53 Republicans in the Senate, 45 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. When all senators are present, there have been 55 votes in favor of funding the government, five short of the 60 needed to move the bill forward.",
      "The Senate, which has 100 senators, requires only a simple majority to pass most legislation. But the Senate's filibuster rule effectively requires nearly all legislation \u2014 including the continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government \u2014 to reach a 60-vote threshold first. A single senator may delay a bill during debate by invoking a filibuster, which can only be ended if a supermajority of 60 senators vote to end debate.",

      "43: Senate Democrats/independents opposed, plus 1 Republican",

On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. On Oct. 28, 25 states asked a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the Agriculture Department to provide benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for November, including by tapping into a contingency fund to ensure the assistance continues to flow to more than 25 million people living within their borders.",

      "According to the Bipartisan Policy Center's analysis of daily Treasury statements and the center's own workforce estimates, at least 670,000 federal employees are furloughed. The Congressional Budget Office estimated last month that compensation for furloughed workers is roughly $400 million per day.",

      "That nine-figure check likely isn't enough to cover the military's entire payroll. There are around 1.3 million active-duty service members, so the donation comes out to roughly $100 per person.",
      "At least $7 billion: The economic cost of the shutdown",
      "The shutdown could temporarily cut the nation's economic output by billions of dollars as unpaid federal workers curtail their spending and SNAP benefits are paused, leading to a 1-percentage-point GDP drop if the shutdown lasts four weeks and a 2-point dip if it drags on for eight weeks, the Congressional Budget Office said in an Oct. 29 estimate.",
      "Much of that decline will be reversed after the government reopens and the spigot of federal spending turns back on \u2014 but not all of it.

    "summary": "President Trump and both parties are drawing negative ratings for their handling of the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are increasingly voicing concern about the shutdown's impact on the U.S. economy, as a big majority feel Congress isn't even working to try to end it.",
      "There's also increased worry from people over being personally affected, particularly among those with lower incomes, along with that concern about national impact.",
      "Politically, that means no one is \"winning\" overall: Congressional Democrats, Republicans and President Trump are all drawing increasingly negative marks for their handling of it as it has gone on.",
      "Democrats express more concern over the economic impact than Republicans do.",
      "Other governmental functions, including air travel, also draw concern due to the shutdown.",
      "Most disapprove of how all the players involved are handling it, and those views have become a bit more negative over October, the month when the shutdown began.",
      "Looking within the rank-and-file of each party, both congressional Republicans and Democrats draw majority approval from their respective partisans. But the Republican base is even more solidly approving of its delegation than the Democrats are of their own.",
      "Some of that is related to attention: the Democrats who don't approve or are unsure of their party aren't following news of the shutdown as closely. Another may be financial: Rank-and-file Democrats generally express more concern about the shutdown's effects on the economy and on themselves, and the Democrats who do approve are also a little more likely to call their own financial situation good, so they may think of themselves in a better position to weather any impact.",
      "But overall, Congress isn't perceived as even working to end it.",
      "Continued uncertainty in the economy",
      "Americans are especially sensitive because the economy continues to elicit uncertainty.",
      "Ratings of it have been bad for years \u2014 nothing much has changed there \u2014 and expectations for the coming year remain mixed at best. Support for tariffs remains negative as it has been; views of the job market are also negative \u2014 and there's also continuing concern, amid all the recent news about AI investment and the market, that AI will take jobs.",
      "But perhaps most of all, prices are still seen as rising \u2014 a reminder amid a sea of other measures that it is prices, not the rate of change in inflation, that Americans often perceive most immediately.",
      "Few expect prices to come down in the next few months, either.",
      "Those who expect continued higher prices and have a more negative outlook on the economy are particularly concerned about the economic effects of the shutdown.",
      "Politics, parties and the week ahead",
      "One year on from his election victory, most Americans do perceive Mr. Trump as trying to fulfil his campaign promises, even though many say it's a different approach than they expected \u2014 nor do all approve.",
      "And as we're reminded again this week amid more state elections, politics is about choices, not just evaluations.",
      "On the policy front, Mr. Trump and the Republicans' perceived approaches to both economic and immigration policy are today favored over the Democrats' in a straight-up comparison. (A sizable number don't seem to like either, or aren't sure.)",
      "For context, ahead of this week's races and as we head into a midterm election year, there's always the political question of how much of a factor Donald Trump will be in other contests, and whether Democrats also need to move this needle on perceived policy approach to be competitive.",
      "One item drawing attention this week is the New York mayor's race (which most people nationally say they're following, if not very closely.) We asked Democrats nationwide what they thought their party's economic policies should be as it regards socialism and capitalism \u2014 and most Democrats would see their party have a mix of both, but not more of one exclusively.",
      "And another topic in focus this week will be redistricting, where Californians will vote on a redistricting measure, while debates over redrawing lines take place across multiple states.",
      "The American public is not so keen on all that. Most of them think the lines ought to be left alone until 2030, or that more competitive \u2014 not more gerrymandered \u2014 districts ought to be drawn.",
      "Only a quarter of the public (largely, only the strongest partisans) want more districts one party can win.",
      "Specific issues",
      "Meanwhile all of that economic uncertainty \u2014 and mixed approach \u2014 does continue to take its toll on Mr. Trump's ratings on inflation and the economy, specifically. Those, along with the shutdown, continue to weigh on his overall approval, and all have been ticking down over time to their lows for this term. Inflation, in particular, sees him with two-thirds disapproving.",
      "Mr. Trump does get relatively better, if not positive, marks on immigration. That's been the case for a while, in part, because his GOP is so solidly behind him on the matter, including his deportation program, and in part because Americans overall do say border crossings are down under his administration.",
      "The negotiated peace deal between Israel and Hamas has given Mr. Trump a bump in his approval on handling that conflict. He gets relatively higher approval from independents (and Democrats to some extent)\u00a0 on handling the Israel-Hamas conflict than he does overall.",
      "He gets more positive marks on this than he does overall and on the economy, inflation and immigration, more specifically.",
      "Overall, Mr. Trump's approval has ticked down just a point from early October, and remains in the low 40s where it has generally been since mid-summer.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,124 U.S. adults interviewed between October 29-31, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "story": [
      "The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee is challenging a new California law designed to protect Jewish students from discrimination that plaintiff teachers and students say is unconstitutionally vague and violates their free speech rights.",
      "The federal complaint, filed Sunday in San Jose, seeks to invalidate legislation Gov. Gavin Newsom signed last month creating an Office of Civil Rights to help schools identify and prevent antisemitism. State lawmakers approved the legislation as political tensions have flared in the U.S. over Israel's war in Gaza.",
      "The new law, which takes effect Jan. 1, doesn't define antisemitism but gives educators the impression that they could be charged with discrimination \"if they expose their students to ideas, information, and instructional materials that may be considered critical of the State of Israel and the philosophy of Zionism,\" according to the complaint.",
      "Jenin Younes, national legal director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, says the lack of guidance has a chilling effect on speech among educators.",
      "\"They censor themselves very broadly because they don't know what's going to get them into trouble,\" she said.",
      "The lawsuit was filed on behalf of individual teachers and students in California public schools and the Los Angeles Educators for Justice in Palestine.",
      "In the complaint, middle school science teacher Jonah Olson says students in his rural, largely Christian school district often ask him what it means to be Jewish. He responds in part by saying that his Judaism does not include support for the State of Israel, and now he fears that might violate the law.",
      "Parents who are part of the lawsuit say they fear their children will be prevented from learning about differing perspectives on Israel, Palestine and the Middle East.",
      "Students in public schools nationwide are generally protected against discrimination through state, federal and district policies, but supporters of the law say they needed to do more given a surge in harassment and bullying of Jewish and Israeli students.",
      "The Anti-Defamation League, which supports the new law, said 860 antisemitic acts such as harassment, vandalism and assault were reported to the group last year at non-Jewish K-12 schools nationwide. The number is a 26% decrease from the previous year but much higher than the 494 reported in 2022.",

The rulings took a SNAP shortfall off the table in the short term, but three other federal assistance programs are still set to lose funding today, leaving many low-income families scrambling.On Friday, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader John Thune said his stance on the filibuster remains \"unchanged,\" despite President Trump's call for the Senate to invoke the \"nuclear option\" to end the shutdown.In a post on Truth Social late Thursday night, Mr. Trump said the Senate should do away with the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most legislation, which would allow Republicans to fund the government without Democratic votes.But Ryan Wrasse, a spokesman for Thune, said \"Leader Thune's position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged.\" The South Dakota Republican has vowed to uphold the filibuster, saying earlier this month that it has \"been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening to the country.\"",

    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the federal government will \"stop traffic\" if it becomes a safety issue, adding, \"We're not going to let that happen.\"",
    "story": [
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Sunday that airport delays are \"going to get worse\" as the government shutdown threatens to stretch into a fifth week and air traffic controllers were not paid this week.",
      "\"I think the real consequence is, what kind of rolling delays do you have throughout the system, right?\" Duffy said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"We've seen problems at L.A., in Dallas, in D.C., Boston, Atlanta. And so I think it's only going to get worse.\"",
      "Duffy said the federal government will \"stop traffic\" if it becomes a safety issue, adding, \"We're not going to let that happen.\"",
      "Duffy's appearance comes as ground delays were reported at major airports on Sunday, including a four-hour ground delay at Newark Liberty Airport, one of the nation's busiest transit hubs. There were staffing triggers reported at airports in Nashville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; Austin, Texas; Denver, Colorado; Northern California and Newark, New Jersey.",
      "The airport chaos is just weeks ahead of some of the busiest travel days of the year around Thanksgiving.",
      "As the government shutdown has stretched on for more than 30 days, air traffic controllers have gone without several paychecks, although they will get back pay when the shutdown ends. Duffy emphasized Sunday that air traffic controllers are being \"confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid?\"",
      "However, Duffy ruled out the Trump administration finding a way to pay air traffic controllers, similar to how the active-duty military has been paid so far. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned active-duty military personnel won't be paid on Nov. 15.",
      "\"So we're looking for pots of money to pay essential workers, but there's really strict rules around what money we can use and how we can use it, and we have to follow the law,\" Duffy said about paying air traffic controllers. \"And so we were able to fund a central air service, service to more rural communities. We've kept our academy up and running thus far. We don't have a ton of time, a couple more weeks of that funding. But I don't have the resources to do that, and the simple answer is, vote to open the government, negotiate your differences. \"",
      "While Duffy suggested on Oct. 9 that if air traffic controllers didn't show up to work, they could be \"let go,\" he said on Sunday that he doesn't plan on firing controllers.",
      "\"Again, when they're making decisions to feed their families, I'm not going to fire air traffic controllers,\" Duffy said. \"I have, I have loved them and supported them as they're trying to go through this process and it's challenging for them. They need support, they need money, they need a paycheck. They don't need to be fired.\"",
      "The Trump administration has continued to blame Democrats for the shutdown, but Democratic Sen. Mark Warner on Sunday suggested that ending the shutdown is \"going to require the active intervention of the president.\"",
      "\"The notion of at least sitting down to talk about health care, making sure that $6 billion that is set aside for SNAP benefits gets paid out so people don't go hungry and we get the government reopened again,\" Warner said in a separate appearance on \"Face the Nation.\" \"The president of the United States has said when he was not president that it's the responsibility of a president to end shutdowns. He has paid no attention to the shutdown. He's stopped his many international trips; come sit down and let's get this resolved.\"",
      "A CBS News poll released Sunday found that Americans are increasingly voicing concern about the shutdown's impact on the U.S. economy, as a big majority feel Congress isn't even working to try to end it. There's also increased worry from people over being personally affected, particularly among those with lower incomes.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Nov 2025 17:39:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Zohran Mamdani is viewed as the leading candidate to become the next mayor of New York City, even as the contest has divided the normal partisan lines between Republicans and Democrats.",
    "story": [
      "New York \u2014 With just days to go before polls close in New York City's fractious race for mayor, frontrunner Zohran Mamdani spoke Saturday with former President Barack Obama, even as some major Democrats have taken a cautious political approach when it comes to the democratic socialist.",
      "A source familiar confirmed their call, first reported by the New York Times. In a statement to CBS News, a spokeswoman for Mamdani's campaign said the candidate \"appreciated President Obama's words of support and their conversation on the importance of bringing a new kind of politics to our city.\"",
      "Mamdani's win in June over former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo in a crowded mayoral Democratic primary was arguably the most significant progressive primary victory since now-Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated a Democratic incumbent congressman in 2018. The win by Mamdani upended Democratic party politics in a year where the national party has struggled to repair its brand issues after a disastrous 2024 election cycle.",
      "While Mamdani's success so far has brought the 34-year-old politician praise, it has also led to more focused criticism for his record, or lack thereof.",
      "Even after Mamdani's summer primary win, some national Democrats have either been slow to publicly embrace him, or have avoided doing so altogether.",
      "In Tuesday's general election contest, Mamdani is facing off against Cuomo, now running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries waited until Oct. 24, the eve of early voting, to endorse Mamdani. Meanwhile, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, have not endorsed in the race.",
      "At a rally last week with Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mamdani said his opponents, Cuomo and Sliwa, possess \"the playbook of the past.\"",
      "\"New York, our work has only just begun,\" Mamdani said as the rally ended. \"On [Tuesday] November 4th we set ourselves free.\"",
      "And in these final days of the contest, Democrats aren't the only ones making political decisions that don't follow normal party lines.",
      "In an interview earlier this week with CBS News, Republican Rep. Nick Langworthy of New York, a former state GOP chair, said of Cuomo that \"no one was a fiercer critic of his time as governor than I was.\"",
      "\"We fought him tooth and nail every step of the way,\" said Langworthy, who is supporting Cuomo for mayor. \"But he would be a far superior choice for the people of New York than Zohran Mamdani.\"",
      "Langworthy also expressed concern about the implications of a Mamdani victory, saying Mamdani's policies would become \"contagious around the country if he has a platform to talk to vast sums of people.\"",
      "The national impact of the race isn't lost on either major party given what a Mamdani victory could mean for control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms, where Republicans are attempting to defend a narrow majority. Whichever party holds the House will likely play a major role in how Washington functions in the final two years of President Trump's term.",
      "Moderate Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York backed Cuomo late last month, saying in a social media post, \"I'm a Democratic Capitalist, not a Democratic Socialist. I endorse Andrew Cuomo. I can not back a declared socialist with a thin resume to run the most complex city in America.\"",
      "As Democrats continue to face questions about how the party can recover and win back voters, Mamdani's run for mayor may provide a telling guide of sorts for the kind of authentic messaging and grassroots campaigning that the left has struggled to cultivate on a national stage outside of Sanders' 2016 and 2020 presidential runs.",
      "Speaking at the late October Mamdani rally, Sanders said \"a victory here in New York will give hope and inspiration to people throughout our country and throughout the world.\"",
      "\"That is what this election is about. And that is why Donald Trump is paying attention to this election,\" Sanders said.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Oct 2025 13:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" the study's co-author said.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have long puzzled over the origins of a mysterious dinosaur excavated in the 1940s: Was it a young T. rex or another type of dinosaur?",
      "At first, researchers had only a tyrannosaur skull to go by, making it hard to tell if it belonged to a child or adult. Another skull and skeleton nicknamed Jane added to the debate, but didn't settle the controversy.",
      "Now, a research team says new evidence resolves the case. The latest clue comes from a complete skeleton \u2014 first uncovered in Montana in 2006 \u2014 that scientists say identifies the mystery reptile as its own species and not a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" said study co-author Lindsay Zanno with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina State University.",
      "Growth rings within the bones found in Montana's Hell Creek Formation told scientists the new dinosaur was an adult about half the size of a fully fledged T. rex. From growth comparisons to other reptiles like crocodiles, they also found that the major differences between the creature's skull and an adult T. rex's \u2014 changes in bone structure, nerve patterns and sinuses \u2014 were unlikely to form from simply going through puberty.",
      "Signs pointed to a dinosaur that's a distant T. rex cousin known as Nanotyrannus lancensis, the researchers reported in a study published Thursday in the journal Nature, calling it a rival species.",
      "\"Nanotyrannus is a small-bodied predator designed for speed. It's very agile and has long powerful arms [that are] larger than those of the T. rex,\"\u00a0Zanno told Nature.",
      "There's now \"more support and evidence than there ever has been\" that this T. rex relative could exist, said Holly Woodward, a fossil bone expert from Oklahoma State University who had no role in the new study. But she's not yet convinced that the other mystery skeletons like Jane are something new.",
      "Case of mistaken identity",
      "Other independent scientists also said the debate isn't over. The new skeleton is indeed an adult, but it could be a sister species to T. rex and not a distant relative, said vertebrate paleontologist Thomas Carr of Carthage College.",
      "There are similarities between the shape of T. rex's skull and the mystery specimens that keep him from switching camps.",
      "\"I don't think this study settles everything,\" he said.",
      "Resolving this case of mistaken identity is important to understanding how T. rex grew up, said study co-author James Napoli with Stony Brook University. Another big question is whether T. rex was the main predator prowling toward the end of the age of dinosaurs 67 million years ago \u2014 or whether a tinier, but still mighty predator also roamed.",
      "\"I suspect that these two species would have occasionally come into conflict, as predators tend to do, but the long legs of Nanotyrannus, and its small size, suggest that it mostly hunted smaller, faster prey than Tyrannosaurus,\" Napoli told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The new skeleton is dubbed \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" because it was found intertwined with the bones of a Triceratops, and is currently on display at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.",
      "The study comes just days after new research suggested dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike. The evidence came from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that's been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "In June, scientists identified a smaller-bodied ancestor of the T. rex that roamed the plains of Mongolia as a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",

    "story": [
      "Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center \u2014\u00a0China launched its Shenzhou-21 spacecraft on Friday, carrying a new three-person crew to man the country's Tiangong space station on a mission focused on scientific research. The replacement crew includes China's youngest-ever taikonaut \u2014 as China's space program calls its astronauts \u2014   and, for the first time since Beijing launched its program, it will also include live mammals.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 and its crew blasted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China atop a Long March-2F rocket just before midnight on Friday, or about 11 a.m. Eastern.",
      "The taikonauts on board \u2014 Zhang Lu, Wu Fei, and Zhang Hongzhang \u2014 will rotate in so the trio currently on board the Chinese space station from the Shenzhou-20 mission, which launched on April 24, can come back home after their six-months in space. The exact date of their return has yet to be announced.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 crew are scheduled to conduct a total of 27 scientific and applied research projects during their mission, focusing on multiple fields including space life sciences, biotechnology, space medicine, space materials science, microgravity fluid physics and combustion and new space technologies, according to information provided by the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).",
      "Along with the taikonauts, Shenzhou-21 is carrying four mice \u2014 two females and two males \u2014 the first live mammals ever carried by China into space. Two previous missions to the Tiangong station carried live fish.",
      "The taikonauts will study the effects of microgravity and confined space conditions on the behavioral patterns of mice.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 crew, with Lu as their commander are scheduled to live aboard the space station for approximately six months, just like the crew they are replacing.",
      "It won't be the first visit to the station for Lu, who previously served on the Shenzhou-15 mission.",
      "The other two crew members are making their first spaceflight, and Flight Engineer Wu, born in 1993, will be the youngest taikonaut ever sent into space by his nation.",
      "\"I feel incomparably lucky,\" he told reporters Thursday. \"Being able to integrate my personal dreams into the glorious journey of China's space program is the greatest fortune this era has bestowed upon me.\"",
      "Crowds gathered around the Jiuquan launch site on Friday ahead of the countdown, and a man who identified himself to CBS News only as Mr. Zhao said he was \"very excited\" to be there with his 7-year-old son, \"hoping to plant the seed of a space dream into his heart.\"",
      "China's growing \"space dream\"",
      "China has ramped up its space program unilaterally since being excluded from the International Space Station project \u2014   largely over the U.S. government's concerns about the Chinese military's full control over its program \u2014   to achieve its \"space dream\" under President Xi Jinping.",
      "It has manned the Tiangong station since 2021, and there are now plans to bring the first non-Chinese crewmember aboard the facility.",
      "China will arrange for one Pakistani national to undertake a short-term space mission in the future, the CMSA has said, following the signing of a cooperation agreement between the two countries in February.",
      "The process to select a Pakistani national for training has already begun, along with planning for training programs and to prepare logistical support for Pakistanis under consideration.",
      "Following the selection process, two Pakistani nationals will travel to China to train alongside Chinese taikonauts for future missions, the CMSA said.",
      "CMSA spokesperson Zhang Jingbo said during a news conference this week ahead of the Shenzhou-21 launch that China would welcome international partners to participate in missions aboard its space station.",
      "The work done on China's space station coincides with and often compliments the nation's efforts to be the first nation to land a person on the moon's surface in more than 40 years. Chinese officials have made it a public goal to land taikonauts on the moon's surface by 2030, and eventually to build a lunar base.",
      "China has already landed unmanned probes on the moon, including the first ever to land and collect samples from the celestial body's far side just last year.",
      "\"Overall, the research and construction has been running smoothly, with China aiming to achieve the goal of landing Chinese astronauts on the moon before 2030,\" Zhang said this week ahead of the looming Shenzhou launch, indicating that the CMSA remains on track to meet its lunar goals.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 14:05:38 -0400",
    "summary": "Elon Musk's partisan stances and foray into politics in recent years have dented the electric vehicle maker's business, Yale researchers say.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk is widely recognized as an electric car pioneer. Yet the Tesla CEO has also single-handedly chilled the automaker's sales, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at Yale University.",
      "Public controversy over Musk's role as leader of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as his acquisition of social media platform Twitter (now known as X) in 2022, reduced Tesla's sales by up to 1.2 million vehicles over a three-year period, the researchers estimated in a working paper published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research that aimed to measure the effect of Musk's politics on Tesla's business.",
      "\"This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be,\" the researchers wrote. \"We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business.\"",
      "Musk's adverse impact on Tesla's business became visible starting in mid-2022, with sales especially dropping in Democratic-leaning states and counties, the study further concludes.",
      "\"Musk's actions antagonized his most loyal customer base, for, as we show, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to purchase a Tesla,\" the researchers said.",
      "The study's lead author is energy and environmental economist Kenneth Gillingham, who is the senior associate dean of academic affairs at the Yale School of the Environment. His research focuses on consumer behavior and policy in the transportation and energy sectors.",
      "Musk announced in May that he was pulling back from DOGE, which the Trump administration formed to shrink the federal government and cut spending.",
      "Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the paper's findings.",
      "Musk's foray into politics and emergence as a prominent adviser to President Trump early in his second term raised the entrepreneur's visibility but alienated some potential Tesla customers, Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, previously told CBS News.",
      "Tesla last week reported third-quarter earnings of $1.4 billion, down 37% from the year-ago period, citing higher costs and tariff-related headwinds. Tesla's vehicle sales fell 1% in 2024 despite a 7% increase in EV sales across the car industry.",
      "Tesla's stock fell 27% in February, a period of time that coincided with Mr. Trump's first full month in the White House. But the shares have rebounded and are now up roughly 14% on the year, with investors betting on growth in the company's fledgling robotaxi business, autonomous driving technology and plans to build AI-powered humanoid robots.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\"\u00a0Wedbush Securities technology analyst Dan Ives said in a recent report, adding that he expects the Trump administration to fast-track such initiatives.",
      "Another measure of Musk's perceived value to Tesla is the enormous pay package shareholders are preparing to vote on for the executive. That total package could be worth up to $1 trillion in a decade, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history.",
      "For Musk to earn the full amount, Tesla would have to hit certain profitability and production targets, as well as reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion \u2014 nearly six times its current value \u2014 in 10 years.",
      "Robyn Denholm, chairman of Tesla's board of directors, is urging shareholders to approve Musk's proposed compensation. \"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor,\"\u00a0 Denholm said in the letter.",

    "summary": "Air traffic controllers missed their first full paycheck last week as the government shutdown approaches a record length.",
    "story": [
      "Travelers heading to airports this week may face more flight disruptions as air traffic controllers missed their first full paycheck late last month and with the\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0on the cusp of becoming the longest in U.S. history.",
      "Almost 6,000 U.S. flights were delayed on Sunday, Nov. 2, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking service. Newark Liberty Airport on Sunday had a four-hour ground delay, while staffing triggers \u2014 a Federal Aviation Administration alert system to indicate an air traffic control facility is understaffed \u2014 were reported at airports including Nashville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; Austin, Texas; and Denver, Colorado.",
      "Airport delays are \"going to get worse,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday.",
      "The shutdown on Tuesday is set to become the longest in history, when it would eclipse the 2018-2019 funding lapse. In the meantime, air traffic controllers and workers for the Transportation Security Administration \u2014 both considered essential workers \u2014 are required to show up at their jobs even though their pay is halted until lawmakers agree on a new deal to fund the federal government.",
      "The longer the shutdown stretches on, the more likely it is to cause flight delays and snarls at security checkpoints, Katy Nastro, a travel expert at Going.com, told CBS News.",
      "\"We're over a month into this shutdown, and in the last few days is really when we've started to see that the seams are ripping,\" Nastro said. \"It's not just in air traffic control staffing triggers, but we're seeing TSA lines hit the 3-4 hour mark.\"",
      "Some Houston travelers faced waits of about an hour to get through airport security lines this weekend, according to CBS affiliate KHOU. Only two out of five security checkpoints are open at Houston's Bush airport, the station noted, while the Houston Chronicle\u00a0reported\u00a0that some people faced waits of three hours to get through the airport's security.",
      "Thanksgiving outlook for air travel",
      "If the shutdown drags longer into November, the real pain point could come during Thanksgiving week, when a record number of Americans are expected to travel for the holidays, Nastro said.",
      "\"I would be cautious if this continues into Thanksgiving \u2014 we're likely to see multiple days of 3 million-plus travelers,\" she said. \"At that point, we would be coming into almost two months of a shutdown.\"",
      "Some holiday travelers might be better off driving to their destinations given the potential for flight disruptions, Nastro added. Booking early morning flights, such as those that depart between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m., can also help minimize delays because these departures are more likely to be on time than flights that are scheduled later in the day, travel data shows.",
      "Still, experts said that air safety isn't an issue, given that the FAA will slow flights if there aren't enough air traffic controllers directing flights. That was reiterated by Duffy on Sunday, who told \"Face the Nation\" that the federal government will \"stop traffic\" if it becomes a safety issue.",
      "\"We're not going to let that happen,\" Duffy added.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Nov 2025 20:09:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Republican Jack Ciattarelli has a shot at winning 2025 New Jersey governor's race against Mikie Sherrill, after Democrats have held the office for two terms.",
    "story": [
      "New Jersey Republican Jack Ciattarelli may have a chance in the race against Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill to win back the governor's office from Democrats after a surprisingly close election four years ago.",
      "But a national political environment that may serve as a referendum on Republican President Trump's first year in office could close that window for the GOP.",
      "Mr. Trump has supported Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, and backed him as he faced a competitive primary, even going as far as to hold a telephone rally for him recently. Ciattarelli is running for governor for a third time, after falling short in a surprisingly close race against Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in 2021.",
      "Sherrill says Ciattarelli has shown \"zero signs of standing up\" to Trump",
      "On the Democratic side, Sherrill, who represents New Jersey's 11th District in Congress, has a favorable national political environment, but is contending with potential political fatigue within the state about her party's back-to-back terms controlling the governor's office. Sherrill has been adamant about tying Ciattarelli to President Trump and focusing her campaign on affordability.",
      "\"He's shown zero signs of standing up to this president. In fact, the president himself called Jack 100% MAGA,\" Sherrill said during a debate.",
      "Ciattarelli faults Democrats for being \"out of touch and ruining our state\"",
      "Ciattarelli has faulted Sherrill for relying on generalities and platitudes while also centering his argument for change on New Jersey Democrats' lengthy tenure in control of state government.",
      "\"Trenton Democrats: out of touch and ruining our state. They push offshore wind while our electric bills skyrocket. They raise tolls and fees but haven't fixed our roads and they care more about pronouns than property taxes,\" Ciattarelli said in one campaign advertisement. \"Had enough? Me too.\"",
      "Sherrill was not the most progressive candidate in this year's New Jersey primary race, and she may also have to contend with the Democratic brand issues that have haunted national Democrats in the wake of 2024, due to her career in Congress.",
      "Democrats' winning streak in the state could also give Republicans an anti-incumbency argument, and it wasn't long ago that a Republican led the state. From the 1970s onwards, neither party has been able to win the New Jersey governor's race three straight times.",
      "The final stretch",
      "Sherrill's campaign received a boost days before Election Day from former President Barack Obama, who joined her at a rally Saturday.",
      "\"You have a candidate worth being excited about,\" he told the crowd. Referring to Sherrill as an \"inspiration,\" the former president told the crowd that \"we need that inspiration \u2014 because let's face it, our country and our politics are in a pretty dark place right now.\"",
      "He said of Mr. Trump, \"Every day, this White House offers up a fresh batch of lawlessness and carelessness and mean spiritedness, and just plain old craziness.\"",
      "On the Republican side, Mr. Trump held a tele-rally for Ciattarelli on the eve of the election,\u00a0as Republicans look to return a GOP candidate to the governor's office for the first time since Chris Christie led the state.",
      "Back in 2021, Ciattarelli narrowly lost the New Jersey governor's race to incumbent Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. The race, occurring early in Democratic President Joe Biden's tenure, was far closer than was expected, given the state's more reliable Democratic lean, with Murphy winning out over Ciattarelli by around three points.",
      "In a close race, New Jersey's Latino voters may also play an influential role for either candidate. Democrats have a voter registration advantage over Republicans in the state, although their numbers have dipped as of late. Statistics show that since the start of the year the number of registered Democrats in New Jersey has fallen by more than 12,000 but remains above 2.5 million in the state. Republican voter registration has grown by close to 29,000 but still trails Democrats by more than 855,000, with around 1.67 million registered to the GOP. Unaffiliated voters still make up a larger share of the state's voters than the GOP and only narrowly trail the Democratic party's numbers.",

      "\"If it could happen to me, small-town Matt McCaffery, it can happen to you,\" said the former chairman of the Upper Merion Republican Committee.",
      "The hoax call was just one of nearly 2,000 records of threats to local officials identified over the past decade in new data from the Impact Project and the Public Service Alliance. CBS News received exclusive access to the dataset, dubbed the \"Security Map,\" ahead of its public release. It compiles more than a decade of cases from court filings, news reports and academic databases.",
      "The findings show that violent threats targeting public officials have surged across all levels of government and political parties. At the same time, the threat landscape has \"fundamentally changed,\" according to researchers.",
      "\"We're seeing not only an increase in volume, but also an expansion in who's being targeted,\" Abby Andr\u00e9, executive director and cofounder of the Impact Project, said in a statement. \"A decade ago, threats were concentrated at the federal level. Today, school board members, county clerks, and even mail carriers face similar dangers.\"",
      "While federal officials remain the most frequent targets, threats against local officials are growing and now make up roughly one-third of all documented threats, researchers found.",
      "\"That's what we see in the map. The threats facing public servants \u2014 they span the entire country,\" said Isa Ulloa, founder of the Public Service Alliance.",
      "Threats were recorded in every state, with roughly a quarter of incidents concentrated in the seven battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan. And for every physical threat, researchers found nine verbal or online threats \u2014 fueling what they call a dangerous chilling effect. Both Democrats and Republicans were targeted at almost equal rates, with 58% of reviewed threats affecting Democrats.",

      "\"Who wants to run for public office if your family's being put in threat, even at the local level where most of the decisions in your life are being made? If they're too scared to do it, we're not gonna have anybody run,\" McCaffery said.",

      "It also brings the risk that the party could slip further into the doldrums that hurt its brand with voters around the country in 2024.",
      "The Nov. 4 election for governor of Virginia \u2014 pitting former Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger against Republican Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears \u2014 will serve as one of Democrats' first major opportunities to rebound from the setbacks they suffered in the 2024 presidential election, when they also lost control of the Senate and failed to retake control of the House.",
      "Spanberger rallies with Obama",
      "Spanberger\u00a0held a rally with former President Barack Obama on the weekend before Election Day. President Trump, however, has had little involvement as Earle-Sears looks to succeed Gov. Glenn Youngkin and become the first GOP candidate since 1997 to succeed a fellow Republican as governor of the commonwealth.",
      "Mr. Trump has not formally endorsed Earle-Sears. In a telephone rally on the eve of the election, the president attacked Spanberger and encouraged people to vote for Republicans up and down the ballot, but he didn't mention Earle-Sears by name.",
      "Under Virginia law, a governor cannot serve for two consecutive terms, which has resulted in open races for the office without the advantage of incumbency. Regardless of who wins between the two in November, Spanberger or Earle-Sears will become the Commonwealth's first ever female governor.",
      "The Trump administration's impact on the federal workforce and the ongoing shutdown may also be on voters' minds in the coming days, as they get their say in a contest that historically has been fraught with prospect of serving as a rebuke to the incumbent in the White House.",
      "\"It is because of the trade wars and the retaliatory tariff policies and the attack on Virginia, our economy and our people, that we recognize the possibility of November 4, that we recognize how important it is to have a governor who will stand up for Virginians,\" Spanberger said at a recent event.",
      "State of the race",
      "Spanberger headed into the start of early voting in September with a clear advantage in the contest. That momentum threatened to be impacted, however, by a controversy that has made its way through Virginia politics. She has faced difficult political questions in attempting to respond to violent text messages, authored by Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee in the Virginia Attorney General's race, about a Republican leader.",
      "\"I'm asking my opponent to please, ask him to get out of the race,\" Earle-Sears said during the lone debate between the two candidates. \"Have some political courage. What you have done is you are taking political calculations about your future as governor. Well as governor, you have to make hard choices, and that means telling Jay Jones to leave the race.\"",
      "Spanberger has denounced Jones' words, which were made public after the start of early voting, where he wrote in the past about a fantasy hypothetical situation involving the shooting of a Virginia state House Republican leader.",
      "Jones however has not left the race, and is still running as the Democratic attorney general candidate in the Nov. 4 election.",
      "That dynamic has provided Virginia Republicans with an issue against Democrats that could alienate moderates and independents at a time where concerns about political violence are rampant. Virginia Democrats are also mounting a last-minute effort to redraw congressional districts in the state to help the left counter Mr. Trump's successful push in a series of red states to undertake an overhaul of district maps in hopes of helping Republicans hold on to the House in next year's midterm elections.",

    "summary": "After his recent remarks about resuming nuclear testing, President Trump told \"60 Minutes\" \"we're the only country that doesn't test.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's comments about restarting weapons tests are not likely to lead to mushroom-cloud explosions over the New Mexico desert or seismic shaking underground in Nevada, according to the nation's foremost experts.",
      "But questions about\u00a0what kind of testing Mr. Trump does have in mind have been rippling through the nuclear nonproliferation community. In an interview on \"60 Minutes,\" the president elaborated on remarks he made last week announcing a plan to resume U.S. testing of nuclear weapons. \"Other countries are testing,\" he said. \"We're the only country that doesn't test, and I don't want to be the only country that doesn't test.\"",
      "The president did not clarify what type of testing he envisions. The U.S. has not conducted above-ground nuclear tests since the 1960s, and the last underground detonation of a nuclear device in the U.S. occurred in 1992. That test, at the Nevada Test Site, was the final nuclear weapons test before the current testing moratorium was put in place.",
      "Asked if he was announcing that after more than 30 years, the United States planned to start detonating nuclear weapons for testing, Mr. Trump replied that \"we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes.\"",
      "\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,\" he said. \"You know, we're an open society. We're different. We talk about it... We're going to test, because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea's been testing. Pakistan's been testing.\"",
      "On Monday, CIA Director John Ratcliffe posted a brief statement on his personal X account that said President Trump \"is right,\" and showed images related to public U.S. assessments from 2019 by the Defense Intelligence Agency that Russia and China were carrying out low-yield nuclear tests.",
      "Low-yield tests involve very small nuclear explosions that can help researchers study a weapon's efficacy, but are generally banned under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The U.S., China and Russia are signatories to that treaty, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1996, but have not ratified it.",
      "There was no mention in Ratcliffe's post of actions by Pakistan or North Korea.",
      "The CIA declined to comment beyond the director's post.",
      "The White House referred a question about clarifying the president's comments on nuclear testing to what Mr. Trump has said.",
      "Nine countries \u2014 the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, India and Israel \u2014 currently possess a combined total of more than 12,000 nuclear warheads, with the U.S. and Russia accounting for nearly 90% of the global stockpile, according to the Federation of American Scientists.",
      "The U.S. intelligence community's 2025 worldwide threat assessment said Russia's nuclear stockpile was the world's \"largest and most diverse,\" noting that it, in combination with an array of delivery systems, \"could inflict catastrophic damage to the Homeland.\"",
      "The assessment also said China \"remains intent\" on expanding its nuclear posture.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters during a press briefing Monday that as a \"responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always ... upheld a self-defense nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.\" And a senior Pakistani security official told CBS News, \"Pakistan was not the first to carry out nuclear tests and will not be the first to resume nuclear tests.\"",
      "George Perkovich, a senior fellow in the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace's Nuclear Policy Program, said experts on nuclear weapons testing believe the president was referencing \"subcritical\" tests, rather than tests that register on the Richter Scale or yield a visible display.",
      "\"These don't produce an explosion. They can be done in laboratories,\" Perkovich said.",
      "Subcritical nuclear tests involve perfecting the final steps in triggering a chain reaction in the lab, and then using computing power to conduct simulations of an actual detonation.",
      "\"Because he kept insisting that everyone else is doing it, I am assuming he means those types of tests that don't involve explosions,\" Perkovich said. \"If these countries have been doing [explosive] tests, then the president just released very highly classified intelligence.\"",
      "Sigfried Hecker, who served as director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1986 to 1997, said the Russians, Chinese and the U.S. all perform subcritical experiments. But another type of nuclear test that the U.S. stopped conducting, called Hydronuclear experiments, involves a tiny amount of explosive \u2013 not enough to be detected by seismic monitors.",
      "\"These are where you barely tickle the bomb, and you get small nuclear reactions,\" Hecker said. \"No mushroom cloud. You're just doing enough to produce a reaction in the plutonium. No risk, no hazard, easily contained. No safety issues.\"",
      "Hecker said he did not know if the president might be referring to that type of test.",
      "\"Whether the president and his advisers are steeped in all of this, I don't know,\" he said.",
      "Samantha Vinograd, a national security expert and CBS News consultant who served as assistant secretary for counterterrorism and threat prevention at the US Department of Homeland Security said \"there are various kinds of tests that the president could be referring to so there are currently a lot of hypotheticals.\"",
      "The White House referred a question about clarifying the president's comments about nuclear testing to what Mr. Trump has said.",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright tried to clarify Mr. Trump's nuclear comments in an appearance on Fox News, saying the president was referencing \"systems tests.\"",
      "\"These are not nuclear explosions,\" Wright said. \"These are what we call noncritical explosions, so we're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "As energy secretary, Wright is helping oversee the modernization of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, which he said the president has made a \"critical priority.\"",

      "\"The United States has conducted 1,054 tests, and Russia has conducted 715. China only conducted 47 nuclear tests, both above ground and underground,\" Williams said on Saturday.",
      "\"This asymmetry in test data has been a sore spot for Chinese officials who felt disadvantaged by arms control agreements, such as the Partial Test Ban Treaty. If one country returns to nuclear testing, others are likely to follow \u2014 in which case, China would stand to gain the most in terms of weapons design and warhead information, further contributing to its nuclear buildup,\" said Williams.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut said she \"found no credible evidence\" that protests in the city grew out of control before the president federalized the troops.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Oregon on Sunday barred President Trump's administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, until at least Friday, saying she \"found no credible evidence\" that protests in the city grew out of control before the president federalized the troops earlier this fall.",
      "The city and state sued in September to block the deployment.",
      "It's the latest development in weeks of legal back-and-forth in Portland, Chicago and other U.S. cities as the Trump administration has moved to federalize and deploy the National Guard in city streets to quell protests.",
      "The ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, an appointee of Mr. Trump, followed a three-day trial in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law.",
      "In a 16-page filing late Sunday, Immergut said she would issue a final order on Friday due to the voluminous evidence presented at trial, including more than 750 exhibits.",
      "The Trump administration on Monday appealed the ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "The purpose of the deployment, according to the Trump administration, is to protect federal personnel and property where protests are occurring or likely to occur. Legal experts said that a higher appellate court order that remains in effect would have barred troops from being deployed anyway.",
      "Immergut wrote that most violence appeared to be between protesters and counter-protesters and found no evidence of \"significant damage\" to the immigration facility at the center of the protests.",
      "\"Based on the trial testimony, this Court finds no credible evidence that during the approximately two months before the President's federalization order, protests grew out of control or involved more than isolated and sporadic instances of violent conduct that resulted in no serious injuries to federal personnel,\" she wrote.",
      "The complex case comes as Democratic cities targeted by Mr. Trump for military involvement \u2014 including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue \u2014 seek to push back. They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states' sovereignty. The administration argues that it needs the troops because it has been unable to enforce the law with regular forces \u2014 one of the conditions set by Congress for calling up troops.",
      "Immergut issued two orders in early October that blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. She previously found that Mr. Trump had failed to show that he met the legal requirements for mobilizing the National Guard. She described his assessment of Portland, which Mr. Trump has called \"war-ravaged\" with \"fires all over the place,\" as \"simply untethered to the facts.\"",
      "One of Immergut's orders was paused Oct. 20 by a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit. But late Tuesday, the appeals court vacated that decision and said it would rehear the matter before an 11-judge panel. Until the larger panel rehears the case, the appeals court's initial order from early October \u2014 under which the National Guard is federalized but not deployed \u2014 remains in effect.",
      "During the Portland trial, witnesses including local police and federal officials were questioned about the law enforcement response to the nightly protests at the city's ICE building. The demonstrations peaked in June, when Portland police declared one a riot. The demonstrations typically drew a couple dozen people in the weeks leading up to Mr. Trump's National Guard announcement.",
      "The Trump administration said it has had to shuffle federal agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the Portland protests, which it has characterized as a \"rebellion\" or \"danger of rebellion\" \u2014 another one of the conditions for calling up troops under federal law.",
      "Federal officials working in the region testified about staffing shortages and requests for more personnel that have yet to be fulfilled. Among them was an official with the Federal Protective Service, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that provides security at federal buildings, whom the judge allowed to be sworn in as a witness under his initials, R.C., due to safety concerns.",
      "R.C., who said he would be one of the most knowledgeable people in DHS about security at Portland's ICE building, testified that a troop deployment would alleviate the strain on staff. When cross-examined, however, he said he did not request troops and that he was not consulted on the matter. He also said he was \"surprised\" to learn about the deployment and that he did not agree with statements about Portland burning down.",
      "Attorneys for Portland and Oregon said city police have been able to respond to the protests. After the police department declared a riot on June 14, it changed its strategy to direct officers to intervene when person and property crime occurs, and crowd numbers have largely diminished since the end of that month, police officials testified.",
      "Another Federal Protective Service official whom the judge also allowed to testify under his initials said protesters have at times been violent, damaged the facility and acted aggressively toward officers working at the building.",
      "The ICE building closed for three weeks over the summer due to property damage, according to court documents and testimony. The regional field office director for ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, Cammilla Wamsley, said her employees worked from another building during that period. The plaintiffs argued that was evidence that they were able to continue their work functions.",
      "Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Scott Kennedy said that \"without minimizing or condoning offensive expressions\" or certain instances of criminal conduct, \"none of these incidents suggest ... that there's a rebellion or an inability to execute the laws.\"",

Yet the move still leaves participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in the dark on exactly when they will get the funds.",
      "In a\u00a0declaration\u00a0submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said $4.6 billion in contingency USDA funds will be used to cover 50% of SNAP recipients' benefits.",
      "However, the USDA declaration said that procedural changes U.S. states must make in order to issue partial benefits could take \"anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months.\"",
      "It's unclear how long it will take some states to issue the benefits since this is an unprecedented situation, said Victoria Negus, a senior economic justice advocate at the nonprofit Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. The timing will depend on how fast states can adjust to issue\u00a0partial SNAP benefits and relay that information to EBT vendors, she added.",
      "\"I would hope that states will move heaven and Earth to get SNAP benefits flowing as quickly as possible,\" she said.",
      "Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey recently\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0that it could take days for SNAP cards to be loaded up again if the funds were to be released for use.",

      "In May of 2024, however, a hit-and-run accident required multiple surgeries and left the 64-year-old Lennox unable to work. Without a stable source of income, Lennox said she relies on SNAP, disability and Social Security retirement benefits to pay the bills. She plans to return to work as soon as she's physically capable, saying she needs a job to help cover her medical expenses.",
      "\"Because it was a hit-and-run, I have all these medical bills to pay,\" she said.",
      "The $192 she gets in monthly food stamps helps her buy fresh produce at the farmer's market, Lennox said.",
      "After learning that SNAP funding was under threat because of the shutdown, Lennox said she pulled back on buying food by conserving the remaining food stamps on her electronic benefits card. She currently has $240 in food stamp payments, but plans on visiting a local food bank to make ends meet.",

When he logged into his state's marketplace, he was dismayed to find out that his current plan's monthly premium is set to rise to $2,600 a month next year, up from $2,200 a month in 2025.",
      "That doesn't include higher cost-sharing for his family, such as a larger out-of-pocket maximum for 2026, meaning he's facing higher costs on both ends for the same coverage for himself, his wife and their 11-year-old son.",
      "\"I already pay a significant portion of my income for this insurance,\" he noted. \"What the hell am I paying for at this point?\"",
      "Roughly 24 million Americans get their health insurance through an ACA plan.",
      "The 26% premium hike for so-called ACA silver plans reflects what insurers are charging consumers buying plans via the marketplaces. Millions of Americans currently pay below the ACA's market rates because of\u00a0premium tax credits, KFF said. Those credits are set to expire at the end of 2025 \u2014 a looming deadline that has contributed to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, as Democratic lawmakers push for Republicans to agree to an extension.",
      "The roughly 22 million people who currently rely on the premium tax credits could see their ACA plan costs more than double in 2026, KFF estimates.",
      "Even those who don't qualify for the credits, as in Tolbert's case, face sharply higher health insurance costs next year, KFF said. The main factors behind that increase are increased demand for costly treatments, such as\u00a0GLP-1 drugs\u00a0for weight loss; higher prices from hospitals and other providers; and insurer projections that millions of people could drop their coverage next year when the premium tax credits expire, said Cynthia Cox, vice president and director of KFF's program on the ACA.",
      "\"The biggest factor is that health care costs for everybody are going up,\" Cox told CBS News. \"That's driven by the underlying health care costs, hospital costs, doctor visits and drugs.\"",
      "\"The last time we saw premium increases like this was 2017, going into 2018, when we were talking about ACA 'repeal and replace,'\" a period during President Trump's first term when he\u00a0sought to roll back the Affordable Care Act, she added.",
      "Higher ACA insurance costs could spur some people to go without coverage, said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and a former official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Biden administration.",
      "\"Some will have to go to skimpier plans,\" she noted in a recent conference call organized by left-leaning economic advocacy group Groundwork Collaborative to discuss the ACA premium tax credit expiration. \"Deductibles are going up as well ... [consumers] will be heading into next year with bigger out-of-pocket expenses.\"",
      "For some people, going without health coverage might seem like a financial necessity in the face of sharply higher ACA plan costs in 2026, but ultimately could prove ruinous, KFF's Cox said. \"It's like gambling with your health and your wallet,\" she added. \"You don't know what will happen.\"",
      "In the meantime, Tolbert expressed concern that ACA insurance may become unaffordable for his family if premiums continue to increase at the same pace. That could push him or his wife, who currently stays at home with their son, to look for a job with a bigger employer to secure health insurance, he noted.",
      "\"At this rate, I have one to three more years before I can no longer afford a plan,\" he said.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, who was nominated to the bench by President Trump, said he expects the trial to last no more than two days \"because it's the simplest case in the world.\"",
    "story": [
      "Throwing a sandwich at a federal agent turned Sean Charles Dunn into a symbol of resistance against President Trump's law-enforcement surge in the nation's capital. This week, federal prosecutors are trying to persuade a jury of fellow Washington, D.C., residents that Dunn simply broke the law.",
      "That could be a tough sell for the government in a city that has chafed against Mr. Trump's federal takeover, which is entering its third month. A grand jury refused to indict Dunn on a felony assault count before U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro's office opted to charge him instead with a misdemeanor.",
      "Securing a trial conviction could prove to be equally challenging for Justice Department prosecutors in Washington, where murals glorifying Dunn's sandwich toss popped up virtually overnight.",
      "Before jury selection started Monday, the judge presiding over Dunn's trial seemed to acknowledge how unusual it is for a case like this to be heard in federal court. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, who was nominated to the bench by Mr. Trump, said he expects the trial to last no more than two days \"because it's the simplest case in the world.\"",
      "A video that went viral on social media captured Dunn hurling a \"submarine-style sandwich\" at a Customs and Border Protection agent outside a nightclub on the night of Aug. 10. That same weekend, Mr. Trump announced his deployment of hundreds of National Guard troops and federal agents to assist with police patrols in Washington.",
      "When Dunn approached a group of CBP agents who were in front of a club hosting a \"Latin Night,\" he called them \"fascists\" and \"racists\" and chanted \"shame\" toward them. An observer's video captured Dunn throwing a sandwich at an agent's chest.",
      "\"Why are you here? I don't want you in my city!\" Dunn shouted, according to police.",
      "Dunn ran away but was apprehended. He was released from custody but rearrested when a team of armed federal agents in riot gear raided his home. The White House posted a highly produced \"propaganda\" video of the raid on its official X account, Dunn's lawyers said. They noted that Dunn had offered to surrender to police before the raid.",
      "Dunn worked as an international affairs specialist in the Justice Department's criminal division. After Dunn's arrest, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced his firing in a social media post that referred to him as \"an example of the Deep State.\"",
      "Pirro, the U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., also issued a\u00a0video announcing the arrest, saying her office is \"going to back the police to the hilt. So there, stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else.\"",
      "Before trial, Dunn's lawyers urged the judge to dismiss the case for what they allege is a vindictive and selective prosecution.\u00a0They argued\u00a0that the posts by Bondi and the White House prove Dunn was impermissibly targeted for his political speech.",
      "Julia Gatto, one of Dunn's lawyers, questioned why Mr. Trump's Justice Department is prosecuting Dunn after the Republican president issued pardons and ordered the dismissal of assault cases stemming from a mob's attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "\"It's an obvious answer,\" Gatto said during a hearing last Thursday. \"The answer is they have different politics. And that's selective prosecution.\"",
      "Prosecutors countered that Dunn's political expressions don't make him immune from prosecution for assaulting the agent.",
      "\"The defendant is being prosecuted for the obvious reason that he was recorded throwing a sandwich at a federal officer at point-blank range,\"\u00a0they wrote.",
      "Dunn is charged with assaulting, resisting, opposing, impeding, intimidating and interfering with a federal officer. Dozens of Mr. Trump's supporters who stormed the Capitol were convicted of felonies for assaulting or interfering with police during the Jan. 6 attack. Trump pardoned or ordered the dismissal of charges for all of them.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. Department of Agriculture told a federal court that it will tap into a contingency fund to allow states to issue partial November benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the government shutdown.",
      "In a declaration submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said the administration \"intends to deplete SNAP contingency funds completely and provide reduced SNAP benefits for November 2025.\"",
      "There is roughly $4.6 billion in the contingency fund that can be used to cover November benefit payments, according to Penn. Officials have said fully covering those benefits would require roughly $9 billion. The $4.6 billion will be used to \"cover 50% of eligible households' current allotments,\" Penn said.",
      "More than 42 million Americans rely on SNAP to buy food, and the program ran out of funding over the weekend due to the ongoing shutdown. The federal government funds SNAP by sending money to the states, which oversee food stamp programs for their residents.",
      "Justice Department lawyers separately told the court that the administration will \"fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds\" by providing states with information on Monday that they can use to calculate benefits due to each eligible household.",
      "The administration said it will \"have made the necessary funds available and have authorized the states to begin disbursements\" once the material has been issued.",
      "Still, relief to food-aid recipients may not be immediate. Penn wrote in his declaration that there could be \"payment errors and significant delays\" because of variations among state eligibility systems, which have to be adjusted for the reduced payments.",
      "\"For at least some States, USDA's understanding is that the system changes States must implement to provide the reduced benefit amounts will take anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months,\" he said.",
      "Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy group that is representing a group of municipalities and nonprofit organizations that sued the Trump administration, said in a statement it is \"considering all legal options to secure payment of full funds.\"",
      "\"It shouldn't take a court order to force our president to provide essential nutrition that Congress has made clear needs to be provided. But since that is what it takes, we will continue to use the courts to protect the rights of people,\" Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, pushed the administration to transfer money from other programs to fully fund November benefits, saying the courts \"have made it clear\" that the government has the authority to do so.",
      "\"It is not enough to do the bare minimum \u2014 the administration should stop playing politics with hunger and use all available resources to ensure Americans can put food on the table,\" Klobuchar said in a statement.",
      "The USDA filing came in response to an order issued by Judge John McConnell, who is overseeing the case brought by nonprofits and municipalities in Rhode Island. Last Friday, McConnell ordered the Trump administration to tap into the fund to cover the lapse in SNAP funding caused by the shutdown. The judge gave the government until Monday to file a status update about the distribution of the funds.",
      "In a separate case in Massachusetts, two dozen states and the District of Columbia filed suit to get the administration to use the contingency funds. The judge in that case agreed with their argument that the government is required to use the money and likewise asked for an update by Monday.",
      "The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress had argued that the contingency fund couldn't legally be used to pay SNAP benefits because the underlying appropriation for the program had lapsed. Both judges disagreed with that argument and said the fund must be used to cover part of the shortfall.",
      "\"There is no question that the congressionally approved contingency funds must be used now because of the shutdown,\" McConnell wrote in the written version of his order on Saturday.",
      "He also said the government should \"find the additional funds necessary (beyond the contingency funds) to fully fund the November SNAP payments.\" The $5 billion in the contingency fund does not fully cover the $9 billion needed to pay out benefits for the month, and the administration had argued that calculating partial payments would be \"exceedingly difficult, highly disruptive, and delayed.\"",
      "The judge said the government could choose to issue partial payments instead of finding other sources of funding, but added that \"under no circumstances\" could those payments be delayed beyond Wednesday.",
      "The USDA warned late last month that federal food benefits would not go out to roughly 42 million recipients on Nov. 1 after it declined to tap into contingency funds to keep food stamp payments flowing during the shutdown. The agency pinned the blame for the pause on congressional Democrats for failing to back a GOP-backed stopgap measure that would fund federal agencies.",
      "The shutdown entered its 34th day Monday and is poised to become the longest shutdown in U.S. history if lawmakers fail to reach agreement on a spending measure by late Tuesday.",
      "The initial decision to halt the food aid appeared to be a shift from the USDA's plan for a lapse in federal funding that was issued Sept. 30. The agency said in its plan that multi-year contingency funds could be used for state administrative expenses to ensure states could continue SNAP operations during a shutdown and were also available \"to fund participant benefits\" in the event of a funding lapse.",
      "But the USDA wrote in a memo to states late last month that the reserve funds were \"not legally available to over regular benefits,\" and said the money was meant for priorities like assisting people in disaster areas.",
      "Faced with the looming cutoff of food stamp payments, half the states and the District of Columbia, as well as the municipalities, sought relief from the federal courts. Some states said they would work to continue providing assistance to food-aid beneficiaries. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans receive food stamps.",

      "Photos and video taken at the scene appeared to show the Ferris wheel \u2014 at the annual Harvest Festival in New Roads, some 40 miles northwest of Baton Rouge \u2014 paused mid-ride with one of the baskets that seat riders tipped upside down.",
      "Witnesses told CBS affiliate\u00a0WAFB that the girls were ejected from the basket while the Ferris wheel was rotating. Two girls fell at least 20 feet onto a steel platform below, while a third clung to the basket, which was suspended about 15 feet in the air.",
      "\"As it was going around, it was just like, stuck at an angle and they flipped out of it,\" Ronald Brasseaux, who witnessed the incident, said. Brasseaux told WAFB that he'd felt unsafe while riding the same Ferris wheel the previous day. \"They need to take this thing down,\" he told the station.",
      "An investigation into what went wrong is underway at the State Fire Marshal's Office, which is required to perform safety checks on rides and attractions like the ones at New Roads' Harvest Festival, according to WAFB. The office told the station in the aftermath of Saturday's incident that only the Ferris wheel and one other nearby ride were closed to the public.",
      "Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff Rene' Thibodeaux, whose office responded to the incident, told WAFB that it happened around 12 p.m.. The Harvest Festival takes place annually in New Roads and \"is dedicated to supporting the local agriculture-based community,\" according to its website.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 15:08:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the federal government will \"stop traffic\" if it becomes a safety issue, adding, \"We're not going to let that happen.\"",
    "story": [
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Sunday that airport delays are \"going to get worse\" as the government shutdown threatens to stretch into a fifth week and air traffic controllers were not paid this week.",
      "\"I think the real consequence is, what kind of rolling delays do you have throughout the system, right?\" Duffy said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"We've seen problems at L.A., in Dallas, in D.C., Boston, Atlanta. And so I think it's only going to get worse.\"",
      "Duffy said the federal government will \"stop traffic\" if it becomes a safety issue, adding, \"We're not going to let that happen.\"",
      "Duffy's appearance comes as ground delays were reported at major airports on Sunday, including a four-hour ground delay at Newark Liberty Airport, one of the nation's busiest transit hubs. There were staffing triggers reported at airports in Nashville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; Austin, Texas; Denver, Colorado; Northern California and Newark, New Jersey.",
      "The airport chaos is just weeks ahead of some of the busiest travel days of the year around Thanksgiving.",
      "As the government shutdown has stretched on for more than 30 days, air traffic controllers have gone without several paychecks, although they will get back pay when the shutdown ends. Duffy emphasized Sunday that air traffic controllers are being \"confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid?\"",
      "However, Duffy ruled out the Trump administration finding a way to pay air traffic controllers, similar to how the active-duty military has been paid so far. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned active-duty military personnel won't be paid on Nov. 15.",
      "\"So we're looking for pots of money to pay essential workers, but there's really strict rules around what money we can use and how we can use it, and we have to follow the law,\" Duffy said about paying air traffic controllers. \"And so we were able to fund a central air service, service to more rural communities. We've kept our academy up and running thus far. We don't have a ton of time, a couple more weeks of that funding. But I don't have the resources to do that, and the simple answer is, vote to open the government, negotiate your differences. \"",
      "While Duffy suggested on Oct. 9 that if air traffic controllers didn't show up to work, they could be \"let go,\" he said on Sunday that he doesn't plan on firing controllers.",
      "\"Again, when they're making decisions to feed their families, I'm not going to fire air traffic controllers,\" Duffy said. \"I have, I have loved them and supported them as they're trying to go through this process and it's challenging for them. They need support, they need money, they need a paycheck. They don't need to be fired.\"",
      "The Trump administration has continued to blame Democrats for the shutdown, but Democratic Sen. Mark Warner on Sunday suggested that ending the shutdown is \"going to require the active intervention of the president.\"",
      "\"The notion of at least sitting down to talk about health care, making sure that $6 billion that is set aside for SNAP benefits gets paid out so people don't go hungry and we get the government reopened again,\" Warner said in a separate appearance on \"Face the Nation.\" \"The president of the United States has said when he was not president that it's the responsibility of a president to end shutdowns. He has paid no attention to the shutdown. He's stopped his many international trips; come sit down and let's get this resolved.\"",
      "A CBS News poll released Sunday found that Americans are increasingly voicing concern about the shutdown's impact on the U.S. economy, as a big majority feel Congress isn't even working to try to end it. There's also increased worry from people over being personally affected, particularly among those with lower incomes.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Nov 2025 17:39:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Zohran Mamdani is viewed as the leading candidate to become the next mayor of New York City, even as the contest has divided the normal partisan lines between Republicans and Democrats.",
    "story": [
      "New York \u2014 With just days to go before polls close in New York City's fractious race for mayor, frontrunner Zohran Mamdani spoke Saturday with former President Barack Obama, even as some major Democrats have taken a cautious political approach when it comes to the democratic socialist.",
      "A source familiar confirmed their call, first reported by the New York Times. In a statement to CBS News, a spokeswoman for Mamdani's campaign said the candidate \"appreciated President Obama's words of support and their conversation on the importance of bringing a new kind of politics to our city.\"",
      "Mamdani's win in June over former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo in a crowded mayoral Democratic primary was arguably the most significant progressive primary victory since now-Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated a Democratic incumbent congressman in 2018. The win by Mamdani upended Democratic party politics in a year where the national party has struggled to repair its brand issues after a disastrous 2024 election cycle.",
      "While Mamdani's success so far has brought the 34-year-old politician praise, it has also led to more focused criticism for his record, or lack thereof.",
      "Even after Mamdani's summer primary win, some national Democrats have either been slow to publicly embrace him, or have avoided doing so altogether.",
      "In Tuesday's general election contest, Mamdani is facing off against Cuomo, now running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries waited until Oct. 24, the eve of early voting, to endorse Mamdani. Meanwhile, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, have not endorsed in the race.",
      "At a rally last week with Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mamdani said his opponents, Cuomo and Sliwa, possess \"the playbook of the past.\"",
      "\"New York, our work has only just begun,\" Mamdani said as the rally ended. \"On [Tuesday] November 4th we set ourselves free.\"",
      "And in these final days of the contest, Democrats aren't the only ones making political decisions that don't follow normal party lines.",
      "In an interview earlier this week with CBS News, Republican Rep. Nick Langworthy of New York, a former state GOP chair, said of Cuomo that \"no one was a fiercer critic of his time as governor than I was.\"",
      "\"We fought him tooth and nail every step of the way,\" said Langworthy, who is supporting Cuomo for mayor. \"But he would be a far superior choice for the people of New York than Zohran Mamdani.\"",
      "Langworthy also expressed concern about the implications of a Mamdani victory, saying Mamdani's policies would become \"contagious around the country if he has a platform to talk to vast sums of people.\"",
      "The national impact of the race isn't lost on either major party given what a Mamdani victory could mean for control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms, where Republicans are attempting to defend a narrow majority. Whichever party holds the House will likely play a major role in how Washington functions in the final two years of President Trump's term.",
      "Moderate Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York backed Cuomo late last month, saying in a social media post, \"I'm a Democratic Capitalist, not a Democratic Socialist. I endorse Andrew Cuomo. I can not back a declared socialist with a thin resume to run the most complex city in America.\"",
      "As Democrats continue to face questions about how the party can recover and win back voters, Mamdani's run for mayor may provide a telling guide of sorts for the kind of authentic messaging and grassroots campaigning that the left has struggled to cultivate on a national stage outside of Sanders' 2016 and 2020 presidential runs.",
      "Speaking at the late October Mamdani rally, Sanders said \"a victory here in New York will give hope and inspiration to people throughout our country and throughout the world.\"",
      "\"That is what this election is about. And that is why Donald Trump is paying attention to this election,\" Sanders said.",

    "summary": "Visa predicts Americans will spend an average of $736 on holiday gifts in 2025, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to open their wallets this holiday season, increasing their gift budgets even as a slowing job market and stubborn inflation weigh on consumer confidence, according to a new analysis from Visa Business and Economic Insights.",
      "U.S. consumers are forecast to spend an average of $736 each on holiday gifts, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year, Visa said in its 2025 holiday spending outlook.",
      "Inflation partly explains this year's projected sales growth, with the Consumer Price Index showing that prices rose 3% on an annual basis in September. But Americans are also planning on upping their gifting, especially older consumers, with baby boomers forecasted to boost their holiday spending by 21%, the study found.",
      "The robust spending outlook highlights consumers' resilience, even as confidence surveys paint a more cautious picture.",
      "\"We are clearly seeing consumers spend in a far better, more robust way than what we're seeing in the consumer sentiment and confidence data,\" Michael Brown, a principal U.S. economist at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Visa tapped retail sales data from the U.S. Department of Commerce \u2014 excluding automobiles, gas stations and restaurants \u2014 for its holiday spending projections.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, changes in consumer spending corresponded more closely with consumer sentiment, Visa's analysis shows. But that link has weakened in recent years. In April, for example, when consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since the pandemic, real consumer spending increased 3.1% on an annual basis, the Visa report points out.",
      "Consumers continue to express dour views about the economy, with sentiment falling for a third consecutive month\u00a0in October due to worries about a weaker job market and rising inflation, according to the latest University of Michigan sentiment index. Another measure from the Conference Board, a nonprofit group, also shows confidence in the economy edged down slightly this month.",
      "What explains the disconnect? Steady wage gains have kept spending aloft, with many Americans continuing to shop despite higher prices because their take-home pay remains solid, Brown said.",
      "Other holiday outlook forecasts from groups like Abode for Business and polling firm\u00a0Gallup point to the same conclusion as Visa's: Americans are planning to dish out billions on holiday gifts, travel and food despite their gloomy views on the economy.",
      "Still, some are exercising caution in their purchasing, Brown said, noting that low- and middle-income households will face the biggest tradeoffs this holiday season. Higher costs for essentials such as groceries are leaving them with less room for discretionary spending, he added.",
      "\"There is absolutely an undercurrent of trying to make the dollar stretch, given some of those necessities are costing a bit more this season,\" Brown said.",

      "The Maldives began implementing a smoking ban Saturday on anyone born on or after January 2007, becoming the only nation with a generational prohibition on tobacco, the Health Ministry said.",
      "The move, initiated by President Mohamed Muizzu earlier this year -- will \"protect public health and promote a tobacco-free generation,\" the ministry said.",
      "\"Under the new provision, individuals born on or after January 1, 2007 are prohibited from purchasing, using, or being sold tobacco products within the Maldives,\" it added.",
      "\"The ban applies to all forms of tobacco, and retailers are required to verify age prior to sale.\"",
      "The measure also applies to visitors to the nation of 1,191 tiny coral islets scattered some 500 miles across the equator and known for its luxury tourism.",
      "The ministry said it also maintains a comprehensive ban on the import, sale, distribution, possession, and use of electronic cigarettes and vaping products and it applies to all individuals regardless of age.",
      "Selling tobacco products to an underage person carries a penalty of 50,000 rufiyaa ($3,200), while using vape devices carries a fine of 5,000 rufiyaa ($320).",

    "summary": "Hurricane Melissa was the most powerful hurricane to lash the island since record-keeping began 174 years ago.",
    "story": [
      "The Jamaican government on Monday said at least 32 deaths have been attributed to\u00a0Hurricane Melissa, with Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon saying there are possibly eight more unconfirmed deaths.",
      "With its tourism season just a month away, officials are rushing to rebuild from the\u00a0catastrophic Category 5 storm\u00a0that shredded the island's western region. Before the hurricane hit on Oct. 28, the government expected Jamaica's tourism industry to grow by 7% this winter season and was preparing to welcome an estimated 4.3 million visitors.",
      "Now, officials are scrambling to repair hotels and clear debris in the western half of the island in the hope of securing tourist dollars at a moment when they're needed most.",
      "Melissa was the most powerful hurricane to lash the island since record-keeping began 174 years ago. The National Hurricane Center said the storm initially came ashore near New Hope, on the southwestern coast of Jamaica.",
      "Before the storm, the Jamaican government said it had done all it could to prepare. \"There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,\" Prime Minister Andrew Holness had said.",
      "\"We are still doing our assessments, but most of the damage was in the northwest and southwest,\" said Christopher Jarrett, who leads the Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association.",
      "He noted that the popular Negril area in Westmoreland was spared major damage.",
      "All international airports in Jamaica have reopened and are receiving commercial flights. But almost a week after\u00a0one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record\u00a0struck the western end of Jamaica, tourism officials were still trying to get a true picture of the damage to the sector \u2014 a mainstay of the island's economy.",
      "Jarrett said the lobby group that represents private hotels and attractions on the island is still unable to reach many of its members, especially in the western parish of Hanover, as communication and electricity services were down.",
      "\"Every individual member who was affected is doing everything to get back up and running,\" he said.",
      "In recent days, Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett said he expected Jamaica's tourism sector to be back to normal by Dec. 15, the start of the island's peak tourism season.",
      "\"It's doable for some and not for others,\" Jarrett said of the timeline, pointing out that the larger hotel chains would be able to recover quicker.",
      "Jarrett, who operates the family-owned Altamont Court Hotel that has properties in Kingston and Montego Bay, said only one property in Montego Bay sustained roof damage and that repairs were underway.",
      "Despite the disruption to the important tourism sector, Jarrett said he doesn't expect the economic fallout to be significant. He said many hotels in the capital of Kingston and in the northern coastal town of Ocho Rios were gaining business from the influx of aid workers and volunteers in the hurricane's aftermath.",
      "\"Right now, we're giving discounts, between 25% and 50%, and some [hotels] are giving complimentary stays as well,\" Jarrett said.",
      "Tourism is Jamaica's main source of foreign exchange earnings, contributing a combined 30% to gross domestic product directly and indirectly. It employs an estimated 175,000 people and is a major economic driver for other sectors in the Jamaican economy, such as construction, banking and finance, utilities and agriculture.",
      "The disruption to the tourism sector is also affecting many providers of goods and services.",
      "\"With some of the hotels closed and most of the tourists gone, many of us are left without work. This storm didn't just destroy buildings; it shattered jobs and incomes for many of us and our families,\" said Patricia Mighten, who works in the western parish of Hanover as a hotel housekeeper.",
      "Desrine Smith, a craft vendor who plies her trade in the resort town of Falmouth in the northwestern parish of Trelawny, echoed those sentiments.",
      "\"Going days without tourists coming to buy anything means no sales and no money. We survive on daily earnings, and now everything is uncertain,\" she said. \"The hurricane has impacted our pockets hard.\"",
      "Crews are still trying to access 25 isolated areas in western Jamaica as helicopters continue to drop food for them. Nearly half of all power customers remain without electricity.",

    "summary": "The 13th century Torre dei Conti in Rome partially collapsed during renovation work. One worker who was extracted from the rubble died soon after, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "Rome\u00a0\u2014 Firefighters late Monday finally managed to extract a worker from beneath rubble inside a medieval tower that partially collapsed during renovation work in the heart of Italy's capital, but the joy of that rescue proved short-lived.",
      "The man didn't withstand the trauma he suffered and died soon thereafter.",
      "\"I express deep sorrow and condolences, on behalf of myself and the government, for the tragic loss of Octay Stroici, the worker who was killed in the collapse of the Torre dei Conti in Rome,\" Italy's Premier Giorgia Meloni said in a statement after midnight. \"We are close to his family and colleagues at this time of unspeakable suffering.\"",
      "Images broadcast on local television had shown a trio of rescuers loading the man onto a telescopic aerial ladder, then descending and wheeling him on a stretcher into an ambulance. His state wasn't immediately clear, but Adriano De Acutis, chief commander of Rome's firefighters, said on state television channel RAI that he was conscious.",
      "\"Since the conditions seem serious, they will now evaluate him and he was immediately taken to the hospital,\" Lamberto Giannini, prefect of Rome, told reporters at the time.",
      "Rescuers had faced a complex task as they tried to use a first-floor window to get near the trapped worker. But they were forced to retreat in a cloud of debris as the structure continued to give way. Another approach on two ladders was also aborted, and a drone sent up in their stead.",
      "As dusk approached, firefighters lifted on a crane used giant tubes to suck rubble out of the second-floor window. They continued the work late into the night.",
      "\"The operation lasted a long time because every time a part of the body was freed, there was additional rubble that covered it,\" Giannini said.",
      "Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri had told reporters earlier that the worker was speaking to rescuers and using an oxygen mask. He added that rescuers were working with extreme caution in \"a very delicate extraction operation\" to avoid further collapses.",
      "Three workers were rescued unharmed after the initial midday incident, said firefighter spokesperson Luca Cari. Another worker, age 64, was hospitalized in critical condition; RAI reported he was conscious and had suffered a broken nose.",
      "No firefighters were injured in the ensuing operation.",
      "The Torre dei Conti was built in the 13th century by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his family. The tower was damaged in a 1349 earthquake and suffered subsequent collapses in the 17th century.",
      "Hundreds of tourists had gathered to watch as firefighters used a mobile ladder to bring a stretcher to the upper level of the Torre dei Conti during the first rescue attempt. Suddenly, another part of the structure crumbled, sending up a cloud of debris and forcing firefighters to quickly descend.",
      "The first collapse struck the central buttress of the structure's southern side, and caused an underlying sloped base to fall. The second damaged part of the stairwell and roof, cultural heritage officials said in a statement.",
      "Queen Paglinawan, 27, was attending to a client in a gelato parlor next door when the tower first started coming apart.",
      "\"I was working and then I heard something falling, and then I saw the tower collapse in a diagonal way,\u2033 Paglinawan, 27, told The Associated Press as yet more rubble crashed down.",
      "The tower, which has been closed since 2007, is undergoing a 6.9 million euro (nearly $8 million) restoration that includes conservation work, the installation of electrical, lighting and water systems and a new museum installation dedicated to the most recent phases of the Roman Imperial Forum, officials said.",
      "Before the latest phase was started in June, structural surveys and load tests were carried out \"to verify the stability of the structure, which confirmed the safety conditions necessary\" to proceed with work, including asbestos removal, officials said. The current work, carried out at a cost of 400,000 euros ($460,000), was just about complete.",
      "Italian prosecutors arrived at the scene as the rescue operation was underway, and were investigating possible charges for negligent disaster and negligent injuries, Italian media reported. It is common in Italy for investigations to begin while an event is ongoing and before possible suspects are identified.",
      "German student Viktoria Braeu had just finished a tour at the nearby Colosseum and was passing by the scene during the firefighters' initial rescue attempt.",
      "\"And then we were like, 'It's probably not long until it's going to go down,' and then it just started erupting,'\" said Braeu, 18.",
      "Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister Meloni had shared her hopes for a successful rescue.",
      "\"My thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to the person currently fighting for his life under the rubble and to his family, for whom I sincerely hope that this tragedy will have a positive outcome,\" Meloni said in a statement.",
      "\"I would like to thank all the law enforcement officers, firefighters, and rescue workers who are intervening with courage, professionalism, and dedication in this extremely difficult situation.\"",

      "North Korea is the only nation known to have conducted a nuclear detonation since the 1990s. China's last known nuclear explosive test was in 1996.",
      "Pakistan's last known nuclear explosive test was in 1998, and it since then its government says it has observed a \"unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing,\" despite not being a signatory to the international Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).",
      "The U.S. is among almost 180 nations that have signed the CTBT, which bans all atomic test explosions.",

      "Asked about Mr. Trump's claims on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters during a press briefing that as a \"responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always ... upheld a self-defense nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.\"",
      "She said China hoped the U.S. would \"take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and maintain global strategic balance and stability.\"",
      "There was no immediate reaction from Moscow to Mr. Trump's claim that Russia has also conducted secret nuclear tests.",

      "\"It resembles a spy operation. By whom, I don't know. I have a few ideas but I'm going to be careful\" about speculating, he said. Last month, several drones were spotted above another Belgian military base near the German border. The operators were not identified.",
      "Russia has been blamed for a number of airspace violations, notably in Estonia and Poland, in recent months. But the perpetrators of a series of mysterious drone flights in Denmark and Germany have been harder to pin down.",
      "A late evening drone sighting at Berlin's Brandenburg airport on Friday suspended flights for nearly two hours. It was not clear who was responsible. On Sunday, some flights were delayed at Bremen Airport in Germany after a drone was spotted in the area, but police did not suspect espionage in that case, local media reported.",
      "Francken ruled out that the weekend drone flights in Belgium might have been a prank. He said that the security services' \"jammer didn't work because they tested our radio frequency, and they changed frequency. They have their own frequencies. An amateur doesn't know how to do that.\"",
      "Asked why it wasn't possible to shoot the drones down, Francken said: \"When they're over a military base we can shoot the drones down. When it's nearby, we have to be very careful because they can fall on a house, a car, a person. That's completely different.\"",
      "This can pose legal challenges too. \"It's not entirely clear. We have to clarify the legal grounds,\" he said.",
      "Francken lamented that Belgium \"is chasing after the threat\" posed by such drone flights. \"We should have bought air defense systems five or 10 years ago,\" that can deal with drones, he said.",
      "A series of mysterious drone overflights have been spotted in the airspace of European Union member countries in recent weeks.",
      "In October, a Belgian official familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News that drones had been sighted over Elsenborn military base, and said that the number of drones was under investigation. Belgium is a member of the U.S.-led NATO military alliance but the source told CBS News that only Belgian forces are stationed at the Elsenborn base.",
      "Also last month, Germany's Munich Airport shut down twice in less than 24 hours after multiple drone sightings. An airport in Lithuania also later closed for several hours overnight Saturday due to a possible sighting of balloons.",
      "In September, the Danish defense ministry said drones were \"observed at several of Danish defense facilities\" during an overnight period. Those drone sightings\u00a0come after several drones were spotted in the Nordic country days earlier, with some of them temporarily shutting down Danish airports.",
      "Drones have also been spotted near military sites in the U.S. this year. The head of NORAD and NORTHCOM \u2014 the military commands that defend North America \u2014 told Congress earlier this year that some of the mysterious drones seen flying inside the United States may indeed have been spying.",

      "Young British children are more likely than their big siblings to adopt American phrases, a new survey of teachers in the U.K. has found.",
      "More than 50% of the teachers at elementary level schools who were surveyed said they had heard their students use the words \"trash\" or \"garbage,\" rather than the more typical British terms \"rubbish\" or \"waste.\"",
      "The word \"candy,\" rather than \"sweets,\" was cited as the second-most imported word, as reported by 40% of the teachers surveyed.",
      "The survey, conducted by Teacher Tapp for The Times of London, involved more than 10,000 educators, and the findings suggest the shift to Americanisms is particularly prevalent among younger children. The survey found that teachers of high school aged children reported fewer examples of such U.S. vocabulary slipping into their pupils' speech.",
      "The terms \"apartment,\" rather than \"flat,\" \"diaper\" instead of \"nappy\" and \"movie theater\" instead of \"cinema\" are some of the other swaps reported by teachers.",
      "A linguist interviewed by The Times, however, sought to reassured concerned parents that trends in children's language change quickly and frequently. Professor Lynne Murphy, who teaches British and American English at the University of Sussex, told the newspaper that academics tend to rely on trends in adult language for that reason.",
      "\"We adults don't talk like we did when we were four, or eight or 12, and neither will today's children,\" Murphy added.",
      "She also noted that while U.S. vocabulary may be imported to Britain via online media, the same thing can happen in the other direction. In 2019, CBS News reported that some parents had noticed their children developing British accents after watching the \"Peppa Pig,\" the British children's program with a remarkable worldwide reach.",

      "\"Every now and then they slip into conversation. It's usually because they have been watching American YouTube videos or cartoons,\" she added.",
      "Frank Young blamed the \"fragmentation\" of childrens' TV programs in the U.K. for his nine-year-old son's occasional lapses into U.S. parlance.",

    "story": [
      "Jerusalem\u00a0\u2014 Palestinian militants have so far released the remains of 20 hostages that were held in Gaza for the past two years as part of the ceasefire agreement in the Israel-Hamas war. But the process of returning the bodies of the last eight remaining hostages, as called for under the U.S. peace plan, is progressing slowly, with militants releasing just one or two bodies every few days.",
      "Hamas says it has not been able to reach all of the remains because they are buried under rubble of buildings destroyed by Israel's two-year offensive in the Gaza Strip. Israel's government and the families of the hostages have accused Hamas of dragging its feet, however, and officials have threatened to resume military operations or withhold humanitarian aid if all of the remains are not returned.",
      "In the most recent release, Hamas returned the bodies on Sunday of three troops killed during its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on southern Israel. Israel's military confirmed that the remains belonged to hostages Omer Neutra, an Israeli American dual national, Oz Daniel and Col. Assaf Hamami.",
      "In return, Israel has so far released the bodies of 270 Palestinians back to Gaza, including 45 handed over on Monday, according to Palestinian media. Israel has not provided any details on their identities, and it is unclear if they were killed in Israel during the attack on Oct. 7, or if they were Palestinian detainees who died in Israeli custody, or bodies that were taken from Gaza by Israeli troops during the war.",
      "Health officials in Gaza have struggled to identify the bodies without access to DNA kits.",
      "Who are the 8 hostages whose remains have not been returned?",
      "Itay Chen was an Israeli American originally from Netanya, in central Israel, who was abducted along with two other members of his tank battalion: Daniel Peretz, who also died, and Matan Angrest, who survived and was released from captivity on Monday. Chen loved basketball and studying human biology, according to the Israeli Hostages Families Forum.",
      "Chen was killed on Oct. 7 and his body was taken to Gaza. His father, Ruby Chen, has met frequently with American leaders about bringing all of the hostages back to Israel, including the remains of the dead. Itay Chen is survived by his parents and two brothers.",
      "Meny Godard was a professional soccer player before enlisting in the Israeli military and serving in the 1973 Mideast War, according to Kibbutz Be'eri. He served in a variety of different positions in the kibbutz, including at its printing press.",
      "On the morning of Oct. 7, Godard and his wife, Ayelet, were forced out of their home after it was set on fire. She hid in the bushes for a number of hours before militants discovered her and killed her. She was able to tell her children that Meny had been killed before she died. The family held a double funeral for the couple. They are survived by four children and six grandchildren.",
      "Hadar Goldin's remains are the only ones that have been held in Gaza since before the war. The Israeli soldier was killed on Aug. 1, 2014, two hours after a ceasefire took effect ending that year's war between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Goldin is survived by his parents and three siblings, including a twin. He had proposed to his fianc\u00e9e before he was killed. Earlier this year, Goldin's family marked 4,000 days since his body was taken. The military retrieved the body of another soldier who was killed in the 2014 war earlier this year.",
      "Ran Gvili, who served in an elite police unit, was recovering from a broken shoulder he sustained in a motorcycle accident but rushed to assist fellow officers on Oct. 7. After helping people escape from the Nova music festival, he was killed fighting at another location and his body was taken to Gaza. The military confirmed his death four months later. He is survived by his parents and a sister.",
      "Joshua Mollel was a Tanzanian agricultural student who arrived at kibbutz Nahal Oz only 19 days before Oct. 7. He had finished agricultural college in Tanzania and hoped to gain experience in Israel he could apply at home. Two smaller Palestinian militant groups posted graphic footage on social media showing their fighters stabbing and shooting Mollel, according to a Human Rights Watch report. He is survived by two parents and four siblings in Tanzania.",
      "Dror Or was a father of three who managed the dairy farm on Kibbutz Be'eri and was an expert cheesemaker. On Oct. 7, the family was hiding in their safe room when militants set the house on fire. Dror and his wife, Yonat, were killed. Two of their children were abducted and released during the November 2023 ceasefire.",
      "Sudthisak Rinthalak was an agricultural worker from Thailand who had been employed at Kibbutz Be'eri. According to media reports, Rinthalak was divorced and had been working in Israel since 2017. A total of 31 workers from Thailand were kidnapped on Oct. 7, the largest group of foreigners to be held in captivity. Most of them were released in the first and second ceasefires. Rinthalak is the last of three Thai hostages whose bodies were held in Gaza. The Thai Foreign Ministry has said in addition to the hostages, 46 Thais have been killed during the war.",
      "Lior Rudaeff was born in Argentina and moved to Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak at age 7. He volunteered for more than 40 years as an ambulance driver and was a member of the community's emergency response team.

      "\"China's testing 'em too,\" Mr. Trump told CBS News correspondent Norah O'Donnell in an interview for 60 Minutes. \"You just don't know about it.\"",
      "\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it. You know, we're a open society. We're different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it, because otherwise you people are going to report \u2014 they don't have reporters that going to be writing about it. We do.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made the claim in the interview with O'Donnell that aired just days after the president's own nominee to lead STRATCOM \u2014 the U.S. military command in charge of nuclear weapons \u2014 told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that neither China nor Russia were conducting nuclear explosive tests.",
      "North Korea is the only nation known to have conducted a nuclear detonation since the 1990s. China's last known nuclear explosive test was in 1996.",
      "\"They don't go and tell you about it,\" continued Mr. Trump. \"You know, as powerful as they are, this is a big world. You don't necessarily know where they're testing. They \u2014 they test way under \u2014 underground where people don't know exactly what's happening with the test.",
      "\"You feel a little bit of a vibration. They test and we don't test. We have to test. And Russia did make a little bit of a threat the other day when they said they were gonna do certain forms of a different level of testing. But Russia tests, China \u2014 and China does test, and we're gonna test also.\"",
      "Asked about Mr. Trump's claims on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters during a press briefing that as a \"responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always ... upheld a self-defense nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.\"",
      "She said China hoped the U.S. would \"take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and maintain global strategic balance and stability.\"",
      "What does Trump mean by U.S. resuming nuclear tests?",
      "President Trump has not been clear about whether his stated plans to have the U.S. military test its nuclear arsenal include conducting actual atomic explosions, or just expanded testing of the weapons systems used to deliver nuclear warheads.",
      "U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, downplayed the notion on Sunday that the U.S. was about to start setting off nuclear explosions.",
      "\"I think the tests we're talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions,\" Wright told Fox News. \"These are what we call 'non-critical explosions,' so you're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry and they set up the nuclear explosion.\"",
      "The U.S. is among almost 180 nations that have signed the international Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions.",

    "summary": "The former Prince Andrew is set to lose his final military title, as King Charles continues shunning his younger brother over historic ties to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, Duke of York, appears set to be stripped of his last honorary military title as the British royals continue their efforts to distance themselves from King Charles III's younger brother over his links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"We've seen Andrew surrender the military positions that he's had and we're looking now at the one remaining position he has, which is the honorary vice admiral position, and we've got a process underway for that\" to be removed, Defense Secretary John Healey told Britain's Sky News on Sunday.",
      "In a separate interview on the same subject with CBS News' partner network BBC News, the defense chief said \"it's a move the king has indicated we should take.\"",
      "Mountbatten Windsor is the late Queen Elizabeth II's third child. He spent decades in public life as a working member of the royal family, but revelations of his historical ties to Epstein have turned him into a pariah figure. In 2016, he was named in a civil lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Epstein paid her to have sex with the former prince on several occasions. Mountbatten Windsor has repeatedly denied the claims, but he settled the case out of court with Giuffre in 2022, for an undisclosed sum.",
      "That settlement failed to stanch criticism of the former prince and the resulting pressure on the royal family, however, as new information continued to emerge about his historic connections with Epstein in the wake of a damning 2019 interview\u00a0with the BBC's Newsnight, in which he defended his ties to the disgraced financier.",
      "In the years after that interview, right up until this year, amid revelations about correspondence between Epstein and the then-prince, the royal family appeared reluctant to intervene, allowing him to step away from public duties and to give up many of his titles and privileges of his own volition.",
      "Last week, however, in a landmark move, King Charles announced that his younger brother would be deprived of the title of prince and told to leave his 30-room, tax-payer-funded Royal Lodge home in Windsor.",
      "One of the few titles Andrew Mountbatten Windsor still holds is honorary Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy, which he received on his 55th birthday in 2015. It is unclear how long the process to remove that title, which defense chief Healy has now confirmed is underway, might take.",
      "The former prince had a 22-year career in the Royal Navy, including serving as a helicopter pilot during the Falklands War, and commanding the anti-mine vessel HMS Cottesmore.",
      "Asked about the ongoing scandal, President Trump told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in an interview that aired Sunday on 60 Minutes that \"it's a terrible thing that's happened\" to the royal family.",

    "story": [
      "British police dismissed speculation on Sunday that a mass stabbing attack on a London-bound train that hospitalized 11 people the night before was terrorism-related.",
      "Police said one person injured in the incident remains in life-threatening condition, among six people hospitalized in the wake of the stabbing. One man, born in the United Kingdom, was in custody Sunday after a second man arrested in connection with the attack was released without charges. Both were arrested eight minutes after the first emergency calls were made from aboard the train, where passengers had reported scenes of panic and chaos as many ran through the carriages and some sought safety in the bathrooms.",
      "The 32-year-old British man still in custody was undergoing questioning by police on suspicion of attempted murder, police said. They also said that they determined the 35-year-old man previously arrested in connection with the stabbing was not involved in the crime.",
      "\"It's a shocking incident, and first and foremost, my thoughts are with the family and friends of those who' been affected and those who are injured,\" British Transport Police Superintendent John Loveless said in a news conference outside the station in Huntingdon in eastern England, where the train halted soon after the attack.",
      "\"There is nothing to suggest this is a terrorist incident,\" he added.",
      "The police superintendent also gave an update on those injured in the attack, reducing the number in life-threatening condition from nine to two. Four of the injured have been discharged from the hospital, he said. One other person had arrived at the hospital, taking the overall number injured in the attack to 11.",
      "Emergency services, including armed police and air ambulances,\u00a0were quick to arrive\u00a0on the scene shortly after they were alerted after 7:30 p.m. local time Saturday as the train drew into Huntingdon, a market town a few miles northwest of the university city of Cambridge. The two people were arrested at the station, which is around 75 miles north of London.",
      "Police said the stabbing attack occurred on the Doncaster to London King's Cross train as it headed into Huntingdon. It did not provide a motive for the attack.",
      "During their immediate response to the stabbing, police said that \"Plato,\" the national code word used by police and emergency services when responding to what could be a \"marauding terror attack,\" had been initiated. But the declaration was later rescinded.",
      "\"At this early stage, it would not be appropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident,\" Loveless said.",
      "The British newspaper The Times\u00a0reported\u00a0that a witness described seeing a man with a large knife. The witness told The Times there was \"blood everywhere,\" with people hiding in bathrooms to escape, and some getting \"stamped (on) by others\" as they tried to flee.",
      "Paul Bristow, the mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, said in a post on X that he had heard of reports of \"horrendous scenes\" on the train. Cambridge is located in the county of Cambridgeshire.",
      "Passenger Olly Foster told the CBS News partner BBC News that he heard people shouting \"run, run, there's a guy literally stabbing everyone,\" and initially thought it might have been a Halloween prank \u2014 Saturday was a day after Halloween. But as passengers pushed past him to get away, he noticed his hand was covered in blood from a chair he had leaned on.",
      "In\u00a0a social media post, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the attack an \"appalling incident\" that was \"deeply concerning,\" and urged people in the area to \"follow the advice of the police.\"",
      "\"My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response,\" he wrote.",
      "Britain's King Charles III sent his sympathies and thoughts to those affected and said he was \"truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack.\"",

      "The news comes after the Pentagon announced on Oct. 24 that it would be sending the USS Gerald R. Ford, the Navy's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, to the waters off Latin America. This move dramatically increased the number of service members and ships dedicated to the Trump administration's\u00a0campaign\u00a0to counter narcotics traffickers.",
      "President Trump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States.

      "Senate Democrats renewed their request for more information about the strikes in a letter on Friday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Hegseth.",
      "\"We also request that you provide all legal opinions related to these strikes and a list of the groups or other entities the President has deemed targetable,\" the senators wrote.",

      "\"That is not the way the system is supposed to work when you further partisan national security \u2014 when we're putting troops in harm's way,\" Warner said. \"I got an aircraft carrier from Norfolk that's in the Caribbean right now. How do I answer the families of those sailors about whether this operation is even legal? This document needs to be shared with every member of the Senate this week, so that as we get into this discussion about war powers, we've got the basis of how the administration is claiming that it's legal.\"",

It's also important to note that 30% of federal employees are also veterans or military spouses. So this is more than an impact to a household budget. This can really undermine morale and focus, and our goal is to provide stability for people who are living paycheck to paycheck and who are frankly losing ground.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I've seen that you're offering interest free loans to customers. Is- is that everyone, or just specifically active duty military? And- and if they can't qualify for a loan, what do they do?",
      "ANDRADE: So we're offering our government shutdown program to all eligible members of USAA. So as you said, that's currently about 14 and a half million people, and at this point, we've acted swiftly and decisively. In the first 48 hours of the shutdown, we funded 150 million in zero interest loans. We are now up to 400 million to date. But that's also in addition to payment extensions that we've done on credit cards, auto loans, mortgages. We've also waived fees for overdraft and we've also had flexible insurance arrangements across our property, casualty, life and health insurance businesses.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Four hundred million in zero interest loans. So people are already looking to try to figure out how to make ends meet. We looked, and a quarter of all active duty military members are food insecure, according to the Department of Agriculture, that was well before this shutdown. That means they don't have a good diet, or they're not able to afford food. We already saw strain on a lot of that active duty military. Can you give us a sense of- of what this means for someone now, to- to look at the calendar and know November 15, there's no pay coming?",
      "ANDRADE: Yeah, and- and- and I agree this is one of the reasons why we've already funded 400 million in loans at this point in time. People are preparing for an uncertain period of time, and this is very important to them, particularly if we think about our younger enlisted and particularly those with families. Dual incomes in military families is not a luxury, it's a necessity. So these are people that we're very worried about, and we want to make sure that they're stable through this period of time. The other part of this, and frankly, the reason for doing these zero interest loans is we want to make sure that they don't turn to high interest rate payday loans or high interest rate credit cards at the same time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the unemployment rate among civilian military spouses is almost five times the national average, to your point, that they need dual income. Many can't do that, but the Congressional Budget Office projection is that there will be an economic cost, that the shutdown itself could lead to seven to 14 billion in lost growth. What's the impact on the communities like yours, where you were living, down in Texas, you know, in areas where there are bases around this country?",
      "ANDRADE: Sure, I think you see it in a few ways. I think one is definitely on consumer spending. Right now, people are prioritizing basic needs, whether it's health or food at this point in time, so they're definitely cutting back on- on discretionary spending. I think that's part of that. The other aspect of it is you're going to see more people who are food insecure, and this is one of the reasons why we have also been supporting our local communities. Our offices are all located near major military installations, and we have donated millions to military aid societies who are best positioned to provide food and other services in installations, and we've also been donating to local food banks in our communities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So how does this compare to the last extended shutdown that we had during the first Trump administration?",
      "ANDRADE: The- the last shutdown basically has not- did not last as long. I think that was a big part of that. And we also had the certainty that the military would be getting paid. Now, clearly, up until now, they have been getting paid. The question of the uncertainty that we're seeing from our members is what happens over the next couple of weeks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you were already planning for that November 15- when you say the shutdown wasn't this long, you're assuming the government does not get funded for how long? How long can you keep doing this?",
      "ANDRADE: We're already- we're already planning for a second loan to members, so we've had a number take us up, certainly on the first offer of loan. Now, they're taking us up on the second offer of loan, and we're prepared to assist. That's our-our job, and to take care of our members in the military community. So we will keep up with this. And if we have to do more, we will do more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Well, we- we are thinking of your customers at this time, we will continue to track what happens with that real world impact. Thank you, Mr. Andrade.",
      "ANDRADE: Thank you, Margaret.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, a Democrat, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 2, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Massachusetts Democratic Governor Maura Healey, who joins us this morning from Boston. Governor, welcome to Face The Nation.",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A family of four receiving food stamps makes $31,000 or less per year. That program gives less than $200 a month to one in eight Americans. It's 42 million people. I know you joined this lawsuit to try to sue the administration to get them to use emergency funding to pay for food stamps during the government shutdown. Given what happened with the courts Friday, will food stamp payments be going out this week? It's your state that has to administer, administer the program, right?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: Yeah, I don't know Margaret because the President hasn't said whether he's going to approve the release of those contingency funds. I mean, the, the impact of this is just devastating. One in eight Americans, you say, I have about one in seven Massachusetts residents who are on SNAP. I was at food pantries yesterday. I mean people across our state do not want to see people go hungry, but people woke up on Saturday morning not having access to their benefits. The reason we sued, Margaret, 28 states, and I'm glad and grateful to the AGs for getting the favorable ruling. It basically tells the President do what you're supposed to do, which is use the contingency funds that have been set aside for exactly this purpose, when there is a shutdown among other things, release those funds, continue the SNAP payments to our states. I strongly urge that. I hope it happens immediately on Monday. People in this country should not go hungry, and I think Americans don't want to see their brothers and sisters go hungry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that federal judge in Rhode Island ordered full payments by Monday or partial SNAP payments by Wednesday. On another network, the Treasury Secretary was asked if, if the administration would do just that, and he said, could be. Practically speaking how do you, how quickly can you turn it on? I mean, if that comes through Wednesday, do people in Massachusetts get to eat on Thursday?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: No. I mean the problem, Margaret, with what the President has done is that he cut this off and it takes a few days to load up those cards. I mean anywhere between two and five days. I will tell you what I am doing as governor because I've got to protect my residents. I've got to work with others to make sure that they are fed. We've advanced funding to our food pantries. We stood up a United Way fund, and already, you know, 3 million, I think, in contributions have come through this week. We have seen an incredible outpouring of volunteers. I was at food pantries yesterday, and the turnout is something. And, you know, but, but this is not sustainable. Right? I mean we cannot continue along this path, which is why he needs to release those funds, as at least one court told him to do, right now. As soon as possible, because it takes us time to load up those cards.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So here's how President Trump described the shutdown impact Friday. Take a listen.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All they have to do is say the government is open, and that's the end of it. And you know, largely, when you talk about SNAP, you're talking about largely Democrats. But I'm President, I want to help everybody. I want to help Democrats and Republicans. But when you're talking about SNAP, if you look, it's largely Democrats. They're hurting their own people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Doesn't he have a point that your party is responsible for some of this pain?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: Absolutely not and, frankly, that's a really insulting comment. You know, Margaret, I've got 21,000 veterans, men and women who have served our country, who are SNAP beneficiaries in Massachusetts, who had their benefits turned off, who face hunger right now. To be clear, you want to know who SNAP beneficiaries are in this country? They're our seniors, they're kids, and they're people with disabilities. They live in every state, in every city and town around this country. And for the President to even suggest something like that or to say something like that is insulting. And this is the part, this is the problem with, with D.C. You showed the poll, right? I mean, at the end of the day, the President and Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House, and, you know, Mike Johnson hasn't had these guys back in session, I think, but for 12 out of 100 of the last days. So get back to Washington, get back to the table. Sort this out. Americans want to see that people are fed. They want to make sure that they have access to child care, because health, Head Start's getting turned off too. And they don't want to see their health premiums go up. I mean, that's what's happening right now, and the impact is being felt everywhere",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We checked and the top five states or districts with the highest percentage of residents who use food stamps are New Mexico, D.C., Louisiana, Oregon and Oklahoma. Two of those states are ruby red and voted for President Trump in last election. I think that's what you're pointing to in terms of insult, but on the substance of why we are in this shut down, Democrats have refused to sign on to a clean government funding bill. On that point, don't Democrats bear some responsibility?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: What Democrats in Congress did is stand with hundreds of\u00a0 thousands, millions of Americans right now who are seeing their premiums go up. I've got people in Massachusetts who just got notices because of the expiration of the subsidies. They're going to see their premiums rise as much as $20,000. American families can't afford that, you know. And I'm focused on economic hardship and what I can do to protect my people and I think most of us are in our states as governors, which is why the folks in D.C. need to get back to work. Mike Johnson needs to call his members back because how are you going to get a negotiation if you're not even in D.C., right? You got to get back to D.C. The president has got to give a clear directive to Republicans that they need to reopen government because Americans are suffering and continue to suffer every single day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, Healy, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\" We turn now to Texas Republican Congressman Dan Crenshaw, who joins us this morning from Humble, Texas. Welcome to \"Face the Nation.\"",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I know you've been in and out of Washington, but largely that the House members have not been here in town. The House hasn't voted since September 19. It will be the seventh consecutive week now that they've been working from home. Would you urge Speaker Johnson to bring everyone back to try to break the impasse over government funding?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: It's up to the Speaker. House Republicans and House Democrats coming back to Washington, will not break the impasse. Let's not forget that the House passed a clean CR. It was a temporary CR, okay. And you know, Democrats keep saying the Republicans have no intent to negotiate. We can't trust them to want to negotiate if we reopen the government. That's nonsense. If we had- look, if we had passed a year-long CR, I think they could make that argument. That's usually an indicator that we really don't want to talk about the budget right now, we want to- we want to keep the can down the road for a year. But when you pass a very short term duration CR, a seven-week one, it is a clear indication that we intend on continuing those conversations. So look, there's other things we could do. The reason I keep going back is because I work on the Intelligence Committee, and I have to do that work from inside DC. There's a number of reasons people go back. But look, in the end, the Senate has to deal with this, and Senate Democrats just have to reopen the government. It's that simple. They voted- I don't even what is it, 15 times now, to keep it closed. They wouldn't even vote to keep federal workers paid. That was a crazy lifeline that Senator Thune gave them, allowing them to vote, almost have the easy way out, allow them to at least vote to take the pain off of federal workers. And they voted that down too. I really don't know what their strategy is at this point. They're the ones that need to figure this out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you heard- perhaps you heard Senator Warner at the top of the program say, you know, conversations are happening this week. He was hoping that there would be some- some end. On your side of the- of the Capitol. You're saying you don't see signs of this ending this week?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Don't see what- sorry, yeah- I don't, I don't see us going back into session. I think we would have been notified by now. Yeah, but again, the impasse is not in the House. You know, we passed it out of the House--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Understood-- but to come to an agreement, which is was- the senator was talking about everyone getting together and going to the White House with the President to hammer this out. The speaker, at least, it doesn't sound like you have that level of optimism. But let's talk about the impact where you are. Your district includes parts of Houston. We checked the numbers, and it appears 350,000 Houston area families may have some difficulty with their food stamps, these SNAP benefits because of the standoff. Have you gotten any guidance from the state or from the administration about whether people get food payments this week?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Well, from what I can tell from the administration's statements, I mean, they're going to try to use the emergency contingency fund for- on a temporary basis. But look the entire- I think there's about $6 billion in that fund. The monthly SNAP benefits cost Americans $9 billion so that's- that is a very, very small band aid. And the only way you're going to get SNAP benefits back on track is if Democrats vote for our clean CR. I visited a food bank recently. Yeah, they're preparing for a huge influx in demand. You know, the state can only do so much on this. We- all of us can only do so much there's- there's a really simple solution to this, which is just keep the government open and you know, you want to negotiate this very complex health care issue, which is what Democrats say they want. I think they kind of chose it out of- randomly, and all of a sudden decided throw this temper tantrum. But fine, let's negotiate it, but you have to do it with the government open and not hold- you're not holding a gun to our heads. You're holding a gun to the regular American people's heads.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are on the Intelligence Committee. You mentioned you had, have had to come back here to view what I assume is classified intelligence. The President confirmed a few weeks back that he had authorized some CIA activity in Venezuela, he didn't give detail on that, but have you seen any evidence that the US pressure campaign on Nicolas Maduro is working, that all this military hardware that's being moved around into the region is doing something?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: I can only tell you what I can assume, having been out of session, we aren't getting the briefings because- because we aren't there. One of the reasons I keep going back is to look into these things. The broader question- this is more of a geopolitical question, is the pressure campaign working? Well, look, deterrence almost always works, especially when you're dealing with- with dictators like Maduro. They only listen to one thing, which is power. And Venezuela has been largely left alone by American administrations. The western hemisphere has been left alone, and I think this President is taking it much more seriously. Look, the Venezuelan government is a, it's- it's- it's a fake government, right? He ran a rigged election. Everyone knows that it's propped up by the Cubans and by the Russians. They have been in collusion with terrorist groups like the FARC for years. It has been an annoyance to countries like Colombia for years. There's many high-level ranking officials in government- in Venezuelan government that are literally under indictment for drug trafficking. It is effectively a narco-terrorist state--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But Maduro is still in power--",
      "REP. CRENSHAW:-- Maduro, what? Sorry--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that he still is in- in power. That's what we were just talking about that with Senator Warner. The- the need for more information to go to lawmakers about exactly what the extent is going to be of US military involvement. Would you support US land strikes in Venezuela?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Actually boots on the ground in Venezuela?--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Land strikes--",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: -- I think we would have to have to have a longer conversation about doing something to that extent. But I think what the- what the President is doing right now is very much within rational legal means, looking at drug boats that we have- people ask, do we have the intelligence to really know what these drug boats are and who's on them? Yes, we do. That I can say, right. We have multi-source intelligence that- so we know for sure what we're- what we're- what we're actually shooting at, and we don't even shoot at all the targets. And people say, well, why can't you just interdict it all? And I say, well how many boats do you think we have? How many boats and helicopters do you think you have? And you know how risky an interdiction operation is? You're going to people- put people's lives at stake. And you know, we've been doing that for years, and it hasn't worked. So, you do need to try something new, because it is an imminent harm to the United States, and that's clearly within the President's authority under Article Two. So, I don't wring my hands over what's going on right now. Talking hypotheticals about invading Venezuela. I mean, that's not really what we're talking about right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No- no, I was asked about land strikes. But- but let me ask you about something some of your fellow conservatives have been talking quite a lot about including Mitch McConnell, he's been concerned about antisemitism. On the right, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said he's seen more antisemitism in the past six months than in his entire life. Take a listen.",
      "(START SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "SEN. TED CRUZ: \"This is a poison, and I believe we are facing an existential crisis in our party and in our country. ///// If you sit there with someone who says Adolf Hitler was very cool and that their mission is to combat and defeat global Jewry, and you say nothing, then you are a coward, and you are complicit in that evil.\"",
      "(END SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was specifically referring there to a widely watched interview Tucker Carlson did with far-right commentator and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes. Do you share Senator Cruz's concern about your party?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Oh, yeah. Mr. Cruz, put it pretty well. I've had a long-standing feud with Tucker Carlson. I'm glad everyone else is- is also waking up now to how bad of a person he is. He's changed a lot over the last 20 years. You know, hard to say why, but it doesn't really matter why. I mean, you have a guy like Fuentes on your show, you're- you're uplifting what is a guy who has really fallen off the radar. You know, he- he used to send his followers to my events and try to ask me a bunch of questions about the Jews and Israel support and all that, and try to disrupt events. And they would try to infiltrate the MAGA movement. You know, they were really on a downhill slide. And for Tucker to have him on- Senator Cruz is exactly right. And this idea that we have to, you know, that it's cancel culture, if we- if we- if we- if we keep Tucker out of our circles from now on, is just nonsense. I literally wrote a book on cancel culture. So, you know, I've thought deeply about this. Cancel culture means you're- you're canceling someone for what is basically a mainstream belief, or maybe- maybe a small, like, honest mistake they made that would be maybe considered cancel culture. It's not cancel culture when you say, look, I want to disassociate myself from you because your beliefs are crazy and you're psychopathic and you're- you are falling apart in front of everyone. You know this disassociation is not canceling anyone, and I know some have suggested it is. So, I think moral- moral clarity is a lot more important in this case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Crenshaw, we have to leave it there. Thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 2, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner. \u00a0Good morning. Good to have you here.",
      "SEN. MARK WARNER: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on this shutdown, we have seen the CEO of all the major airlines come out. The union that represents the air traffic controllers all support the Republican position of just quickly fund the government with a short term clean spending bill. The American Federation of Government Employees also echoing that, AFSA, which represents the diplomats our country has, are coming out and saying that. They're saying in high threat posts they don't have armored vehicles because they can't afford to repair them. Cyber-attacks are up. Consular officers are paying out of pocket to visit ill or incarcerated Americans. Medication shipments aren't arriving, bills aren't being paid. At what point does all of this pain and pressure end the shutdown?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I hope it ends it this week. Frankly, I see it from my folks. I was greeting voters yesterday, we have early- early vote for our gubernatorial election, but I hear people also very angry at this president. I mean, we knew this wasn't going to end unless Donald Trump was back in the country. He's now back in the country. He got to go ahead and put America first and sit down with us, deal with the health care shortage, deal as well- and to show the just cruelty of this administration, there were $6 billion set aside for SNAP benefits. He's had judges say spend that money. We're still waiting to see whether the administration wants to appeal that. Get the money out to people in need, sit down with us, get this resolved this week, and let's get everybody back to work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say it's going to end this week, does that mean you're going to see more Democrats cross the aisle and agree to vote for a short term spending bill--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "SEN. WARNER: What I think it means is that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --three have.",
      "[CROSSTALK ENDS]",
      "SEN. WARNER: What we've seen from your polling, everything else, it's a pox on both your houses. We got to put this to bed. It's going to require Trump in the room. It's why the bipartisan conversation so far, I don't think we'll ever get to yes, because unfortunately, my Republican colleagues can't move on anything without a Trump sign off. Trump has spent enough time going out there now trying to audition for a Nobel Prize, running around the world. Come back and put America first. Sit down and let's get this resolved. It can be done in an hour using Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, what is the Democratic ask at this point to get that. Because leader Thune said, hey, I'll talk to you about health care open the government first.",
      "SEN. WARNER: The Democratic ask is- everyone, as of Saturday, saw health care rates skyrocket. This is an immediate crisis too--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, we've blown past that date of November 1--",
      "SEN. WARNER: They can- we can- but we can deal with this jointly, but it's going to require the active intervention of the President.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning you need to see some sort of negotiation on an extension to government health care subsidies before voting to reopen the government?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Listen, President Trump has ended up- and I'm a big supporter of Ukraine, has met more with Volodymyr Zelenskyy this year than he's met with any Democrat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the ask is the meeting?",
      "SEN. WARNER: The meeting is, let's sit down and resolve it. I can't believe Donald Trump, the great deal maker of deal makers- who at least how he presents himself, sitting down with us, we couldn't reach an agreement in an hour.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But at this point, what I hear you saying is, you are not willing to cross the aisle for an immediate, short term funding bill that is clean. You still need a negotiation over health care.",
      "SEN. WARNER: The notion of at least sitting down to talk about health care, making sure that $6 billion that is set aside for SNAP benefits gets paid out so people don't go hungry and we get the government reopened again. The President of the United States has said when he was not President that it's the responsibility of a president to end shutdowns. He has paid no attention to the shutdown. He's- stopped his many international trips, come sit down and let's get this resolved.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And there's been outreach, or there hasn't been outreach?",
      "SEN. WARNER: There's lots of conversations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when you say you're optimistic- or would you say you're optimistic about it after this week?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I think as- what your poll indicated, people are pox on both your houses at this point, get the darn thing open. Deal with the health care cliff. Don't let people go hungry when we've got money set aside on SNAP. That can all be accomplished, sooner the better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be talking about those food stamps later in the program. I want to ask you about your national security portfolio. Just overnight, there was another US strike on an alleged drug boat. I know you have been concerned that Democrats are being excluded, particularly from a key meeting that happened this past week with only Republicans in the room. Secretary Hegseth was asked shortly after your press conference by our Ellee Watson of CBS about his plans to share evidence with Congress. Take a listen.",
      "[SOT]",
      "SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PETE HEGSETH: We are presenting it to Congress. We have time and time again on a bipartisan basis they have been given the evidence directly.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says it's been given. So is your complaint that the evidence is not sufficient, or you disagree with the--",
      "SEN. WARNER: The Secretary of Defense doesn't tell the truth on this matter, we asked for the legal opinion back in July when it was first written. We had been promised it time and again. The Secretary of State, my former colleague and friend, Marco Rubio, looked me in the eye nine days ago and said, Mark, you're going to get it right away. We still didn't get the legal opinion. And then a group of random Republican senators was shared on a partisan basis what is the President's understanding of why these- why it's legal to take these actions. That- you know Margaret, that is not the way the system is supposed to work. When you further partisan national security- when we're putting troops in harm's way. I got an aircraft carrier from Norfolk that's in the Caribbean right now. How do I answer the families of those sailors about whether this operation is even legal? This document needs to be shared with every member of the Senate this week, so that as we get into this discussion about war powers, we've got the basis of how the administration is claiming that it's legal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know the administration says this isn't about war powers that the President has has authorities under Title Two. But let me read to you, because the White House knew you were coming on, they reached out to us yesterday to assert they've provided six bipartisan briefings to members or staff, including your staff, plus the Gang of Eight. A senior Administration official also said classified documents were made available.",
      "SEN. WARNER: There were no classified documents made available to the Gang of Eight members until after a partisan briefing was made to Republicans only. That is not the way our system is supposed to work. If you want to put Americans in harm's way, it needs to be done on a bipartisan basis. My Republican colleagues, many of them afterwards, said, oh yeah, that was not really good. Well, I wish they would have got up and walked out of the damn room, because everyone knows partisanship should not be involved in these national security matters, particularly when we're putting our soldiers and sailors in harm's way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it wasn't just you. The Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican and his Democratic colleague, Jack Reed, said they have twice written to Secretary Hegseth, asking for execute orders specifically legal justifications and the list of terror organizations tied to these strikes. They don't have that information, and they have oversight of the military.",
      "SEN. WARNER: I rest my case. This is what we're all saying, come clean. And the fact is, if, as the administration says, these are all bad guys, and yeah, they're all drugs on these boats, interdict these boats and show the world. Listen the Maduro government in Venezuela. And by the way, none of- none of this legal opinion has anything to do with the Venezuelan Government, Maduro is a bad guy. We should have pushed harder on him when the people of Venezuela voted him out under President Biden. Biden didn't do enough. The drugs are all cocaine it has nothing to do with fentanyl. If you are going to try to make a case to the American public, make it publicly, don't do this and then try to hide the legal justification and give it out only on a partisan basis?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does your Republican colleague, the Chair of the Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton, hear you on this? Is he working with you on this?",
      "SEN. WARNER: To his credit, he did not attend this Republican only briefing that took place earlier this week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And neither did Roger Wicker, Armed Services--",
      "SEN. WARNER: --the notion here is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the White House and the Republicans are in disagreement on this.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, there is not a lack of disagreement from members of the Senate that we've been asking for this legal justification for months, and they are now hiding the ball and only giving it out on a partisan basis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator Warner, thank you for your time today.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Thank you, Margaret.",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 2, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We go now to the Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, who joins us this morning from Far Hills, New Jersey. Welcome to Face The Nation.",
      "TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY:\u00a0 Hey, thanks, Margaret, good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So our CBS polling shows that there is real concern among Americans regarding the effect of the shutdown on all transportation. Should Americans also have safety concerns at this point?",
      "SEC. DUFFY: I think that's a great question. We work overtime to make sure the system is safe. And we will slow traffic down, you'll see delays, we'll have flights canceled to make sure the system is safe. But we have to be honest, when we have controllers, where we have shortages and towers and TRACONs doing two jobs, does it add more risk into the system? Sure, it does. But again, we're always managing that. Again, we don't- we don't want crashes, we want people to go safely, and so we will slow and stop traffic if we don't think we can manage it in a way that keeps people safe as they go from point A to point B.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, I did see that the FAA said, up in New York, 80% of air traffic controllers were absent from New York area airports, and that same day, there was a near miss at LaGuardia Airport. One United plane clipped another one. Was that pilot error? Or was that linked to some kind of shortage?",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 Well, you mentioned the shortages of air traffic controllers in the New York airspace. We had a couple days ago, three hour delays throughout New York. And again, I haven't got the readout yet on whether that was pilot error. And usually, when these planes are- are traveling very close to each other, it's their job to stay away from one another. That's not controllers, it's usually pilot error. But again, I'll have to look and see what directive was given by the air traffic controllers. But it's normally the pilot's responsibility to stay away from aircraft on the tarmac.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So if this shutdown continues, how- when does it become an emergency in terms of passenger safety and the safety of those who are trying to, for example, get home for Thanksgiving in a few weeks.",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 Well, does it become a flight emergency, a safety issue? No, we will stop traffic. So we're not going to let that happen. I think the real consequence is, what kind of rolling delays do you have throughout the system, right? We've seen problems at LA, in Dallas, in DC, Boston, Atlanta. And so I think it's only going to get worse. We have controllers who, some of them are new controllers. We have trainee controllers who are very helpful in the tower. They don't make a lot of money, and they're now confronted, they haven't had a paycheck for over a month. They're confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid? They're making decisions. I've encouraged them all to come to work. I want them to come to work, but they're making life decisions that they shouldn't have to make. Let's open the government up. Let's pay these people, these young controllers. Margaret, it's really important, I think you've covered this, we don't have the best equipment in our towers and centers for air traffic control. But we have the safest airspace, we have the most efficient airspace because we have the best controllers in the world that work our skies and keep our people safe. They deserve a paycheck.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, given that they are so essential, is there any way the administration can find a pot of money like seems to be getting found for others, like the military, to pay controllers so they can show up to work? Why isn't the administration able to do that?",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 Yeah, well, I think that's a great question. So we have done all we can. President Trump has done all he can to minimize the pain of the shutdown on the American people. Again, you remember under Barack Obama's shutdown, he was trying to gate off open air monuments in Washington, DC, and were shutting down parks just walking paths. President Trump has tried to make it less painful on the American people. So we're looking for pots of money to pay essential workers, but there's really strict rules around what money we can use and how we can use it, and we have to follow the law. And so we were able to fund a central air service, service to more rural communities. We've kept our academy up and running thus far. We don't have a ton of time, a couple more weeks of that funding. But I don't have the resources to do that, and the simple answer is, vote to open the government, negotiate your differences. That's fine, that's fair. But again, these people should be paid. And to say that it's Donald Trump's fault, to say he has to find money, when Democrats have said there's no money for you because we've shut the government down, I mean, that's a contorted analysis. And Democrats are trying to do that, and I don't think it really works. Give the money and we'll pay the controllers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Yeah, well, I saw reports that air traffic controllers only received partial pay mid-October, and this past week they missed a paycheck altogether. So practically speaking, for those who are in these jobs, would you advise them to pick up part time work elsewhere?",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 No, I'm clearly asking them, come to work. It is your job to come to work, and eventually you will be paid. But as I've traveled around the country and talked to air traffic controllers, they've told me that a lot of them can navigate missing one paycheck. None of them can manage missing two paychecks. And they're like every American family, everyone watching your show today as they think about their own finances, how many paychecks can they miss before it becomes real stress, real strife in their life? And so they're- at the- next week, they're going to get a notice of what their next paycheck is going to be. And if the government doesn't open, the notice will be another big fat zero, and you're going to see more of them probably make the decisions of funding their families, putting food on their table, gas in their cars, versus coming into work. That's not what I want, but I'm a realist as well, Margaret, these are the decisions of life and survival that these controllers have to make. By the way, it's the technicians, also. We have old equipment. We have technicians that work in the towers that keep the equipment operational. They're not getting paid. I have train inspectors who are working to keep our trains running and running safely. They're working without pay. I have pipeline inspectors, same thing. Across the system. We have a number of people who are working without pay. We talk about the air traffic controllers, but I have thousands of employees who are showing up, doing the work and trying to keep this system safe for the American people all the while they don't get paid to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Understood. So you said back on Fox Business on October 9 that \"I can't have people not showing up for work and that they may be let go.\" There's a shortage of 4,000 controllers already. You're not firing people, are you? You can't afford to.",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 No, so when- we're 2-3,000 controllers short, but that's a huge number. And you make an interesting point, because I've tried to surge air traffic controllers into the system through our academy. Margaret, we're up 20% of controllers through the academy this year alone. It takes them about a year to two to get certified in a tower, but this shutdown is impacting my pipeline of controllers. And so as- when everyone forgets about air traffic control and the shutdown, I'm going to deal with the consequences of, again, delivering for the American people and getting more controllers in the towers, not less. And you bring up a good point. We're already stressed in that we don't have enough controllers in our system, and this shutdown, when we have staffing triggers where they're not coming in because they're funding their families and food on their tables, that makes it more difficult because we're already short long. Long term consequences--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're not going to fire them?",
      "SEC. DUFFY: I don't plan on firing control. No, listen, I have, no, I- again when they're making decisions to feed their families, I'm not going to fire air traffic controllers. I have, I have loved them and supported them as they're trying to go through this process and it's challenging for them. They need support, they need money, they need a paycheck. They don't need to be fired.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 All right. Secretary Duffy, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back.",

      "Rescuers and aid workers fanned out across Jamaica on Saturday to distribute food and water and reach communities still isolated four days after Hurricane Melissa hit the island.",
      "One of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes to make landfall, Melissa has been blamed for at least 19 deaths in Jamaica, 31 in nearby Haiti, and at least one death in the Dominican Republic. Melissa made landfall in southwest Jamaica on Tuesday as a Category 5 hurricane with top winds of 185 mph.",
      "Health Minister Christopher Tufton recognized that the death toll in Jamaica was probably higher as many places are still hard to access, but said that it would be unwise to speculate.",
      "Less than half the island has communications, and nearly 400 water systems were knocked out by the storm.",
      "The U.S. Army\u00a0deployed\u00a0three CH-47 Chinook helicopters to Jamaica Friday for humanitarian and disaster relief efforts, with another five helicopters on the way.",
      "According to Agence-France Presse, Jamaican officials on Saturday also announced plans to set up multiple field hospitals after several hospitals in western Jamaica were especially hard-hit by the storm.",
      "\"That facility will come fully equipped, which will include an operating theater and other critical diagnostic equipment, and some team members to support the local team,\" Tufton said in a briefing Saturday, according to AFP, adding that officials expect the hospital to be up and running in the coming week.",
      "There were desperate scenes in Montego Bay, as residents lined up to get food, water and cash. Many U.S. tourists are still working to make their way home. The Florida-based nonprofit Gray Bull Rescue Foundation found a way to get 341 American citizens back from two very hard-hit Montego Bay resorts.",
      "Essential relief supplies are now rolling into hurricane-stricken St. Elizabeth and Westmoreland, most of which had been cut off by fallen concrete posts and trees strewn across roads.",
      "But in some parts, people were forced to dip buckets into rivers, collecting the muddy water for everyday use, while others have been drinking coconut water and roasting breadfruit.",
      "In Westmoreland, mangled metal sheets, splintered wooden frames of houses and fragments of furniture littered the coastline.",
      "Social Security Minister Pearnel Charles Jr. was among several convoys of emergency responders en route to deliver ready-to-eat meals, water, tarpaulins, blankets, medicine and other essentials.",
      "\"The priority now is to get help to those who need it,\" said Charles Jr. during a brief stop en route to Black River for the first time with long-awaited relief supplies. Prime Minister Andrew Holness had declared Black River ground zero and said the town will have to be rebuilt.",
      "The Jamaica Defense Force set up a satellite disaster relief site at the Luana community center near Black River where care packages are being dispatched to hurricane-stricken residents.",
      "Many have been without vital supplies since Tuesday and quickly converged around a JDF truck as word spread that relief supplies were being distributed in the sweltering afternoon sun.",
      "\"Everyone is homeless right now,\" Rosemarie Gayle said. \"Thank you, thank you. I can't say thank you enough,\" she said, as she accepted a package of rice, beans, sardines, powdered milk, cooking oil and other essentials.",

      "Satellite photographs showed the southwestern Jamaican fishing village of White House and the nearby town of Black River before and after Melissa slammed into the island. Each pair captures a once vibrant-looking town reduced to dirt and rubble.",
      "Some people have been walking for miles in search of basic goods and to check on loved ones, as more than 60% of the island remained without power. Helicopters have been dropping food in cut-off communities.",
      "\"People are in shock and they're waiting on relief,\" said World Vision's national director of domestic humanitarian and emergency affairs Mike Bassett, who traveled to the town of Santa Cruz in St. Elizabeth on Friday.",
      "\"The biggest needs are clean water, tarps for roof damage, canned proteins, hygiene and cleaning supplies,\" he said.",
      "On Saturday, the United Nations' World Food Program received 2,000 boxes of emergency food assistance shipped from Barbados, to be distributed in shelters and in the most-affected communities in the St. Elizabeth area.",
      "\"They will help meet the needs of 6,000 people for one week,\" said communications officer for WFP Alexis Masciarelli.",
      "Tufton also warned about the risk of increased mosquitoes, waterborne diseases and food poisoning. \"Please discard spoiled food,\" he said.",
      "A U.S. regional disaster assistance response team was on the ground after being activated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier this week, the U.S. Embassy in Jamaica said.",
      "\"The United States stands with Jamaica as they respond to the impacts of the hurricane and remains prepared to swiftly deliver emergency relief items,\" it said.",
      "Jamaica's Water and Environment Minister Matthew Samuda took to the social media platform X in a desperate bid to find tarpaulin after Melissa tore off scores of roofs on homes in western Jamaica. X users chimed in to help, indicating where they had seen supplies.",
      "Falmouth, a popular fishing spot on Jamaica's north coast, had suffered significant damage including flooding and flattened buildings, Holness said on Saturday.",
      "\"Our immediate priority is to restore electricity and telecommunications and to ensure that essential services, particularly at the Falmouth Hospital, are stabilized,\" he said on X, adding that Jamaica would rebuild \"stronger and wiser.\"",
      "Following the devastation, the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility said that it would make a record payout to Jamaica of $70.8 million.",
      "The facility enables countries to pool their individual risks to provide affordable coverage against natural disasters. The payout will be made within 14 days, the group said on Friday.",
      "Finance Minister Fayval Williams said Thursday that the CCRIF insurance policy was just one part of the government's financial plan to respond to natural disasters. She pointed to a contingencies fund, a national natural disaster reserve and a catastrophe bond.",

      "Recent studies have shown that even if you feel healthy and fit, your immune system could be aging quicker than you think, which could increase the risk of infections and immune-related disorders.",
      "\"Immune aging, like all aging, means that our immune systems start to slow down, make more mistakes and be less effective at protecting us from infection as we get older,\" Chris Rhodes, Ph.D., a nutritional biochemist and longevity expert in California, told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"After the age of 35, our immune systems become less and less able to adapt to new antigens, allergens and other inflammatory stimuli \u2014 and our thymus, the organ responsible for producing T-cells, gradually shrinks, meaning our immunity and ability to respond to new infections becomes more compromised with age,\" the doctor added.",
      "Inflammation is a key driver of declining immune function, leading to what many experts call \"inflammaging.\"",

      "\"A wide variety of polyphenols, fibers and omega-3 fats nourishes the gut microbiome, which trains and regulates immune cells,\" she said. \"Because roughly 70% of immune tissue resides in the gut, microbial diversity directly predicts immune resilience.\"",
      "When the immune system ages, immune cells become less able to perform crucial functions like fighting infection, destroying cancer cells and healing wounds. (iStock)",
      "Diet plays an \"enormous role\" in immune functionality and longevity, according to Rhodes, as the effects of certain foods can boost inflammation and lead to immune system stress. Over time, this can promote autoimmune disorders, contribute to disease progression and decrease longevity.",
      "\"The best way to keep your immune system youthful and happy is to focus on a diet rich in antioxidants, polyphenols and plant bioactives that have anti-inflammatory effects, as well as whole foods that avoid the glucose and lipid spikes that promote inflammation,\" he advised.",
      "Diet plays an \"enormous role\" in immune functionality and longevity.",
      "Rhodes also recommends considering intermittent fasting to minimize the time the body spends in the \"post-prandial (post-eating) state\" and to benefit from \"powerful anti-inflammatory effects.\"",
      "Lack of sleep and chronic stress can cause immune cells to be more worn out, less effective at their jobs and more prone to making mistakes, according to Rhodes.",
      "\"Increases in cortisol caused by lack of sleep or high stress levels will promote immune system activation, which can be beneficial in the short term to avoid infection, but will lead to accelerated immune cell aging and less effective functionality over time,\" he warned.",

      "Finding \"intentional\" ways to manage stress \u2014 such as journaling, meditating and spending time outdoors \u2014 can also help boost immunity.",
      "Exercise is known to strengthen immunity by lowering stress hormones, reducing chronic inflammation and helping immune cells move through the body.",
      "Rhodes cautioned, however, that while exercise is essential to promoting long-term health and longevity, it can also be \"pro-inflammatory,\" as the damage done to the muscle during exercise also activates the immune system and causes inflammation.",

      "\"Most people begin to experience measurable immune decline by their late 30s to early 40s, but lifestyle and metabolic health can delay it significantly.\"",
      "The doctor noted, however, that these supplements should complement, not replace, healthy lifestyle behaviors.",

      "These effects can sometimes linger even after the person has recovered from the infection.

      "YOUR PHONE IS TRACKING YOU EVEN WHEN YOU THINK IT\u2019S NOT",
      "Step one: Find the built-in mic switch",
      "Before opening menus, check your TV's frame. Many models feature a small hardware switch that turns the microphone off completely.",
      "Look closely along the bottom or sides of your screen. Some switches are labeled \"Built-in MIC.\" On Samsung TVs, it's often near the bottom right edge when facing the screen.",

      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss hackers using airport USB charging ports and phishing texts to target victims.",
      "A security researcher found a serious weakness in the software that powers thousands of e-commerce sites. The platform, called Magento, and its paid version Adobe Commerce, has a bug that lets attackers break into active shopping sessions. Some attackers can even take control of the entire store.",
      "The flaw is known as SessionReaper. It allows hackers to pretend they are real customers without needing a password. Once they are inside, they can steal data, make fake orders, or install tools that collect credit card details.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "Why is this attack so serious?",
      "The problem starts in the part of the system that handles how a store communicates with other online services. Because the software does not properly check the information it receives, it sometimes trusts data that it should not. Hackers take advantage of this by sending fake session files that the store accepts as real.",
      "Researchers at SecPod warn that successful attacks can lead to stolen customer data, fake purchases and even full control of the store's server.",
      "Once the attack method was shared publicly, cybercriminals began using it right away. Security experts at Sansec reported that more than 250 online stores were compromised within a single day. This shows how quickly attacks can spread once a vulnerability becomes public.",
      "Hackers are exploiting a new flaw called SessionReaper to hijack active shopping sessions on thousands of e-commerce sites running Adobe Commerce and Magento. (Kurt Knutsson)",
      "Why are many stores still unprotected?",
      "Adobe released a security update on Sept. 9 to fix the issue. Weeks later, about 62% of affected stores still have not installed it. Some store owners are afraid an update might break features on their site. Others simply do not know how serious the risk is.",
      "Every unpatched store remains an open door for attackers who want to steal information or install malicious code.",
      "MAJOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING GOOGLE AND DIOR, HIT BY MASSIVE SALESFORCE DATA BREACH",
      "How can you stay safe when shopping online?",
      "While store owners are responsible for fixing the problem, you can still take smart steps to protect yourself when shopping online. These actions can help you spot danger early and keep your personal information safe.",
      "Always pay attention to how a website behaves. If a page looks odd, loads slowly or shows error messages, it could mean something is wrong behind the scenes. Check for the small padlock symbol in the address bar that shows the site uses HTTPS encryption. If it is missing or the site redirects you to an unfamiliar page, stop and close the browser tab immediately. Trust your instincts if something feels off.",
      "Cybercriminals often use fake promotional emails or ads that look like real store offers. Instead of clicking links in messages or banners, type the store's web address directly into your browser to avoid phishing pages designed to steal your login details or card information. Since attacks like SessionReaper can expose your personal data to criminal marketplaces, consider using a reputable data removal service that continuously scans and deletes your private information, such as your address, phone number and email, from data broker sites. This reduces your risk of identity theft if your information has been leaked through a compromised online store.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Strong antivirus protection is your silent guard online. Choose reputable software that offers real-time protection, safe browsing alerts and automatic updates. A strong antivirus program can detect malicious code that tries to run on your device, block unsafe sites and alert you to potential threats. This adds another crucial layer of defense when visiting online stores that may not be fully secure.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Whenever possible, choose payment services that add an extra layer of protection between your bank account and the online store. Platforms like PayPal, Apple Pay or Google Pay do not share your card number with the retailer. This reduces the chance of your information being stolen if the store is compromised. These payment gateways also offer dispute protection if a purchase turns out to be fraudulent.",
      "Stick to stores with a solid reputation. Well-known brands usually have better security and faster response times when issues arise. Before buying from a new website, check its reviews on trusted consumer sites. Look for signs of credibility such as clear contact information, a professional design and verified payment options. A few minutes of research can save you from weeks of frustration.",
      "TRANSUNION BECOMES LATEST VICTIM IN MAJOR WAVE OF SALESFORCE-LINKED CYBERATTACKS, 4.4M AMERICANS AFFECTED",
      "Updates may seem annoying, but they are one of the most effective ways to protect your data. Make sure your computer, smartphone and web browser all have the latest security patches installed. Updates often fix the exact kinds of flaws hackers use to spread attacks like SessionReaper. Enable automatic updates if you can, so your devices stay protected without extra effort.",
      "If you create accounts on shopping sites, make sure each one has its own strong password. Avoid using the same password across multiple platforms. Consider using a password manager to generate and store long, random passwords. That way, if one account is compromised, your other logins stay safe.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "If a site or payment service offers\u00a0two-factor authentication, enable it. This adds a second security step, such as a code sent to your phone or generated by an app. Even if hackers steal your password, they will not be able to access your account without that second verification.",

      "Public Wi-Fi networks\u00a0in places like caf\u00e9s, airports and hotels are often unsecured. Avoid entering payment information or logging in to accounts while connected to public networks. If you must make a purchase while away from home, use a mobile data connection or a reliable VPN to encrypt your activity.",
      "Check your financial statements regularly for any unusual activity. Small, unauthorized charges can be early signs of fraud. Report any suspicious transactions to your bank or credit card company right away so they can freeze your account or issue a new card.",
      "If you notice anything strange during or after an online purchase, act quickly. Contact the store's customer service to report what you saw. You should also inform your payment provider or credit card company so they can block unauthorized transactions. Reporting early can help stop further damage and alert other shoppers to potential risks.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The SessionReaper attack shows how fast online threats can appear and how long they can linger when updates are ignored. Even well-known stores can become unsafe overnight. For retailers, installing patches quickly is critical. For shoppers, staying alert and choosing secure payment methods are the best ways to stay protected.",

      "The mode that hides \u2013 but doesn't erase",
      "Private browsing, also called Incognito Mode, lets users browse the internet without saving history, cookies or logins. While it may sound harmless, it can make it harder for parents to see what kids are accessing online.",

      "5) Digital footprint",
      "The trail your child leaves behind",
      "Every post, comment or photo shared online becomes part of your child's digital footprint, a permanent record of their online presence. Even deleted posts can live on through screenshots, data archives or algorithms.",
      "Why it matters: Colleges, employers and even peers can access public digital traces. Teaching kids to think before posting helps them build a positive and professional online reputation.",

      "Pro tip:\u00a0You can also set up Google Alerts for your child's name to get notified whenever new content appears online, a simple, free way to stay aware of their digital footprint as it evolves.",
      "Also, you may want to consider using a data removal service to help clean up your child's personal information that may appear on people-search sites or data-broker platforms. These tools scan the web for outdated profiles, cached pages and databases containing sensitive details like addresses, phone numbers and photos. They can automatically submit takedown requests and continue monitoring for new exposures over time.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to warn about a disturbing new scam where criminals use AI to clone the voices of loved ones and trick victims into sending money.",
      "The dark web often feels like a mystery, hidden beneath the surface of the internet that most people use every day. But to understand how scams and cybercrimes actually work, you need to know what happens in those hidden corners where criminals trade data, services and stolen access.",
      "Cybercriminals rely on a structured underground economy, complete with marketplaces, rules and even dispute systems to operate safely away from law enforcement. By learning how these systems function, you can better understand the threats that could reach you and avoid becoming the next target.",

      "5 SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY TIPS TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE",
      "Learn how to protect your personal information from dark web threats with simple cybersecurity habits and tools. (Phil Barker/Future Publishing via Getty Images)",
      "Inside the hidden layers of the internet",
      "The internet is often divided into three layers: the clear web, the deep web and the dark web. The clear web is the open part of the internet that search engines like Google or Bing can index, including news sites, blogs, stores and public pages. Beneath it lies the deep web, which includes pages not meant for public indexing, such as corporate intranets, private databases and webmail portals. Most of the content in the deep web is legal but simply restricted to specific users.",
      "The dark web, however, is where anonymity and illegality intersect. It requires special software such as Tor to access, and much of its activity happens behind encryption and invitation-only walls. Tor, short for The Onion Router, was originally developed by the U.S. Navy for secure communication but has since become a haven for both privacy advocates and criminals.",
      "It anonymizes users by routing traffic through multiple encrypted layers, making it almost impossible to trace where a request truly came from. This anonymity allows criminals to communicate, sell data and conduct illegal trade with reduced risk of exposure.",
      "Over time, the dark web has become a hub for criminal commerce. Marketplaces once operated like eBay for illegal goods, offering everything from drugs and stolen credit card data to hacking tools and fake identities. Many of these platforms have been shut down, but the trade continues on smaller, more private channels, including encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram. Vendors use aliases, ratings and escrow systems to build credibility.",
      "Ironically, even among criminals, trust is a critical part of business. Forums often have administrators, verified sellers and mediators to settle disputes. Members who cheat others or fail to deliver are quickly blacklisted, and reputation becomes the main currency that determines who can be trusted.",
      "The criminal economy and how scams are born",
      "Every major cyberattack or data leak often traces back to the dark web's underground economy. A single attack typically involves several layers of specialists. It begins with information stealers, malware designed to capture credentials, cookies and device fingerprints from infected machines. The stolen data is then bundled and sold in dark web markets by data suppliers. Each bundle, known as a log, might contain login credentials, browser sessions and even authentication tokens, often selling for less than $20.",
      "Another group of criminals, known as initial access brokers, purchases these logs to gain entry into corporate systems. With that access, they can impersonate legitimate users and bypass security measures such as multi-factor authentication by mimicking the victim's usual device or browser. Once inside, these brokers sometimes auction their access to larger criminal gangs or ransomware operators who are capable of exploiting it further.",
      "Some of these auctions are run as competitions, while others are flash sales where well-funded groups can buy access immediately without bidding. Eventually, this chain of transactions ends with a ransomware attack or an extortion demand, as attackers encrypt sensitive data or threaten to leak it publicly.",
      "Interestingly, even within these illegal spaces, scams are common. New vendors often post fake listings for stolen data or hacking tools, collect payments and disappear. Others impersonate trusted members or set up counterfeit escrow services to lure buyers.",
      "Despite all the encryption and reputation systems, no one is truly safe from fraud, not even the criminals themselves. This constant cycle of deception forces dark web communities to build internal rules, verification processes and penalties to keep their operations somewhat functional.",
      "What you can do to stay ahead of dark web-driven threats",
      "For ordinary people and businesses, understanding how these networks operate is key to preventing their effects. Many scams that appear in your inbox or on social media originate from credentials or data first stolen and sold on the dark web. That is why basic digital hygiene goes a long way. Below are some steps you can take to stay protected.",

      "A growing number of companies specialize in removing your personal data from online databases and people search sites. These platforms often collect and publish names, addresses, phone numbers and even family details without consent, creating easy targets for scammers and identity thieves.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "One of the easiest ways to stay safe online is to use unique, complex passwords for every account you own. Many breaches happen because people reuse the same password across multiple services. When one site is hacked, cybercriminals take those leaked credentials and try them elsewhere, a technique known as credential stuffing. A password manager eliminates this problem by generating strong, random passwords and securely storing them for you.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Antivirus software remains one of the most effective ways to detect and block malicious programs before they can steal your information. Modern antivirus solutions do far more than just scan for viruses. They monitor system behavior, detect phishing attempts and prevent infostealer malware from sending your credentials or personal data to attackers.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Outdated software is one of the biggest entry points for attackers. Cybercriminals often exploit known vulnerabilities in operating systems, browsers and plugins to deliver malware or gain access to systems. Installing updates as soon as they are available is one of the simplest yet most effective forms of defense. Enable automatic updates for your operating system, browsers and critical applications.",
      "Even if your password gets leaked or stolen,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an additional barrier for attackers. With 2FA, logging in requires both your password and a secondary verification method. This includes code from an authentication app or a hardware security key.",
      "Identity theft protection can provide early warnings if your personal information appears in data breaches or on dark web marketplaces. These services monitor your sensitive data, such as Social Security numbers, bank details or email addresses. If anything suspicious is detected, they alert you. Many providers also offer recovery assistance, helping you restore stolen identities or close fraudulent accounts. While no service can prevent identity theft entirely, these tools can shorten your response time and limit potential damage if your data is compromised.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The dark web thrives on the idea that anonymity equals safety. But while criminals may feel protected, law enforcement and security researchers continue to monitor and infiltrate these spaces. Over the years, many large marketplaces have been dismantled, and hundreds of operators have been caught despite their layers of encryption. The takeaway for everyone else is that the more you understand how these underground systems function, the better prepared you are to recognize warning signs and protect yourself.",

      "Starcloud's long-term goal is to create a five-gigawatt orbital data center about 2.5 miles wide (around 13,000 feet across). It could handle massive AI workloads while cutting costs and carbon emissions. As launch prices continue to fall, building data centers beyond Earth could soon become practical.",

      "Why are unsupported systems dangerous",
      "Unsupported Windows 10 systems no longer get the updates that keep you safe. Without those patches, ransomware and malware have easy access to your files. Once inside, attackers can encrypt your personal data or steal credentials and banking details.",
      "It's not just about losing files. Identity theft and financial fraud often start with outdated systems. The older the software, the easier it is for cybercriminals to exploit weaknesses that will never be fixed.",
      "The \"just one more year\" trap",
      "Many people tell themselves they'll upgrade later. Microsoft calls this \"just one more year\" thinking. The problem is that every delay increases your risk. Extended security updates only offer limited coverage, and they don't stop new types of attacks.",
      "Without Microsoft's regular monitoring, new vulnerabilities stay hidden. You could be using your computer for months while attackers quietly collect your data. That's a frightening thought, especially when most of it can be prevented by upgrading.",

      "HACKERS FOUND A WAY TO TURN OFF WINDOWS DEFENDER REMOTELY",
      "Start by checking whether your PC can handle Windows 11. Most modern AMD and Intel processors already meet the system requirements. Upgrading keeps your computer protected with ongoing updates that patch vulnerabilities and improve overall performance. It's one of the simplest ways to defend against ransomware and malware before they strike.",
      "Be cautious with every link and attachment you receive. Cybercriminals love sending fake update notifications that look like official Microsoft messages. These phishing scams often contain malicious links that install malware in seconds. Before you click, hover over links to verify their source and only download updates directly from Microsoft's official site. To add an extra layer of protection, install strong antivirus software that can detect and block malicious files before they infect your system.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

By limiting what's publicly available about you, you make it much harder for cybercriminals to target you, especially if your older, unsupported Windows 10 system is ever exposed online.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Protecting your online life starts with consistent action. Each step below adds another layer of defense against hackers, malware and credential theft.",
      "Start with your most important accounts, such as email and banking. Use strong, unique passwords with letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid predictable choices like names or birthdays.",
      "Never reuse passwords. One stolen password can unlock multiple accounts. Each login should be unique to protect your data.",
      "A password manager makes this simple. It stores complex passwords securely and helps you create new ones. Many managers also scan for breaches to see if your current passwords have been exposed.",
      "Next, check whether your email has been caught in a recent credential leak. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in Breach Scanner that searches trusted databases, including the newly added Synthient data from\u00a0Have I Been Pwned. It helps you find out if your email or passwords have appeared in any known leaks. If you see a match, change any reused passwords right away and secure those accounts with strong, unique credentials.",

      "Turn on 2FA wherever possible. It adds a powerful second layer of defense that blocks intruders even if they have your password. You will receive a code by text, app or security key. That code ensures only you can log in to your accounts.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. It's a smart way to stay one step ahead of hackers.",

      "Updates fix security flaws that hackers exploit. Turn on automatic updates for your operating system, antivirus and apps. Staying current keeps threats out.",
      "Avoid unknown websites that offer free downloads. Fake apps and files often contain hidden malware. Use official app stores or verified company websites.",
      "Check your accounts regularly for unusual logins or device connections. Many platforms show a login history. If something looks off, change your password and enable\u00a02FA immediately.",
      "The massive leak of 183 million credentials shows just how far your personal information can spread and how easily it can resurface years later in aggregated hacker databases. Even if your passwords were part of an old breach, data like your name, email, phone number or address may still be available through data broker sites. Personal data removal services can help reduce your exposure by scrubbing this information from hundreds of these sites.",
      "While no service can guarantee total removal, they drastically reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to cross-reference leaked credentials with public data to impersonate or target you. These services monitor and automatically remove your personal info over time, which gives me peace of mind in today's threat landscape.",

Safety is at the foundation of everything Kodiak builds. Our core value is \u2018safety first and always.\u2019 We believe independent safety evaluations like Nauto's help to validate what we already know: the Kodiak Driver is already among the safest drivers on American highways.

      "REMOVE YOUR DATA TO PROTECT YOUR RETIREMENT FROM SCAMMERS",
      "Right now, if you're over 50, you can make extra contributions to your 401(k) on top of the standard annual limit ($23,500 in 2025). These \"catch-up\" contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning the money comes out of your paycheck before tax and grows tax-free until retirement.",
      "But starting in 2026, for anyone earning more than $145,000 in the previous year, these catch-up contributions will no longer be tax-deferred. Instead, they'll become like the Roth 401(k), meaning you pay taxes on the money now, but it grows tax-free and can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement.",

The court acknowledged that while the crime was serious, it did not meet the threshold for deportation because of its nature and short duration.",
      "The ruling prompted swift condemnation from Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, who released a video promising stricter deportation laws. \"No one should have to worry about meeting their attacker or rapist on the street,\" Kristersson said. \"Those who commit serious crimes in Sweden and are not Swedish citizens must leave the country.\"",
      "In a written response to Fox News Digital, Judge Lars Viktorsson said the court considered both the nature and duration of the act, noting there was no use of weapon, and there wasn\u2019t intercourse, and that \"the duration of the incident had been short.\" \"It is true that the duration of the rape was of significance in the assessment of the matter of deportation,\" Viktorsson stated, \"However, the nature of the offense was at least as significant.\"",

    "summary": "Voters say President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress are more to blame for the ongoing government shutdown, according to a new NBC News poll.",
    "story": [
      "Voters say President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress are more to blame for the ongoing government shutdown, according to a new NBC News poll. But their verdict on the spending stalemate includes more blame for Democrats than some past shutdowns, part of a growing collection of data outlining negative views of both parties.",
      "The survey, conducted Oct. 24-28, finds a combined 52% of voters blame Trump and congressional Republicans for the stalemate, while 42% blame Democrats in Congress and 4% blame all of the players.",
      "The share of voters who blame Democrats is the highest for the party when compared to other shutdowns or potential shutdowns measured in NBC News polling over the last 30 years.",
      "Meanwhile, voters\u2019 negative views of the Democratic Party, including among Democrats, are relatively unchanged from record-low ratings in the March NBC News poll. The Republican Party is underwater with voters too, though not to the same degree. And in another poll question, voters responded positively to the idea of booting every member of Congress.",
      "At the same time, the poll also finds that both parties\u2019 core supporters are on their side in the shutdown standoff \u2014 perhaps explaining why it has carried on for a month with few signs of a resolution.",
      "The groups most likely to blame Trump and Republicans for the shutdown include core Democratic constituencies like self-described liberals, young voters, those in urban areas, Black voters and higher-educated voters. Those blaming Democrats include self-identified MAGA supporters, white men, and rural and older voters.",
      "\u201cEach party could look at this data and say, \u2018Let\u2019s not blink,\u2019\u201d said Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies, who conducted the survey with Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates.",
      "Neither party has blinked yet, as Democrats oppose government funding bills unless a deal is reached to extend expiring health care subsidies.",
      "\u201cHealth care, a central focus of the government shutdown debate, is an area where Democrats continue to hold the upper hand,\u201d said Horwitt.",
      "The survey also finds 34% of voters say they or someone in their family have seen their employment, services or benefits affected by the shutdown \u2014 the highest share in NBC News polling covering other shutdowns in 2019, 2013, 1996 and 1995.",
      "Those personally affected are also among the voters more likely to blame Republicans for the impasse and align broadly with Democrats, including young women and Black voters, 50% of whom say they have been affected.",
      "\u201cHistorically, Republicans are perceived as not being as supportive of government,\u201d said McInturff, also noting the federal layoffs driven by Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency that have driven voter views of his presidency. The Republican pollster added that even though Democratic votes are needed to advance legislation in the Senate thanks to the 60-vote threshold to end debate, voters may broadly view Republicans as controlling the government.",
      "\u201cGiven those factors, I think the default for people is that it\u2019s a Republican effort in terms of who gets the blame. \u2026 We\u2019ve had 30 years of shutdowns, and this is the highest number of blaming Democrats. So both things can be true at the same time,\u201d McInturff said.",
      "Although voters place more blame on Trump and the GOP for the ongoing shutdown, the survey does find a deep well of ill feeling toward both parties, as well as negative views of members of Congress.",
      "Democrats are 25 points underwater, with just 28% of voters viewing the party positively, near a record-low positive rating of 27% in March. A majority of voters (53%) say they have a negative view of the Democratic Party.",
      "Republicans have a net-negative rating of 9 points, with 46% viewing the party negatively and 37% viewing it positively.",
      "And according to these results, Democrats\u2019 shutdown standoff has not boosted views of the party within their own ranks.",
      "The gap between the two parties\u2019 ratings persists in part because 22% of Democrats say they view their own party negatively, while just 8% of Republicans say the same of the GOP. Back in March, 19% of Democrats said they had negative views of their party.",
      "The new poll also finds 59% of Democrats view their own party positively \u2014 unchanged since March. (The remainder said they were neutral or not sure.)",
      "Asked how they would vote if they could choose to defeat and replace every single member of Congress, including their own representatives, 57% of voters say they would vote to do so \u2014 the highest share in NBC News polling since October 2013. Forty percent said they would not oust every member of Congress if given the chance.",
      "Similar shares of Democrats (57%) and Republicans (55%), as well as 62% of independents, say they would vote to replace every lawmaker.",
      "The findings come as more candidates consider primary challenges against sitting lawmakers in the 2026 election cycle and as both parties confront the prospect of generational change following the results of the 2024 election.",
      "The NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters Oct. 24-28 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points."

    "story": [
      "For Hannah Szretter, the government shutdown is more than just a political fight.",
      "The 26-year-old Buffalo-area resident said she has had Type 1 diabetes since she was 10 and also now has a mental health disorder that prevents her from working. The $300 she receives each month in food assistance from the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program has been a needed lifeline to make sure she is able to maintain her blood sugar level.",
      "\u201cI need these benefits for my food. If I don\u2019t get the food, I won\u2019t be able to control my numbers,\u201d she told NBC News. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get it taken care of, you can lose toes or limbs, or could go blind.\u201d",
      "Now she is among the more than 40 million people who may not receive their November SNAP benefits as the government shutdown goes into its sixth week with no end in sight.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d she said.",
      "Trump's attention, however, was elsewhere, this weekend. Just hours before these food assistance benefits were set to lapse, President Donald Trump hosted a lavish \"Great Gatsby\"-themed Halloween party at Mar-a-Lago, with the theme: \"A little party never killed nobody.\" And on Friday, he posted dozens of photos on social media about his fancy renovation of the Lincoln bathroom in the White House.",
      "Along with the loss of SNAP benefits and the disruption of other social service programs for millions of people, the government shutdown has resulted in federal employees going without pay. Many of them have turned to food banks and unemployment benefits to get by.",
      "Hannah\u2019s mom, Betty, a 63-year-old recent retiree who is a caretaker for her daughter and a longtime Trump supporter, said she is losing confidence in the president she once supported amid the shutdown fight.",
      "\u201cI think deep down he wants to help the country with things like food insecurity,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now he is busy out of the country and demolishing the White House. I know that is being paid for with private funds, but those could be used to help people.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt all seems very selfish,\u201d she added.",
      "Betty Szretter said she now regrets voting for Trump in 2024 and would prefer a Democrat in the White House to \u201cprotect benefits he [Trump] wants to cut.\u201d",
      "The shutdown is compounding problems that have intensified broader anxiety over an economy that in recent months has been marked by lingering high prices for many consumer goods, rough jobs numbers, mass layoffs at major companies \u2014 including Amazon and Target \u2014 and an uptick in inflation.",
      "That stagnation has in recent months eroded the high approval marks President Donald Trump once enjoyed on the economy.",
      "The bleak picture has some Republicans sounding the alarm to the White House \u2014 even though delivering the news isn\u2019t easy.",
      "\u201cNo one wants to tell the president he\u2019s losing on the economy,\u201d said a Republican strategist who said they recently warned the White House about their concerns.",
      "Trump\u2019s overall approval rating sits at 43%, while just 34% of registered voters say he has \u201clived up\u201d to expectations on the economy, 33% say he has \u201clooked out for the middle class\u201d and 30% say he met expectations on inflation, according to a new NBC News poll released Sunday.",
      "A White House official blamed Democrats for the prolonged shutdown and argued that some indicators, like growing wages and a booming stock market, are proof the economy has bright spots. The person also argued that the massive tax cuts and tariffs pursued by Trump are going to take time to fully take effect.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is under any illusions that things are perfect \u2026 but looking at the data, we feel good about the trajectory here,\u201d said the White House official, who, like others in this article, was granted anonymity to speak candidly.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is that the actual buying power and actual purchasing power of American consumers is going up, and, as far as specific prices go, you know there are things like gas and eggs that have gone down,\u201d the official said. They also asserted that Trump\u2019s pursuit of investment in the U.S. will pay major dividends in the future for American workers and consumers.",
      "Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican and Trump ally, said in an interview with NBC News that he remains optimistic about the economy.",
      "\u201cThe state of the economy is very strong, if you look at real wages that continue to go up,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cThe Working Families Tax Cut Act worked really well. ... The big thing is, obviously, the Democrats don\u2019t want the economy to be successful, which is decently sad considering they should be cheering for the American people. But they shut down the government because they want Trump to fail.\u201d",
      "Republicans are pushing for the passage of a \u201ccontinuing resolution,\u201d which would extend current funding levels until Nov. 21. Democrats, meanwhile, want to include an extension of tax credits that help people buy private insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Those credits expire at the end of the year, and without the extension, millions of people who receive them are likely to see steep premium increases. Republicans have argued the health care fight should be handled separately, after the government reopens.",
      "For his part, Trump for weeks has largely been focused on issues aside from the shutdown and economic concerns, with the exception of deals around his tariffs. Democrats have called on him to become more engaged to help end the stalemate.",
      "On Tuesday night, Trump did write on social media that Senate Republicans should use the \u201cnuclear option\u201d to get rid of the filibuster. The drastic move would allow Republicans to reopen the government without needing 60 votes \u2014 and the cooperation of Democrats \u2014 but it was swiftly rejected by Republican leaders.",
      "Last week, Trump\u2019s attention was in Asia, far from the pain of the shutdown, with a big announcement on tariffs. Before that, much of his focus was on demolishing the East Wing of the White House to build a $300 million ballroom funded by private donors, a project that is ongoing.",
      "And on Thursday, a reporter asked Vice President JD Vance about the loss of SNAP benefits, and whether the administration was working to find a funding solution, as it has tried to do to pay troops and law enforcement during the shutdown.",
      "Vance avoided answering whether there would be a push around SNAP, instead blaming Democrats.",
      "\u201cThe unfortunate reality \u2014 and we\u2019re starting to see this with our aviation industry \u2014 we\u2019re going to find out the hard way with SNAP benefits, the American people are already suffering, and the suffering is going to get a lot worse,\u201d Vance said.",
      "Some relief could be coming \u2014 but if it does, it\u2019s over the Trump administration\u2019s objections. On Friday, a federal judge ordered the administration to distribute money to SNAP recipients \u201cas soon as possible\u201d by tapping a contingency fund. Another federal judge in a separate case also said it was unlawful for the administration not to pay out the benefits.",
      "The White House has argued that it cannot use those funds and is seeking further clarification from the courts.",
      "Several recent public polls have pointed to Trump having an economic problem, one that is quickly turning into a political one for Republicans trying to maintain slim majorities in the House and Senate headed into the 2026 midterms \u2014 an election where Republicans will have to energize Trump voters without his presence on the ballot.",
      "The new NBC News poll found Republicans have just a 1-point advantage over Democrats on \u201cdealing with the economy,\u201d a margin that has consistently been 15-20 points in favor of Republicans going back to 2018.",
      "Chuck Rocha, a Democratic strategist who advised freshman Sen. Ruben Gallego\u2019s winning campaign in Arizona last year, said that economic hardship gives his party\u2019s candidates an opening to win key segments of the electorate \u2014 including the young men who helped Trump take back the White House \u2014 if they focus on making the argument that their policies are better than the president\u2019s.",
      "\u201cRight now, people\u2019s prices are going up. Their prices are going up for the utility bills, going up for lots of things in their life, because of the tariffs,\u201d Rocha said. \u201cIf you show up and start talking to folks about actually trying to provide for their family, there\u2019s going to be a lot of men who right now feel a little regret because they were promised lower prices and they\u2019re not getting them.\u201d",
      "Moreno said he was not worried \u201cabout the politics\u201d of the shutdown, noting that he has pledged to serve no more than two Senate terms and, as a native of Colombia, is constitutionally ineligible to be president. But he said Republicans need to better articulate their message: that they hold Democrats responsible for the shutdown and its economic ramifications.",
      "He specifically alluded to recent remarks from House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., who in an interview with Fox News acknowledged that families would \u201csuffer\u201d because of the shutdown but emphasized that Democrats needed to exert their political \u201cleverage\u201d to address health care costs.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to speak up more loudly and more aggressively, like [Senate Majority Leader] John Thune did the other day. I think we haven\u2019t shown enough outrage. We do it privately, but we haven\u2019t done it enough publicly. Just call these guys out. It\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Moreno said.",
      "\u201cWe need to speak clearly, with humanity, not political talk,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump remains popular with Republicans on things like immigration enforcement \u2014 Betty Szretter says she still supports the president on that issue \u2014 but pocketbook issues more often than not have an outsize role in swaying election outcomes.",
      "The NBC News poll found 83% of registered voters said the \u201ccost of living\u201d was their single most important issue or very important to them, a number that was at 58% when they were asked about \u201cimmigration and border security.\u201d",
      "On the Asia trip last week, Trump nevertheless told reporters he had the \u201chighest [poll] numbers I ever had.\u201d",
      "He has also directly avoided questions about the economy.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s just make it about this subject,\u201d Trump said at an event centered around an autism announcement last month. \u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about some nonsense on the economy. I will say this: The economy is unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Republicans running in swing House seats across the country, however, have not been eager to talk about Trump\u2019s economy.",
      "NBC News reached out to eight Republicans either defending swing seats they currently hold or challenging Democrats in winnable seats; seven did not return requests seeking comment.",
      "Brinker Harding is a Republican city councilman in Omaha running to replace Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who is not seeking re-election in one of the most up-for-grab seats in the country. Harding said he believes that once the midterm campaigns really begin, moves Trump has made will have the economy in a better place.",
      "\u201cCome next November, Republicans\u2019 tax cuts for working families and small businesses, in addition to projected interest rate cuts, will have the American economy moving more than it already is,\u201d he said.",
      "Other swing state Republicans where vulnerable Democrats are on the ballot are pinning economic woes on those Democrats.",
      "\u201cMaine\u2019s issues are especially pronounced on the economic front,\u201d said Lauren LePage, who is the Republican national committeewoman from Maine. \u201cAnd the blame for our high cost of living, nation-leading electricity price increases and more lies at the feet of Democrats here.\u201d",
      "Maine is home to one of the nation\u2019s most closely watched 2026 Senate contests as Democrats try to knock off Republican Sen. Susan Collins. LePage\u2019s father, former Republican Gov. Paul LePage, is himself running to challenge Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, in a House seat that is considered winnable for either party.",
      "Other Republicans, including some former Trump allies, are acknowledging that prices have remained stubbornly high during Trump\u2019s second term in office.",
      "\u201cPrices have not come down at all,\u201d Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said on \u201cThe Tim Dillon Show\u201d last week. \u201cThe job market is extremely difficult. Wages have not gone up.\u201d",
      "She has also made an uncharacteristic pivot in recent weeks. After being one of Trump\u2019s staunchest defenders, she has been critical of the president and her own party of late, agreeing with Democrats that the Affordable Care Act tax credits should be included as part of any deal to reopen the government.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to the point where families are spending anywhere from $1,500 to $2,000 a month and looking at hikes coming on their insurance premiums, I think that\u2019s unforgivable,\u201d she told NBC News in early October.",
      "For people like Betty Szretter, they just want the fight to be over and the focus to return to Americans hurting in the current economic climate.",
      "\u201cI would say practice what you preach and save the country as a true servant,\u201d she said when asked what she would say to Trump directly. \u201cThere are not a lot of people who use their wealth to actually help others. Really no one.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Monday endorsed former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a lifelong Democrat running as an independent, in New York City's mayoral election.",
      "The president urged voters not to cast a ballot Tuesday for Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, saying it would be \u201ca vote for [Zohran] Mamdani.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "A recent poll from Suffolk University showed Mamdani leading the race with 44% support, with Cuomo trailing behind him by 10 percentage points. Sliwa, meanwhile, sat at 11%.",
      "Trump\u2019s endorsement came shortly after his interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes,\" where he reiterated his threat to withhold federal funds from the city if Mamdani is elected.",
      "During the interview, Trump also indicated his preference for Cuomo over Mamdani, whom he's called a \"communist\" through much of the mayoral race.",
      "Mamdani on Sunday used Trump\u2019s remarks as ammunition, mocking Cuomo on social media by congratulating him and saying, \u201cI know how hard you worked for this.\u201d",
      "Cuomo has rebuffed the prospect of Trump\u2019s endorsement in recent weeks. In an interview with NBC News' \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last month, Cuomo said he would reject an endorsement from Trump, saying his tent was not big enough to include the president in his coalition of supporters.",
      "\u201cI have not had a conversation nor would I accept an endorsement from President Trump,\u201d Cuomo said.",
      "Neither Cuomo's campaign nor Sliwa's immediately responded to requests for comment on Trump's endorsement.",
      "While governor of New York, Cuomo was an outspoken critic of Trump during the president\u2019s first term. The Democratic governor frequently slammed Trump over his response to Covid. During a mayoral debate last month, Cuomo described their clashes as \u201cbloody battles.\u201d",
      "Cuomo resigned as governor in 2021 after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment. He has repeatedly denied those allegations. In an interview with \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last month, Cuomo said he has no regrets about his behavior \u201cvis-\u00e0-vis those allegations,\u201d but added that he has \u201clearned to be more careful.\u201d",
      "Trump boosted several other candidates Monday ahead of Election Day. The president held tele-rallies for candidates in Virginia and New Jersey, talking up New Jersey GOP gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli and Republican candidates in Virginia, but without mentioning the name of Virginia\u2019s GOP nominee for governor, Winsome Earle-Sears.",
      "Trump has endorsed Ciattarelli but hasn't done the same for Earle-Sears."

    "story": [
      "A super PAC supporting former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the New York mayoral election is running a late ad that depicts Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani in front of video of the Twin Towers crashing down on 9/11.",
      "The ad quotes liberal streamer Hasan Piker, with whom Mamdani appeared earlier this year, saying \"America deserved 9/11\" during a 2019 livestream. Alongside Piker's stream, the ad includes video of one of the World Trade Center towers bursting into flames during the 2001 terror attack, with Mamdani superimposed on top of the video for a moment.",
      "\"That's Zohran's buddy, Hasan Piker, saying we deserve 9/11. It's a disgrace to every life lost,\" the narrator says in the ad.",
      "\"Zohran went on Piker's show, and now Piker was just spotted at Zohran's event. Mamdani is wrong for New York.\"",
      "Mamdani's opponents have repeatedly criticized the Democrat for appearing with Piker in early April, during the Democratic mayoral primary. Cuomo has repeatedly invoked the appearance to argue, among other things, that Mamdani wouldn't be the right mayor for the city's Jewish population, including making that case on the debate stage last month.",
      "After months of criticism, Mamdani addressed Piker's comments about 9/11 during the NBC 4/Telemundo 47/Politico New York debate, calling them \"objectionable and reprehensible.\u201d",
      "\"I also think that part of the reason why Democrats are in the situation that we are in, of being a permanent minority in this country, is we are looking only to speak to journalists and streamers and Americans with whom we agree [on] every single thing that they say,\" he added.",
      "For Our City, the super PAC behind the ad, is one of the outside groups boosting Cuomo's campaign. Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg is one of the largest funders of the group and gave $3.5 million on Oct. 29, campaign finance records show.",
      "The ad comes two weeks after Cuomo briefly laughed during a radio interview when the host said Mamdani would be \"cheering\" if \"another 9/11\" happened on his watch, after which Cuomo added: \"That's another problem. But can you imagine that? If Mamdani was in the seat on 9/11, what would have happened in this city?\"",
      "Cuomo had been talking about executive experience before that exchange. Piker was not named during that portion of the interview, but a Cuomo spokesman, Rich Azzopardi, later told NBC News that Cuomo was referring to Piker in his response and that he did not agree with the interviewer's comments.",
      "The next day, Mamdani delivered an emotional speech outside a mosque in the Bronx, where he blasted the \"racist, baseless\" attacks he's faced as a candidate, lamenting that \"Islamophobia is not seen as inexcusable\" and pledging to no longer brush the attacks aside and stay silent.",
      "\"While my opponents in this race have brought hatred to the forefront, this is just a glimpse of what so many have to endure every day across the city,\" Mamdani said, later adding: \"The question lies before each of us: Will we continue to accept a narrow definition of what it means to be a New Yorker?\"",
      "\"I will not change who I am, how I eat or the faith that I am proud to call my own. but there is one thing that I will change: I will no longer look for myself in the shadows. I will find myself in the light,\" Mamdani said."

      "The candidates for governor in New Jersey and Virginia crisscrossed their states in the final weekend of the 2025 campaign season, ahead of the first big elections since President Donald Trump\u2019s victory in 2024.",
      "The races will provide some early answers to questions facing both political parties, from how to navigate the high cost of living to how to appeal to increasingly swingy Latino voters, as well as which side is more energized going into the 2026 midterms. Republicans face a familiar challenge of turning out Trump\u2019s coalition when he is not on the ballot, while Democrats are looking for a boost after a demoralizing election last year.",
      "In Virginia, former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger has consistently led her Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, in polling and fundraising throughout the campaign. A more competitive race has formed in New Jersey, according to recent polling, where Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill is facing Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state legislator.",
      "Both Sherrill and Spanberger were elected to Congress in the party\u2019s 2018 midterm blue wave during Trump\u2019s first term, and they lived together while serving in the House. The former roommates are now looking to lead their party\u2019s electoral pushback against Trump following his return to the White House.",
      "\u201cIn 2025, it really feels like the important fight is at the state level in these governor\u2019s offices, because with the president having the presidency, the GOP having the Senate and the House, and even co-opting the Supreme Court, the last bastion feels like governors' races and governors standing in the breach,\u201d Sherrill told NBC News in an interview Friday.",
      "While Democrats have brought some high-profile surrogates to their states, Republicans have largely campaigned on their own. Trump has not campaigned in person in either state, despite endorsing Ciattarelli. (Trump has not endorsed Earle-Sears.)",
      "But the president is holding two telephone rallies Monday night for candidates in New Jersey and Virginia.",
      "Both Spanberger and Sherrill had some help from former President Barack Obama at rallies Saturday. Obama appeared with Sherrill in Newark, the state\u2019s largest city, amid some concerns about Black voter turnout. In Virginia, Obama rallied supporters in Norfolk and encouraged them to send a message to the rest of the country.",
      "\u201cLord knows we need that light. We need that inspiration.\u201d Obama said at both rallies. \u201cBecause, let\u2019s face it, our country and our politics are in a pretty dark place right now.\u201d",
      "Obama told voters in both states they have the opportunity to \u201cset a glorious example for this nation.\u201d",
      "Other prominent Democrats \u2014 including potential future presidential contenders \u2014 hit the campaign trail in both states in the final days.",
      "In New Jersey, the state\u2019s two Democratic senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, campaigned for Sherrill, along with Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy.",
      "Their weekend events followed other top Democrats' forays into the state, including former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin. Many of the same names crossed through Virginia as well.",
      "In Virginia, Spanberger continued her closing statewide bus tour \u2014 which had kicked off Oct. 25 \u2014 making stops Saturday in Norfolk, alongside Obama, and Sunday in the Washington, D.C., suburbs. On Monday, she\u2019s scheduled to hold a trio of final-day events in the region of her old Richmond-area congressional district.",
      "Her closing message has centered on her campaign-long focus on economic and affordability issues, as well as a sharp rejection of Trump\u2019s policies and the chaos she said they\u2019ve created in Virginia\u2019s economy.",
      "\u201cWith the political turmoil coming out of Washington right now, this election is an opportunity,\u201d she said during her Norfolk speech.",
      "\u201cIn Virginia, we need a governor who will recognize that Virginians are struggling to afford the rising costs in health care, housing and energy,\u201d she added.",
      "Polls in Virginia have consistently shown Spanberger leading. Early voting kicked off in the commonwealth more than six weeks ago, and as of Saturday, more than 1.43 million people had already voted \u2014 nearly 44% of total turnout in the 2021 governor\u2019s race.",
      "While Republicans did not see the same quantity of high-profile surrogates on the trail in the final days, Earle-Sears had support from popular Gov. Glenn Youngkin.",
      "Earle-Sears held campaign events Saturday in Abingdon, a heavily Republican area in southwest Virginia, and in Loudoun County. Youngkin, the term-limited Republican governor, appeared at those events, alongside the rest of the Republican ticket \u2014 John Reid, the lieutenant governor nominee, and Jason Miyares, the incumbent attorney general.",
      "The same lineup appeared at Earle-Sears' campaign events Sunday in Prince George and Hanover, near Richmond. Earle-Sears was scheduled to hold more events Monday in Roanoke, Virginia Beach and Manassas, where Republican National Committee Chair Joe Gruters was scheduled to join.",
      "In recent days, Earle-Sears has put a focus on attacking Spanberger over years-old violent texts from Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones, as well as efforts by legislative Democrats to redraw Virginia\u2019s congressional maps.",
      "But over the weekend, Earle-Sears revisited a message that had been a focus earlier in her campaign: emphasizing the accomplishments of Youngkin\u2019s administration and telling voters that electing her would mark a continuation of his record, including growing the private sector of the economy.",
      "\u201cThis election is about our future,\u201d Earle-Sears said in Abingdon. \u201cWe\u2019ve had four glorious years where we\u2019ve been making jobs left and right. \u2026 We\u2019ve already had so many successes, but there\u2019s more that can happen.\u201d",
      "In New Jersey, Ciattarelli embarked on a bus tour to rally  supporters over the weekend. Asked after he cast his ballot  Friday if any big names would join him on the trail, he told reporters, \u201cJack Ciattarelli.\u201d",
      "This is Ciattarelli\u2019s third run for governor after losing the 2017 GOP primary and becoming the GOP nominee in 2021, when he lost a surprisingly close 3-point race to Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. Ciattarelli said Friday that this year feels different.",
      "\u201cThe issues I was talking about in \u201921 were percolating. Today, they\u2019re at a complete boil. We\u2019ve got an affordability crisis, a public safety crisis, a public education crisis, a housing crisis, including overdevelopment,\u201d Ciattarelli said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot less indifference this time around,\u201d Ciattarelli later added. \u201cBack in \u201921, I had too many people inside New Jersey, including Republicans, and people around the country who didn\u2019t think I had a shot in hell. They now know differently because of our performance in \u201921.\u201d",
      "Public polls have shown a competitive campaign in New Jersey, although the state of the race has varied depending on the survey. On Thursday alone, five independent polls came out showing Sherrill's lead ranging from 9 points to a negligible 1-point edge.",
      "Both Ciattarelli and Sherrill have also highlighted the state's high cost of living in the campaign's closing days \u2014 part of more than $100 million in ads in the race, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Since the June primary, Democrats have spent nearly $64 million on ads through Election Day, while Republicans have spent more than $42 million.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll serve you as governor to drive your costs down,\u201d Sherrill says in her closing TV ad. \u201cOn Day One, I\u2019m declaring a state of emergency on utility costs to lower your family\u2019s bills. And when I\u2019m governor, no sales tax increases, period. And I\u2019ll fight for your family just as hard as I fight for mine.\u201d",
      "Ciattarelli used one of his closing spots to cast himself as the \u201cchange\u201d candidate, tying Sherrill to Murphy, the two-term Democratic governor.",
      "\u201cWe need someone who\u2019s honest with a real plan, someone who gets it,\u201d Ciattarelli says in the ad. \u201cAs governor, I\u2019ll fight every day for people who work hard and play by the rules because that\u2019s what you deserve. Together, I know we can fix New Jersey. It\u2019s time.\u201d",
      "In Virginia, Earle-Sears\u2019 closing ads have largely focused on attacking Spanberger, highlighting Jones\u2019 texts and her positions on the rights of transgender people, as well as tying her to national Democrats such as Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s weak, she\u2019s wrong, we can\u2019t trust her,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says.",
      "Spanberger, for her part, has used her closing ad to revisit her personal story, talking about her record of public service, including as a CIA officer."

      "In a screen career spanning more than 60 years, Ladd portrayed an eclectic gallery of characters, embodying women who were strong-willed but vulnerable, off-kilter but grounded.",
      "Scorsese cast Ladd as a fiery, sharp-tongued Arizona diner waitress in \"Alice Doesn't Live Her Anymore,\" released in 1974 to critical acclaim \u2014 and a best supporting actress Oscar nomination for Ladd.",
      "The same year, Ladd had a small but memorable role as a mysterious woman who hires Jack Nicholson's cynical private detective in Roman Polanski's \"Chinatown.\"",
      "Lynch cast Ladd as a cartoonishly spiteful mother in \"Wild at Heart\" (1990), a lovers-on-the-run noir that paid homage to Elvis Presley and \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Ladd earned her second supporting actress nod in the role of Marietta Fortune.",
      "\"There's not only talk of the Wicked Witch, but Marietta, played with fine, sleazy zest by Diane Ladd, actually wears wicked-witch shoes,\" The New York Times critic Vincent Canby wrote in his review.",
      "Ladd's third supporting actress nomination arrived the following year for her work as a Southern family matriarch in \"Rambling Rose,\" again cast opposite Dern. The two made history as the first mother-daughter duo nominated for Oscars in the same year.",

      "She earned her first big-screen credit in B-movie king Roger Corman's biker picture \"The Wild Angels,\" released in 1966. Ladd's other notable film roles from this period included \"The Reivers,\" \"The Rebel Rousers\" and \"White Lightning.\"",

      "By the middle of the '70s, Ladd acknowledged her own versatility.",
      "\"I can do Shakespeare, Ibsen, English accents, Irish accents, no accent, stand on my head, tap dance, sing, look 17 or look 70,\" Ladd told The New York Times for a profile published on Sept. 23, 1976.",

      "Ladd drew raves for her performance as Dern's character's mother on Mike White's cult HBO dramedy \"Enlightened.\" Dern played a troubled sales executive who moves back in with her mom after a nervous breakdown at the office.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A Fox News report prompted President Donald Trump to call out Nigeria over the killing of Christians and then threaten military action, setting off a scramble in the White House over the weekend, according to multiple U.S. officials.",
      "It\u2019s still unclear what \u2014 if anything \u2014 the administration will do to counter Islamic militants in Nigeria, but precision drone strikes are among the preliminary options being considered, two U.S. officials said.",
      "A White House spokesperson declined Monday to offer any details on the plans under consideration.",
      "\u201cAt President Trump\u2019s direction, the administration is planning options for possible action to stop the killing of Christians in Nigeria,\" the spokeswoman, Anna Kelly, said in a statement. \"Any announcements will come from the President directly.\"",
      "Trump's first social media post on Nigeria came Friday night after he watched a Fox News report on violence in the West African nation, two administration officials said. The president asked his staff for more information about the situation and, shortly after, declared in a Truth Social post that he was designating Nigeria a \"country of particular concern\" over its failure to, in his words, stop the \"mass slaughter\" of Christians.",
      "Trump then went further in a Saturday post, directing the Defense Department to prepare for possible military action.",
      "\u201cIf the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, \u2018guns-a-blazing,\u2019 to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "It\u2019s not the first time the president\u2019s rapid fire social media posts have moved faster than policy deliberations, with officials rushing to draft diplomatic and military options and allied governments taken by surprise.",
      "Experts and scholars who follow events in Nigeria say Trump\u2019s portrayal of the security situation in the country as a \u201cChristian genocide\u201d is misleading and oversimplified, as Nigerians of all faiths have suffered at the hands of Islamist extremists and other groups.",
      "Trump's posts even contradicted one of his own senior State Department advisors, Massad Boulous, who said last month that Muslims have died in larger numbers than Christians.",
      "\u201cPeople of all religions and of all tribes are dying, and it is very unfortunate, and we even know that Boko Haram and ISIS are killing more Muslims than more Christians,\" Boulos said while meeting with the Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu in Rome, according to state media outlet, Voice of Nigeria. \"So people are suffering from all sorts of backgrounds. This is not specifically targeted at one group or the other.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters on Monday, Trump hinted that he was open to sending troops on the ground in Nigeria, but that seemed like a far less likely option as he has generally been loath to deploy troops to conflicts overseas, according to the two U.S. officials.",
      "A senior Trump administration official said the White House is in regular contact with the Nigerian government.",
      "\u201cWe hope that the Nigerian government will be a partner in the process of addressing this issue, and work with the United States to take swift and immediate action to address the violence that is affecting Christians, as well as countless other innocent civilians across Nigeria,\u201d the official said.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s government was taken aback by Trump\u2019s statements, but officials cited the two countries\u2019 friendly relations and called for a cooperative approach between the two governments to tackle the threat posed by Islamist groups.",
      "Daniel Bwala, an advisor to Nigeria\u2019s president, told the BBC that any military action against the Islamist groups should be carried out jointly. Nigeria would welcome U.S. help in tackling the militants but added that it was a \u201csovereign\u201d country.",
      "Insurgent groups like Boko Haram and Islamic State\u2019s branch in West Africa sometimes use anti-Christian language, but their attacks are indiscriminate, targeting civilians, officials, and local leaders regardless of religion, according to Miriam Adah, an analyst with the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (ACLED), a U.S.-based nonprofit that tracks conflicts and crises.",
      "\u201cIn Nigeria, the violence is widespread and complex. It involves insurgents, bandits, ethnic clashes, and land disputes \u2014 not a single campaign to eliminate Christians,\u201d Adah said. \u201cBoth Christians and Muslims are victims.\u201d",
      "The bipartisan U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has pointed to violence against both Christians and Muslims in Nigeria, saying there are systematic religious freedom violations in the country. \u201cViolence affects large numbers of Christians and Muslims in several states across Nigeria,\u201d the commission said in a report last year.",
      "It also described the Nigerian government response to attacks on Nigerian civilians by \u201cnonstate actors\u201d as slow or ineffective.",
      "Islamist groups like Boko Haram are not the only actors behind violence in Nigeria, experts say.",
      "Apart from Boko Haram and an Islamic State branch in northern Nigeria, there is a separatist movement in the southeast, ethnic militant groups in the oil-producing Niger Delta, kidnapping gangs in the northwest and clashes between Muslim herders and Christian farmers in the Middle Belt fueled by climate change.",
      "Trump\u2019s comments may have had more to do with domestic American politics than addressing a security threat in Nigeria, experts said.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers, aligned with elements of Nigeria\u2019s Christian diaspora population in the United States, have long focused on the plight of Christians in Nigeria. And Trump may have been trying to deliver a message to his Christian supporters in the United States, experts said.",
      "\u201cRepublicans on the Hill in particular, for years, have been trying to frame Nigeria as \u2018a Christian genocide,\u2019 and they have strong allies in the Nigerian diaspora in the United States,\u201d said Darren Kerr, dean of the School of Peace Studies at the University of California at San Diego.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s population of 230 million is split almost evenly between Muslims and Christians, and the sectarian divide has triggered political violence in the past. Trump\u2019s comments threaten to potentially \u201clight a match\u201d in an already fragile landscape, Kerr said.",
      "\u201cTo bring the weight of the United States solely on the Christian side and to frame things in a Muslim-Christian dimension is probably extremely unhelpful to both Christians and Muslims in Nigeria,\u201d Kerr said.",
      "The United States does, however, have grounds to question how the Nigerian government is using the weapons and other assistance that Washington has delivered over the years, Kerr said.",
      "\u201cHad the President been more measured in his comments to say \u2018Nigeria, we give it all this money, what\u2019s happened? That, I think, is a legitimate criticism on the part of the United States to say to the government, \u2018Look, what are you guys doing? Where\u2019s the strategy? Where\u2019s the success, where\u2019s the progress that we\u2019re expecting?\u2019\u201d"

      "\"And then one day in a meeting, Steven Spielberg said, 'Old School\u2019s a big hit. What else do we have with Will Ferrell? We should do something else with him.' And they were like, 'Well, we just put it in turnaround.' And he\u2019s like, 'Well, get it back,'\" Apatow said.",
      "Thanks to that decision, \"Anchorman\" was put in production, and in 2004, it hit theaters.",
      "\u201c(Spielberg) was the reason Adam and Will were allowed to make 'Anchorman,\u2019\u201d Apatow said.",
      "Along with Ferrell, the movie featured then-rising comedians like Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Christina Applegate and Steve Carell.",
      "Apatow said Carell specifically always had the movie's staff in tears.",
      "\"If you were on the set of 'Anchorman,' and you were just watching the shoot, there was no one there who wasn\u2019t like, 'Steve Carell is the funniest guy ever,'\" he said.",
      "\"So just one day I\u2019m like, 'Do you have any ideas for yourself as a lead?' And then one day he told me about a sketch he worked on once about a guy who is at a poker game, and they were all talking dirty about sex, and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s lying and hasn\u2019t had sex. And I thought, 'Sadly, I understand that,'\" Apatow laughed. \"I know how to develop that.\"",
      "That movie turned into Carell's breakout film \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin.\"",
      "When asked what advice he would give to people who are trying to get into comedy, Apatow turns to his new book, \"Comedy Nerd: A Lifelong Obsession in Stories and Pictures.\"",
      "\"Part of how I built the book is that I put all the failures in there also. So all the pilots that weren\u2019t picked up, everything that was a bomb. And I talk about how that happened. How did things fall apart? What\u2019s it like when they work? What\u2019s it like when they don\u2019t work?\" he said.",
      "\"So you have to really be strong, and find your voice, and not give up,\" he added. \"I always say, if you give up, it\u2019s not going to work. So, the key is not quitting.\""

      "\"Ironically, this week has been the busiest week since leaving the villa,\" Nic tells TODAY.com. \"I have a marathon to train for, so of course the week of is going to be the busiest.\"",
      "Nic, who will be running the marathon with Team Strava, says he decided to run the race just a few months ago, \"which I know is a bit later in the training process,\" he admits with a laugh. The registered nurse already has two marathons under his belt \u2014 one of which was part of an Ironman race.",
      "\"Hopefully it won't be too hard,\" he says of the NYC race.",

      "\"I've said this before, like I want to go on our hot air balloon date, I want to do all these things \u2014\u00a0but at this point, I'm like, I just want to sit on a couch and do nothing with her,\" he adds. \"That sounds elite.\""

      "Maksim Chmerkovskiy is clarifying his recent statements about new \"Dancing with the Stars\" pro Jan Ravnik.",
      "On Oct. 24, Chmerkovskiy appeared on his wife Peta Murgatroyd\u2019s \u201cThe Penthouse With Peta\u201d podcast and said Ravnik had \"no business\" teaching a celebrity partner on the dancing competition.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s zero foundation, technique, quality, understanding of the partnership. Bro, I\u2019m getting emotional,\u201d Chmerkovskiy said during the episode.",
      "Ravnik, who was previously a dancer on Taylor Swift's \"Eras Tour,\" was partnered with \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" star Jen Affleck. The duo were eliminated from the competition on the Oct. 28 episode.",
      "After facing criticism for his comments about Ravnik's dancing skills, Chmerkovskiy posted a new video to his Instagram page and explained what motivated him to speak out in the first place.",
      "\u201cFirst and foremost, I want to apologize to Jan for the way my words had made you feel, for hurting your feelings,\u201d Chmerkovskiy said.",
      "The professional dancer, who was a \"DWTS\" pro for 17 seasons, then said he would \"love to meet\" Ravnik and and \"bury the hatchet.\"",
      "\u201cAnd, dare I say, we probably might even be friends,\u201d he said, adding that he hopes a 1:1 meeting would leave Ravnik \"feeling completely different.\"",
      "Chmerkovskiy went on to explain that he didn't mean to offend Ravnik when he made his initial comments.",
      "\"I'm not not a friend, regardless of what I say. Maybe it's paradoxical, but my personality. (If) I love you, (I) will tell you how it is, let alone if I don't know you,\" he said.",
      "Chmerkovskiy then clarified that he doesn't let \"feelings and emotion\" cloud his \"commentary on dance.\"",
      "\u201cIt just comes with (a) completely different range of reasoning. And, you know, I'm that guy. And so I would like to explain myself, like I said. I would like this to be personal because this is crazy to me,\u201d he said.",
      "Chmerkovskiy's wife, brother Val Chmerkovskiy and sister-in-law Jenna Johnson have all appeared as professional dancers on \"DWTS.\" During his video message, the 45-year-old said many people reached out to him after his comments about Ravnik to criticize him for only winning the show once.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t really hurt my feelings by saying, \u2018Look at you, loser. You only won once.\u2019 Blah, blah, blah. Yes, I know that more than anybody else. I\u2019m also very well aware that every single member of my family has won 'Dancing with the Stars' more than I have. They are much better at 'Dancing with the Stars than me,'\u201d he said.",
      "Chmerkovskiy explained that he always had a hard time mastering one important element of the competition: public perception and what people think of him.",
      "\"Fundamentally, I don\u2019t care, and I lead with that. And because I lead with that, I\u2019m not fighting for anybody\u2019s votes,\u201d he said.  \u201cAnd so in a platform where that\u2019s important, I\u2019m not the guy.\u201d",
      "Chmerkovskiy said he was motivated to apologize to Ravnik publicly after doing some soul searching, not because of the public's criticism.",
      "\u201c(When) I realize something about myself, I realize it. It\u2019s not going to be because somebody says that to me, it\u2019s because I finally understood that for myself,\u201d he said.",
      "At the end of his video, the professional dancer sent a message to social media users, saying, \"Let\u2019s not defend someone by attacking somebody else. That\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna say.\u201d",
      "After being eliminated from \"DWTS\" on Oct. 28, Ravnik addressed Chmerkovskiy's podcast comments during an interview with \"Entertainment Tonight.\"",
      "\"I have no comment on that. Look, I got all the love on this show. All the praise from the judges also, like everyone gave me so much love,\" he said. \"Whoever is saying, outside, the people who (are) trying to stay relevant and spreading the hate, this is not a way to do it.

      "\u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d icon Suzanne Rogers has announced that she was diagnosed with Stage 2 colorectal cancer and recently underwent treatment.",
      "Rogers, who has portrayed Salem staple Maggie Horton for 52 years, opened up about her cancer diagnosis during an interview with TV Insider published Oct. 30, revealing that her health struggles are the reason for her absence from the show.",
      "The 82-year-old actor told the entertainment outlet that she decided to make an appointment with her doctor after feeling that something \u201cwasn\u2019t quite right\u201d despite getting routine colonoscopies. She had another and the surgeon suggested that she return for an MRI, PET scan and biopsy after seeing her results.",
      "\u201cAnd the minute he said that I knew that it was something more,\u201d she recalled.",
      "She learned after another procedure that she had Stage 2 colorectal cancer. Her doctor informed her, \u201c\u2018You have cancer and you have to start treatment,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Rogers added, \u201cIt was all a shock. I mean, I think I was in a shock for several days because I take pretty good care of myself. But he said, \u2018It\u2019s a good thing you caught it in time.\u2019\u201d",
      "She underwent treatment this summer after \u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d finished filming in June.",
      "\u201cIt was radiation every day and chemo every day for six weeks and it was tough,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cIt was tough knowing you had to do it five days a week and then you had off Saturday and Sunday. I thoroughly enjoyed my weekends because I didn\u2019t have to go to and see a doctor. I was so tired of seeing doctors.\u201d",
      "Although she initially didn\u2019t disclose her diagnosis, she later turned to co-star Linsey Godfrey, who plays her on-screen daughter Sarah Horton, for support. She revealed Godfrey held her hand during one of her infusions, and that other co-stars, like Paul Telfer, Mary Beth Evans, Stephen Nichols, Greg Rikaart and AnnaLynne McCord, were there for her, too. Producers also told her to prioritize her health and that she could resume portraying Rogers when she improved.",
      "Her treatment ended on July 31. \u201cI\u2019m feeling really good,\u201d she told TV Insider. \u201cI start back to work next week, so we\u2019ll see how that goes.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cNow, I\u2019m feeling anxious like I do any time I get scripts because I want to do my very best and you don\u2019t want to hold up anybody. So that\u2019s the only anxiousness I feel. It\u2019s not because of my illness, let\u2019s put it that way.\u201d",
      "Rogers said that her recent health struggles have changed her perspective on life. \u201cIt\u2019s so funny because I used to worry about some silly things,\u201d she shared. \u201cAnd when you go through this, it kind of takes you a while to say, \u2018OK, well, this is what I have, and I will do my very best to fight it and to get through it.\u2019 And that\u2019s what I did. The prayers and the good wishes from my friends and my family helped me stay positive and stay on top of it and beat this.\u201d",
      "Her \u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d family posted a message on Instagram about Rogers\u2019 diagnosis Oct 30 and told viewers they can expect to see Maggie on their televisions again soon.",
      "The show wrote, \u201cWe are delighted that Suzanne has come through this challenge with her trademark grace and strength. Fans will be glad to know that \u2018Maggie\u2019 will remain a constant presence in Salem.\u201d",
      "The post said Rogers\u2019 absence on the show in 2026 with me \u201cminimal.\u201d According to TV Insider, \u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d films 10 months in advance.",
      "\u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d had previously commented on Rogers taking a hiatus from the show in July. The soap shared a statement with Soap Opera Digest at the time that addressed rumors Rogers was leaving, writing that the speculation, \u201ccould not be further from the truth, Maggie and Suzanne are integral to the show\u2019s history, present storylines, and now, on the heels of our pick-up, the future! Neither are going anywhere.\u201d",
      "Rogers has played Maggie on the beloved soap opera since 1973, totaling 3205 episodes according to IMDb. NBCUniversal confirmed that \u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d has been renewed for seasons 62 and 63 on Peacock.",
      "Colorectal cancer develops in either the colon or the rectum, and about 3.9 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with the disease at some point in their life, the National Cancer Institute reports. Since 2018, the American Cancer Society has been recommending that patients start screening for colorectal cancer starting at the age of 45.",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve always had the dream to have, to write and to work on an album, almost to the point that it became a little bit of a nightmare because I had a lot of expectations,\u201d the 30-year-old Venezuelan singer-songwriter tells TODAY.com. \u201cI was pressuring myself a lot, and it wasn\u2019t the moment for it, but I would keep (telling) myself, \u2018It\u2019s going to come and be awesome.\u2019",
      "\u201cI just had no clue what it was going to be,\u201d she adds, having now accomplished her dream with \u201cBendito Verano.\u201d",

Thank you for the present.\u2019\u201d",

      "I think after (my 2024 song) \u201cMe Lo Merezco\u201d (\u201cI Deserve It\u201d) was born, I was like, \u201cThis is where I\u2019m feeling the best,\u201d because it transcended the music and it became more about the message and what it was doing in people\u2019s lives.",
      "It was that feeling of, \u201cLook at everything we\u2019ve gone through and we made it. We\u2019re here at the beach, let\u2019s just have fun and dance.\u201d Mixing that feeling of what summer means to me and then asking the question of, \u201cIf there were to be a summer in heaven, what playlist would they play?\u201d",
      "Which is why we have sax, we have trumpets because I would picture angels performing in heaven. (I wanted this album) to help us remember the things that really matter ... and it would be about love.",
      "We have elements like Afro that make me feel freedom, that make me feel at peace, joy and be in the present. There\u2019s a lot of roots feelings when I listen to a bass line, or when I listen to the drums that remind me that I come from amazing people that have done amazing things in order for me to be here.",
      "But then I have my message, which is where I really come in and put like my little grain of salt. I speak about mental health and awareness and emotional responsibility and real and unconditional love.",
      "We went to Italy to record all the visuals. Every song has a visual. The first time I went to Italy, it was right after I picked up my relationship with my father. We hadn\u2019t spoken in like five years and my father is half Chilean, half Italian, but grew up in Venezuela.",
      "My last name is Italian, and I had always wanted to go to Italy, and I\u2019m grateful it happened right after we hugged it out. Visually, the woman that I saw in Italy was a woman hugging everything about where she comes from and who she is. (Someone) who never lost her essence, but really worked on the woman that she wants to be and who she wants to be for the world and her industry and her craft. I\u2019m grateful to see that visually. I needed to see it. And in a place like Italy, in Lake Como, the first thing that I thought was, \"If God wakes up in the morning and opens the window of his bedroom, this is the view.\"",
      "And then we recorded everything in Italy, aesthetically with this woman that you see vulnerability and innocence, but then you also see her strength and her resilience.",
      "The album opens up with a mantra that I wrote with my life coach that repeats, \"I am, I am.\" It\u2019s just one minute. I want people to start the days like that. It's how I start my days.",
      "The interlude was my best friend. I asked him, \u201cIf you could describe the warrior of light, how would you describe her?\u201d",
      "And then it closes with a song that I wrote to my inner child. It begins with my mom and my grandmother singing. So it\u2019s very, very intentional, just a big ball of love.",
      "I think every song has something like \u201cLuna de Miel\u201d (with Rawayana), to me, is the wedding song of the album. \u201cLa de Dios\u201d is the moment to connect with the purest part of your heart, your inner child, and also to connect with God. It\u2019s a reminder in a world that right now is in a lot of chaos.",
      "\u201cAleluya!\u201d tells you, love without fear. \u201cAlma\u201d tells you, look at everything that you\u2019ve gone through. You\u2019ve always had everything and if you lose whatever you have, you\u2019re losing nothing.",
      "\u201cAm\u00e9n Beb\u00e9,\u201d you have a partner and you build something together, a best friend, a boyfriend, a dog, celebrate life. There\u2019s a little bit of everything. I\u2019m just grateful that I have an album that I think you can listen from beginning to end, and it\u2019s gonna be an experience.",
      "I\u2019m excited, happy. This is my first US tour. We\u2019re going to be presenting the album. We\u2019re preparing a very intimate show, which is how I like it. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s gonna be way too long and people are gonna tell me, \u201cYou guys have to leave.\u201d And we\u2019re all gonna be like, \u201cNo!\u201d",
      "I\u2019m excited to see my warriors of light. They\u2019re everything to me. We feed each other and we exchange energy. We elevate each other, and I\u2019m bringing now a work that I put all my heart and soul (into), and I can\u2019t wait for you guys to listen to it."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A Fox News report prompted President Donald Trump to call out Nigeria over the killing of Christians and then threaten military action, setting off a scramble in the White House over the weekend, according to multiple U.S. officials.",
      "It\u2019s still unclear what \u2014 if anything \u2014 the administration will do to counter Islamic militants in Nigeria, but precision drone strikes are among the preliminary options being considered, two U.S. officials said.",
      "A White House spokesperson declined Monday to offer any details on the plans under consideration.",
      "\u201cAt President Trump\u2019s direction, the administration is planning options for possible action to stop the killing of Christians in Nigeria,\" the spokeswoman, Anna Kelly, said in a statement. \"Any announcements will come from the President directly.\"",
      "Trump's first social media post on Nigeria came Friday night after he watched a Fox News report on violence in the West African nation, two administration officials said. The president asked his staff for more information about the situation and, shortly after, declared in a Truth Social post that he was designating Nigeria a \"country of particular concern\" over its failure to, in his words, stop the \"mass slaughter\" of Christians.",
      "Trump then went further in a Saturday post, directing the Defense Department to prepare for possible military action.",
      "\u201cIf the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, \u2018guns-a-blazing,\u2019 to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "It\u2019s not the first time the president\u2019s rapid fire social media posts have moved faster than policy deliberations, with officials rushing to draft diplomatic and military options and allied governments taken by surprise.",
      "Experts and scholars who follow events in Nigeria say Trump\u2019s portrayal of the security situation in the country as a \u201cChristian genocide\u201d is misleading and oversimplified, as Nigerians of all faiths have suffered at the hands of Islamist extremists and other groups.",
      "Trump's posts even contradicted one of his own senior State Department advisors, Massad Boulous, who said last month that Muslims have died in larger numbers than Christians.",
      "\u201cPeople of all religions and of all tribes are dying, and it is very unfortunate, and we even know that Boko Haram and ISIS are killing more Muslims than more Christians,\" Boulos said while meeting with the Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu in Rome, according to state media outlet, Voice of Nigeria. \"So people are suffering from all sorts of backgrounds. This is not specifically targeted at one group or the other.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters on Monday, Trump hinted that he was open to sending troops on the ground in Nigeria, but that seemed like a far less likely option as he has generally been loath to deploy troops to conflicts overseas, according to the two U.S. officials.",
      "A senior Trump administration official said the White House is in regular contact with the Nigerian government.",
      "\u201cWe hope that the Nigerian government will be a partner in the process of addressing this issue, and work with the United States to take swift and immediate action to address the violence that is affecting Christians, as well as countless other innocent civilians across Nigeria,\u201d the official said.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s government was taken aback by Trump\u2019s statements, but officials cited the two countries\u2019 friendly relations and called for a cooperative approach between the two governments to tackle the threat posed by Islamist groups.",
      "Daniel Bwala, an advisor to Nigeria\u2019s president, told the BBC that any military action against the Islamist groups should be carried out jointly. Nigeria would welcome U.S. help in tackling the militants but added that it was a \u201csovereign\u201d country.",
      "Insurgent groups like Boko Haram and Islamic State\u2019s branch in West Africa sometimes use anti-Christian language, but their attacks are indiscriminate, targeting civilians, officials, and local leaders regardless of religion, according to Miriam Adah, an analyst with the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (ACLED), a U.S.-based nonprofit that tracks conflicts and crises.",
      "\u201cIn Nigeria, the violence is widespread and complex. It involves insurgents, bandits, ethnic clashes, and land disputes \u2014 not a single campaign to eliminate Christians,\u201d Adah said. \u201cBoth Christians and Muslims are victims.\u201d",
      "The bipartisan U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has pointed to violence against both Christians and Muslims in Nigeria, saying there are systematic religious freedom violations in the country. \u201cViolence affects large numbers of Christians and Muslims in several states across Nigeria,\u201d the commission said in a report last year.",
      "It also described the Nigerian government response to attacks on Nigerian civilians by \u201cnonstate actors\u201d as slow or ineffective.",
      "Islamist groups like Boko Haram are not the only actors behind violence in Nigeria, experts say.",
      "Apart from Boko Haram and an Islamic State branch in northern Nigeria, there is a separatist movement in the southeast, ethnic militant groups in the oil-producing Niger Delta, kidnapping gangs in the northwest and clashes between Muslim herders and Christian farmers in the Middle Belt fueled by climate change.",
      "Trump\u2019s comments may have had more to do with domestic American politics than addressing a security threat in Nigeria, experts said.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers, aligned with elements of Nigeria\u2019s Christian diaspora population in the United States, have long focused on the plight of Christians in Nigeria. And Trump may have been trying to deliver a message to his Christian supporters in the United States, experts said.",
      "\u201cRepublicans on the Hill in particular, for years, have been trying to frame Nigeria as \u2018a Christian genocide,\u2019 and they have strong allies in the Nigerian diaspora in the United States,\u201d said Darren Kerr, dean of the School of Peace Studies at the University of California at San Diego.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s population of 230 million is split almost evenly between Muslims and Christians, and the sectarian divide has triggered political violence in the past. Trump\u2019s comments threaten to potentially \u201clight a match\u201d in an already fragile landscape, Kerr said.",
      "\u201cTo bring the weight of the United States solely on the Christian side and to frame things in a Muslim-Christian dimension is probably extremely unhelpful to both Christians and Muslims in Nigeria,\u201d Kerr said.",
      "The United States does, however, have grounds to question how the Nigerian government is using the weapons and other assistance that Washington has delivered over the years, Kerr said.",
      "\u201cHad the President been more measured in his comments to say \u2018Nigeria, we give it all this money, what\u2019s happened? That, I think, is a legitimate criticism on the part of the United States to say to the government, \u2018Look, what are you guys doing? Where\u2019s the strategy? Where\u2019s the success, where\u2019s the progress that we\u2019re expecting?\u2019\u201d"

      "Showcasing more than 5,300 objects from the young king\u2019s tomb, including his iconic death mask and glittering royal regalia, the new section of the vast museum here on the outskirts of Cairo is expected to draw millions of visitors every year.",
      "The galleries, displaying mostly pieces never seen by the public, were officially opened in an elaborate and long-awaited grand opening ceremony on Saturday in front of delegates from more than 70 countries.",
      "On a behind-the-scenes visit to the museum\u2019s Conservation Center earlier this month, general director Hussein Kamal told NBC News that it will be the first time since Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered over a century ago that all the items are stored in one place.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d he said, adding that he was particularly excited by the exhibition featuring King Tut\u2019s armor. The piece made from textiles and leather was \u201cunique throughout ancient Egyptian civilization,\u201d he said.",
      "Kamal said the items, previously held in a storeroom, were painstakingly restored since 2017 by some of the center\u2019s 150 conservators.",
      "\u201cWe tried to reshape it from the original,\u201d he said, adding that it was a challenge because they did not have anything to compare it to and had to depend on \u201cinvestigation and analysis to know the original structure of the armor.\u201d",
      "Believed to have become pharaoh when he was 8 or 9 years old, in around 1334 B.C., Tutankhamun ruled until his death 10 years later. He is believed to have suffered from numerous illnesses and disabilities, including circulatory problems, malaria, bone disease and a club foot.",
      "Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered in November 1922 in the Valley of the Kings by the British archaeologist Howard Carter, undisturbed by grave robbers and almost completely intact, nearly 400 miles south of Egypt\u2019s most famous archeological treasures in Giza.",
      "Now the artifacts recovered from that tomb will sit in the largest museum in the world dedicated to a single civilization \u2014 the Grand Egyptian Museum's grounds cover 117 acres, or the equivalent of 80 football fields, just over a mile north of the Great Pyramids of Giza outside Cairo.",
      "The collection also includes the 4,000-year-old funerary boat, also known as the Cheops ship, of Pharaoh Khufu.",
      "At Saturday's grand opening, attended by a number of European and Arab leaders, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi sought to give the event an international scale, calling on attendees to \"make this museum a platform for dialogue, a destination for knowledge, a forum for humanity, and a beacon for all who love life and believe in the value of humankind.\"",
      "With the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx as their backdrop, actors dressed in ancient Egyptian garb paid tribute to thousands of years of history, as an orchestra played fanfares. Hundreds of drones created a light show in the sky, depicting figures including Tutankhamun and ancient Egyptian gods Isis and Osiris.",
      "While the museum will officially open Tuesday, limited tours have been available since 2023, and the public is allowed access to most of its main galleries since October.",
      "Hassan Allam, CEO of the museum's management company, said daily visitor numbers would surge from 6,000 to 15,000 this week as the doors are opened on the \"out of this world\" Tutankhamun Gallery.",
      "He said running the museum had been a \"challenging and yet wonderful experience,\" describing it as a \"great privilege\" to \"play a small role in Egypt's history, maintaining it, managing it, and hosting Egyptology lovers from across the world.\"",
      "Alongside the Tutankhamun exhibition, the museum holds artifacts from the prehistoric era, dating from 700,000 B.C., to the Roman era of the fourth century A.D., arranged around themes of kingship, society and beliefs.",
      "Statues, sarcophagi and stelae also offer a glimpse into the life of Egypt\u2019s ancient elite and how they prepared themselves for the afterlife.",
      "At the museum\u2019s center sits the six-story Grand Staircase with a view of the pyramids and an atrium containing monuments, pharaonic statues and sarcophagi.",
      "The opening ceremony marks the culmination of a project first announced in 1992. Construction officially began in 2005 and has been hit by repeated delays due to the Arab Spring in the early 2010s and the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Ahmed Ezz, the chairman of Ezz Steel, which provided all of the steel rebar needed for the project, said in an interview this week that the museum not only reflects his country\u2019s past but is \u201calso part of an architectural renaissance of Egypt.\u201d",

      "Inside each ampule is the substance at the heart of the geopolitical strife between the United States and China: fentanyl, the deadly opioid at the center of a deal outlined by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping on Thursday.",
      "NBC News got exclusive access to the headquarters of Yichang Humanwell Pharmaceutical, the largest producer of the drug in China, and indeed Asia, at its sprawling complex in the central city of Yichang.",
      "Humanwell says that it only supplies fentanyl for use in hospitals and that it does not export any medication to the United States, Mexico or Canada. In 51 years of operating, \u201cwe have never had a single incident of a drug going missing \u2014 not a single dose has ever been lost,\u201d its president, Du Wentao, said in an interview inside his factory, which is surrounded by high fences wrapped in concertina wire and electric sensors.",
      "Humanwell is one of only five companies in China licensed to produce fentanyl for use in hospitals, and it makes around 100 million doses of fentanyl variants each year.",
      "After a strict registration process to get past the main gate, all visitors and staff alike \u2014 including the CEO \u2014 are required to wear blue hospital caps, shoe covers and lab coats to ensure they do not contaminate the workspace.",
      "Most of the production line is automated to limit human contact, with the vials being washed and sterilized and then filled with fentanyl using long rubber tubes.",
      "Two staffers in protective gear supervised the process, with an alarm pinging every 10 minutes to remind them to spray their gloved hands with disinfectant. The vials are then inspected using flashes of light, stamped, boxed up and shipped out via a warehouse.",
      "Trump pressed Xi for a crackdown on fentanyl at a meeting in South Korea on Thursday, the last stop of his three-country Asian tour. The president said he would reduce his fentanyl tariff on China to 10% from 20%, effective immediately, after Xi agreed to intensify China\u2019s efforts to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for the deadly opioid.",
      "American officials say the Chinese government hasn\u2019t done enough to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for fentanyl, which are then processed into the highly addictive opioid in Mexican labs and smuggled across the border to the United States. Though deaths appear to be declining in the U.S., fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have killed hundreds of thousands of Americans in recent years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "China has previously defended its anti-fentanyl efforts and says unrelenting American demand for the drug is to blame for the crisis.",
      "But a State Department report to Congress last month accused the ruling Chinese Communist Party of continuing to \u201csubsidize and otherwise incentivize China-based companies to export synthetic drug precursors, including through tax rebates, monetary grants and awards, and official site visits.\u201d It accused companies controlled by the Communist Party of being \u201ccomplicit in this illicit trade.\u201d",
      "Under pressure from Trump, China made fentanyl a controlled substance in 2019, banning its use outside of medical prescriptions. That slowed the influx of Chinese fentanyl into the U.S., but the \u201cprolific export of chemical precursors and other illicit narcotics remains,\u201d the State Department report said.",
      "Chinese officials rejected that narrative. \u201cChina expresses sympathy for the American people suffering from the fentanyl crisis,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters in Beijing on Wednesday.",
      "But he added that \u201cChina is the country most resolute in drug control, with the most comprehensive policies and the best track record. It is also one of the countries with the largest number of controlled substances and the strictest regulations in the world.\u201d",
      "Du, the president of Humanwell Healthcare, which produces 100 million doses annually of fentanyl-based products, says that the meticulously clean, automated and controlled operation observed by NBC News was no facade.",
      "\u201cThe management of fentanyl drugs in China is among the strictest in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is absolutely no possibility that any dose from our company has flowed to the United States. I can state this with full confidence and certainty \u2014 there is no issue whatsoever.\u201d",
      "He derided the \"many statements in the U.S. claiming that the fentanyl crisis originates from China,\" saying that is impossible \"given how strict our controls are.\"",
      "As well as the visit to Humanwell, NBC News gained exclusive access to the National Narcotics Intelligence Center in Beijing, which had been sanctioned by Washington in 2020 but saw those measures lifted three years later during the Biden administration as the two countries agreed to resume cooperation on fentanyl.",
      "There, Chinese security officials said the two sides are again exchanging information on how smugglers alter their tactics.",
      "Fentanyl precursors are \"indeed one of our main concerns because drug synthesis techniques and methods are constantly evolving,\" lab director Hua Zhendong told NBC News.",
      "\"We have not found such processing plants domestically,\" he said, so \"most of the relevant information comes from technical exchanges with U.S. counterparts.\"",
      "Hua said the latest precursor chemicals identified by the U.S. \u201care added to our monitoring list so we can strengthen our attention to these substances.\"",
      "He said that banning all fentanyl products outside medical use in 2019 had \"effectively curbed illegal production and trafficking.\"",
      "U.S. officials say that's not the case. As Washington and Beijing seek common ground on the issue, experts say halting the illicit flow of fentanyl components is easier said than done.",
      "\u201cI think there is an assumption here that if the Chinese really wanted to shut off these precursors, they could do it,\u201d said Michael Swaine, a senior research fellow in the East Asia Program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a Washington-based think tank, speaking ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting.",

      "So while there might be a \u201csymbolic effort\u201d to deal with the fentanyl issue after the Trump-Xi meeting, he said, \u201cI don't think that this is going to go completely away.\u201d"

    "summary": "Hurricane Melissa, which made landfall in Jamaica and Cuba this week, followed what has become a familiar pattern for major storms as the climate changes.",
    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa, which made landfall in both Jamaica and Cuba in the last two days, followed what has unfortunately become a familiar pattern for major storms in a warming world.",
      "The most catastrophic storms \u2014 those with the most intense winds and soaking rains \u2014 were once rare, but they are becoming more likely because of climate change. And similarities are emerging among these powerful hurricanes\u2019 behavior and timing, too.",
      "Before Melissa hit Jamaica as a Category 5 monster, it churned over especially warm waters \u2014 as did other hurricanes over the past decade. This allowed it to strengthen at blistering pace, becoming the most powerful of this year\u2019s Atlantic season and tying the record for strongest landfall ever in the Atlantic.",
      "Then the storm slowed to a crawl, giving it more time to dump rain on Jamaica, another hallmark of hurricanes on a warming planet. Melissa\u2019s timing, too, was notable: It formed late in the season \u2014 hurricane activity has typically been thought to peak in early September \u2014 as ocean heat lingered into the fall.",
      "Taken together, this behavior makes Melissa a kind of poster child for the new normal of hurricanes, experts said.",
      "\u201cThese storms aren\u2019t the same storms as a couple decades ago,\u201d said Shel Winkley, a meteorologist at the nonprofit research group Climate Central.",
      "It\u2019s a shift with life-or-death consequences \u2014 one that forecasters and officials in storm-prone areas are now watching closely.",
      "Intensifying in a hurry",
      "One of Melissa\u2019s most eye-opening characteristics is how remarkably fast it intensified. In just 18 hours, it exploded from a tropical storm into a Category 4 Sunday, before reaching Category 5 strength early Monday.",
      "Climate change is increasing the risk of this \u201crapid intensification\u201d pattern, which the National Hurricane Center defines as an increase in sustained wind speeds of at least 35 mph over 24 hours.",
      "In Melissa\u2019s case, Winkley said, unusually warm sea-surface temperatures in the Caribbean and high levels of moisture in the atmosphere caused an \u201cextreme rapid intensification.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten really good at forecasting and understanding when hurricanes are going to make a big boost in intensity, but with Melissa, it even exceeded the best forecast that we can make for it in terms of wind speed,\u201d he said.",
      "Winkley added that the storm passed over Caribbean waters that were 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than usual \u2014 conditions that climate change made up to 700 times more likely.",
      "Two-and-a-half degrees Fahrenheit may not sound like a lot when it comes to a giant hurricane, but small temperature differences can really make a big impact,\u201d Winkley said.",
      "Many other recent storms have undergone rapid intensification. Last year, Hurricane Milton\u2019s wind speed increased by 90 mph in roughly 25 hours, and in 2022 Hurricane Ian went through two rounds of rapid intensification before making landfall in Florida. The list goes on: Hurricanes Idalia in 2023, Ida in 2021 and Harvey in 2017 all underwent rapid intensification, too.",
      "Fewer hurricanes, higher impact",
      "In the past 35 years, the number of hurricanes and tropical cyclones that form annually has been decreasing.",
      "\u201cWe find that the number of hurricanes globally, including typhoons, has gone down significantly since 1990,\u201d said Phil Klotzbach, an atmospheric scientist who studies hurricanes at Colorado State University.",
      "But that overall decrease is largely due to a drop in cyclone activity in the Pacific, Klotzbach said; Atlantic hurricane activity has risen, primarily as a result of a decades-long trend toward La Ni\u00f1a, a seasonal circulation pattern that tends to weaken the high-altitude winds that discourage hurricane formation.",
      "\u201cLa Ni\u00f1a is good for the Atlantic if you like hurricanes,\u201d Klotzbach said.",
      "When hurricanes do develop, they\u2019re more likely to turn into major storms as the seas warm.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase of those reaching Category 4 and 5,\u201d Klotzbach said.",
      "Melissa was the third Category 5 hurricane this year \u2014 the first time in two decades that more than two storms of such power have formed in the same season.",
      "Zachary Handlos, an atmospheric scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said that although warmer seas in the future will be more conducive to hurricanes, a warmer atmosphere will force changes to the high-altitude winds that can prevent or destroy hurricanes. These winds could strengthen in some locations and weaken in others, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a very straightforward answer.\u201d",
      "How these trends will play out remains an active area of research and scientific dispute.",
      "A longer hurricane season",
      "It\u2019s not lost on experts that the strongest hurricane of the season hit just days before Halloween.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re pretty late into the season at this point. Things should be starting to wind down,\u201d said Derrick Herndon, a researcher in the Tropical Cyclone Research Group at the University of Wisconsin.",
      "The Caribbean has always been a hotspot for powerful, late-season hurricanes, but they\u2019re becoming even more likely, Klotzbach said \u2014 he recently submitted research showing the trend for peer review. At the same time, hurricane data in the era of satellite observations (from 1971 to 2022) suggests that hurricane season is beginning earlier in the year, too.",
      "The fall hurricane pattern has been fueled by the long-term trend toward the La Ni\u00f1a pattern, Klotzbach added, which itself is likely the result of a combination of climate change and natural variability.",
      "La Ni\u00f1a weakens high-altitude winds at a time when Caribbean waters are still hot, setting the stage for storms in late October and early November, he said: \u201cIt loads the dice toward these robust hurricanes.\u201d",
      "Hurricane Melissa was exacerbated by warmer-than-usual waters off Jamaica\u2019s southern coast.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to get a really intense hurricane in the Atlantic, it\u2019s going to probably be in this part of the world,\u201d Herndon said.",
      "In the past, such a storm would typically have churned up cold water from below the surface and stifled its own growth, according to Andy Hazelton, a hurricane modeler and associate scientist with the University of Miami\u2019s Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies. But this year, ocean heat is elevated both at the surface and as deep as 200 feet below, he said, so Melissa simply churned up more heat and energy.",
      "Storms are stalling",
      "Just before or after landfall, hurricanes are now more likely to stall and dump immense amounts of rain, according to a study published last year. Other research suggests their forward speed has gotten slower overall, though this remains a topic of debate.",
      "Hurricane Melissa followed the pattern, stalling off the coast of Jamaica as it continued to build intensity. On Tuesday morning, the day of its first landfall, the storm was moving at just around 2 mph. Forecasters expected up to 30 inches of rainfall in parts of Jamaica, which is more than a third of its annual average.",
      "Scientists have not reached a consensus about why some storms are moving more slowly, but some have theorized that it\u2019s because climate change has weakened atmospheric circulation patterns.",
      "Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was a dramatic example of the consequences of such stalling: When it parked over Houston, the storm dropped about 5 feet of rain in some locations. The pattern is particularly problematic because a warmer atmosphere can absorb and deliver more rainfall.",
      "\u201cFor every 1 degree Fahrenheit of warming, the atmosphere can hold onto 4% more moisture,\u201d Winkley said. \u201cWarmer oceans not only boost the intensity of hurricanes, but it allows for more evaporation, so it\u2019s putting more of that rain-making moisture into the atmosphere for these hurricanes to absorb and then unleash.\""

      "Alan Arnette, a mountaineering expert from Colorado who has climbed Mount Everest, told NBC News that it would most likely be a recovery operation.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s delayed by at least 12 to 18 hours, which almost eliminates any chance of finding anybody for recovery, for rescue. So it turned into a recovery operation, and the No. 1 rule of recovery is for the rescuers not to become the victims,\u201d Arnette said.",
      "\u201cThey must go very carefully and very slowly, take care of the injured first, evacuate them out by helicopter when it\u2019s safe and then look for the bodies, if possible,\u201d he added.",

      "\u201cEach person has not only [a] name, but also a fate and a face,\u201d Sima Velkovic, the leader of Yad Vashem\u2019s family roots research team, told NBC News. \u201cWe want to know: Who were these people?\u201d",
      "Between 1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered approximately 6 million Jews across Europe \u2014 about two-thirds of the continent\u2019s Jewish population \u2014 through mass shootings, forced labor, starvation and extermination camps such as Auschwitz. Millions of others, including disabled people and political dissidents, were also killed under Adolf Hitler\u2019s regime.",

      "How they did it",
      "Reaching this milestone was not easy.",
      "\u201cThere never was a list of Holocaust victims,\u201d said Alexander Avram, director of the Hall of Names and the Central Database of Shoah Victims\u2019 Names at Yad Vashem.",
      "\u201cThe Nazis and their collaborators did not issue death certificates. \u2026 In most cases the Jews were just killed or gassed or \u2026 no registration whatsoever,\u201d Avram told NBC News in an interview inside the Hall of Names memorial.",
      "Men, women and even children were shot into unmarked mass graves. At extermination camps, the Nazis burned the remains of Jewish victims in crematoria to hide evidence of genocide.",
      "To reconstruct victims\u2019 identities, Yad Vashem\u2019s researchers have scoured tens of thousands of sources, including archival material.",
      "One of the key sources has been \u201cPages of Testimony\u201d \u2014 biographical fact sheets submitted by survivors and those who knew the victims to preserve their memory.",
      "Each page is vetted carefully, Avram said. Researchers cross-reference submissions with prewar lists and historical events, sometimes requesting additional documentation before accepting a record.",
      "The pages \u201ccan be considered tombstones for the Jews who were assassinated during the Holocaust,\u201d Avram said.",
      "For families like Koza-Culp\u2019s, those pages are far more than data points. \u201cTo now be able to look at that photo and know their names \u2026 and to know a little bit about them, to me, makes them feel real and makes them feel like they mattered,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes them feel like they matter.\u201d",
      "Those names have also reunited branches of a family tree that had been separated for decades.",
      "\u201cThe fabric of our family was ripped apart, and through this \u2026 we\u2019ve stitched it back together a little bit, but \u2026 those scars are kind of always there,\u201d she said.",
      "The race against time",
      "That sentiment drives Yad Vashem\u2019s mission today, as historians race to preserve survivors\u2019 memories while these eyewitnesses to genocide are still alive. Experts estimate that 90% of Holocaust survivors will have died by 2040.",
      "New tools may help. Yad Vashem says artificial intelligence could help researchers scour archival material, possibly helping uncover around 250,000 more names.",
      "But AI cannot track down names that are not in the historical record. Yad Vashem is imploring survivors and their descendants to share their stories now so that the very people Hitler hoped to erase are instead remembered for generations to come.",
      "\u201cThis is the last hour,\u201d warned Avram.",
      "Jesse Kirsch reported from New York City, and Paul Goldman reported from Jerusalem."

      "The Russian government has welcomed these culture war refugees. In 2024, President Vladimir Putin issued an executive order offering temporary residence to people wanting to move to the country because they rejected \"destructive neoliberal ideological attitudes\" of their home countries.",
      "Around 1,500 of these \u201cideological immigrants,\u201d as they\u2019ve been dubbed by the Russian media, including 127 Americans, have applied for temporary residence in Russia, according to the Main Directorate for Migration Affairs.",
      "\"President Putin is an amazing leader and he\u2019s done great things for Russia,\u201d Derek Huffman, 45, said in a video on his family\u2019s YouTube channel on March 9. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like you see on the news.\u201d The social media platform X \u201cis the only place where you get real information\" about America's own problems, Derek says.",
      "The family initially found a community of Russians and westerners on social media who encouraged their move, with donations from some of their 15,000 YouTube subscribers providing financial support after their arrival in Russia. But when Derek Huffman voluntarily joined the Russian army in May, the family became a lightning rod for broader online scrutiny.",
      "Derek Huffman said he joined the Russian army to expedite the family\u2019s applications for Russian citizenship, as well as to show support for their new homeland.",
      "\u201cAbove and beyond the citizenship, the money, a big part of it for me is about the respect and earning our place here in Russia,\u201d he said on the Huffmans\u2019 YouTube channel on May 26.",
      "But in a follow-up video posted in June, which was subsequently deleted, DeAnna Huffman, 42, told viewers that her husband had been \u201cthrown to the wolves.\u201d NBC News viewed a re-upload of the video.",
      "The couple had hoped Derek Huffman would put previous welding experience to use in the repair battalion and \u201cactually be utilized for his skills,\u201d she said in the video. Instead, she said, he was sent to the front line and struggled to understand his training, which was in Russian.",
      "Pro-Ukrainian commentators, keen to publicize hardship for pro-Russian figures, said on social media that Derek Huffman had been killed. A post on X claiming to have access to drone footage of his death has more than 2 million views. NBC News did not find video to substantiate the claim, and DeAnna Huffman denied the reports.",
      "Derek reappeared in several videos on the family\u2019s YouTube channel uploaded on October 25, celebrating his daughter\u2019s birthday and signing forms to receive his Russian passport.",
      "In one filmed in the family\u2019s neighborhood, he said he was back \u201con vacation\u201d after being deployed for six months, and praised his wife for keeping the family going while he was gone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that I\u2019m still alive and doing what I can to survive, and be of service to Russia. I\u2019m so thankful to all the Russian people who have reached out and helped my family while I\u2019ve been gone,\u201d he said.",
      "Another family, the Hares, also moved from Abilene, Texas, to Russia to shield their three sons from what they say are harmful elements of American culture.",
      "\u201cIt was the promise of a country that would not promote the LGBT agenda. We liked the fact that LGBT is basically outlawed here in official ways,\u201d Leo Hare, 62, told NBC News via a video call from the family\u2019s new home in Ivanovo, Russia.",
      "Russia has strict laws against the \u201cpromotion of nontraditional sexual relationships,\u201d which have in practice banned public displays of LGBTQ identity, including wearing or posting the rainbow flag on social media.",
      "His wife Chantelle Hare, 53, says in a video on the family's own YouTube channel that when they lived the U.S., she and her husband preferred to get their news from Alex Jones and Mike Adams, who are far-right commentators and conspiracy theorists. They felt particularly disillusioned with American politics after the 2020 election, and don\u2019t believe Donald Trump\u2019s return to power will change the country enough to convince them to return.",
      "\u201cWhen we left, it was final. We don\u2019t plan to come back. There will not be anything to come back to,\u201d Chantelle Hare said.",
      "The Hares have endured their share of hardship trying to build a new life in Russia.",
      "They say their initial plan to rent an apartment in Moscow fell through just as they boarded the plane from Texas, and the family spent a bitterly cold winter caring for chickens, horses and rabbits on a farm 70 miles south of Moscow in exchange for free board. At one point, they even had to bring the goats and their newborns inside their cabin to keep the animals from dying.",
      "Leo Hare thought their troubles were over when their landlord\u2019s son offered a generous interest rate for investing their $50,000 nest egg in what he described as a car import business. But they only saw one payment before he stopped sending them money and refused to return their money, Leo Hare said.",
      "The couple went to the police and the local court to file complaints about their lost money and with their concerns that they had been swindled, but say they have received no help from law enforcement officials. NBC News contacted Domodedovo police for comment but did not receive a reply.",
      "The Hares\u2019 sons, 17, 15, and 12, have had difficulty adapting to life in Russia, and the two older boys want to return to America, according to their father. They feel isolated and are disappointed that school is not an option since Russia requires students to pass a language test to study in public schools.",
      "Leo and Chantelle, who ran a carpet cleaning business and a mobile snack business back in the U.S., are now working as English tutors. They have found an apartment in Ivanovo, northeast of Moscow, and \u201care living really comfortably now.\u201d They are currently homeschooling their children. Leo Hare said it probably \u201cwould have been a dealbreaker\u201d if they knew about the school restrictions.",
      "The Hares have not met the Huffmans.",
      "Leo Hare says he never considered joining the army because of his age and safety concerns, and says that Derek Huffman \u201cassumed a little too much\u201d about life in the Russian military.",
      "\"We assumed a lot, too,\" he admitted. \"But we do have a faith in Christ and He is leading us, even though we\u2019ve made mistakes.\""

      "Democrats investigating Jeffrey Epstein have intensified their calls for Britain\u2019s former Prince Andrew to answer questions about his links to the disgraced financier, days after King Charles stripped his younger brother of his title.",
      "The calls for testimony from Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, as he is now known, came as new emails emerged showing he suggested a \u201ccatch-up\u201d with Epstein just months after the notorious pedophile was released from prison.",
      "Several Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee told the BBC that Andrew should voluntarily testify before Congress. Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Va., said Saturday that if the former prince \u201cwants to do right by the victims, he will come forward,\u201d noting that his name had been mentioned \u201cmany times\u201d in survivors\u2019 accounts.",
      "Fellow committee member Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., urged Andrew to \u201ccome and testify and tell us what you know\u201d during a Friday interview, while Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., said Andrew\u2019s testimony might be \u201chelpful in getting justice\u201d for survivors.",

      "In April 2010, less than a year after Epstein\u2019s release from prison for soliciting minors, Andrew wrote that it would be \u201cgood to catch up in person.\u201d Epstein had proposed that Andrew meet American banker Jes Staley in London, but Andrew replied that he would be out of the country and might \u201cdrop by\u201d New York later in the year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll look and see if I can make a couple of days before the summer,\u201d he wrote.",

      "That account was challenged last month when the Mail on Sunday and the Sun on Sunday newspapers published another email reported to have been sent by Andrew to Epstein in 2011, not verified by NBC News.",
      "\u201cWe are in this together,\u201d the newspapers reported that the email read. \u201cPlay some more soon.\u201d",

      "Pressure mounted following the posthumous publication of late Epstein survivor Virginia Giuffre\u2019s posthumous memoir, which details her allegations that Andrew had sex with her on multiple occasions.",
      "Andrew reached a legal settlement with Giuffre for an undisclosed amount in February 2022 after she filed a civil case against him in a New York court accusing him of sexually assaulting her when she was 17 years old. He has repeatedly denied having met her and previously denied that a photograph of the two of them is real.",

      "But what\u2019s known as the International Stabilization Force (ISF) is far from a reality, and so far it lacks a detailed mission, confirmed participants and sources of funding. So as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire frays \u2014 Israel carried out airstrikes in Gaza on Tuesday after, it said, Hamas fighters attacked its forces \u2014 several experts questioned its viability in interviews with NBC News.",

      "Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto did say in a speech at the United Nations in September that his country was ready to deploy troops to Gaza.",
      "According to Rubio, one complication is that many of the countries that have said they are willing to send troops, money or both would require a United Nations resolution or an international agreement to authorize their involvement. Israel has long been deeply critical of the role the U.N. plays in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, accusing it of bias and of perpetuating the conflict by maintaining Palestinians in a permanent refugee status.",
      "Hamas, which hasn\u2019t commented on the ISF plans, is also a wild card.",
      "Even in the \u201cbest case scenario,\u201d it would most likely take months to establish any kind of international stabilization force in the enclave, especially if Hamas doesn\u2019t agree to lay down its weapons, said Shapiro, who is a fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council think tank, pointing to a key stipulation of Trump\u2019s plan and a long-standing demand from Israel.",
      "Natan Sachs, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute think tank, said, \u201cIf a security force was charged with disarming [Hamas] and dislodging them as the Trump plan detailed, there is no question to my mind that they would resist that and resist that with force.\u201d",
      "As well as the makeup and number of troops, it isn\u2019t clear how the force would be funded, although Matthew Duss, the executive vice president of the Center for International Policy, a Washington-based think tank, said he thought \u201cthe presumption is that the Arab states, the Saudis, others would be paying for this.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs much as it\u2019s being talked about, there\u2019s very little in the way of details that have been worked out yet,\u201d said Duss, a former foreign policy adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.",
      "Although he was \u201cvery skeptical\u201d about the plan, Duss said an international, U.N.-backed force \u201cbrought stability\u201d in the Balkans after the breakup of the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.",
      "But at a regional level, he said, the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) hadn\u2019t \u201cworked as well.\u201d Tasked with keeping the peace between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group, which, like Hamas, is funded by Iran, UNIFIL peacekeepers have on many occasions been caught in the crossfire or come under attack themselves.",
      "\u201cYou need a force there that is just going to create some measure of law and order,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven that the Gaza Strip has been utterly devastated, this is an enormous task \u2014 even the most committed and efficient military would have trouble in this scenario. We saw how the United States struggled in occupying Iraq and Afghanistan.\u201d"

      "Andrew Mountbatten Windsor: No longer a prince, but is he no longer a threat to the British monarchy?",
      "King Charles III's move to banish his brother was largely welcomed Friday by the British media, politicians and royal observers as a necessary, if overdue, intervention.",
      "It\u2019s the fourth attempt by Buckingham Palace to shield itself from the scandal over Andrew's ties to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and the king will be hoping it is the last.",
      "Andrew, who just two weeks ago announced he would relinquish the use of his Duke of York title, has now been formally stripped of it and all his other royal titles, and effectively evicted from the 30-room mansion where he has lived for more than 20 years. It marks a dramatic culmination of a saga that has proved so damaging for the institution as it navigates waning popularity, family feuds and health crises.",
      "\"The king realized that it wasn't enough for him to just say that he would no longer use his title Duke of York, but more action had to be taken,\" NBC News royal contributor Emily Nash said. \"He understood that this was really getting to a point where it was doing very serious damage to the royal family.\"",
      "Nash pointed to just how rare a step Charles has taken \u2014 the last prince to be stripped of his title was punished for fighting for  Germany in World War 1.",
      "Andrew first stepped back from royal duties in 2019 after his disastrous BBC interview in which he cited an inability to sweat that he said contradicted allegations against him, and in 2022, Queen Elizabeth II stripped him of his royal and military patronages.",
      "The move two weeks ago appeared designed to head off fallout from a renewed wave of revelations. But instead they appeared to open the floodgates.",
      "The token rent of \"one peppercorn\u201d that Andrew has reportedly paid on his sprawling Royal Lodge home since funding its renovation two decades ago drew outrage not just from the press, but also in Parliament, as the scandal threatened to break long-standing norms that helped shield the monarchy from public scrutiny.",
      "On Monday, Charles was heckled by a protester who shouted about whether he had \u201casked the police to cover up\u201d for his brother, and how long he had known about Andrew and Epstein.",
      "Then came the statement from Buckingham Palace. \"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,\" it read.",
      "The measures taken by the king received approving coverage Friday in much of the tabloid media, and were welcomed \"warmly\" by a government minister, as well as the leaders of the opposition Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties.",
      "\u201cThe monarchy can see that the PR war has been lost until now, and to win it, they need to show distaste for what Andrew has done and show solidarity with the victims,\u201d said royal historian Andrew Lownie, author of a recent biography of Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson.",
      "Lownie said he believed there may even be grounds for a criminal investigation.",
      "The publication of late Epstein survivor Virginia Roberts Giuffre\u2019s posthumous memoir, which added new detail to her allegations that Andrew had sex with her on at least three occasions, had intensified the pressure on the royals.",
      "Giuffre, with whom Andrew settled a suit in 2022 for an undisclosed amount after she accused him of sexually assaulting her when she was 17 years old, committed suicide in April. Andrew has repeatedly denied having met her and previously denied that a photograph of the two of them is real.",
      "In his statement two weeks ago, Andrew cited \u201cthe continued accusations about me\u201d as a distraction. \u201cAs I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me,\u201d he said.",
      "Charles' expression of solidarity with Epstein's victims, \"stood in total contrast,\" to this, said Craig Prescott, who teaches law at Royal Holloway, University of London, and specializes in the constitutional and political role of the monarchy.",
      "\"That difference speaks volumes,\" he said. \"This is the most drastic move the king could have made.\"",
      "Charles\u2019 order comes with immediate effect and Andrew will be forced to leave Royal Lodge as soon as is practicable. He will move to a property on the royal family\u2019s private estate 140 miles away in Sandringham, though it is understood that Ferguson will not be joining him.",
      "Buckingham Palace said the king\u2019s decision was made with the support of the wider family, including his son and heir, Prince William \u2014 who is widely viewed as supporting a firmer stance on Andrew as he looks ahead to his own reign.",
      "But not everyone is satisfied by Andrew being cast out from the royal family.",
      "\"Being told that you have to live in your own house and being called by your name is not a punishment,\" said Graham Smith, the chief executive of the anti-monarchy campaign group, Republic.",
      "Smith called for a proper investigation into Andrew's ties with Epstein and the role the rest of the family may have played in the scandal.",
      "He added that Republic was pursuing a private prosecution, which could culminate in the public prosecutor taking over the case if there's deemed to be enough merit.",
      "Lownie said Charles may have decided to kick Andrew out now because, \u201cthey\u2019re worried new revelations might come out about his relationship with Epstein.\u201d",
      "But, he added, \u201cThe king has done what he can.\u201d"
