      "NEW YORK -- In his dreams, Raymond Chandler could conjure tales as unsettling as some of his greatest novels, as if haunted by the spirits of Kafka and Edgar Allan Poe.",
      "\u201cNightmare,\u201d a brief and rarely seen sketch published this week in The Strand Magazine, finds the author of \u201cThe Long Goodbye,\u201d \u201cFarewell, My Lovely\u201d and other crime fiction classics imagining himself in prison \u201csomewhere\u201d for a murder he does not remember committing.

      "\u201cAs I was wondering, apparently rather audibly, about the date set for my execution, the guard said to me, \u2018After a bit you\u2019ll get a letter with the envelope addressed in your own writing. That will tell you the date for your hanging,'\u201d Chandler wrote.",
      "\u201cNightmare\u201d was found recently among the papers of Chandler's assistant, Jean Vounder-Davis, that were sold last year through the Doyle auction house. Other items included Chandler's 1953 Olivetti Studio 44 typewriter, unpublished drafts of early novels and a two-page list of 46 things he hated, among them \u201cgolf talk\u201d and \u201cnovels about people who can\u2019t make any money.\u201d",
      "Strand Managing Editor Andrew F. Gulli purchased \u201cNightmare\u201d at auction but declined to say how much he paid. Writing in the current edition of The Strand Magazine, Gulli called the piece a perfect illustration of Chandler's \u201cability to evoke so much with so little.\u201d He believes \u201cNightmare\u201d was likely written in the early 1950s, before the death of Chandler's wife, Cissy, whom the author mentions in a footnote. Cissy Pascal Chandler died in 1954, five years before the death of Raymond Chandler.",

      "\u201cPut simply, the jury has spoken. Its verdict represents an \u2018affirmative indication of innocence,\u2019\u201d the lawyers said.",

      "Lear deBessonet, the new artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, has chosen \u201cRagtime\u201d as her first show",
      "NEW YORK -- When Lear deBessonet, the incoming artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, was thinking about what should be her first show as its new leader, she landed on something sweeping, very American \u2014 and some unfinished business.",
      "She had just directed an off-Broadway concert version of \u201cRagtime\u201d \u2014 a big, soaring musical celebrating early 20th-century America \u2014 that had wowed critics despite being a bare-boned production with some actors reading from their scripts. Might it fit the bill if she filled it out?",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re hoping is to make work that\u2019s going to be meaningful in people\u2019s lives, and I really felt that it was. And that it was in a way that wasn\u2019t finished,\u201d the Tony Award-nominated director says. \u201cIt really warranted the full flourishing of the idea.\u201d",
      "She gets her wish this fall as 33 actors buoyed by an 28-piece orchestra announce her arrival with a full-throated Broadway revival of the stage version of E.L. Doctorow\u2019s bestselling novel. Previews begin Friday; opening night is Oct. 16.",
      "\u201cRagtime'' is the story of three distinct groups of characters navigating their way through the turbulent racial and economic times of 1906 in New York City \u2014 a Jewish immigrant with his young daughter, a well-to-do white family and a Black piano player.",
      "\u201cBecause \u2018Ragtime\u2019 has, in fact, so many stories with multiple protagonists, there is an opportunity for people to connect with it in many different ways that reflect their own history, their own family\u2019s history, their own experience,\u201d she says.",
      "Tony Award-nominee Joshua Henry leads the cast and views it as the perfect musical for this moment. \u201cHow we see each other, how we hear each other is right now at the forefront,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI think \u2018Ragtime\u2019 puts the spotlight on how we have been successful and not successful doing that in the past, and I feel that\u2019s going to help us move forward.\u201d",
      "The revival is part of a slate of shows that deBessonet is crafting for the multi-Tony Award-winning, three-theater complex on the Lincoln Center campus, one that has built a reputation for new plays and sumptuous revivals of great musicals.",
      "\u201cThe work we make here I want it to be something that anyone of any background \u2014 whether they are visiting New York City or were born here \u2014 could come in and feel restored to humanity, feel connected to other people,\u201d she says. \u201cPart of why I\u2019m such a passionate advocate for the theater as an art form is, I really believe, it\u2019s a place where we can gather across difference.\u201d",
      "DeBessonet this season is also bringing over the London hit \u201cKyoto,\u201d a political thriller about the climate accords, and a revival of \u201cThe Whoopi Monologues\u201d with Kerry Washington and Kara Young. There also will be a family holiday opera and a comedy series in its rooftop off-Broadway venue.",

      "Cuban teenagers Fabio and Diego Abreu are part of a new wave of musicians revitalizing Cuba\u2019s music scene",
      "HAVANA -- Cuban teenagers Fabio and Diego Abreu seem shy at first, but the moment they step on stage, they become confident, filling a concert hall in downtown Havana with a hypnotic form of traditional jazz.",
      "The Abreu brothers, aged 19 and 17, are part of a new generation of musicians revitalizing Cuba\u2019s music scene. They are filling a void left by established performers who have emigrated or stayed abroad as the island endures one of its most dire economic crises in decades. Their rise is also fueled by the opening of small, private venues for their shows and the relatively recent spread of internet access on the island, which they use for promotion.",
      "\u201cWe do what we like and we\u2019re fortunate enough to make a living from what we love, which is music,\u201d 19-year-old Fabio Abreu said shortly before a concert at the F\u00e1brica de Arte Cubano, a sprawling cultural center housed in a former factory that now operates as an art gallery, music venue and nightclub.",
      "And it's not just good old traditional jazz like that of the Abreus. Young musicians in Cuba are experimenting with everything, mixing traditional Cuban music like timba and salsa with newer, more daring sounds like electronic music and hip hop.",
      "The Cuban music scene is both complex and interesting, said Michel Hern\u00e1ndez, a writer and journalist specialized in music. \u201cThe recent migration of major Cuban artists \u2014 many with established careers \u2014 has created a void that is now being filled by a new generation of musicians,\u201d he said.",
      "The emerging scene is highly hybrid, he said, blending rock, pop and electronic music with traditional Afro-Cuban music styles such as \u201cson,\u201d which is the root of salsa. The phenomenon has led to the rise of new genres, including the highly commercial \u201creparto,\" a genre that originated in Havana\u2019s working-class neighborhoods and is known for its explicit lyrics.",
      "In addition to new sounds, many of these artists are now performing in small, private bars that have opened over the last decade. And lacking a formal record industry, young Cuban artists rely heavily on social media and the internet \u2014 a tool only widely available on the island since late 2018. They also depend on music videos, some of which are made with very low production budgets, that are shared between phones.",
      "One of them is Melanie Santiler, a 23-year-old pop singer and songwriter who has gained a following among young people. She credits online videos for much of her success. Her Instagram account boasts 248,000 followers, while her YouTube channel has 73,000.",
      "\u201cWe emerging musicians are the ones carrying the flag and shaping the future of Cuban music,\" she said. \u201cFor me, this is a decisive moment.\u201d",

      "Acclaimed Italian actor Claudia Cardinale has died at the age of 87",
      "ROME -- Acclaimed Italian actor Claudia Cardinale, who starred in some of the most celebrated European films of the 1960s and 1970s, has died in France, her agent said Wednesday. She was 87.",
      "Cardinale died in Nemours, France, surrounded by her children, her agent Laurent Savry told The Associated Press.",
      "Praise for Cardinale's talent, beauty and impact on the European cinema poured in on Wednesday, with French President Emmanuel Macron saying, \u201cWe French will always carry this Italian and global star in our hearts, in the eternity of cinema.\u201d",
      "Cardinale starred in more than 100 films and made-for-television productions, but she was best known for embodying youthful purity in Federico Fellini\u2019s \u201c8\u00bd,\u201d in which she co-starred with Marcello Mastroianni in 1963.",
      "Cardinale also won praise for her role as Angelica Sedara in Luchino Visconti\u2019s award-winning screen adaption of the historical novel \u201cThe Leopard\u201d that same year and a reformed prostitute in Sergio Leone\u2019s spaghetti western \u201cOnce Upon a Time in the West\u201d in 1968.",
      "Italian Culture Minister Alessandro Giuli offered condolences to Cardinale\u2019s family and hailed Cardinale\u2019s beauty and \u201cexceptional talent\u201d that inspired \u201cmilestones\u201d of Italian cinema.",
      "\u201cWith the death of Claudia Cardinale, one of the greatest Italian actresses of all time has passed away,\u201d he said in a statement late Tuesday.",
      "Cardinale began her movie-career at the age of 17 after winning a beauty contest in Tunisia, where she was born of Sicilian parents who had emigrated to North Africa. The contest brought her to the Venice Film Festival, where she came to the attention of the Italian movie industry.",
      "Before entering the beauty contest she had expected to become a school teacher.",
      "\u201cThe fact I\u2019m making movies is just an accident,\u201d Cardinale recalled while accepting a lifetime achievement award at the Berlin Film Festival in 2002. \u201cWhen they asked me \u2018do you want to be in the movies?\u2019 I said no and they insisted for six months.\u201d",
      "Her success came in the wake of Sophia Loren\u2019s international stardom and she was touted as Italy\u2019s answer to Brigitte Bardot. While never achieving the level of success of the French actor, she nonetheless was considered a star and worked with the leading directors in Europe and Hollywood.",
      "\u201cThey gave me everything,\u201d Cardinale said. \u201cIt\u2019s marvelous to live so many lives. I\u2019ve been living more than 150 lives, totally different women.\u201d",

      "Miles Mykkanen has come a long way since his musical theater dreams shifted to opera at Juilliard",
      "NEW YORK -- Miles Mykkanen grew up wanting to sing and dance on Broadway, but he was turned down by the musical theater programs he applied to for college. So he had to \u201csettle\u201d for studying opera at the Juilliard School at Lincoln Center.",
      "\u201cAt 18, when your sights are set on 42nd Street and then you\u2019re getting called to 65th Street, it was weirdly a letdown,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut after a few hours I kind of slapped myself and said \u2018Miles, pull yourself together.\u2019\u201d",
      "That was 16 years ago, and he has since pulled himself together to such an extent that at age 34 he\u2019s just opened the Metropolitan Opera season in a leading role in a new opera, \u201cThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay.\u201d",
      "With a libretto by Gene Scheer and score by Mason Bates, the opera is based on the novel by Michael Chabon. Mykkanen portrays Sammy Clay, a Jewish kid growing up in World War II-era Brooklyn who teams with his cousin, Czech refugee Joe Kavalier, to create a comic strip hero modeled on Superman.",
      "He\u2019ll also be back at the Met in the spring in another modern opera, Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho\u2019s \u201cInnocence.\u201d He plays the Bridegroom, a part he first sang in 2024 when San Francisco Opera gave the work\u2019s U.S. premiere.",
      "Mykkanen had sung at the Met before, mostly attracting little attention in small parts, though his haunting rendition of the Holy Fool in Mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cBoris Godunov\u201d in 2021 drew critical acclaim.",
      "\u201cBut this season is so ideal,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cAll of a sudden my schedule came together, and I thought, my God, where did this all come from.\u201d",
      "When the Met was casting \u201cKavalier & Clay,\u201d it was Michael Heaston, the artistic administrator, who thought of Mykkanen for the role of Sammy.",
      "\u201cI first became acquainted with Miles when he was still a student at Juilliard, and he immediately impressed me,\u201d Heaston said. \u201cHe is a singer who can straddle genres, that rare artist who can sing a heartfelt operatic aria in one moment and then turn on a dime to a classic tune from the American Songbook.",
      "\u201cWhen I looked at Mason\u2019s score and considered the vocal and acting demands alike, it seemed tailor-made for Miles.\u201d",
      "Mary Birnbaum, who taught Mykkanen acting at Juilliard, said she\u2019s not surprised at his sudden rise to prominence.",
      "\u201cHonestly it\u2019s what I thought he would do all along,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very American sound, and it\u2019s appealing and it\u2019s lush. But also he\u2019s bold as an actor \u2026 and he makes material look better for being in it.\u201d",
      "By coincidence, both his roles this season are people who have something to hide. \u201cThey are characters with two huge secrets that are kind of gnawing away at them,\u201d Mykkanen said.",

      "\u201cAs a gay man myself, it\u2019s been really rewarding for me to be working on this role, thinking back to my coming out process 20 years ago now,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cSammy wants to believe there\u2019s a future for him, but he keeps struggling and wondering if the world will ever get past its prejudice and accept him.\u201d",
      "\u201cInnocence\u201d deals with the lingering effects of a school shooting 10 years later, and as secrets are peeled away, the Bridegroom\u2019s role in the horrific events is gradually exposed.",
      "Mykkanen relishes the very different musical challenges the two roles provide. Saariaho\u2019s score for \u201cInnocence,\u201d he said is composed with a kind of \u201cmathematical\u201d precision. \u201cWhen I first cracked it open, it was overwhelming because of the time signatures, the key signatures. You\u2019re trying to figure out, what was she thinking, how do you put this all together?\u201d",
      "\u201cKavalier & Clay,\u201d written in a style that uses what Bates calls \u201csymphonic electronica,\u201d has been easier to learn. \u201cI almost feel it\u2019s starting to carve a new genre in opera,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cSomething American opera has been trying to find in the last decade or so. \u2026 I don\u2019t want to stay to say it\u2019s musical theater, but at times it\u2019s very colloquial.\u201d",
      "Mykkanen grew up in the remote Ironwood region of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, where both his parents were high school band directors. Though he displayed a talent for singing at a young age, it was show music rather than opera that inspired him. When his parents found him a classical voice teacher, \u201cFor me it was a means to an end, to develop my voice so I could sing on the Broadway stage.\u201d",
      "Though his career now takes him all over the U.S. and to Europe, Mykkanen still calls the Ironwood region home. In 2020, he launched an arts festival called Emberlight that has grown into a two-month summer program of live performance, film, art shows and talkbacks with visiting artists. When he\u2019s not on site he handles logistics remotely and also relies heavily on volunteers.",
      "\u201cJust being the person who with a lot of other people behind me brings art to this region which is rural and remote \u2026 It\u2019s been one of the big blessings of my life,\u201d he said.",
      "And when he isn\u2019t performing, he returns. \u201cI have a room in my parents\u2019 basement where I store my stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m between contracts I come back here and stay with my mom and dad. \u2026 I\u2019lll call them from Amsterdam and say \u2018OK, what are we having for dinner next Tuesday when I land.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cKavalier & Clay\u201d runs through Oct. 11. Also starring are baritone Andrzej Filo\u0144czyk as Joe; soprano Lauren Snouffer as his sister, Sarah; soprano Sun-Ly Pierce as Rosa Saks, and baritone Edward Nelson as Tracy Bacon. Met music director Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin conducts the production directed by Bartlett Sher.",

      "Pamela Anderson has embraced a makeup-free lifestyle at 58, attending fashion shows and film premieres with a bare face",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Pamela Anderson has nothing against makeup. It's just that she's been there, done that in her younger years. That's why now, at 58, she's attending fashion shows and film premieres with a blissfully bare face.",
      "It's a look, especially for older women, that serves to plague and perplex. Do we chase youth (and relevancy) with a full face, or do we foster radiant skin and march on makeup free?",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be the prettiest girl in the room,\u201d Anderson told Vogue ahead of a recent show she attended during Paris Fashion Week. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s just freedom. It\u2019s like a relief.\u201d",
      "Down here in the non-celebrity world, is it just as easy and comfortable to go makeup free? Some proponents of the look, along with style and beauty experts, weigh in.",
      "Women, particularly older women, are not universally giving up makeup, but Anderson, Alicia Keys and other celebrities who have publicly shown off bare faces have certainly inspired some to cast it off.",
      "Working women, however, acknowledge difficulties doing that on the job \u2014 especially in traditional, less creative work spaces.",
      "\u201cI do still think that there are some politics associated with it. More around feeling and looking polished,\u201d said Deborah Borg, the chief of human resources for a creative-leaning company that has roughly 25,000 employees.",
      "She said she's seen more women come into work makeup-free since COVID, and thinks the pandemic significantly altered the workplace dynamic.",
      "Borg, 49, gave up makeup four years ago, save an occasional swipe of her bold, signature red lipstick. At Dalya, a cozy clothing shop in New York's trendy Soho neighborhood, she lent herself as a model to demonstrate how to help one's bare skin glow and how to use attire and accessories to accentuate the look.",
      "Makeup artist Rebecca Robles counseled Borg and others with mature skin to think hydration when choosing products to make the most of their bare faces.",
      "Robles recommends a five-step workday routine: A gentle cleanser that doesn't strip the skin; a vitamin C serum to brighten and mitigate fine lines; a moisturizer with sun protection; a separate broad-spectrum sunscreen for an extra boost (don't forget to apply that to the ears); and a glossy lip balm for a bit of added polish.",
      "No mascara? No problem. Use a lash curler to offer a bit of pop to the eye, Robles said. And gently brush brows into place to complete the look.",
      "Find products with hyaluronic acid and ceramides, Robles suggests, and always swipe up with skincare products. Minimize tugging and pulling on the skin.",
      "\u201cWhen your skin is glowing, one thing that\u2019s really fun to keep in mind is that light reflects off that moisture in the skin and can help blur out any fine lines or enlarged pores. So it\u2019s win-win,\u201d Robles said.",
      "She advised that each product should sit for a minute or two before the next step is applied.",
      "Borg emphasized the ease of her morning routine since going makeup free. She used to spend about 30 minutes just on makeup. Now, she does hair and face in half that time.",

I don\u2019t have to do that. I can make the choice if I want to go no makeup, minimal makeup, full glam. I can have those choices,'\" she said.",

      "First, with clothes, \"use a lot of color. I call it our filter,\u201d Tincher said.",
      "Secondly, play with texture; it determines how light will be reflected. \u201cSo if you have something more matte, that is going to create a more soft lighting on you. If you have more silk satin, like say something like a blouse, it\u2019s going to be more like a laser beam,\u201d she said.",
      "Finally, accessorize. Tincher said added touches like lapel pins, earrings and necklaces can provide a finished polish \u2014 especially if that polish is still expected at work. A considered style can offset judgments about going makeup free, she said.",
      "\u201cThink of your outfit as the big picture. When you walk in, what is the statement that it\u2019s making? It\u2019s not just about one part of you, it\u2019s your whole presence in a room,\u201d she said.",

      "Makeup, she said, \u201cfelt like prison.\u201d She stopped gradually, giving up foundation first. But still, she's not above applying a bit of mascara on special occasions.",

      "The North American box office has slowed down after a strong September.",
      "Neither a Jordan Peele-produced horror nor a Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell romantic drama were enough to continue the September hot streak at the movies. After back-to-back weekends that had films majorly overperforming, first \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rights\u201d followed by the anime \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Infinity Castle,\u201d the North American box office slowed significantly.",
      "Overall ticket sales were down nearly 50% from last weekend, with the holdover champion \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d edging out the newcomer \u201cHim\u201d for first place, according to studio estimates Sunday. Crunchyroll and Sony Pictures\u2019 \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d added $17.3 million over the weekend, bringing its total to $104.7 million, which makes it the highest grossing anime film ever in North America.",
      "The football horror \u201cHim\u201d opened in second place with an estimated $13.5 million in ticket sales. Universal Pictures opened \u201cHim\u201d in 3,168 North American theaters, where the audience was 52% male and 65% over the age of 25. Internationally, it earned $400,000.",
      "Produced by Peele\u2019s Monkeypaw and directed by Justin Tipping, \u201cHim\u201d is about a promising young quarterback (Tyriq Withers) who is invited to train with a veteran (Marlon Wayans) at an isolated compound.",
      "\u201cHim\u201d scored with neither critics (it carries a 29% on Rotten Tomatoes) nor audiences, who gave the film a C- CinemaScore. In his review for The Associated Press, film writer Jake Coyle wrote that the film \u201cwas made with the potent premise of bringing the kind of dark, satirical perspective that characterizes a Monkeypaw production to our violent national pastime. But that promise gets fumbled in an allegorical chamber play that grows increasingly tedious.\u201d",
      "\u201cHim\u201d was also nearly upstaged by another horror, \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rights,\u201d which made an estimated $13 million in its third weekend. With a global total of $400 million, it\u2019s now the biggest film in the Conjuring universe.",
      "They are two of three horror movies in this weekend's top 10, including \u201cWeapons.\u201d According to data firm Comscore, this year that genre alone has generated $1.1 billion in domestic box office receipts, just several million short of the 2017 record driven by \u201cIt\u201d and \u201cGet Out.\u201d",
      "\u201cHorror movies have been on a bit of a hot streak,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore's head of marketplace trends. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a record-breaking year.\u201d",
      "In addition to \u201cDemon Slayer,\u201d Sony had a new film this weekend as well: The original romance \u201cA Big Bold Beautiful Journey,\u201d starring Robbie and Farrell, but that fizzled with audiences, earning only $3.5 million from 3,300 locations. It also received largely negative reviews and currently has a 37% on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cAudiences are selective in what they want to see,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cNegative reviews can create really strong headwinds for original films with no brand recognition.\u201d",
      "In its second weekend, \u201cDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale\u201d added another $6.3 million, bringing its running total to $31.6 million. The Stephen King adaptation \u201cThe Long Walk\u201d is also estimating $6.3 million in weekend two, down only 46% from its opening. Its domestic total of $22.7 million has already exceeded its production budget of $20 million (though that sum does not account for marketing and promotion).",
      "Ron Howard\u2019s 1995 hit \u201cApollo 13\u201d played in 200 theaters this weekend for its 30th anniversary as well. It made an estimated $600,000. The 30th anniversary re-release of \u201cToy Story,\u201d now in its second weekend, added $1.4 million.",
      "Next weekend there is excitement surrounding the new Paul Thomas Anderson film \u201cOne Battle After Another,\" although his biggest hit to date remains the 2007 film \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d which made just over $76 million worldwide, not accounting for inflation.",

      "Anthony Roth Costanzo, who introduced $11 tickets to Opera Philadelphia, aims to surprise audiences again with the company\u2019s new season as it celebrates its 50th anniversary",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Anthony Roth Costanzo, the man who brought $11 opera tickets to Philadelphia, hopes to keep surprising audiences during the company\u2019s new season.",
      "\u201cIt is very much opera. It\u2019s dramatic, it\u2019s cathartic, it\u2019s collaborative in interdisciplinary ways,\u201d Costanzo said of Opera Philadelphia\u2019s 50th anniversary season \u2014 the first he\u2019s been able to plan since taking charge of the financially teetering company last year. \u201cBut it\u2019s different from what your perception of opera might be.\u201d",
      "He slated a work by Rossini to kick things off, with opening night set for Friday. But instead of choosing a repertory staple, Costanzo picked the less-familiar \u201cIl viaggio a Reims.\u201d And the production will be anything but traditional: Director Damiano Michieletto has changed the original setting from an inn to an art gallery where the portraits come alive and sing.",
      "After that the offerings become even more adventurous. There\u2019s a multimedia piece by playwright Sarah Ruhl set to music by Vivaldi \u2014 including \u201cThe Seasons\u201d \u2014 and starring Costanzo, who maintains a flourishing performing career as a countertenor. Then comes a world premiere with libretto by Pulitzer-winner Michael R. Jackson and a score by 10 different composers. Another new opera follows, by Gregory Spears, in which the chorus has the starring role. Finally, bass-baritone Dav\u00f3ne Tines performs a \u201cvaudevillian rendering\u201d of a poem by Langston Hughes.",
      "\u201cAs I put all of the pieces together, I thought, how can I encapsulate this in just a few simple words,\u201d Costanzo said. \u201cAnd what occurred to me was: \u2018Opera, but different.\u2019 And that is the slogan of the season.\u201d",
      "His pride in the lineup is understandable, especially given that when he took over it wasn\u2019t certain there would even be a 2025-26 season.",
      "The company was nearing bankruptcy and needed to quickly raise $4 million, he recalled.",
      "Almost immediately he instituted a \u201cpick your price\u201d policy under which people could buy tickets to any seat in the house starting at $11. (The website gives buyers a range of higher options and invites them to make a donation on top of the purchase. Season subscriptions at higher prices are also still available.)",
      "\u201cI said OK, I have to think like a venture capitalist,\u201d Costanzo said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to spend money to make money. Besides, he said, the old pricing system was projected to bring in only 8% of the revenue the company needed, so little was at risk from the new policy.",
      "The publicity and good will generated by the move helped the company quickly raise $7 million in donations, more than enough to retire the debt. When tickets went on sale for 2024-25, all three operas sold out within three weeks, and the season ended with a surplus of $2.4 million.",
      "Corrado Rovaris, the company\u2019s longtime music director, was on the podium for the season-opening performance last fall of Missy Mazzoli\u2019s \u201cThe Listeners,\u201d a recent work having its U.S. premiere.",
      "\u201cIt was amazing to see the reaction in the house,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBeautiful to see a full house but also to see such an enthusiastic house. Beautiful and very moving.\u201d",

This year a similar percentage are either first-timers or repeats from last season.",

      "Although Harris earned a reputation as guarded and circumspect, the book has the tone of someone who is finished biting her tongue. She concedes mistakes, reveals frustrations and details some of the stranger moments from her race.",
      "The book isn't a winding memoir or a political treatise, and Harris doesn't disclose any future plans. Instead, it reads like a ticking time bomb, with each chapter counting down to Election Day.",

      "Biden's team appeared to be in denial. Afterward, they gave Harris talking points that said \u201cJOE BIDEN WON.\"",

      "Bacteria that are difficult to treat due to the so-called NDM gene primarily drove the increase, CDC researchers wrote in an article published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said.",
      "Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.",

The bill also could help get the death penalty carried out again in the ninth-largest U.S. state.",

North Carolina last carried out an execution in 2006.",

      "Brown, whose criminal record included serving more than five years in prison after pleading guilty to robbery using a deadly weapon, had been charged in January in Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, with misusing the 911 system, a misdemeanor, according to court records.",
      "But a magistrate \u2014 a nonelected local court official who often determines if a defendant can be released while awaiting trial \u2014 released him on a written promise to return for court. And it took more than six months for a court to order a mental evaluation for him. Brown\u2019s mother told Charlotte-area television that she had sought an involuntary psychiatric commitment this year after he became violent at home.",
      "GOP Sen. Ralph Hise said the legislation has nothing to do with winning political points, but rather is a response to the failure of the criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cWe need a criminal justice system that protects society from individuals. I believe these are many great steps in this bill,\u201d Hise said.",
      "The measure, named \u201cIryna\u2019s Law,\u201d would prohibit cashless bail for certain crimes and eliminate some of the discretion that magistrates and judges have for pretrial release decisions.",
      "For example, first-time defendants accused of a violent offense could only be released on a secured cash bond or receive house arrest with electronic monitoring. Such house arrest and monitoring would be the only option for some repeat defendants.",
      "The bill also attempts to ensure that more suspects are subject to psychological examinations before their potential release. Defendants accused of a violent crime and committed involuntarily in recent years to a mental health facility would be subject to a psychological evaluation.",

      "The report attributes most of the administrative costs to the implementation of changes in determining eligibility and enrolling people, along with duplicative technology, training and coordination while the state litigated to overcome Biden administration objections.",
      "\u201cNow the entire country can see what we in Georgia already know \u2014 Georgia\u2019s Medicaid work reporting requirement program is the real waste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d Sen. Raphael Warnock, one of the Georgia Democrats who requested the report. \u201cThis report shows that Pathways is incredibly effective at barring working people from health coverage and making corporate consultants richer,\" his statement said.",
      "A spokesperson for Republican Gov. Brian Kemp countered that Democrats are responsible for the extra spending.",
      "\u201cNow, as other states prepare to adopt our model and reject one-size-fits-none big government healthcare, Democrats like Senators Ossoff and Warnock are trying to rewrite history after four years of inaction and blame the State for costs associated with their own stonewalling.\"",
      "Millions of eligible people will lose coverage due to the Trump law because the administrative process will make it too difficult for them to repeatedly document their work, critics say, pointing to what happened in Georgia, which is so far the only state that imposes work requirements.",
      "Georgia has among the highest rates of uninsured and is one of 10 states that refused to expand Medicaid to all adults with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, as envisioned by President Barack Obama's health care overhaul.",
      "Instead, Kemp heralded his July 2023 launch of Georgia Pathways to Coverage, which limits Medicaid for adults to those who earn no more than poverty-level wages, now set at $15,650 a year. Georgia's traditional Medicaid still covers poorer children, disabled adults, poor people in nursing homes and a handful of other adults.",
      "Nationally, most adults on Medicaid in states that expanded it are already working, and in Georgia, an estimated 246,365 adults are potentially eligible for traditional Medicaid or Pathways. But a year after it launched, Pathways had enrolled around 4,300. As of this spring, there were 6,514 adults enrolled, according to the state Department of Community Health.",

      "Nearly 90% of this spending has been federal money, and Georgia used $20 million in other federal grants to help implement the program, trying to make it easier for people to apply. More spending is planned this year on improvements, publicity and staff training, the report notes.",

      "Life Alliance didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "More than 100,000 Americans are on the transplant list and thousands die waiting because there aren\u2019t enough donations to go around. Last year there were more than 48,000 transplants, a record, the vast majority from deceased donors.",

      "A vaccine advisory committee handpicked by U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. met in Atlanta for two days this week to consider various vaccine recommendations",
      "NEW YORK -- A vaccine advisory committee handpicked by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met in Atlanta this week to consider whether to revise recommendations on shots against COVID-19, hepatitis B, and a combination shot that protects children against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.",
      "The panel, which is charged with making vaccine recommendations, declined to recommend COVID-19 vaccines, saying instead that people could make individual decisions \u2014 a move that adds confusion as people weigh whether to get a dose this fall.",
      "During the sometimes chaotic two-day meeting, the panel also recommended new restrictions for a vaccine that protects against chickenpox as well as measles, mumps and rubella. In a surprise move, the group indefinitely postponed an expected vote on hepatitis B shots given to infants on the day they are born.",
      "With Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, leading the country's health agencies, the meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, struck a different tone from past gatherings. Among the 12 members, all chosen this year by Kennedy after he fired the previous 17-member panel, are people who have criticized and spread misinformation about vaccines. Critics say the panel's makeup and agenda could sow distrust in the shots.",
      "The panel's recommendations will be sent to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency that has been rocked by disagreements over Kennedy's vaccine policies. The panel's recommendations are usually adopted by the CDC, and then widely followed by doctors and insurers.",
      "Here are some takeaways from the meeting.",
      "The panel on Friday debated COVID-19 vaccinations as the virus has remained a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths last fall and winter, according to CDC data.",
      "Until now, the vaccinations had been routinely provided to nearly all Americans who wanted them. The Food and Drug Administration recently put new restrictions on this year\u2019s shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax, reserving them for people over 65 or younger ones who are deemed at higher risk from the virus.",
      "Panelists declined to recommend the shots for anyone, including seniors and high-risk populations. They said individuals could make their own decisions. Removing the recommendations that were previously in place may confuse Americans trying to decide whether and how to get their fall boosters.",
      "The panel also urged the CDC to adopt stronger language around claims of vaccine risks, despite pushback from outside medical groups who said the shots had a proven safety record from the billions of doses administered worldwide.",
      "The divided panel narrowly avoided urging states to require a prescription for the shot.",
      "Several states have announced policies to try to ensure people's access to COVID-19 vaccines, worried about Friday\u2019s ACIP decision. And a group representing most health insurers, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said earlier this week that its members will continue covering the shots through 2026.",
      "The committee recommended that a combined vaccine known as MMRV should not be given to children under 4. Instead, they said in an 8-3 vote with one abstention, children in this age group should get separate vaccines \u2014 one for MMR and another for varicella, or chickenpox.",
      "Their discussions centered on rare feverish seizures that can occur in kids who receive the first dose, between the ages of 1 and 2. Medical experts agree these seizures, while potentially frightening for families, are not linked to brain function or school problems.",
      "In 2009, the ACIP changed a previous recommendation to advise that either the combination shot or separate shots were acceptable for the first dose.",
      "Some doctors and public health experts say they are not aware of any new safety data that would explain the revisiting of those vaccination recommendations.",
      "About 85% of children already receive separate doses for the first round, according to information presented at the meeting.",

Government insurance programs like Medicaid, for example, would have to stop paying for the early combo dose if the acting CDC director accepts the panel's guidance.",
      "Ever since the ACIP panel in 2005 recommended a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns, cases of the liver virus among infants have dropped by more than half.",
      "Nonetheless, the committee opted to revisit the guidance in this week's meeting, with members questioning whether babies born to moms who test negative for hepatitis B really need a vaccine at birth.",
      "The panelists considered whether to recommend delaying that initial vaccination \u2014 something doctors and parents already can choose to do.",

      "But several outside medical experts criticized that the committee was debating the issue at all and said the vaccine is safe and successful at reducing infant infections.",
      "After discussing it on Thursday, the panel decided Friday morning to indefinitely postpone a vote on the issue.",
      "Chairman Martin Kulldorff opened the meeting by challenging former CDC directors to a public debate. Several doctors representing outside medical groups accused the panel of not following the CDC\u2019s long-established guidelines in weighing evidence for making recommendations.",
      "CDC staff, as usual, presented numerous studies on the topics being debated, explaining how they chose which research to discuss. But a few times, panel members cited different papers they had found, including ones done in mice, which are not generally considered applicable.",
      "The committee also took a vote on Thursday that they had to redo on Friday morning concerning the government\u2019s Vaccines for Children program, which covers vaccine costs for about half of U.S. kids. On Friday, they voted to align coverage under the program with their guidance on MMRV shots. A day earlier, they had voted no on the idea.",

      "They suggested the new panel was selectively using its recommendations to justify specific conclusions, rather than considering all the evidence.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s troubling to see the erosion of the committee\u2019s integrity,\u201d said Dr. Sandra Fryhofer of the American Medical Association.",

      "Police at the scene recovered three semiautomatic rifles that are restricted for civilian use.",
      "The case highlighted a growing trend: Restricted-use, military-style firearms are increasingly ending up in the hands of Brazilian criminal organizations, according to a study published Tuesday by the Sou da Paz Institute, a Brazilian nonprofit that tracks gun violence. Most of the guns are made in Brazil, but in second place are those that come from the United States.",
      "The victim, Ant\u00f4nio Vin\u00edcius Lopes Gritzbach, had received death threats from a powerful international criminal group called First Command of the Capital, or PCC, after he agreed to a plea bargain to testify about his ties to the organization.",
      "Found at the scene were a Smith & Wesson semiautomatic rifle bought by a U.S. citizen 15 years before at a gun shop in Winchester, Virginia and abandoned in a backpack near Sao Paulo\u2019s international airport, according to police records reviewed by The Associated Press.",
      "The other two were Romanian-made weapons, also purchased in the United States. Authorities have not determined how the guns entered Brazil.",
      "The study by Sou da Paz Institute analyzed restricted firearm seizures from 2019 to 2023 in Brazil\u2019s southeast, the country\u2019s largest region and home to both Sao Paulo\u2019s PCC and a group based in Rio de Janeiro called Red Command.",
      "Researchers reviewed records of nearly 7,000 seized guns, combining data obtained through freedom of information requests with police records from the region\u2019s four states. The data included seizure dates, locations, crime types and weapon details.",
      "It showed an 11.4% increase in the seizures of restricted, military-style guns over the five-year period.",
      "The study attributes at least part of the rise in heavy weaponry in criminal hands to looser gun regulations in Brazil under former President Jair Bolsonaro, who authorized many kinds of weapons once restricted to military and police use for civilians, including 9 mm pistols and some semiautomatic rifles.",
      "The number of privately owned firearms nearly doubled, from 1.3 million at the end of 2018 to 2.9 million in 2022, according to the study. Some of these guns were diverted to the illegal market, after an increase of reported stolen guns from sport shooters and collectors.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that weaker gun controls during the Bolsonaro administration opened a new pathway for organized crime: cheaper, with a veneer of legality and enabled by straw buyers of rifles,\u201d said Carolina Ricardo, executive director of Sou da Paz.",
      "In July 2023, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva signed a decree tightening restrictions on civilian access to guns, reversing the pro-firearms policies of his right-wing predecessor.",
      "The decree restored restrictions on semiautomatic weapons, reduced the number of guns civilians can possess for personal safety from four to two and required documentation proving the need to hold the weapons. Lula also tightened weapon registration requirements.",
      "While the majority of seized firearms were Brazil-made, U.S.-origin weapons ranked second. The U.S. was the main foreign source of both complete firearms and unmarked components feeding Brazil\u2019s illegal market, the study showed.",
      "Natalia Pollachi, one of the authors of the study, said there is a well-documented smuggling route from the U.S. to Brazil through Paraguay, Peru and Bolivia. The study found that not only complete firearms but also separate components for restricted-use weapons from the U.S. are illegally entering Brazil and being assembled locally.",
      "\u201cThe United States plays a key role because parts and components are sold there with far less regulation. Police reports often show these items being smuggled into Brazil,\u201d Pollachi added.",
      "Ricardo, of Sou da Paz, said that if the U.S. government believes the growth of organized crime threatens its interests\u2014 as it has with Mexico and Canada \u2014 it must also recognize that weak gun controls in the U.S. directly fuel organized crime in Brazil.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fair for the U.S. to demand action from Brazil,\u201d the executive director of Sou da Paz said, \u201cbut it must first admit it is part of the problem.\u201d",

      "MANZINI, Eswatini -- A Jamaican man who was among five migrants deported by the United States to Eswatini in Africa has been repatriated to his home country, Eswatini authorities and his lawyers said.",
      "Orville Etoria, 62, was held in a maximum-security prison in Eswatini for more than two months without charges or access to legal counsel, his lawyers said Tuesday. They accused the U.S. of deporting him there unlawfully in mid-July.",
      "The lawyers had said U.S. officials sent him to the southern African nation under the Trump administration's third-country deportation program even though Jamaica was willing to take him back. They alleged Etoria and the four other men were then repeatedly denied visits by a lawyer while they were held at the prison.",
      "Etoria's lawyers at the New York-based Legal Aid Society confirmed his repatriation, saying in a statement that he had been arbitrarily detained in Eswatini. The case was \u201ca grave injustice that underscores the dangers of the U.S. government\u2019s continued third-country deportations,\" the statement said.",
      "The U.S. has sent more than 30 deportees to at least four African countries since July under the new program: South Sudan, Eswatini, Rwanda and Ghana. It has an agreement with another Africa nation, Uganda, though no deportations there have been announced yet. Rwanda said it has ultimately agreed to receive up to 250 deportees.",
      "The U.S. has said it wants to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Eswatini, a tiny kingdom bordering South Africa where the king holds absolute power and has been accused of clamping down on pro-democracy movements.",
      "Abrego Garcia\u2019s wrongful deportation to his native El Salvador and ongoing case has become a flashpoint in U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on immigration.",
      "Etoria was repatriated on Sunday with the assistance of the United Nations\u2019 International Organization for Migration, Thabile Mdluli, the Eswatini government\u2019s acting spokesperson, said in a statement.",
      "She said there were \u201cengagements\u201d with the other four men from Cuba, Laos, Vietnam and Yemen to have them sent home.",
      "The five men were described as dangerous criminals by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. It said they had been sent to Eswatini because their home countries refused to take them back.",
      "Eswatini, in an apparent contradiction of that, said they were only there in transit and would be sent home.",
      "The five men had been convicted of serious crimes including murder and child rape, and all were in the U.S. illegally and had deportation orders, DHS said. Their lawyers said they had all completed their criminal sentences but were sent overseas to be held in another prison without charges or due process.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- The Trump administration Tuesday designated the Barrio 18 gang as a foreign terrorist organization, joining other Latin American criminal groups receiving the designation in recent months.",
      "Barrio 18, largely based in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, originated in the United States as a street gang in Los Angeles created by young Salvadoran immigrants as a way to protect themselves. When many of their members were deported from the U.S. to El Salvador, the gang expanded and gained power across Central America, where it continues to terrorize communities.",
      "In recent years, the gang has been dealt a powerful blow by El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, who has waged war on the country's gangs, imprisoning more than 1% of El Salvador's population for alleged gang ties with little evidence or access to due process. That has sharply dropped crime rates in El Salvador, but also fueled accusations of mass human rights abuses by the government.",
      "In a statement on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the designation \u201cfurther demonstrates the Trump administration\u2019s unwavering commitment to dismantling cartels and gangs and ensuring the safety of the American people.\u201d",
      "Bukele has long referred to members of the gang as \u201cterrorists\u201d and even built a mega-prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center. It was that same lockup where 200 Venezuelan deportees were held earlier this year as part of an agreement with Trump.",

      "Nearly 1.9 million people were relocated across Guangdong province, the southern Chinese economic powerhouse. A weather station in Chuandao town recorded maximum gusts of 241 kph (about 150 mph) at noon, a high in Jiangmen city since record-keeping began. Huge waves battered Zhuhai city\u2019s coastline and strong winds buffered trees under intense rain. Fallen branches were scattered on the streets.",
      "State broadcaster CCTV said the typhoon made landfall along the coast of Hailing Island in Yangjiang city at about 5 p.m., packing maximum winds near the center of 144 kph (89 mph). It is forecast to keep moving west, prompting the suspension of some train services in the Gunagxi region on Thursday. Chinese officials allocated 150 million yuan ($21 million) for relief efforts in Guangdong, Hainan and Fujian provinces.",
      "Schools, factories and transportation services were initially suspended in about a dozen cities, but a few of them distant from the landfall location were preparing to resume work as winds weakened",
      "The fierce winds, brought by Ragasa, once a super typhoon, woke Hong Kong residents in the early hours, and many went online to describe scenes like a kitchen ventilation fan being blown down and a crane swaying.",
      "Strong winds blew away parts of a pedestrian bridge\u2019s roof and knocked down hundreds of trees across the city. A vessel crashed into the shore, shattering a row of glass railings along the waterfront. Areas around some rivers and promenades were flooded, including cycling lanes and playgrounds. At several promenade restaurants, furniture was scattered chaotically by the winds. 90 injured people were treated at hospitals.",
      "A video that showed waves of water crashing through the doors of a hotel and flooding its interiors went viral in the financial hub. The hotel has not immediately commented on the incident. But staff were seen cleaning up the lobby, with parts of its exterior damaged.",
      "Hong Kong and Macao, a nearby casino hub, canceled schools and flights, with many shops closed. Hundreds of people sought refuge in temporary centers in each city. Streets in Macao turned into streams with debris floating on the water. Rescue crews deployed inflatable boats to save those who were trapped. The gambling city's local electricity supplier suspended its power supply in some flooded, low-lying areas for safety.",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s observatory said Ragasa had maximum sustained winds near the center of about 195 kph (120 mph) and skirted around 100 kilometers (62 miles) to the south of the city. Hong Kong categorizes cyclones with sustained winds 185 kph or stronger as super typhoons to make residents extra vigilant about intense storms.",
      "The observatory said Ragasa is the strongest tropical cyclone in the northwestern Pacific and South China Sea region so far this year. Preliminary analysis showed it also ranks as the second-strongest one in the South China Sea region since the observatory's record-keeping began in 1950, tying with typhoons Saola in 2023 and Yagi in 2024, it said.",

      "She had become pregnant, and after doctors in the Greenlandic town of Maniitsoq terminated her pregnancy, they fitted her with an intrauterine contraceptive device, commonly known as an IUD, or coil.",
      "Now 52 and living in Denmark, Petersen recalled being told she had been fitted with the device before leaving the hospital.",
      "\u201cBecause of my age, I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said tearfully. \u201cI kept it inside me and never talked about it.\u201d",

      "\u201cToday, there is only one real thing to say: Sorry,\u201d Frederiksen said in Danish, after Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen delivered a somber address in Greenlandic. \u201cSorry for the wrong that was done to you because you were Greenlanders. Sorry for what was taken from you, and for the pain it caused.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany of you have been fighting for years for justice and for us to listen, for us to take responsibility, and we\u2019re doing that now: Denmark and Greenland together,\" Frederiksen said, lamenting \"a chapter in our shared history that should never have been written.\u201d",

      "An independent investigation, published earlier this month, found Inuit victims, some 12 years old and younger, were either fitted with IUDs or given hormonal birth control injections. They were not told details about the procedure, nor did they give their consent.",
      "Some described traumatic experiences that left them with feelings of shame as well as physical side effects, from pain and bleeding to serious infections.",
      "While the report covered the experiences of 354 women who spoke with investigators, Danish authorities say more than 4,000 women and girls \u2014 reportedly half the fertile women in Greenland at the time \u2014 received IUDs between the 1960s and mid-1970s. It\u2019s not known how many of those cases lacked consent.",

      "The alleged purpose of the forced contraception was to limit population growth in Greenland by preventing pregnancies. The population on the Arctic island was rapidly increasing at the time because of better living conditions and better health care. Greenland took over its own health care programs in 1992.",

The missiles are one of Iran\u2019s few military deterrents after the war decimated its air defense systems \u2014 something that Tehran long has insisted will never be included in negotiations with the West.",
      "Missile experts told AP that obtaining the mixers is a goal for Tehran, particularly as it prepares for possible United Nations sanctions to be reimposed on the country later this month. The sanctions would penalize any development of the missile program, among other measures. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian is due to address the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday.",
      "Known as planetary mixers, the machines feature blades that revolve around a central point, like orbiting planets, and offer better mixing action than other types of equipment. Iran could purchase them from China, where experts and U.S. officials say they've purchased missile fuel ingredients and other components in the past.",
      "\"If they\u2019re able to reacquire some key things like planetary mixers, then that infrastructure is still there and ready to get rolling again,\u201d said Sam Lair, a research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies who studied Iranian missile sites.",
      "Iran's mission to the United Nations did not respond to questions about the country's efforts to rebuild its missile program.",
      "Solid-fuel missiles can be fired faster than those using liquid fuel, which must be loaded just before launch. That speed can make the difference between launching a missile and having it destroyed in a launcher \u2014 something that happened during the war with Israel.",
      "Iran has solid-fuel missile manufacturing bases at Khojir and Parchin, two sites just outside Tehran, as well as at Shahroud, some 350 kilometers (215 miles) northeast of the capital. Even before the most recent war, all of those sites came under Israeli attack in October 2024 during hostilities between the countries.",
      "Attacks during the war in June appeared aimed at destroying buildings that housed the mixers, which are needed to ensure the missile fuel is evenly combined, according to experts. Other sites struck by Israel included manufacturing facilities that likely could be used to make the mixers.",
      "Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC taken this month and analyzed by AP show construction at both the Parchin and Shahroud facilities.",
      "At Parchin, mixing buildings appear to be under repair, Lair said, and similar rebuilding is happening at Shahroud involving mixing buildings and other structures.",
      "The speed at which Iran is rebuilding shows the importance Tehran puts on its missile program. Iran's bombed nuclear sites so far have not seen the same level of activity.",
      "During the war, Iran fired 574 ballistic missiles at Israel, according to the Washington-based Jewish Institute for National Security of America, which has a close relationship with the Israeli military. In two exchanges of fire before the war, Iran launched another 330 missiles, the think tank said.",
      "The Israeli military had estimated Iran's total arsenal at around 2,500 missiles, meaning that over a third of its missiles were fired.",
      "Before the war, Iran was on track to be able to produce more than 200 solid-fuel missiles a month, said Carl Parkin, a summer fellow at the James Martin Center. That drew Israeli strikes to missile-building facilities.",
      "\u201cIsrael\u2019s targeting indicates that they believed mixing was a bottleneck in Iran\u2019s missile production,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Iran is able to overcome their mixing limitations, they\u2019ll have all the casting capacity that they need to start producing at high volumes again.\u201d",

      "Iran may choose to rely on China to obtain mixers and the chemicals to make solid fuel.",
      "Such chemicals may have caused a massive explosion in April that killed at least 70 people at a port in Iran. Iran still has not explained the blast, which happened as its diplomats met with Americans in Oman over its nuclear program.",
      "Just days after the explosion, the U.S. State Department sanctioned Chinese firms it said provided the Islamic Republic with \u201cballistic missile propellant ingredients.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Iran's Revolutionary Guard likely supplied a planetary mixer to an underground ballistic missile construction facility in Syria near the town of Masyaf, some 170 kilometers (105 miles) north of the capital, Damascus, near the Lebanese border. Footage released by the Israeli military months after the September 2024 raid on the facility showed the mixer, which bore a resemblance to others sold online by Chinese firms.",
      "Iran's president and military officials visited Beijing earlier this month for China's Victory Day parade. Iran's government has provided no detailed readout on what Pezeshkian said to Chinese President Xi Jinping, and China's state-run media offered no indications that Tehran asked for help.",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry, asked about possibly supplying Tehran mixers and fuel ingredients, told AP that Beijing is \u201cwilling to continue leveraging its influence to contribute to peace and stability in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina supports Iran in safeguarding its national sovereignty, security and national dignity,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cAt the same time, China is deeply concerned about the continued escalation of tensions in the Middle East.\u201d",

      "Sheikh Abdulaziz's role as grand mufti put him as one of the top Islamic clerics in the world of Sunni Muslims. Saudi Arabia, home to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, hosts the annual Hajj pilgrimage required of all able-bodied Muslims once in their lives, making the pronouncements of the grand mufti that much more closely followed.",
      "While closely aligned to Al Saud ruling family, which has allowed women to drive, opened movie theaters and further socially liberalized in recent years, Sheikh Abdulaziz denounced extremists like those in the Islamic State group and al-Qaida. He also made pronouncements during his time as grand mufti viewed as sectarian and more following Saudi Arabia's Wahhabism, a strictly austere form of Islam that for decades saw the kingdom segregate the sexes, restrict music and follow other puritanical pursuits.",
      "Saudi Arabia's state media reported Sheikh Abdulaziz's death, without offering a cause. The kingdom's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who runs the kingdom's day-to-day governance under his 89-year-old father, King Salman, attended funeral prayers for the late mufti on Tuesday night in Riyadh.",
      "\u201cWith his passing, the kingdom and the Islamic world have lost a distinguished scholar who made significant contributions to the service of Islam and Muslims,\u201d the Saudi Royal Court said in a statement.",
      "Sheikh Abdulaziz, who became blind as a young man, became grand mufti in 1999, installed by Saudi King Fahd. At the time, the kingdom remained segregated and its people closely policed by the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. Those views could be seen in the grand mufti's earlier reported comments, such as condemning mobile phone cameras in 2004 for possibly being \u201cexploited to photograph and spread vice in the community.\u201d",
      "Other remarks focused on Christianity. He joined other Islamic leaders in denouncing then-Pope Benedict XVI's 2006 speech quoting a Byzantine emperor as saying some of the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s teachings were \u201cevil and inhuman.\u201d In 2012, responding to a question about Christian churches in Kuwait, Sheikh Abdulaziz reportedly said it was \u201cnecessary to destroy all the churches of the region.\" Those around him later sought to walk the remarks back after they drew outrage from Christian leaders.",
      "Sheikh Abdulaziz also targeted the faith of Islam's Shiites after Iran's supreme leader harshly criticized Saudi Arabia's conduct after a crush and stampede at the 2015 Hajj killed more than 2,400 pilgrims.",
      "\u201cWe must understand they are not Muslims, for they are the descendants of Majuws, and their enmity toward Muslims, especially the Sunnis, is very old,\u201d the Saudi cleric reportedly said. \u201cMajuws\u201d is a term that refers to Zoroastrians and those who worship fire.",

      "He decried the \u201cfake jihad\u201d of Islamic extremists in 2007. Saudi Arabia for years after the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks on the U.S. battled a militant insurgency in the kingdom. He also called the Islamic State group \"enemy No. 1 of Islam.\u201d",

      "But the rise of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed saw Sheikh Abdulaziz soften, change or silence his social stances, particularly on the mixing of men and women, which he once referred to as \u201cevil and catastrophe.\" He also had called women driving \u201ca dangerous matter that exposes women to evil,\" said girls as young as 10 could be married and even described chess as akin to gambling.",
      "In 2018, Saudi Arabia ended its ban on women driving, something Sheikh Abdulaziz later supported. The vice commission lost its sway as movie theaters opened and women took more jobs.

      "Russia now controls about 70% of the Donetsk region. Ukraine's forces have been pushed back to a string of four cities that analysts have dubbed its \u201cfortress belt,\u201d where they've repelled Moscow's efforts to seize the region for years.",
      "But shortages of troops, supplies and chaotic management are making it increasingly hard to resist Russia's relentless pressure in the region.",
      "As the more-than-3-year-old invasion continues despite months of U.S.-led peace efforts, analysts and the military say the country could struggle to resist an intensified push to seize the last cities in the region under Ukrainian control.",
      "Analysts and Ukrainian officers say that Russia is unlikely to engage in protracted urban battles and avoid costly fights like the storming of Bakhmut, which dragged on for months with staggering losses on both sides.",
      "\u201cAfter Bakhmut and Chasiv Yar, the Russians clearly understood that large cities turn into vast cemeteries for their army, where they lose thousands upon thousands,\u201d said Col. Pavlo Yurchuk, whose troops are defending a small city at the northern end of the fortress belt.",
      "To skirt the cities, Russian forces are pushing on the flanks and increasingly using infiltration tactics, sending small groups of soldiers through gaps between Ukrainian units.",
      "Some of these groups have achieved tactical gains, slipping behind the front line to hide in tree lines or basements, occasionally occupying abandoned positions or cutting off supply routes. But the human cost is heavy: of a five-man unit, Ukrainian commanders estimate, two are usually killed, one is wounded, one goes missing, and only one survives to call for a drone to drop water or medicine.",
      "\u201cThese are tactical successes, not strategic ones,\u201d Yurchuk said. \u201cThis tactic is very slow and does not solve the tasks of encirclement or control of large settlements.\u201d",
      "Drones and glide bombs are also playing a crucial role, allowing Russia to hit troops and supplies headed for the front and to weaken Ukraine's strongholds without head-on fighting.",
      "This summer, Russian forces stepped up attacks at the northern and southern ends of the Donetsk belt. Their strategy, Ukrainian officers say, is to sever supply lines and surround the region\u2019s cities rather than storming them directly.",
      "The region \u2014 one of four that Russia illegally annexed in 2022, though it did not control any of them \u2014 became the epicenter of the fighting since the start of the full-scale invasion.",

It was occupied during part of the first year of the full-scale invasion but liberated in Ukraine\u2019s autumn 2022 lightning counteroffensive.",
      "If Russian forces manage to take Lyman, Yurchuk said, they could use it to build up troops and attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets River, a natural obstacle that helps protect Sloviansk.",

      "While Russia achieves tactical gains without sparing sentiment for human life, Ukraine faces the grinding reality of troop shortages.",
      "Exhaustion and a lack of regular rotations could also weaken Ukraine\u2019s defenses.",
      "\u201cPeople are obviously one of the key problems,\u201d said Taras Chmut, director of the Come Back Alive Foundation, which has raised more than $388 million over the past decade to equip Ukraine\u2019s forces. \u201cNot only the quantity, but their dispersion on the battlefield, the inefficiency of command, and the shortcomings in training and management.\u201d",
      "On paper, he said, some brigades list thousands of soldiers but can only field hundreds in combat, a gap he attributed not to Russian superiority but to mismanagement. He said the chaos means too many soldiers are sometimes doubled up on the same tasks and targets while others are left uncovered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a systemic flaw we can neither admit nor fix,\" he said. \"Until we do, we have to make up for it with technology, with manpower, with the enemy\u2019s weaknesses on the battlefield, and with the courage of people and volunteers who step in where they can.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe overall trend, measured over years, looks unfavorable for Ukraine,\u201d Chmut said, adding that unless changes are made in the rear \u2014 such as fixing management failures in the army \u2014 and no new technology or geopolitical shift emerges, the outlook will remain grim. \u201cThe longer this drags on, the worse it will get \u2014 and without fresh resources the Russians will simply outmatch us in quantity and means.\u201d",

      "Bourbon production at Buffalo Trace Distillery has been connected to the Kentucky River for decades",
      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- The long history of bourbon production at Buffalo Trace Distillery has been connected to the Kentucky River \u2014 summed up as a blessing and curse by a plaque on the grounds.",
      "In the 1800s, long before the Buffalo Trace name was attached to the distillery, the river served as a floating highway to bring in grain and other production essentials and to transport barrels of whiskey to markets along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Even today, river water cools down production equipment. But the river flowing past the distillery flashed its destructive side in April.",
      "A massive flood, caused by days of unrelenting rain, sent the Kentucky River surging over its banks, inundating most of the 200-plus-acre distillery grounds on its main campus in Frankfort. Nearly every phase of production was impacted, as were several warehouses where whiskey is aged.",
      "\u201cIt was just something that was hard to process, but we knew we couldn\u2019t take too much time to process it,\" said Tyler Adams, a distillery general manager. He said they had much to do to recover from the reservoir of murky water that swamped the bourbon-making campus.",
      "Five months later, production at the distillery is back to normal, including of some of the most sought-after bourbons. Its lineup includes the namesake flagship brand, Buffalo Trace, as well as Eagle Rare, W.L. Weller and Blanton's. Pappy Van Winkle bourbons are distilled and aged at Buffalo Trace while the Van Winkle family remains in control of the coveted brand.",
      "The distillery recently filled its 9 millionth barrel of bourbon since Prohibition, just two and a half years since filling the 8 millionth barrel. It has also introduced new whiskeys to its catalogue and is renovating a campus building into a cafe and events center.",
      "The cleanup enlisted hundreds of plant employees and contract workers. Buffalo Trace fans swamped the distillery with offers to pitch in, Adams said. The distillery politely declined and suggested they might assist area residents instead.",
      "Crews removed debris, sanitized equipment and pumped out what was left after floodwaters receded. Bourbon barrels swept into the parking lot caught some attention, Adams said. No chance for sneak samples, though \u2014 the barrels were empty.",
      "Few visible reminders remain of that mud-caked, debris-strewn mess.",
      "Some filled whiskey barrels touched by floodwaters were still being cleaned and tested, but the meticulous task of examining thousands of barrels was nearly complete, the distillery said. Quality control assessments found only small amounts of aging whiskey were impacted. High water marks are etched into some buildings and tour guides casually remind visitors of the epic event.",
      "Danny Kahn, a master distiller for Buffalo Trace's parent company, says he still experiences \"a little PTSD\u201d when recalling those frantic days. River flooding has been a sporadic part of the distillery's history \u2014 including big ones in 1937 and 1978, but in early April, the floodwaters surged to previously unseen heights. Buffalo Trace had also just completed a decade-long, $1.2 billion expansion to double distilling capacity.",
      "\u201cIt actually looked kind of calm, but I knew that it was not calm because we could see buildings were under 10 feet (3 meters) of water,\" Kahn said. \"It was really quite overwhelming.\u201d",
      "Activating their flood plans, workers shut down the distillery and did what they could to safeguard equipment. After that, all they could do was watch and wait. Distillery officials observed the devastation from higher ground and via drone footage.",
      "Once the river crested, it took a few days for the floodwaters to fully recede, but operations gradually sprung back to life. Finished whiskey shipped out the day after the rain stopped. Bottling soon resumed and a makeshift gift shop opened until the visitors' center was repaired. Tours eventually resumed. But bourbon production halted for about a month as the cost for cleanup and repairs surpassed $30 million.",

And when we finally got it done, it was really a sigh of relief and we get back to business as normal.\"",
      "For the American whiskey industry as a whole, it's been anything but business as usual.",
      "After years of growth, prospects turned sour for the sector amid sluggish sales and trade uncertainties as President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs.",

Initial data for the first half of 2025 showed a continued decline, it said. American whiskey exports dropped more than 13% through July of this year compared to the year-ago period, it said. The American whiskey category includes bourbon, Tennessee whiskey and rye whiskey.",
      "Lower domestic sales stem from a mix of market challenges, including supply chain disruptions and changes in consumer purchasing trends, said Chris Swonger, the council's CEO.",
      "\u201cWhile there\u2019s ongoing debate about whether these are temporary headwinds or signs of a more fundamental shift in consumer behavior, large and small distilleries across the country are under pressure,\u201d Swonger said in a statement.",

      "At Buffalo Trace, its future is entrenched alongside the Kentucky River, realizing that more floods could come in the years ahead. The distillery learned lessons to be even better prepared next time.",
      "\u201cThis area being a National Historic Landmark, being right on the river, there\u2019s only so much you can do to hold back that water,\" Adams said. \"Your best bet is to prepare for it, do what you can. But holding back that water? It\u2019s really inevitable it\u2019s going to make it into some spaces.\u201d",

      "Now, Trump's strongest issues are border security and crime, but there were signs of potential weakness on crime in the most recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "At the same time, Trump\u2019s overall approval has been fairly steady in AP-NORC polling since the beginning of his second term. This month, 39% of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling his job as president, which is back in line with his average approval rating after a slight uptick in August. There was a similar pattern during his first White House term, when his approval stayed within a narrow range.",
      "Here are the issues on which he's been strongest and weakest in his second term:",
      "Trump has turned border security into a strength of his second term, a sharp reversal from his first term in office.",
      "Most Americans approve of Trump\u2019s approach to border security. He gets higher marks on that than on his handling of the presidency overall or other issues that had previously been top strengths, including immigration and crime. This has also emerged as a unique strength of his second term. Only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults approved of Trump\u2019s approach to border security in 2019, during which time Trump was focused on securing funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "His approval on immigration is slightly lower than it was early in his second term, but it remains a bit higher than his overall job approval.",
      "In March, about half of U.S. adults approved of his handling of immigration. But the most recent measure found his approval on immigration at 43%, just a tick higher than his overall approval rating.",
      "Even with the slight dip, immigration remains a strength in a way it wasn\u2019t in his first term. Throughout his first term, closer to 4 in 10 U.S. adults approved of his immigration approach \u2014 but when he started his second term, it was about half who approved.",
      "Trump has taken firm steps to deport immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, and the new poll finds that a sizable share of Americans \u2014 about half \u2014 say Trump has \u201cgone too far\u201d in pursuit of that goal, roughly the same share as held that stance in a poll conducted in April.",
      "His approval on how he\u2019s handling crime is also down slightly to 46%, after reaching 53% in August as he deployed the National Guard to Washington. But that still exceeds his overall job approval, and it\u2019s also an advantage among certain groups, like independents. About 4 in 10 independents approve of Trump\u2019s approach to crime, compared with 25% who approve of his approach to the presidency overall.",
      "The economy is often a fraught point for presidents, and there are indications that Americans continue to be concerned about the country\u2019s economic state.",

      "Other than the logo of a school's apparel sponsor, corporate branding patches on uniforms are prohibited by the NCAA. But the NCAA's decision last year to allow commercial advertisements on football fields makes approval of uniform patches seem inevitable.",

      "A potential holdup would be the exclusivity clauses in schools' contracts with apparel partners. Brands such as adidas, Nike and Under Armour do not allow marks of other corporate sponsors on the uniforms they supply to schools.",
      "Gahagan said he and other stakeholders have had promising conversations with the apparel companies to ease that restriction.

      "Nebraska and Texas Tech, like most other power-conference programs, are spending the maximum $20.5 million on direct revenue-sharing payments to athletes this school year. They've had to be creative in finding ways to fund the new expense, and Hocutt said jersey patches show promise.",

      "Grayson, a 63-year-old mother of six and a nurse for 36 years, had gone to the halfway house in Willimantic on Oct. 28, 2023, to administer medication to Michael Reese, who was living there while on probation and after serving prison time for stabbing and sexually assaulting another woman in 2006.",

    "story": [
      "A Trump administration decision to repurpose an old chemotherapy drug for autism has surprised many experts \u2014 including the physician who recently proposed the idea",
      "WASHINGTON -- When President Donald Trump's administration announced it would repurpose an old, generic drug as a new treatment for autism, it came as a surprise to many experts \u2014 including the physician who suggested the idea to the nation\u2019s top health officials.",
      "Dr. Richard Frye told The Associated Press that he'd been talking with federal regulators about developing his own customized version of the drug for children with autism, assuming more research would be required.",
      "\u201cSo we were kinda surprised that they were just approving it right out of the gate without more studies or anything,\u201d said Frye, an Arizona-based child neurologist who has a book and online education business focused on the experimental treatment.",
      "It\u2019s another example of the haphazard rollout of the Trump administration\u2019s Monday announcement on autism, which critics say has elevated an unproven drug that needs far more study before being approved as a credible treatment for the complex brain disease.",
      "A spokesperson for the Republican administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday morning.",
      "The nation\u2019s leading autism groups and researchers quickly distanced themselves from the decision on leucovorin, a derivative of vitamin B, calling the studies supporting its use \u201cvery weak\" and \u201dvery small.\"",
      "\u201cWe have nothing resembling even moderate evidence that leucovorin is an effective treatment for autism symptoms,\u201d said David Mandell, a psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "Mandell and other researchers say the evidence suggests autism is mostly rooted in genetics, with input from other factors, including the age of the child's father.",
      "Nevertheless, a growing number of doctors are prescribing the medication, repurposing versions used for chemotherapy or ordering new formulations from compounding pharmacies.",
      "Many researchers agree the drug warrants additional study, particularly for patients with a deficiency of folate, or vitamin B9, in the brain that may play a role in autism. But for now, they say, it should only be taken in carefully controlled clinical trials.",
      "\u201cWe often say our job is to stay between the yellow lines,\" said Dr. Lawrence Gray, a pediatric developmental specialist at Northwestern University. \u201cWhen people just decide to go outside of current guidelines, then they\u2019re outside of that. And nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen out there.\u201d",
      "The case for leucovorin\u2019s use in autism begins with established science but quickly veers into uncertain terrain.",
      "When metabolized, the drug turns into folate, which is essential for healthy prenatal development and is recommended before and during pregnancy. But far less is known about its role after birth.",
      "The issue caught the attention of Frye and others more than 20 years ago, when research suggested some people with autism had low levels of folate in the brain due to antibodies blocking the vitamin's absorption.",
      "The theory linking autism to folate levels was mostly abandoned, however, after research showed that the siblings of people with autism can also have low folates without any symptoms of the condition.",
      "\u201cI honestly thought this had died out as a theory for autism and was shocked to see its reemergence,\u201d Mandell said.",
      "In 2018, Frye and his colleagues published a study of 48 children in which those taking leucovorin performed better on several language measures than those taking a placebo.",
      "Four small studies in other countries, including China and Iran, showed similar results, albeit using different doses, metrics and statistical analyses, which researchers say is problematic.",
      "Frye struggled to get funding to continue within the traditional academic system.",
      "\u201cI decided to move out of academia to be more innovative and actually do some of this stuff,\u201d he said.",

      "More than 3\u00bd years after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine kick-started efforts to revitalize the Bundeswehr, the challenge of strengthening the German military has grown along with fears of the threat from Moscow.",

      "Earlier this month, the military\u2019s top brass watched as a ferry packed with armored vehicles was escorted out of the Baltic port of Rostock, drones were intercepted in the air and on the water and fighter jets circled above.

      "There's plenty to do on both mat\u00e9riel and personnel, in a country where the military was often viewed with indifference or suspicion given the legacy of the Nazi past.",
      "Germany suspended conscription for men in 2011 and subsequently struggled to attract large numbers of short-term volunteers. In recent years, the number of military personnel has hovered just above 180,000 \u2014 compared with 300,000, more than a third conscripts, in 2001. Now the government wants to raise it to 260,000 over the next decade, and says it will also need around 200,000 reservists, more than double the current figure.",
      "Better pay is one way to make the Bundeswehr more attractive, said Thomas Wiegold, a defense policy expert who runs the Augen geradeaus! military blog. But a key issue is fixing the military's longstanding equipment problems, \u201cbecause a force that doesn't have enough tanks, that doesn't have enough ships, that also doesn't have enough barracks, is not particularly attractive for applicants.\u201d",
      "F-35 fighter jets, Chinook transport helicopters, Leopard 2 tanks, frigates and other hardware are on order after a 100 billion-euro ($117 billion) special fund was set up in 2022 to modernize the Bundeswehr, but they will take time to arrive. This year, Merz\u2019s new coalition enabled higher spending by loosening strict rules on incurring debt, a big step for a historically debt-averse nation.",
      "After conscription was suspended, the Bundeswehr gave up 48 barracks. A report by the parliamentary commissioner for the military earlier this year said that some remaining barracks and other facilities are still in a \u201cdisastrous\u201d state after years of penny-pinching. A program to build new military accommodation now aims to build 76 new buildings by 2031.",
      "The Cabinet last month approved plans for a new military service system meant to tackle the personnel challenge. It foresees more attractive pay and conditions for people who join up on a short-term basis, better training and more flexibility on how long people can serve.",
      "The aim is to draw sufficient recruits without reviving conscription, an idea unpopular with the center-left junior partner in Merz\u2019s coalition, but the plan leaves the door open to do so if not enough people volunteer.",

      "Used car shopping doesn\u2019t mean having to skimp when it comes to modern safety features",
      "In recent years, more and more vehicles at all manner of price points have come equipped with an array of advanced driver assistance systems as standard equipment. Studies from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and other organizations have shown that these features can help you keep your attention on the road and even help avoid or reduce the seriousness of a collision.",
      "But shopping for a used vehicle can be tricky. A vehicle from seven years ago, for example, might have one or two features as standard, and then maybe a few more as optional equipment. If you\u2019re buying used, how do you know what to look for? The automotive experts at Edmunds detail the features that they think you most need to know about and provide advice on how to determine if your next used vehicle purchase will have them.",
      "Forward collision warning is an advanced driving aid that can use audio or visual cues to alert a driver if the system detects that a frontal collision is likely or imminent. Systems generally can detect stationary or moving vehicles, and an increasing number can detect pedestrians and cyclists. If the vehicle is approaching a detected object too quickly, the system will issue a warning.",
      "Automatic emergency braking adds another layer of driver assistance. It utilizes the same sensors used for forward collision warning. If the driver doesn\u2019t react in time to the warning, the vehicle can automatically engage its brakes to slow or stop the vehicle before a collision occurs, or at least lessen the severity of the impact.",
      "While these are two separate features, many automakers routinely bundle them together in a specific trim level or option package. Blind-spot warning is likely to be one of the most familiar advanced driver aids. Like the other systems listed here, it relies on a variety of sensors to let the driver know if a vehicle is out of view. A warning is often communicated with a visual cue located in or near the side mirrors, along with some form of audible warning.",
      "Rear cross-traffic alert comes into play when a vehicle is put into reverse. The system emits audible and visual warnings should something or someone undetected approach from either side. This can be valuable when, for example, reversing out of a parking spot and an otherwise unseen vehicle is quickly approaching from either side.",
      "One of the relatively newer features in this lineup of Edmunds-recommended advanced driver aids, reverse automatic emergency braking applies the brakes when the vehicle\u2019s sensor array detects an impending collision with something immediately behind it. The key benefit being that, even if the driver fails to react in time to various in-car warnings, reverse automatic braking is there to take over. This feature could prevent an expensive encounter with something like a concrete wall or pillar in a crowded parking structure.",
      "Even the best drivers can use some extra help parking in snug situations. This is why Edmunds recommends a surround-view camera system. It goes beyond a typical reverse camera in that it provides a bird\u2019s-eye view of the vehicle.",

      "This is done by a system of cameras located around the car or truck. When in reverse, an overhead image is displayed on the infotainment screen and, in many cases, some form of guidelines and audible warnings are included to alert the driver if a nearby obstacle is too close.",
      "Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t easy. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re shopping for a 2016 Toyota RAV4. Toyota offered an optional package when the vehicle was new that added forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking. Blind-spot warning was also optional. Oh, but you got those features as standard equipment if you bought the top Limited trim of the RAV4. Confused yet? But by 2020, the RAV4 had standard forward collision warning and automatic braking, and a surround-view camera system was optional.",
      "Our main advice is to research the vehicles you\u2019re interested in on auto websites such as Edmunds or check out the government\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website. Using an artificial intelligence agent can also help speed up your search, though you\u2019ll want to check the search\u2019s sources to make sure.",
      "An increasing number of used cars and trucks are outfitted with driver aids that can help drivers avoid an accident and reduce some of the stressors that come along for the ride with everyday driving. As a general rule of thumb, buying the newest year you can will increase your chance of getting more advanced driver aids as standard equipment.",

      "Gold, meanwhile, continued its record-breaking rally and topped $3,800 per ounce. It\u2019s soared nearly 45% so far this year, even more than the U.S. stock market, in part on expectations that the Fed will cut interest rates to help the slowing U.S. job market.",

      "The U.S. pledged $2 billion, with roughly half still accessible via loan guarantees, said Jordan Lee of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change in Jakarta. The JETP always was meant to cover only a portion of the roughly $97 billion needed.

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Tariffs and years of teetering mall traffic have roiled much of the toy industry. But Build-A-Bear investors are continuing to reap sizeable gains.",
      "Shares of Build-A-Bear Workshop are up more than 60% since the start of 2025, trading at just under $72 apiece as of Tuesday afternoon. That compares to just 13% for the S&P 500 since the start of the year, and marks dramatic growth from five years ago, when the St. Louis-based retailer's stock sat under $3.",
      "The toy industry overall has been \u201creasonably soft\u201d in recent years, notes Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData \u2014 but certain categories, including craft-oriented products, have done very well following the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. And that's key to Build-A-Bear's core business model: welcoming consumers into their brick-and-mortar stores to make their own plush animals.",
      "That may also set Build-A-Bear apart from the malls its stores are often inside, many of which have struggled to see overall traffic rebound over the years.",
      "\u201cThe mall may not be a destination, but Build-A-Bear often is \u2014 because it\u2019s often a planned trip,\" Saunders said. \u201cIt\u2019s a store within a mall that many consumers make a beeline for.\u201d",
      "Build-A-Bear still isn\u2019t entirely immune to macroeconomic pressures, but the company's profit has soared to record after record in recent quarters. Last month, the retailer reported what it said were the best results for a second quarter and first half of a fiscal year in the history of the Build-A-Bear, which opened its first store in 1997. Company executives pointed to strong store performance and other expansion efforts.",
      "In the first half of its 2025 fiscal year, the company\u2019s revenues hit $252.6 million and its pre-tax income climbed to $34.9 million \u2014 up 11.5% and 31.5%, respectively, year-over-year.",

Some of that has already trickled down to the cost of Build-A-Bear's merchandise in North America, but Todorovic noted that such levies would impact the company \"even more in the second half of the year.\u201d",
      "Still, he and other executives pointed to preparations Build-A-Bear had made to lessen the blow, including previous inventory increases. The company also maintained that consumer-facing price impacts would be limited.",
      "While the retailer offers some ready-made toys and toy clothing, \"what Build-A-Bear generally buys is materials,\u201d Saunders noted. This can \u201chedge against tariffs much more effectively,\" he explained, as they reduce labor costs and potentially allow for more flexibility on sourcing.",
      "Still, Saunders notes that everyone is going to be affected by tariffs and Build-A-Bear isn't an exception. He adds that consumers will probably \u201ceat that extra cost because they're paying for the entertainment value.\"",
      "Barring any significant changes, Todorovic said in August's earnings call that tariffs are anticipated to cost Build-A-Bear under $11 million for the 2025 fiscal year. But despite that and other costs, he noted that the company is still on track to approach or slightly beat last year's earnings.",
      "The company's latest guidance expects its pre-tax income to reach between $62 million to $70 million for the full 2025 fiscal year, compared to just over $67 million reported in 2024.",

      "In his speech, Miran said, \u201cit should be clear that my view of appropriate monetary policy diverges from those of other\" members of the committee. \u201cI view policy as very restrictive,\u201d he added, meaning that it is holding back the economy and \u201cposes material risks\u201d to the Fed's congressional mandate of seeking maximum employment.",

      "If the Yankees can win the division, they can also secure the best record in the AL for the second straight season, giving them homefield advantage through the AL Championship Series.",
      "New York clinched a postseason berth for the 26th time in 31 seasons. The Yankees have the most postseason appearances since the playoffs were expanded in 1995. The Yankees, Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers are the only teams with eight playoffs appearances in the last nine seasons.",
      "The only time the Yankees missed the playoffs since manager Aaron Boone succeeded Joe Girardi in 2018 was the 2023 season. New York finished with 82 wins and lost Judge for nearly two months after the slugger fractured his toe in a game at Dodger Stadium.",
      "Boone became the third manager in Yankees history to make the playoffs in seven of his first eight seasons, joining Casey Stengel and Joe Torre. Torre reached the playoffs in every season from 1996 to 2007, and Stengel made the playoffs in nine of his first 10 seasons from 1949 to 1960.",

After Trent Grisham bounced into a double play, Judge drew his second intentional walk of the game. Cody Bellinger followed with a walk and Volpe scored on a wild pitch by Eisert. Caballero then punctuated a nine-pitch at-bat against Steven Wilson by looping a single that dropped in front of center fielder Brooks Baldwin as Judge scored the winning run.",

      "After the clubhouse celebration ended, the Yankees moved the festivities to the field and posed for a group picture in center field.",
      "After winning their first AL pennant since 2009 last season, the Yankees won 35 of their first 55 games and built a seven-game lead in the AL East. New York went 25-34 through Aug. 5, lost six of seven in Toronto between June 30-July 23 and dropped out of first place on July 3.",

      "After they took a 48-32 deficit into a halftime harangue from Tibbetts, the Mercury emerged with more of an edge. They used a 12-0 run midway through the third quarter to quickly extinguish the Lynx's 20-point lead and whittled it away to a two-possession game by midway through the fourth quarter.",
      "\u201cYou have to play like that to get back in the game, and that\u2019s exactly what they did,\" said Collier, who went 2 for 8 from 3-point range and made only three shots after halftime.",
      "The Lynx went back up by five after the three-point play by Thomas and still held that lead with under a minute left in regulation, but a costly 5-second call during an inbound play with 46 seconds left gave the Mercury the ball back and Thomas hit a floater to cut it to 77-76.",
      "\u201cWe just could not get that way about us to win the game,\u201d Reeve said.",

      "Corey Seager and Marcus Semien won\u2019t try to return to play this week for the Texas Rangers, ending the fourth season together for middle infielders who have been sidelined since late August",
      "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Corey Seager and Marcus Semien won't try to return to play this week for the Texas Rangers, ending the fourth season together for middle infielders who have been sidelined since late August.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re done. They\u2019re pretty much shut down,\u201d manager Bruce Bochy said Tuesday before the Rangers' 4-1 loss against Minnesota to open their final home series.",
      "Semien has been out since Aug. 22, after the second baseman sustained a broken bone and sprained ligament when fouling a pitch off his left foot. That was a week before shortstop Seager had an appendectomy.",
      "While Seager and Semien are done and the Rangers are out of playoff contention, Bochy said Jacob deGrom (12-8, 3.01 ERA) will make his last scheduled start Wednesday against the Twins. It will be the two-time Cy Young Award winner's 30th start this year after missing most of the past two seasons recovering from Tommy John surgery.",
      "DeGrom already has thrown 167 2/3 innings this season, after only 35 starts and 197 1/3 innings combined the past four seasons. That included his final two injury-plagued years with the New York Mets before leaving in free agency and then having surgery after only six starts in his Rangers debut in 2023, the season of their only World Series title.",
      "\u201cHe wants to pitch,\u201d Bochy said.",
      "Seager and Semien were a half-billion dollar addition for the Rangers in free agency after the 2021 season, when Seager got a $325 million, 10-year contract, and Semien signed for $175 million over seven seasons. The following offseason, deGrom arrived with a $185 million, five-year deal that included a conditional sixth-year club option worth at least $20 million for 2028 that has been triggered because of the time missed injured.",
      "Both Seager and Semien had indicated that they hoped to get back to play this season, especially when the Rangers made a late push for a playoff spot with a 13-3 run that included a pair of six-game winning streaks. But the eight-game losing streak, their longest of the season, dropped them 5 1/2 games behind Houston for the American League's final playoff spot with five games left in the regular season.",
      "When asked about the possibility of two-time World Series MVP Seager coming back this week, Bochy responded, \u201cIt's not worth the risk. He's not quite ready. Same with Marcus.\u201d",

      "Mike Gundy, one of college football\u2019s most colorful coaches over the last two decades, has been fired by Oklahoma State",
      "Mike Gundy, one of college football\u2019s most colorful coaches over the last two decades, was fired by Oklahoma State on Tuesday.",
      "The 58-year-old Gundy had a career record of 170-90 at his alma mater, where he was a star quarterback in the late 1980s. He posted winning records every season from 2006 to 2023, but had losing records in his final two years.",
      "\u201cCowboy Football reached an unprecedented level of success and national prominence under Coach Gundy\u2019s leadership,\u201d Oklahoma State athletic director Chad Weiberg said in a statement. \u201cI believe I speak for OSU fans everywhere when I say that we are grateful for all he did to raise the standard and show us all what is possible for Oklahoma State football.\u201d",
      "Gundy arrived as head coach in 2005, and the Oklahoma City native's charm and sense of humor appealed to fans and recruits and helped the Cowboys compete with better-funded programs. As late billionaire T. Boone Pickens poured millions into the program, Gundy turned Oklahoma State into an unlikely powerhouse that often affected the national championship race. The Cowboys won the Big 12 in 2011 and played in the Big 12 title game in 2021 and 2023.",
      "But the Cowboys couldn\u2019t keep up as college football changed. The transfer portal and NIL made it more difficult for a coach who made his name mining diamonds in the rough. Gundy lost 11 of his final 12 games with the program. In his final two seasons, he emerged as a refreshingly open and honest voice about the changes in the sport.",
      "On Monday, Gundy said he wanted to stay.",
      "\u201cEver since I was hired, I\u2019ve put my heart and soul into this, and I\u2019ll continue to do that until I don\u2019t want to do it anymore, or until someone else says we don\u2019t want you to do it,\u201d he said.",
      "For all his positives, Gundy came with quirks. He is known as much for his \u201cI\u2019m a man, I\u2019m 40\u201d rant that he made defending a player \u2014 a diatribe that remains a part of pop culture through a Consumer Cellular commercial \u2014 as for his success.",
      "In 2020, he apologized for calling COVID-19 the \u201cChinese Virus, \u201d and again months later after he wore a T-shirt featuring the far-right One America News Network that created a disagreement with running back Chuba Hubbard.",
      "All those things were forgiven as the team won. But the Cowboys lost their last nine games last season, the final defeat a 52-0 blowout at Colorado.",

      "Major League Baseball's 11-man competition committee on Tuesday approved use of the Automated Ball/Strike System in the major leagues in 2026.",
      "Human plate umpires will still call balls and strikes, but teams can challenge two calls per game and get additional appeals in extra innings. Challenges must be made by a pitcher, catcher or batter \u2014 signaled by tapping their helmet or cap \u2014 and a team retains its challenge if successful. Reviews will be shown as digital graphics on outfield videoboards.",
      "New York Yankees outfielder Austin Slater, one of four players on the competition committee, said three voted in favor after getting support from 22 of the 30 teams. All six management reps voted in favor.",
      "\u201cI think with any sort of technology, there\u2019s not 100% certainty of the accurateness of the system,\u201d Slater said. \u201cI think the same can be said of umpires. So I think it\u2019s just coming to grips with the impact that technology is going to have and whether or not we were willing to live with that error that was associated with the system, even if the error is very, very miniscule.\u201d",
      "Big league umpires call roughly 94% of pitches correctly, according to UmpScorecards.",
      "Adding the robot umps is likely to cut down on ejections. MLB said 61.5% of ejections among players, managers and coaches last year were related to balls and strikes, as were 60.3% this season through Sunday. The figures include ejections for derogatory comments, throwing equipment while protesting calls and inappropriate conduct.",

      "At Triple-A at the start of the 2023 season, half the games used the robots for ball/strike calls and half had a human making decisions subject to appeals by teams to the ABS.",
      "MLB switched Triple-A to an all-challenge system on June 26, 2024, then used the challenge system this year at 13 spring training ballparks hosting 19 teams for a total of 288 exhibition games. Teams won 52.2% of their ball/strike challenges (617 of 1,182).",

      "In the first test at the big league All-Star Game, four of five challenges of plate umpire Dan Iassogna\u2019s calls were successful in July.",
      "Teams in Triple-A do not get additional challenges in extra innings. The proposal approved Tuesday included a provision granting teams one additional challenge each inning if they don't have challenges remaining.",
      "MLB has experimented with different shapes and interpretations of the strike zone with ABS, including versions that were three-dimensional. Currently, it calls strikes solely based on where the ball crosses the midpoint of the plate, 8.5 inches from the front and the back. The top of the strike zone is 53.5% of batter height and the bottom 27%.",
      "\u201cThroughout this process we have worked on deploying the system in a way that\u2019s acceptable to players,\u201d Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \u201cThe strong preference from players for the challenge format over using the technology to call every pitch was a key factor in determining the system we are announcing today.\u201d",
      "This will be MLB's first major rule change since sweeping adjustments in 2024. Those included a pitch clock, larger bases, and restrictions on defensive shifts and pitcher disengagements such as pickoff attempts.",
      "The challenge system introduces ABS without eliminating pitch framing, a subtle art where catchers use their body and glove to try making borderline pitches look like strikes. Framing has become a critical skill for big league catchers, and there was concern that full-blown ABS would make some strong defensive catchers obsolete.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a really good eye ... only getting two (challenges), I think a lot of the borderline ones are going to stay the same,\u201d Rangers catcher Kyle Higashioka said. \u201cSo it keeps some of the human element in in the game.\u201d",
      "In addition to Slater, the other players on the competition committee are Arizona's Corbin Burnes and Zac Gallen and Seattle's Cal Raleigh, with the Chicago Cubs' Ian Happ at Detroit's Casey Mize as alternates. The union representatives make their decisions based on input from players on the 30 teams.",
      "Bill Miller is the umpire representative. The Major League Baseball Umpires Association declined to comment Tuesday, saying its members \u201care focused on the 2025 season and postseason.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The New York Liberty will not renew coach Sandy Brondello\u2019s contract for next season, the organization announced Tuesday.",
      "Brondello led the Liberty to its first WNBA championship in 2024, but the team struggled with injuries to star players Breanna Stewart, Jonquel Jones and Sabrina Ionescu this year. New York earned the No. 5 seed in the playoffs and lost in the first round to the Phoenix Mercury.",
      "\u201cIt has been a privilege to have coached the NY Liberty these last four years. Bringing the first ever championship to New York will always be the most amazing feeling. I wish the team and organization more success moving forward,\u201d Brondello said to The Associated Press in a text message.",
      "Brondello went 107-53 in her four seasons with the team, giving her the most wins in franchise history. The Liberty got off to a franchise-best start, winning nine straight games, only to stumble over the next few months as injuries took their toll.",
      "\u201cWe would like to thank Sandy Brondello for her everlasting impact on the New York Liberty,\u201d Liberty GM Jonathan Kolb said. \u201cSandy finishes her tenure in New York as the winningest coach in franchise history, and she took us to never-before-seen heights as the first head coach to lead the Liberty to a championship. We wish Sandy the very best in her next chapter.\u201d",
      "She had her players' support after the team lost in the playoffs last week.",
      "\u201cTo anybody that kind of questions Sandy being here, this is a resilient group,\u201d Stewart said after the Game 3 loss to Phoenix last week. \u201cAnd she has our back and we have hers. The way that she continued to kind of deal with the cards she was dealt was incredible. It wasn\u2019t easy for anybody but she came in every day with a positive attitude and a mindset to put us in our best positions possible and best foot forward.\u201d",
      "Before coming to New York, Brondello led the Phoenix Mercury to a championship in her eight seasons with that team. She was hired before the 2022 season by the Liberty after she helped the Mercury reach the WNBA Finals in 2021.",
      "\u201cI think Sandy\u2019s done a great job. It\u2019s an unfortunate part of our business,\u201d Indiana coach Stephanie White said. \u201cShe does it not only from a great standpoint in terms of wins and losses, but in a way that leads with grace and leads with dignity and values the game and players in this game.\u201d",
      "New York lost in the finals to Las Vegas in 2023 before winning the championship last year in a decisive Game 5 overtime victory over Minnesota.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t love it for Sandy, I\u2019m gonna have to be honest,\u201d Las Vegas Aces coach Becky Hammon said Tuesday. \u201cShe\u2019s just won a championship. She\u2019s won in other places, and I know her to be a quality coach and a quality person. Those are rare sometimes to get that mixture of qualities as a head coach.\u201d",

I think Sandy\u2019s a heck of a coach, and Sandy will land on her feet like she always does,\" Minnesota coach Cheryl Reeve said. \"I think I am absolutely thrilled if I am Seattle, Toronto and Portland that I was just gifted a championship-level coach.

      "Ireland will host its first NFL regular-season game Sunday when the Pittsburgh Steelers face the Minnesota Vikings at Croke Park",
      "Ireland's indigenous sports are called Gaelic games, and Gaelic football in particular features kicking skills that can transfer to American football via placekicking and punting.",
      "A growing number of Gaelic football players are giving American football a shot, either through college programs or the NFL\u2019s international player pathway program.",
      "Before the Pittsburgh Steelers face the Minnesota Vikings at Croke Park in the first regular-season NFL game in Ireland, here are some facts about Gaelic games and the players trying to reach the NFL:",
      "Gaelic football, hurling and camogie (women\u2019s hurling) are the most popular. All three 15-a-side sports are played on a rectangular field with goals and goal posts rising above \u2014 like uprights in American football. In each sport, scoring in the goal is worth three points; through the uprights is one point. Gaelic football recently added a 2-point score for kicks from certain parts of the field.",
      "Gaelic football is a bit like rugby \u2014 no pads and plenty of collisions. It differs in ball movement. Players can possess and advance the ball but must bounce or kick it to themselves at least once every four steps. They can kick or hand pass to teammates. You score primarily by kicking the ball into the net or through the uprights. Like in soccer, free kicks are awarded for fouls. The ball is slightly smaller than a soccer ball.",
      "Hurling and camogie are described as a combination of lacrosse, field hockey and baseball. Helmets and face masks are worn. The ball is called a sliotar. The wooden stick is a hurley. The Gaelic Athletic Association says hurling is \u201c one of the oldest field games in the world ... with the first literary reference dating back to 1272 BC.\u201d",
      "The Irish government offers \" 5 things Americans should know about Gaelic games.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur games are a way of life for a lot of people. They\u2019re the quintessential expression of Irishness for lots of people and Croke Park is the epicenter of that relationship,\u201d GAA head of communications Alan Milton said.",
      "Gaelic games occasionally cross over into popular culture: Irish actor Paul Mescal has popularized GAA shorts.",
      "The GAA, founded in 1884 as part of a revival of Irish nationalism and culture while under British rule, oversees 1,600 local clubs across the island of Ireland and 500 more abroad promoting Gaelic football, hurling, handball and rounders. Camogie and women's Gaelic football have their own organizations but there's an initiative to fully integrate them into the GAA by 2027. The Camogie Association was founded in 1904 when women's sports options were limited.",
      "Gaelic games are amateur sports, so players don't get salaries. Many players have jobs or are university students. Club-level players move up to compete for their counties. The inter-county competitions culminate each summer in the All-Ireland finals, which capture the attention of the nation. Star players can land endorsement deals, but the Gaelic Players Association said typical inter-county athletes lose money each year due to out-of-pocket expenses. For comparison, Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker T.J. Watt\u2019s average annual salary is $41 million.",

      "Charlie Smyth is on the New Orleans Saints practice squad. From County Down in Northern Ireland, Smyth kicked a 52-yard field goal in a preseason game. He came through the NFL's international player pathway program, as did Mark McNamee. The Dubliner is on the practice squad of the Green Bay Packers, who already have Irish-born punter Daniel Whelan \u2014 he moved with his family to the U.S. as a teenager.",
      "There's a trend of Irish kickers and punters in college football, too. Kildare's Sean O\u2019Haire is a kicker for Maryland. Northern Ireland's Adam-McCann Gibbs, who can kick and punt, has committed to Penn State for 2026. Galway native Andy Quinn, whose first love was rugby, is a kicker/punter for Boston College. David Shanahan punted for Georgia Tech. Tadhg Leader runs a program that identifies and trains the Irish hopefuls. Soccer and rugby \u2014 both popular in Ireland \u2014 also offer transferrable foot skills.",
      "\u201cWe are really at the tip of the iceberg here \u2014 there's so much Gaelic football talent,\u201d said Michael McQuaid, host of the Irish Steelers Podcast.",

He told the Sports Direct TikTok page that it \u201ctoughened me up.\u201d Indeed, a key part of Grealish\u2019s game in soccer is absorbing contact and winning fouls. Noel Gallagher confirmed to the Irish Times that he once played at Croke Park for a Manchester team. The Oasis star was back at the stadium this summer during the band's reunion tour.",

      "Shaw said Tuesday that Kirk's widow Erika texted asking him to attend the event, and he was \u201cnot concerned at all\u201d about any backlash toward him for going. He said he and Kirk lived in the same apartment complex in Arizona and connected through their faith.",

      "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Cleveland Guardians designated hitter David Fry sustained a broken nose and facial fractures after he was hit in the face by a pitch from Detroit\u2019s Tarik Skubal in the sixth inning of Cleveland\u2019s 5-2 win over the Tigers, a victory that deadlocked the AL Central division race.",
      "\u201cHe is doing OK, he's in good spirits,\u201d manager Stephen Vogt said by phone Wednesday morning. \u201cHe\u2019s upright, he\u2019s alert.\u201d",
      "Vogt visited Fry in the hospital. The team planned a more detailed update later.",
      "Fry squared around to try to bunt a 99 mph fastball from Skubal on Tuesday night and the pitch struck him in the nose and mouth area. As Fry collapsed in the batter\u2019s box and immediately grabbed his bloodied face, a visibly shaken Skubal threw off his glove and cap as Vogt and trainers rushed onto the field.",
      "Fry laid in the dirt for several minutes before being slowly helped to his feet. He gave a thumbs-up signal as he sat up and was driven off in a cart.",
      "The Guardians said Fry was being transported from Lutheran Medical Center to the Cleveland Clinic Main Campus for further testing and observation.",
      "\u201cIt was straight to the face,\u201d Vogt said, describing the impact on Fry that shook everyone inside Progressive Field. \u201cWe\u2019re all thinking about David and his family right now. Obviously, we\u2019re glad he is OK, but obviously it\u2019s a really scary moment.\u201d",
      "Skubal, the reigning AL Cy Young Award winner, paced around the infield as Fry was being assisted. Following the game, Skubal, who allowed just two hits through the first five innings, said seeing Fry in distress was difficult.",
      "\u201cReally tough,\u201d the left-hander said. \u201cI\u2019ve already reached out to him. I\u2019m sure his phone is blowing up. I just want to make sure he\u2019s all right. Obviously, he seemed like he was OK coming off the field and hopefully it stays that way.",
      "\u201cI know sometimes with those things that can change. So hopefully he\u2019s all right. I look forward to hopefully at some point tonight or (Wednesday) morning getting a text from him and making sure he\u2019s all good because there\u2019s things that are bigger than the game and the health of him is more important than a baseball game.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s how Guardians left fielder Steven Kwan felt after watching Fry, an All-Star in 2024 who underwent offseason elbow surgery and didn\u2019t join the team until late May, go down.",

Lately, she's been encouraged by the uptick in interest in foraging, a trend she sees as benefiting the environment, community and people.",

Yet foraging enthusiasts say the search for wild mushrooms, edible plants, shellfish and seaweed has grown more popular in recent years as people tout their rare finds. Others share knowledge on social media, and experienced foragers offer training to novices on safe and sustainable practices.",
      "The renewed interest ranges from those wanting to be budget-conscious \u2014 foraging is free after all \u2014 to those wanting to be more mindful of their environmental footprint. Some even use foraging as a creative outlet, using mushrooms they find to create spore prints and other art.",
      "The popularity is also helped by the hobby's accessibility. Foragers can look for wild food everywhere, from urban landscapes to abandoned farmlands to forests \u2014 they just need permission from a private landowner or to secure the right permit from a state or federal park. Some advocates have even launched a map highlighting where people can pick fruits and vegetables for free.",

      "Former Vice President Al Gore has announced an expansion of Climate TRACE to track soot pollution using satellite technology and artificial intelligence",
      "NEW YORK -- Soon people will be able to use satellite technology and artificial intelligence to track dangerous soot pollution in their neighborhoods \u2014 and where it comes from \u2014 in a way not so different from monitoring approaching storms under plans by a nonprofit coalition led by former Vice President Al Gore.",
      "Gore, who started Climate TRACE, which uses satellites to monitor the location of heat-trapping methane sources, on Wednesday expanded his system to track the source and plume of pollution from tiny particles, often referred to as soot, on a neighborhood basis for 2,500 cities across the world. Particle pollution kills millions of people worldwide each year \u2014 and tens of thousands in the United States \u2014 according to scientific studies and reports.",
      "Gore's coalition uses 300 satellites, 30,000 ground-tracking sensors and artificial intelligence to track 137,095 sources of particle pollution, with 3,937 of them categorized as \u201csuper emitters\u201d for how much they spew. Users can look at long-term trends, but in about a year Gore hopes these can become available daily so they can be incorporated into weather apps, like allergy reports.",
      "It\u2019s not just seeing the pollutants. The website shows who is spewing them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, before AI, for people to really see precisely where this conventional air pollution is coming from,\u201d Gore said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s over in their homes and in their neighborhoods and when people have a very clear idea of this, then I think they\u2019re empowered with the truth of their situation. My faith tradition has always taught me you will know the truth and the truth shall set you free.\u201d",
      "Unlike methane, soot pollution isn't technically a climate issue because it doesn't cause the world to warm, but it does come from the same process: fossil fuel combustion.",

      "World Gorilla Day is observed on September 24",
      "BWINDI, Uganda -- Sept. 24 is observed as World Gorilla Day. It was launched in 2017 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the establishment of a Rwanda-based gorilla study center founded by Dian Fossey, the American primatologist and conservationist who gained global renown for her research.",
      "The gorillas Fossey studied and looked after were mountain gorillas that belong to the species known as the eastern gorilla and live mostly in the Virunga Massif, a mountainous area encompassing parts of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. The second species, known as the western gorilla, inhabits areas of west and central Africa.",
      "Gorillas are losing their habitat because of poaching and other threats. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists both gorilla species as endangered, with three of four subspecies critically endangered.",
      "Here are some things to know about the great apes:",
      "Humans share much of their DNA with gorillas, and scientists cite figures showing up to 98% similarity. \u201cGorillas are humans\u2019 closest living relatives after chimpanzees, and are of comparable importance for the study of human origins and evolution,\u201d according to the science journal Nature. This kinship with humans is one reason gorillas are susceptible to infections spread through close contact with tourists, researchers and others who come near them. Gorillas are especially vulnerable to the influenza virus, and respiratory illnesses are a frequent cause of death among adult gorillas.",
      "Visitors tracking gorillas in the wild are usually urged to stand at least 7 meters (yards) from the primates \u2014 as well as not to touch them even if they wander, as they sometimes do, closer to people. In her lifetime, Fossey worried that gorilla tourism was injurious to the well-being of gorillas because it might alter their behavior in the wild, but tourism-driven gorilla conservation projects in countries such as Uganda has proved successful over the years.",

      "Gorillas in the wild live in families, with the dominant male \u2014 known as the silverback because of the patch of silvery fur on his back \u2014 as the head of the group. He can co-exist with younger males, who defer to him, as well as many females, juveniles and infants.",
      "Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, home to many of the world's remaining gorillas, has 27 families considered \u201chabituated,\u201d trained to appear comfortable in the presence of humans. Most silverbacks are known to be protective of their families. The silverback in one of the Bwindi families is named Murinzi, a local word for \u201cprotector,\u201d because rangers have seen him to be quite solicitous.",
      "To assert their authority, silverbacks sometimes stand on their hind legs, beat their chests and vocalize, sending younger males in flight and warning rivals from other groups. Gorilla mothers are just as generous with their offspring, and the \u201clove they show for their youngsters is undeniably deep and evident to everyone lucky enough to observe it,\u201d according to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, a charity working to protect the primates. Gorillas can live for over 40 years in the wild.",
      "The powerful majesty of gorillas in the wild is one reason they fascinate tourists. But while they are the largest living primates, they can also seem gentle and meek. An average silverback can weigh up to 180 kilograms (396 pounds). Herbivorous creatures, gorillas eat mostly leaves and the shoots and stems of plants. They may also eat ants and snails.",
      "The International Gorilla Conservation Program says the main threat to gorillas is habitat loss from the clearance of the forested ecosystems they inhabit. \u201cConversion of land for agriculture and competition for limited natural resources such as firewood lead to varying degrees of deforestation,\u201d according to the group, a coalition of conservation nonprofits focusing on the survival of mountain gorillas.",

      "Ferrante, who previously served in key security positions at the White House and the FBI, says he's awaiting the results of the investigation before drawing any conclusions about the nature of the setup, but he emphasizes that the scale of the operation shows how simple tools can pose real risks to critical infrastructure.",
      "\u201cThe masterminds could have set this up a long time ago and be operating from thousands of miles away,\" he said. \"It\u2019s a stark reminder of how deeply interconnected our world has become, where local vulnerabilities can be exploited globally.\u201d",

      "Many victims were vulnerable Indigenous people from regional and remote communities, some of whom lived outside the range of Optus mobile coverage.",

      "Following the ruling, Optus said in a statement it was \u201cremediating impacted customers as a matter of priority.\u201d The statement didn't detail that remediation.",
      "Optus would also pay AU$1 million ($660,000) to support digital literacy initiatives for Indigenous Australians.",

      "It sounded robotic, lifeless even \u2014 shorn of the warmth, grace and believability that French voice actor Fran\u00e7oise Cadol has given to Croft since she started playing the character in 1996.",
      "Gamers and Cadol herself came to the same conclusion: A machine had cloned her voice and replaced her.",
      "\u201cIt's pathetic,\" says Cadol, who straight away called her lawyer. \u201cMy voice belongs to me. You have no right to do that.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was absolutely scandalous,\u201d says Bos. \u201cIt was artificial intelligence.\u201d",
      "Aspyr, the game developer based in Austin, Texas, didn\u2019t respond to e-mailed questions from The Associated Press. But it acknowledged in a post last week on its website that what it described as \u201cunauthorized AI generated content\u201d had been incorporated into its Aug. 14 update of \u201cTomb Raider IV\u2013VI Remastered\" that angered fans.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve addressed this issue by removing all AI voiceover content,\u201d Aspyr's post said. \u201cWe apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.\u201d",

      "\u201cIf we can replace actors, we\u2019ll be able to replace accountants, and a whole range of other professions that could also be automated,\" says Patrick Kuban, a French-language voice actor who is also a co-president of United Voice Artists, an international federation of voiceover artists.",

      "Once the initial shock subsided, she resolved to fight back. Her Paris lawyer, Jonathan Elkaim, is seeking an apology from Aspyr and financial redress.",
      "In the update, new chunks of voiceover appear to have been added to genuine recordings that Cadol says she made years ago.",
      "Most notably, fans picked up on one particularly awkward segment.

      "Not only does it sound clunky but it also rings as grammatically incorrect to French speakers \u2014 mixing up the polite and less polite forms of language that they use, depending on who they're addressing.",
      "Gamers were up in arms. Bos posted a video on his YouTube channel that same evening, lamenting: \"It\u2019s half Fran\u00e7oise Cadol, half AI. It\u2019s horrible ! Why have they done that?\u201d",
      "\u201cI was really disgusted,\u201d the 34-year-old said in an AP interview. \u201cI grew up with Fran\u00e7oise Cadol's voice. I've been a \u2018Tomb Raider\u2019 fan since I was young kid.\"",
      "\u201cLara Croft is a bit \u2014 how should I say \u2014 a bit sarcastic at times in some of her lines. And I think Fran\u00e7oise played that very, very well,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why now is the time to set boundaries,\" he added. \u201cIt\u2019s so that future generations also have the chance to experience talented actors.\"",

      "Robot umpires are coming to the big leagues in 2026 after Major League Baseball\u2019s 11-man competition committee on Tuesday approved use of the Automated Ball/Strike System",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Robot umpires are coming to the big leagues in 2026 after Major League Baseball\u2019s 11-man competition committee on Tuesday approved use of the Automated Ball/Strike System.",
      "ABS will be introduced in the form of a challenge system in which the human umpire makes each call, which can be appealed to the computer. Robot umpires have been tested in the minor leagues since 2019, with recent testing done at Triple-A since 2022, MLB spring training this year and at this summer's All-Star Game in Atlanta.",
      "Here's what to know about MLB's robot umps.",
      "Stadiums are outfitted with cameras that track each pitch and judge whether it crossed home plate within the strike zone. In early testing, umpires wore ear buds and would hear \u201cball\u201d or \u201cstrike,\u201d then relay that to players and fans with traditional hand signals.",
      "The challenge system adds a wrinkle. Human umps call every pitch, but each team has the ability to challenge two calls per game. Teams that burn their challenges get one additional challenge in each extra inning. A team retains its challenge if successful, similar to the regulations for big league teams with video reviews, which were first used for home run calls in August 2008 and widely expanded to many calls for the 2014 season.",
      "Only a batter, pitcher or catcher may challenge a call, signaling with the tap of a helmet or cap; and assistance from the dugout is not allowed. A challenge must be made within 2 seconds, and the graphic of the pitch and strike zone is shown on the scoreboard and broadcast feed. The umpire then announces the updated count.",
      "MLB estimates the process averages 17 seconds.",
      "A Hawk-Eye pose-tracking system of cameras tracks pitches and whether they are within a strike zone based on the height of each batter, who is measured without shoes before a team\u2019s first test game. MLB estimated the calibration process at less than one minute for each player.",
      "While the strike zone actually called by big league umpires tends to be oval in shape, the ABS strike zone is a rectangle, as in the rule book.",
      "Developing a consensus on what a computer strike zone should be has been an issue.",
      "MLB has changed the shape of the ABS strike zone several times.",
      "It started with a 19-inch width in 2022, then dropped it to 17 inches \u2014 matching the width of home plate. Narrowing the strike zone led to an increase in walks and only small changes in strikeout rates.",

      "ABS makes the ball/strike decision at the midpoint of the plate, 8 1/2 inches from the front and 8 1/2 inches from the back. The contrasts with the rule book zone called by umpires, which says the zone is a cube and a strike is a pitch that crosses any part. Big league umpires call roughly 94% of pitches correctly, according to UmpScorecards.",
      "ABS, which utilizes Hawk-Eye cameras, has been tested in the minor leagues since 2019. The independent Atlantic League trialed the system at its 2019 All-Star Game and MLB installed the technology for that\u2019s year Arizona Fall League of top prospects. The ABS was tried at eight of nine ballparks of the Low-A Southeast League in 2021, then moved up to Triple-A in 2022.",
      "At Triple-A at the start of the 2023 season, half the games used the robots for ball/strike calls and half had a human making decisions subject to appeals by teams to the ABS.",
      "MLB switched Triple-A to an all-challenge system on June 26, 2024, then used the challenge system this year at 13 spring training ballparks hosting 19 teams for a total of 288 exhibition games. Teams won 52.2% of their ball/strike challenges (617 of 1,182) challenges.",
      "At this year's MLB All-Star Game, four of five challenges of plate umpire Dan Iassogna\u2019s calls were successful.",

      "Estonia is extending a fence along its border with Russia and building anti-tank ditches and bunkers in preparation for a potential conflict with Moscow",
      "VINSKI, Estonia -- Estonia is extending a fence along its border with Russia and building anti-tank ditches and bunkers in preparation for a potential conflict with Moscow. But those defenses won\u2019t guard against the threat it and its NATO allies face from Russian drones and electronic warfare.",
      "From the Baltic to the Black Sea, countries bordering Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are facing the spillover from Moscow's war in Ukraine.",
      "The incursion of about 20 Russian drones into Poland this month shone a spotlight on holes in NATO's air defenses, as multimillion-dollar jets had to be scrambled to respond to drones that cost thousands and that ended up crashing into the Polish countryside. Russia denied that it targeted Poland, but Polish officials suggested it was intentional.",
      "Faced with a growing problem, some EU defense ministers will meet Friday to discuss creating a \u201cdrone wall.\"",
      "NATO warned Russia on Tuesday that it would defend against any further breaches of its airspace after Estonia said Russian fighter jets violated it last week. But although the alliance knows how to identify threats from jets and missiles, dealing with drones is a greater challenge, officials said.",
      "In Poland, \u201cmost of the drones were not detected,\" said Hanno Pevkur, Estonia\u2019s defense minister. \u201cThis is a real gap we have to solve.\u201d",
      "Military and defense officials from the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 NATO and EU members that border Russia \u2014 told The Associated Press that defending against drones requires solving a complex set of technological, financial and bureaucratic problems.",
      "Europe needs cheaper technology to buy and to speed up slow production and procurement cycles, they said. But even then, drone technology is advancing so quickly that anything bought now could be outdated in months.",
      "\u201cWhat I need,\u201d said Lt. General Andrus Merilo who commands Estonia's military, is technology that is \u201cgood enough, it\u2019s affordable and can be produced in mass.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t need high-end capabilities of which I can fire only one, against targets which will be attacking in hundreds,\u201d he said.",
      "Russia is using drones every night in Ukraine because each drone is a \u201clottery ticket that always wins,\u201d said Kusti Salm a former top official at Estonia\u2019s Defense Ministry.",
      "That\u2019s because a drone either hits something or, if Ukraine shoots it down with a missile, it drains Kyiv's air defenses and finances, since missiles are more expensive than drones, said Salm who now runs Frankenburg Technologies, a company developing low-cost anti-drone missiles.",
      "Although NATO countries have a \u201cvery good understanding\u201d of how to defend against conventional threats such as missiles and planes, they need to rapidly improve at dealing with drone threats, said Tomas Godliauskas, Lithuania\u2019s vice-minister of national defense.",
      "When the Russian drones flew into Poland, NATO nations deployed fighter jets and attack helicopters and put missile defense systems on alert. But none of those options was specifically designed for drone warfare.",
      "Although Russia and Ukraine have been firing more and more drones at each other, there has been less investment in counter-drone systems, said Salm. He suggested that's partly because it's easier to get a drone to fly than it is to develop something to detect or intercept it.",
      "Slow, low-flying drones made from wood, fiberglass, plastic or polystyrene might not be detected by radar systems searching for a fast-moving missile made of metal, or they might look like birds or a plane.

      "Many locals, including reformed poachers living near the park, told The Associated Press that the money generated has ensured the recovery of the species, with habitat encroachment and poaching in decline as wildlife authorities seek to collaborate more with nearby communities.",
      "Philemon Mujuni, a poacher until five years ago, said he once thought of the gorilla as a hostile animal to be killed before it killed him if he ever encountered one. As a boy, he used to follow his father, whom he described as \u201ca senior poacher,\u201d into the forest to help carry the antelopes they pulled from traps.",

      "Ahead of Sunday's vote to choose a new 101-seat legislature, multiple online monitoring groups have tracked propaganda and disinformation campaigns attributed to Russia. Their aim is to diminish support for the ruling pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity, or PAS, in a vote many view as a geopolitical choice between East and West.",

      "Moldovan authorities have long warned that Russia is conducting a hybrid war \u2014 meddling in elections, disinformation campaigns, illicitly funding pro-Russian parties \u2014 to try to derail the country\u2019s path toward EU membership. Moscow has repeatedly denied meddling in Moldova.",

It publishes \u201cKremlin-aligned propaganda\u201d attacking Sandu, PAS and the EU.",

      "St. Louis Public Schools is among the districts nationwide weighing how many urban schools to keep open due to shrinking budgets, the falling birthrate and a growing school choice movement. A district-commissioned report released this year found that the school system has more than twice the schools it needs.",
      "Such decisions are gut wrenching. It\u2019s a financial strain to operate half-empty schools, but research shows kids often fare badly after closures.",
      "Elsewhere, Philadelphia, Boston, Houston and Norfolk, Virginia, are considering shuttering schools, while a public outcry over potential closures has stopped them \u2014 for now \u2014 in Seattle and San Francisco.",
      "From 2019 to 2023, enrollment declined by 20% or more at nearly 1 in 12 public schools \u2014 roughly 5,100, according to a report published last year by the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative-leaning education think tank. Many were chronically low-performing schools in high poverty neighborhoods, the report found.",
      "Public school enrollment is projected to tumble 5.5% between 2022 and 2031, largely due to changing demographics, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Other factors include the shift by some students to private education or homeschooling and some immigrant families' decisions to leave the country.",
      "Federal funds allowed many schools to stay open during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite tumbling enrollment numbers. But now the relief money is gone, and those under-populated schools are a problem, said Aaron Garth Smith, director of education reform at Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank.",
      "\u201cThe takeaway is pretty clear,\u201d Smith said: Public school enrollment is declining. \u201cIt\u2019s going to continue to fall for years to come. And so generally, state and local policymakers have to adapt to this new reality.\u201d",
      "Chicago shuttered around 50 schools in 2013 \u2014 the largest school closure in U.S. history. Afterward, fighting and bullying increased as displaced students settled into new schools, said Marisa de la Torre, managing director and senior research associate at the UChicago Consortium on School Research.",
      "Test scores dipped in the schools slated for closure, and while the displaced students' reading scores eventually recovered, math performance issues persisted for years.",
      "\u201cThere were a lot of communities pitted against each other,\u201d de la Torre said. \u201cIt was a very long process, a lot of uncertainty. All of this really affected the staff and the kids.\u201d",
      "Under pressure from the Chicago's powerful teachers union, the city issued a moratorium on closures through 2027. Around a third of classroom seats remain empty.",
      "St. Louis Public Schools' student population plummeted from 115,543 in 1967 to 18,122 last year, reflecting an exodus of families to the suburbs. That number could drop further as residents leave their tornado-damaged homes.",
      "Sumner and an elementary school \u2014 both in the Ville neighborhood \u2014 are among seven St. Louis schools that didn\u2019t open this fall because of tornado damage. At a school board meeting in July, consultants argued that the district can\u2019t support all its schools, which on average were built 79 years ago. Closures, they said, could free up money for improvements.",
      "Board member Donna Jones wasn\u2019t buying it.",

      "President Donald Trump has returned to the United Nations to boast of his second-term foreign policy achievements and lash out at the world body as a feckless institution",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- President Donald Trump castigated the United Nations as a feckless institution in a speech to the world body on Tuesday, praising the turn America has taken under his leadership while warning Europe will be ruined if it doesn\u2019t turn away from a \u201cdouble-tailed monster\u201d of ill-conceived migration and green energy policies.",
      "His roughly hourlong speech before the U.N. General Assembly was both grievance-filled and self-congratulatory as he used the platform to applaud his second-term achievements and lament that some of his fellow world leaders' countries were \u201cgoing to hell.\"",
      "The address was the latest reminder for U.S. allies and foes that the United States \u2014 after a four-year interim under the more internationalist President Joe Biden \u2014 has returned to an unapologetically \u201cAmerica First\u201d posture with an antagonistic view toward the United Nations. Trump also sharply criticized the global body for inaction, saying it was filled with \u201cempty words\u201d that \u201cdon\u2019t solve wars.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat is the purpose of the United Nations?\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe U.N. has such tremendous potential. I\u2019ve always said it. It has such tremendous, tremendous potential. But it's not even coming close to living up to that potential.\u201d",
      "Afterward, Trump attempted to assuage fears from some diplomats by assuring the top U.N. leader that the U.S. remained \u201c100%\u201d supportive of the global body despite his earlier criticism.",
      "\u201cI may disagree with it sometimes, but I am so behind it because the potential for peace at this institution is great,\u201d Trump told Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.",
      "It was another about-face after Trump offered a weave of jarring juxtapositions in his address to the assembly.",
      "He trumpeted himself as a peacemaker and enumerated successes of his administration's efforts in several hotspots around the globe. At the same time, Trump heralded his decisions to order the U.S. military to carry out strikes on Iran and more recently against alleged drug smugglers from Venezuela and argued that \u201cglobalists\u201d are on the verge of destroying successful nations.",
      "Trump touted his administration's policies allowing for expanded drilling for oil and natural gas in the United States, and aggressively cracking down on illegal immigration, implicitly suggesting more countries should follow suit.",
      "He sharply warned that European nations that have more welcoming migration policies and commit to expensive energy projects aimed at reducing their carbon footprint were causing irreparable harm to their economies and cultures.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m telling you that if you don\u2019t get away from the \u2018green energy\u2019 scam, your country is going to fail,\" Trump said. \"If you don\u2019t stop people that you\u2019ve never seen before that you have nothing in common with, your country is going to fail.\u201d",
      "Trump added, \u201cI love the people of Europe, and I hate to see it being devastated by energy and immigration. This double-tailed monster destroys everything in its wake, and they cannot let that happen any longer.\u201d",
      "Trump also addressed Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, once again threatening to hit Moscow with \u201ca very strong round of powerful tariffs\u201d if Russian President Vladimir Putin does not come to the table to end the war.",
      "He waited until after the speech, and a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to announce a dramatic shift in his position on the war: He said he now believes Ukraine, with the help of NATO, can win back all territory lost to Russia.",
      "Trump wrote in part in his post. \u201cI think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form. With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option.\u201d",
      "The strengthened support from Trump, if it sticks, is a huge win for Zelenskyy, who has urged the American president to keep up the pressure on Putin to end his brutal war on Ukraine.",

      "President Donald Trump has issued an executive order designating antifa as a domestic terrorist organization",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Monday signed an order designating a decentralized movement known as antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, though whether he can actually do that remained unclear. Trump blames antifa for political violence.",
      "The Republican president said on social media last week during a state visit to the United Kingdom that he would be making such a designation. He called antifa a \u201cSICK, DANGEROUS, RADICAL LEFT DISASTER\u201d and said he will be \u201cstrongly recommending\u201d that its funders be investigated.",
      "The White House released Trump's executive order shortly after he departed for New York, where he was addressing the annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday.",
      "Here are a few things to know about Trump and antifa:",
      "Short for \u201canti-fascists,\u201d antifa is not a single organization but rather an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations.",
      "Antifa is a domestic entity and, as such, is not a candidate for inclusion on the State Department\u2019s list of foreign terror organizations. Dozens of groups, including extremist organizations like the Islamic State and al-Qaida, are included on that list. The designation matters in part because it enables the Justice Department to prosecute those who give material support to entities on that list even if that support does not result in violence.",
      "But there is no domestic equivalent to that list in part because of broad First Amendment protections enjoyed by organizations operating within the United States. And despite periodic calls, particularly after mass shootings by white supremacists, to establish a domestic terrorism law, no singular statute now exists.",
      "The executive order did not specify how Trump he would go about designating antifa as a domestic terrorist organization.",
      "Literature from the antifa movement encourages followers to pursue lawful protest activity as well as more confrontational acts, according to a 2018 Congressional Research Service report.",
      "The literature suggests that followers monitor the activities of white supremacist groups, publicize online the personal information of perceived enemies, develop self-defense training regimens and compel outside organizations to cancel any speakers or events with \u201ca fascist bent,\u201d the report said.",
      "People associated with antifa have been present for significant demonstrations and counter-demonstrations in recent years, including mobilizing against a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. They were also present during clashes with far-right groups in Portland, Oregon.",

The order calls on relevant government departments and agencies to use every authority to investigate, disrupt and dismantle any and all illegal operations, including terrorist actions conducted by antifa or anyone claiming to act on its behalf.",

      "The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission will award 172 bear hunt permits by random lottery for the December hunt, down slightly from the 187 permits initially proposed. The permit allows a hunter to kill one bear in areas where the bear population is deemed large enough.",
      "Florida has an estimated 4,000 black bears, wildlife officials say.",
      "Applications were taken from Sept. 12 through Monday.

      "In the future, the FWC foresees a bear hunt between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31, subject to more studies about the effect of hunting and the population of the animals. In future years, hunters could use up to six dogs each to pursue bears.",

      "Connecticut officials have agreed to a $2.25 million settlement of a lawsuit over a sex offender\u2019s killing of visiting nurse Joyce Grayson in 2023",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- Connecticut officials have agreed to a $2.25 million settlement of a lawsuit over a sex offender's killing of visiting nurse Joyce Grayson at a halfway house in 2023 \u2014 a case that reignited calls for better protections for home health care workers across the country.",
      "A state judge in Hartford approved the settlement on Thursday in the wrongful death lawsuit filed by Grayson's husband. Meanwhile, settlement talks with other defendants in the lawsuit, including Grayson's employer, are continuing, said Kelly Reardon, a lawyer for Grayson's family.",
      "Grayson, a 63-year-old mother of six and a nurse for 36 years, had gone to the halfway house in Willimantic on Oct. 28, 2023, to administer medication to Michael Reese, who was living there while on probation and after serving prison time for stabbing and sexually assaulting another woman in 2006.",
      "Police found Grayson dead in the basement of the home later the same day. The medical examiner\u2019s office said she died of compression of the neck and had blunt force injuries. Reese pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced last month to 50 years in prison.",
      "The lawsuit alleged state officials failed to properly supervise Reese during his probation, failed to ensure the public was protected from him, failed to detain him when he violated his probation, failed to provide him adequate mental health and drug programs and allowed him to be alone with visiting nurses despite his violent past. The lawsuit blamed the Department of Correction and probation oversight run by the Judicial Branch.",
      "\u201cThe family hopes that this settlement demonstrates that the state is taking its involvement with the perpetrator of this horrific crime against Joyce Grayson seriously,\" Reardon said. \u201cAlong those lines, as part of the settlement, family members will be meeting with representatives of some of the involved state agencies to discuss ways that these types of crimes can be prevented in the future.\u201d",
      "The Connecticut attorney general's office, which represented the state in the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment Tuesday. In the settlement agreement, the state does not admit to any wrongdoing.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's unproven statements about Tylenol, childhood vaccines and autism are validating the so-called Make America Healthy Again movement and revealing its potential political power",
      "NEW YORK -- As medical professionals react with alarm to President Donald Trump's unproven statements about Tylenol, childhood vaccines and autism, a different group of Americans is feeling vindicated.",
      "For the \u2018Make America Healthy Again\u2019 movement, a diverse coalition that includes supporters of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., anti-vaccine activists and others who distrust the American health care system, Trump's Monday announcement was a watershed moment.",
      "\u201cI think that for the \u2018MAHA\u2019 movement, this is like the dark clouds have finally parted and a single ray of sunshine is shining down,\u201d Del Bigtree, Kennedy\u2019s former communications director and founder of the advocacy group Informed Consent Action Network, said in an interview Tuesday.",
      "By amplifying the movement's long-held concerns about vaccines and pharmaceutical products, Trump handed a major victory to a group that has been growing in influence since he tapped Kennedy to oversee the nation's health services. It's a coalition that is viewed as a potentially important voting bloc for Republicans, but had become impatient with what they saw as inaction by his administration.",
      "Yet Trump's platforming of inaccurate health claims on the White House stage also concerns medical professionals, including some Republican lawmakers. After the announcement Monday, they urged people to listen to their doctors and warned that following Trump's guidance for pregnant women to entirely avoid Tylenol and for parents to delay vaccinations could lead to other harmful health outcomes.",
      "In Monday's news conference, Trump claimed that pregnant women using acetaminophen, the painkiller known by the brand name Tylenol (or paracetamol outside the U.S.), has contributed to the rise in autism cases in the U.S. in recent years. While some studies have suggested a potential correlation between the two, many others haven't found that concern.",
      "Experts say the research is inconclusive and the increase is mainly due to better diagnoses and a new definition for the disorder that now includes mild cases on a spectrum. In addition, the Coalition of Autism Scientists said Monday that acetaminophen use during pregnancy hadn\u2019t increased in recent decades like autism rates have.",
      "The president urged pregnant women to \u201cfight like hell\u201d to avoid taking the most commonly used drug in the country. His advice also went beyond the more nuanced Food and Drug Administration guidance released Monday, which notes that the potential correlation is an area of ongoing debate and that acetaminophen is the only over-the-counter drug approved for treating fever during pregnancy.",
      "Untreated fevers in pregnancy, particularly the first trimester, increase the risk for miscarriages, preterm birth and other problems, according to the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.",
      "Trump's comments also advanced a narrative discredited by decades of evidence that the ingredients in vaccines or taking immunizations close together can cause autism in children. Those claims appeal to \u2018MAHA\u2019 figures, including Kennedy, who have long insisted that vaccines and autism are related.",
      "\u201cI think for many of us it was like: It\u2019s about time,\u201d John Gilmore, executive director of the Autism Action Network, said in an interview. \u201cAnd it just felt extremely validating that the criticisms we\u2019ve been making of the vaccine program and health care are finally being taken seriously.\u201d",
      "Kennedy's core supporters in the anti-vaccine movement were quick to revel in the moment on social media and on podcasts, relieved the announcement did not shy away from vaccines as some had anticipated it would.",
      "\u201cWe should all just be incredibly grateful,\u201d MAHA Action president Tony Lyons said on Steve Bannon\u2019s show Monday, adding that Trump should be known as the \u201cMAHA\u201d president.",
      "The president and his health secretary directly addressed the parents of children with autism, saying their trepidation about vaccines had not been affirmed enough from the national stage.",
      "\u201cI want to reassure the people in the autism community that we will be uncompromising and relentless in our search for answers,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "The news conference also featured comments from two mothers who expressed appreciation. One said she had been \u201ccrying out for help, for answers, for years.\u201d",

      "Josephine Lukito, a journalism and media professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said appealing to maternal concerns about children's health can be \u201cincredibly persuasive\u201d and is a common strategy in the anti-vaccine movement.",
      "She said Trump's comments also leaned on other rhetorical strategies that are often used to spread vaccine misinformation, including focusing on emotional anecdotes instead of specific data.",
      "At one point in the news conference, Trump told a story about a woman who used to work with him in Trump Tower and claimed her young son got a high fever after receiving a vaccine. The president then added he knew at least two other people who were \u201cbadly hurt\u201d by vaccinations, but did not go into detail.",
      "\u201cThese sort of anecdotes are very, very salient among anti-vaxxers because they tug at our heartstrings,\u201d Lukito said in an interview. \u201cBut one story does not a statistic make.\u201d",
      "The vast majority of parents in the U.S. are keeping their children up-to-date with recommended childhood vaccines, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says rates have been falling for the past five years. Nationwide, the percentage of kindergartners receiving the most common childhood vaccines dropped well below 95%, the level needed to protect the community against an outbreak.",
      "During the news conference, Trump said he was a \u201cbeliever\u201d in vaccines, but a different message came through for some of those watching who have long been skeptics.",
      "\u201cI think what happened today is going to make parents think, Well, wait a minute, I don\u2019t even think I want to vaccinate now,\u201d Polly Tommey, director of the streaming arm of the anti-vaccine group Children\u2019s Health Defense, said in a video posted on X. \u201cBecause if you read between the lines of what Trump was saying, vaccines are unsafe, ineffective, can and do kill and cause autism.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s comments were praised by many of his allies in Congress. Rep. Diana Harshbarger of Tennessee, vice chair of a House subcommittee on health, wrote on X that Trump and Kennedy\u2019s move represented \u201creal action\u201d on autism and a turnaround from previously, when \u201cautism rates climbed while Washington stayed silent.\u201d",
      "But the announcement created uneasiness among other prominent Republicans and doctors, including Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a gastroenterologist who has pressed Kennedy on vaccines.",
      "\u201cHHS should release the new data that it has to support this claim,\u201d Cassidy wrote on X in response to Trump\u2019s advice to women not to take Tylenol during pregnancy. \u201cThe preponderance of evidence shows that this is not the case. The concern is that women will be left with no options to manage pain in pregnancy. We must be compassionate to this problem.\u201d",
      "In Tennessee, Republican state Sen. Richard Briggs, a cardiothoracic surgeon, cautioned people to check with their physicians about acetaminophen and vaccinations. In a phone interview, the Knoxville lawmaker also expressed concern about the administration firing some internationally recognized scientists in the field.",
      "North Dakota Republican state Sen. Judy Lee, who worked 10 years doing chemical analyses in hospital clinics and labs, said in an interview that she is \u201cextremely disappointed that the president has chosen to make such a firm statement about something that has no scientific basis.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor the president to make that kind of pronouncement with no personal expertise, no scientific background, no support of the experts, which he has either gotten rid of or discounted at the CDC, concerns me a great deal,\u201d Lee said.",

      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- A map drafted centuries ago as Spanish settlers solidified their presence in what is now Mexico and the southwestern United States has been returned to the Mexican government, marking the end of a yearslong effort to bring the historic document home.",
      "FBI agents and Mexican officials were joined by historians and archivists Tuesday at the consulate in Albuquerque for a celebratory handoff of the map. FBI Special Agent in Charge Justin Garris said it was more than simply ink on paper and Mexican officials described it as a significant part of their history and cultural heritage.",
      "\u201cThis document not only enriches our collective memory but also strengthens the ties that unite Mexico and New Mexico through a shared history,\u201d said Patricia Pinz\u00f3n, Consul of Mexico in Albuquerque.",
      "She mentioned the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro as one of those links. The 1,600-mile (2,560 kilometer) route once served as a lifeline between Mexico City and Santa Fe and is depicted as a central feature that snakes through the map. The names of communities are artfully scripted along the route as other lines radiating from the route mark rivers.",

      "The map is one of thousands of archaeological and cultural items reclaimed by Mexico in recent years, Pinz\u00f3n said. Just last month, a nearly 500-year-old priceless manuscript page signed by Spanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s was returned.",
      "Archivists in Mexico City first realized the map was gone in 2011. It was among 75 pieces that were taken from records belonging to the national archives. The physical evidence included a scar inside one volume where pages had been removed.",

      "North Carolina Republican legislators have introduced criminal justice measures to toughen bail rules and evaluate offenders for mental health issues",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Republican legislators are poised this week to approve criminal justice measures designed to toughen bail rules, restrict magistrates' powers and evaluate offenders' mental health after the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee on a Charlotte commuter train. The bill also could help get the death penalty carried out again in the ninth-largest U.S. state.",
      "Senate and House Republicans unveiled legislation that their leaders previously signaled would surface when the General Assembly reconvened on Monday after nearly two months away from Raleigh.",
      "The Aug. 22 death of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska \u2014 her attack caught on camera \u2014 and subsequent charges against a suspect who had previously been arrested more than a dozen times caused public outrage. An array of Republicans, President Donald Trump among them, have attempted to blame Zarutska's death on Charlotte-area leaders and Democratic state officials for what they call soft-on-crime policies.",
      "The Senate approved the legislation 28-8 late Monday, with many Democrats absent from the otherwise party-line vote. The bill now goes to the House, where a vote is likely Tuesday.",
      "Any final measure would then go to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein\u2019s desk. Stein, the former attorney general, has suggested pretrial release changes and greater emphasis on mental health are needed in light of Zarutska's death.",
      "But the measure took a different direction \u2014 away from bipartisan support \u2014 when Senate Republicans approved an amendment that could in the future open the door to other forms of capital punishment beyond lethal injection, which is currently the state\u2019s sole method. North Carolina last carried out an execution in 2006.",
      "The stabbing suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., could received a death sentence if convicted of first-degree murder in state court or a federal count filed against him.",
      "Brown, whose criminal record included serving more than five years in prison after pleading guilty to robbery using a deadly weapon, had been charged in January in Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, with misusing the 911 system, a misdemeanor, according to court records.",
      "But a magistrate \u2014 a nonelected local court official who often determines if a defendant can be released while awaiting trial \u2014 released him on a written promise to return for court. And it took more than six months for a court to order a mental evaluation for him. Brown\u2019s mother told Charlotte-area television that she had sought an involuntary psychiatric commitment this year after he became violent at home.",
      "GOP Sen. Ralph Hise said the legislation has nothing to do with winning political points, but rather is a response to the failure of the criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cWe need a criminal justice system that protects society from individuals. I believe these are many great steps in this bill,\u201d Hise said.",
      "The measure, named \u201cIryna\u2019s Law,\u201d would prohibit cashless bail for certain crimes and eliminate some of the discretion that magistrates and judges have for pretrial release decisions.",
      "For example, first-time defendants accused of a violent offense could only be released on a secured cash bond or receive house arrest with electronic monitoring. Such house arrest and monitoring would be the only option for some repeat defendants.",
      "The bill also attempts to ensure that more suspects are subject to psychological examinations before their potential release. Defendants accused of a violent crime and committed involuntarily in recent years to a mental health facility would be subject to a psychological evaluation.",

      "The secretary \u2014 a member of the governor's Cabinet \u2014 would have to select another method that's been adopted by another state and has not been found unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. That could include the use of a firing squad, a method that's been used to execute South Carolina inmates twice this year.",

      "\"Most of all, I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,\" Kimmel said. \"I never would have imagined that Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, even my old pal Ted Cruz, who believe it or not said something very beautiful on my behalf. It takes courage for them to speak out against this administration. They did and they deserve credit for it.\"",
      "The Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, had announced Monday that Kimmel would return to the air.",
      "It followed a political and media firestorm that began after the comedian addressed Kirk's slaying in a Sept. 15 monologue, saying: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"",
      "An emotional Kimmel on Tuesday said, \"It's important to me as a human, and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man. I don't think there's anything funny about it,\" noting that he had taken to social media following Kirk's killing to send his condolences to Kirk's family.",
      "Kimmel didn't issue a blanket apology for his monologue remarks last week, but said he understood how it was offensive to some.",
      "\"Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what was obviously a deeply disturbed individual,\" Kimmel said of the suspected gunman. \"That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make. But I understand that to some, that felt either ill-timed or unclear, or maybe both. And for those who think I did, point a finger, I get why you're upset. If the situation was reversed, there's a good chance I'd have felt the same way.\"",
      "Kimmel gave a brief explanation for what took place behind the scenes between himself and ABC's brass.",
      "\"I was not happy when they pulled me off the air on Wednesday,\" Kimmel said. \"I did not agree with that decision, and I told them that, and we had many conversations. I shared my point of view, they shared theirs. We talked it through, and at the end, even though they didn't have to, they really didn't have to, this is a giant company \u2026 they welcomed me back on the air.\"",
      "On Tuesday night, before the show aired on the East Coast, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, \"I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled!\"",
      "He went on, \"I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars,\" Mr. Trump said in reference to his defamation lawsuit last year against ABC News over remarks made by anchor George Stephanopoulos, which the network settled in December by agreeing to contribute $15 million to Mr. Trump's presidential foundation and museum, and another $1 million toward Mr. Trump's legal fees.",
      "\"This one sounds even more lucrative,\" Mr. Trump wrote Tuesday. \"A true bunch of losers!\"",
      "Kimmel told his audience Tuesday that the president \"made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs. Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can't take a joke.\"",
      "\"One thing I did learn from Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and Howard Stern, is that a government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn't like, is anti-American,\" he added.",
      "In a Sept. 17 interview with right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr called Kimmel's remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" and said there was a \"path forward for suspension over this.\"",
      "\"The FCC is going to have remedies we could look at,\" Carr told Johnson. \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"",
      "Within hours of that interview, station operator Nexstar announced it would preempt Kimmel's show over the remarks. Nexstar owns and operates more than 200 stations nationwide, including more than two dozen ABC affiliates. Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it.",
      "A Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News last week that the decision to preempt Kimmel's show was \"made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision.\"",
      "ABC later said that it was \"indefinitely\" suspending the show.",
      "Another major station owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group, also said last week that it was pulling Kimmel's show.",
      "Despite its return to ABC on Tuesday night, both Nexstar and Sinclair said they would continue to preempt Kimmel's show.",
      "Sinclair on Monday night posted a statement on X saying it will preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" across its ABC affiliate stations and will be \"replacing it with news programming\" beginning Tuesday night. \"Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,\" Sinclair said.",
      "Nexstar on Tuesday said it will continue to preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and \"monitor the show as it returns to ABC.\"",
      "Regarding Carr, Kimmel on Tuesday\u00a0showed\u00a0the audience a social media post that the FCC chair wrote in May 2022 in which he said, \"Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech. It challenges those in power while using humor to draw more people in to the discussion. That's why people in influential positions have always targeted it for censorship.\"",
      "Disney on Monday did not delve into the details of what led to its decision to allow Kimmel's show to resume, only saying in a statement that the initial suspension was \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\" calling his comments \"ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"",
      "\"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,\" Disney said.",
      "The temporary removal of Kimmel's show sparked a nationwide debate over issues of free speech and censorship. Many in the Hollywood community rallied to Kimmel's side, with more than 400 celebrities \u2014 including actors Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep \u2014 signing an open letter with the American Civil Liberties Union that criticized the move as \"a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.\"",
      "Conservatives upset with Kimmel's comments about Kirk praised the decision, including President Trump, who congratulated ABC on his Truth Social platform \"for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also speculated last week whether networks that cover him negatively should have their broadcast licenses revoked.",
      "\"They give me only bad publicity or press,\" the president told reporters on Sept. 18. \"I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr.\"",
      "But one prominent conservative, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, was specifically critical of Carr's comments to Johnson.",
      "\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas,'\" Cruz said Friday on his podcast. \"That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it.'\"",
      "Kimmel's show, which launched in 2003, tapes in front of a studio audience on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. The guests for Tuesday's show included actor Glen Powell and singer Sarah McLachlan.",
      "Joe  Walsh, \n                                                  \n                                  Aimee  Picchi, \n                                                  \n                                  Kathryn  Watson and \n                                                  \n                                  Mary  Cunningham\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Among the other big names set to perform are Bill Burr, Dave Chapelle and Kevin Hart.",
      "In an\u00a0episode\u00a0of his podcast The Tim Dillon Show released online on Sept. 20, the comedian said he had been \"fired\" from the festival because of jokes he had previously made referencing the alleged use of\u00a0forced labor in the conservative Islamic kingdom.",
      "\"They heard what you said about them having slaves,\" Dillon recalled his manager telling him in a previous conversation, in the podcast. \"They didn't like that.\"",
      "\"I addressed it in a funny way, and they fired me,\" he said. \"I certainly wasn't gonna show up in your country and insult the people that are paying me the money.\"",
      "The remarks referenced were part of a previous podcast episode, aired on Aug. 30, in which Dillon repeatedly joked about alleged slavery in Saudi Arabia, and his decision to accept a reported payment of $375,000 for his performance at the Riyadh festival.",
      "CBS News has not been able to independently verify that figure, and representatives of Dillon have not responded to requests for comment on his contract with the Saudi government-run festival, or his apparent removal from it.",

      "The comedy festival will be the latest in a string of major sporting and cultural events in Saudi Arabia, which critics say are part of a concerted effort to deflect attention from human rights issues in the kingdom.",

      "Joey Shea, a researcher for the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch organization alleged to CBS News the comedy festival was a \"deliberate effort to whitewash the country's human rights record and deflect from the egregious abuses that continue to happen inside of the country.\"",
      "Shea told CBS News the Western comedians should use their platform to draw attention to Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, and avoid being \"complicit in covering up the abuses of a repressive regime.\"",

    "story": [
      "A former stylist for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs \u2014 who testified against the disgraced music mogul in his federal criminal trial earlier this year \u2014 filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing Combs of sexual abuse and violence while he was in Combs' employ.",
      "The 37-page lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on behalf of Deonte Nash against Combs and Combs' label, Bad Boy Entertainment, also accuses Combs of sexual battery, human trafficking and false imprisonment.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Nash said he was hired to be Combs' stylist around 2008, at the age of 21, and worked for him until about 2018. Nash said that during that time period, he also worked as a stylist and creative director for Combs' then-girlfriend, R&B singer Cassandra Ventura, who also accused Combs of sexual abuse in a 2023 lawsuit and gave graphic testimony against him in his trial.",
      "\"Nash personally experienced sexual, physical, mental, and emotional abuse at the hands of Defendants during his ten-year employment,\" including \"forced tests of loyalty and manipulation, sexual harassment and sexual assaults, physical violence and manhandling, labor trafficking, threats of harm, and threats of death,\" the lawsuit against Combs reads.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that Nash was sexually assaulted by Combs on \"multiple occasions.\"",
      "Nash said the alleged abuse prompted him to resign in 2018, but Combs \"continued to threaten Mr. Nash after his employment ended.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Combs' attorneys for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "In one incident that Nash claims occurred in 2013 or 2014, Combs discovered that Nash and Ventura had gone out to dinner in L.A. without Combs' permission. The following day, the lawsuit states, Combs \"threw\" Nash \"onto the car and violently strangled him.\"",
      "On another occasion in 2014, Combs and his security team allegedly entered Nash's home without permission, during which they \"confiscated Mr. Nash's keys and phone while they forcibly searched the house\" for Ventura, the lawsuit says.",
      "\"After enduring years of abuse, I finally found the courage during the criminal trial, and I am now ready to take action,\" Nash said in a statement. \"Sean Combs has never taken accountability for the years of harm he inflicted on me and so many others.\"",
      "In July, following a lengthy trial, the 55-year-old Combs was found guilty of two counts of prostitution-related charges, but acquitted on more serious charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.",
      "He is\u00a0scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 3.",
      "During the trial, Ventura testified that she was repeatedly physically and sexually abused by Combs over the course of their relationship. She testified about a 2016 incident, which was caught on\u00a0surveillance video, that showed Combs violently assaulting her in the hallway of a California hotel.",
      "Nash also testified in the trial that Combs threatened Ventura and that he \"would beat her.\"",
      "Nash testified about a time when Combs allegedly grabbed a sleeping Ventura by the hair and started hitting her \"pretty hard.\" Nash said Ventura's head hit a bed frame and started bleeding, and Combs then told her, Nash and an assistant, \"Look what y'all made me do.\"",
      "Nash testified he dialed 911 but was told to hang up. He said he feared retaliation but did tell some of Combs' employees about the alleged abuse and told jurors Combs got physical with him a few times.",

Findley  then threatened to sell Graceland to the highest bidder if Presley's family didn't pay a $2.85 million settlement, according to prosecutors.",
      "Findley posed as three different people allegedly involved with the fake lender, fabricated loan documents and published a fraudulent foreclosure notice in a Memphis newspaper announcing the auction of Graceland in May 2024, prosecutors said. A judge stopped the sale after Riley Keough, Lisa Marie's daughter, sued.",

      "Among other things, they noted that he had to let go over 100 employees from his businesses and many of them have been unable to get new jobs because of their past association with Combs.",
      "His seven children, they said, have faced \"devastating consequences,\" including lost business opportunities in acting, television, fashion and concerts, with some of them being included in some of the nearly 100 civil lawsuits filed against Combs since his arrest.",
      "The lawyers also noted that Combs and his family were set to star in a Hulu show about their lives, but the show was cancelled once the allegations against him became public.",
      "Combs was removed from the boards at three charter schools he created in Harlem, the Bronx and Connecticut and was stripped of an honorary doctorate degree from Howard University, which plans to return his prior donations, they said.",
      "Inmate approached Combs with a shiv, lawyers say",
      "Meanwhile, Combs's life in prison has been harrowing at times, even as it has allowed him to become sober for the first time in 25 years, his lawyers said.",
      "On one occasion, another inmate approached Combs with a shiv, accusing Combs of sitting on a chair that the inmate wanted to sit on, before Combs defused the situation and calmed the man and his makeshift weapon down, the lawyers said.",
      "They said he has been under constant suicide watch, meaning every two hours he must present his identification card to guards to show he is alive and well and is awakened from sleep in a brightly lighted cell by a guard to ensure he is well.",
      "He also has limited access to clean water, leaving him to heat the water that he drinks to ensure it won't make him sick and he must sleep within two feet of other inmates in a dorm-style room containing a bathroom and no door, the lawyers wrote.",
      "\"Mr. Combs has not breathed fresh air in nearly 13 months, or felt sunlight on his skin, often walking with a limp due to a painful knee injury that requires surgery,\" they said. And the food, they added, sometimes contains maggots.",
      "Lawyers say Combs had no choice to face trial after plea offer",
      "Prior to trial, the lawyers said, prosecutors offered Combs a plea deal that would have recommended a prison sentence of at least 25 years and required him to plead guilty to crimes of which he was acquitted.",
      "They portrayed their client as a changed man, who had realized that his overuse of drugs, including some prescribed by doctors, had contributed to violent acts he participated in.",
      "\"Without minimizing Mr. Combs's conduct, this is in many ways a 'sex, drugs, and rock n' roll' story,\" they said. \"Mr. Combs had severe substance abuse problems throughout the entirety of the offense conduct and participated in a high-octane celebrity lifestyle.\"",
      "The music maven's trial featured lengthy testimony from two former girlfriends of Combs who said they felt forced to participate in drug-fueled sex marathons with male sex workers as Combs watched and sometimes filmed the dayslong encounters.",
      "R&B singer Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura testified that she participated in hundreds of the meetups that were referred to as \"freak-offs\" while she was his most frequent girlfriend from 2007 to 2018.",
      "Another ex-girlfriend, testifying under the pseudonym \"Jane,\" said she also felt pressured to perform sexually with male sex workers while she dated Combs from 2021 until his arrest at a New York hotel a year ago.",
      "Lawyers say a sober Combs looks to new future unlike his past",
      "There was also extensive testimony during the trial about Combs beating his girlfriends and using violence and the fears of it to control those around him.",
      "Defense lawyers at trial conceded there was domestic abuse but said the charges brought by prosecutors were not proven.",
      "While he was once so depressed in jail that \"there were days when he was unable to get out of his bed or even talk to the psychology department,\" his lawyers said he looks forward to the future.",
      "They said he has begun teaching other inmates essential skills in business management, entrepreneurship and personal development.",
      "The lawyers wrote that the education program has become \"one of the most impactful and important endeavors of his life\" and he hopes to expand it to state-run facilities once he is released.",
      "\"He is a humbled man who understands that the most important things in life are his devotion to and quality time with his family and his contributions for the benefit of others,\" they said.",
      "Possibility of a pardon",
      "Combs' lead attorney, Marc Agnifilo, told CBS News in July that he has not had any conversations with the Trump administration about seeking a pardon for his client after another attorney for Combs, Nicole Westmoreland, told\u00a0CNN\u00a0it was her understanding that the defense team \"had conversations in reference to a pardon.\"",
      "But Agnifilo told CBS News, \"I have nothing to do with a possible pardon.\"",
      "\"I have had conversations with nobody,\" Agnifilo said. \"I have not spoken to the president. I have not spoken to anybody who speaks to the president about Sean Combs. I have not.\"",
      "He says he hasn't discussed it with Combs either, except to tell him what's in the news.",
      "\"He says, 'Go tell him (Mr. Trump) that I need a pardon,'\" Agnofilo said. \"'Go tell him I deserve a pardon.' That's what he said.\"",

    "summary": "\"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" had been preempted on Wednesday following comments Kimmel made on the show in response to the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
    "story": [
      "After being pulled off the air nearly a week ago, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" will return on Tuesday, The Walt Disney Company announced Monday.",
      "The late-night show had been \"pre-empted indefinitely\" last week following comments Kimmel made on the show in response to\u00a0the shooting death\u00a0of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "In a statement Monday, The Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, said Kimmel's show was suspended \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\" adding that some of the host's comments were \"ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"",
      "\"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,\" Disney said.",
      "Kimmel had not yet commented on Monday on his show's return.",
      "The late-night host made the remarks in his monologue on Sept. 15, saying: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\" He also mocked Mr. Trump's reaction to the shooting.",
      "Before Disney announced last week that Kimmel's show was \"pre-empted indefinitely,\" Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr called the remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" and said there was a \"path forward for suspension over this.\"",
      "\"The FCC is going to have remedies we could look at,\" he said during a podcast interview, telling host Benny Johnson: \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"",
      "Kimmel faced criticism from conservatives over his comments. Mr. Trump last week had congratulated ABC for \"finally having the courage to do what had to be done.\"",
      "ABC parent company Disney has faced fallout in Hollywood over the move: Other late-night hosts have publicly sided with Kimmel, A-listers like Tom Hanks and Robert De Niro signed an open letter calling it a \"dark moment for freedom of speech,\" and screenwriter and \"Lost\" co-creator Damon Lindelof vowed not to work with Disney unless Kimmel's show is restored. Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who led Disney for more than two decades, spoke out and defended Kimmel last week, writing on X: \"Where has all the leadership gone? If not for university presidents, law firm managing partners, and corporate chief executives standing up against bullies, who then will step up for the first amendment?\"",
      "Carr's comments on Kimmel drew pushback on First Amendment grounds, with the FCC's sole Democrat-appointed commissioner, Anna Gomez, arguing the agency had used Kimmel's \"inopportune joke as a pretext to punish speech it disliked.\" Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas also sharply criticized Carr for urging ABC to crack down on Kimmel, calling the Trump appointee's comments \"dangerous as hell\" and \"right out of 'Goodfellas.'\" Cruz chairs the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.",
      "ABC's announcement last week came after media giant Nexstar announced that it would preempt Kimmel's show indefinitely on all its stations over Kimmel's remarks. Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar's broadcasting division, said the comments were \"offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located.\"",
      "Nexstar owns and operates more than 200 stations nationwide, including more than two dozen ABC affiliates. Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it. A Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News last week that the decision was \"made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision.\"",
      "Another major station owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group, also said last week that it was pulling Kimmel's show.",
      "\"Regardless of ABC's plans for the future of the program, Sinclair intends not to return 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' to our air until we are confident that appropriate steps have been taken to uphold the standards expected of a national broadcast platform,\" Sinclair said last week in a statement.",
      "On Monday night, Sinclair posted a statement on X saying it will preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" across its ABC affiliate stations and will be \"replacing it with news programming\" beginning Tuesday night. \"Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,\" Sinclair said.",

    "summary": "The action movie star, who tapped into some childhood trauma to play mixed martial arts fighter Mark Kerr in his new film, reveals that he told costar Emily Blunt and director Benny Safdie he was scared to take on the dramatic role.",
    "story": [
      "This picturesque farm in rural Virginia is Dwayne Johnson's very private sanctuary, with a well-stocked pond that he usually fishes alone. \"Just me,\" he said, \"and I'll bring the girls here, and it's magical. Just the way the property is set up, I never have to see anybody. And I know it sounds crazy, and maybe kind of weird, but that's fun for me.\"",
      "I asked, \"What does that do for you?\"",
      "\"Peace,\" he replied.",
      "Peace has been hard to come by lately. Last month, Johnson made his first trip to the Venice Film Festival, for what is probably the most ambitious film of his career, \"The Smashing Machine.\" He plays the real-life mixed martial arts fighter Mark Kerr, a two-time world champion who fought drug addiction and depression.",
      "Johnson endured three hours of makeup and prosthetics a day to look like Kerr, and he's never played anyone quite so real before. But it's something he says he's been aching to do.",
      "\"For years, I've been dreaming and hoping,\" he said. \"My desire was to play not only a dramatic role, but something that I felt like I could really sink my teeth into, and rip myself open. You hear that term. I just didn't want to do drama. I wanted to do something that really allowed me to do that.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Smashing Machine\" click on the player below:",
      "I asked, \"This is a big, raw role. Did you have any doubts that you could do it?\"",
      "\"When it became real, yes,\" he said.",
      "Director Benny Safdie paired Johnson with Emily Blunt as Mark Kerr's volatile wife, Dawn Staples. The two last worked together in Disney's 2021 film \"Jungle Cruise,\" the kind of film on which Johnson built his multi-billion-dollar career.",
      "\"I was chasing something for a lot of years, and what I was chasing was box office,\" he said. \"And there's a part of me, the brain [that goes], 'Don't rock the boat. Stay in this zone. Everyone's happy. You're paying the bills.' But the heart is like, 'Yeah. But you're not being fulfilled.'\"",
      "\"Did you feel like that, you weren't being fulfilled?\" I asked.",
      "\"One hundred percent,\" Johnson said. \"But I was really nervous. And on day one, I remember Benny coming to me, and Emily as well, [they] said, 'Are you scared?' I went, 'Yes.'\"",
      "\"You flat out said, 'Yes, I'm scared'?\"",
      "\"Absolutely. I am.\"",
      "And Dwayne Johnson doesn't scare easily.",
      "His father was a professional wrestler, and with dad on the road a lot of the time, young Dwayne grew up with his share of trauma. When he was 15, Dwayne and his mom were evicted from their apartment because they couldn't pay the rent.",
      "He moved around a lot, and eventually started wrestling on local TV in Memphis, which he showed us in 2022.",
      "We also saw where he stayed back then: a dilapidated trailer in nearby Mississippi.",
      "The trailer park kid fought his way out of poverty, became the wrestling legend known as \"The Rock,\" and eventually moved into movies, from action (the \"Fast and the Furious\" series) to animation (\"Moana\").",
      "For \"The Smashing Machine,\" he had to find a way to transform into someone whose whole world was coming apart, like the scene where Mark Kerr loses his first fight. To conjure up the feelings of despair on camera, Johnson knew right where to go. \"I went back to what it's like being a 15-year-old kid and coming home and being evicted,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"You said it felt like you were ripping yourself open. What do you think that did for you, Dwayne Johnson, ripping yourself open like that?\"",
      "\"The thing that I was running from, which was ripping myself open, is actually the thing that I needed the most,\" he replied, \"because it made me realize that the thing I love, which is acting and telling these stories, now I see it in a different world.\"",
      "These days, Johnson talks a lot about gratitude. At his property in Virginia, far from the trailer in Mississippi, he said, \"Even more reason to be grateful.\"",
      "One thing he won't talk about: Oscar buzz. \"No, no, I can't, I can't,\" he said. \"The thought that that is even a question? \u00a0\u2026 \u00a0You know, trailer park kid.\"",
      "The married father of three will be starting work on another \"Moana\" film soon, and also another drama. Yes, Dwayne Johnson will always be The Rock, but as any scientist can tell you, rocks can change.",
      "This Rock, for one, seems smaller now. \"Yeah. Svelte!\" he laughed. \"Because I'm preparing for a role.\"",
      "\"So, this really is, this is like a new era for you?\"",
      "\"It's a new, I wouldn't say, chapter. I would say new book. A whole new book. And I love it.\"",

      "On August 16, 1977, I was meeting my sister for lunch on Melrose Avenue. It was a strangely cold and damp day for summer in Los Angeles. As I neared the restaurant, Michelle was flagging me down from the corner across the street. When I came to a stop, she rushed over to the car. She told me that she'd just had a call from Dad. Joe Esposito was phoning all over, trying to get a hold of me. It was something about Elvis being in the hospital. My heart stopped. I knew Joe wouldn't be doing that if it was just another of Elvis's hospital stays. Something must be terribly wrong.",
      "I did a U-turn and raced home, running traffic lights and going far too fast. Cars skidded to a halt to miss me. It's a miracle I didn't get hit. All the way home, I prayed over and over, \"Dear God, please let it be all right.\" Lisa was at Graceland, due to come home later that day, so she was part of whatever was happening.",
      "When I reached home, I could hear the phone ringing as I got out of the car. I prayed it would keep ringing until I reached it. I let myself into the house with shaking hands and grabbed the receiver.",
      "It was Joe. I said, \"What's happened?\" He replied, \"It's Elvis.\"",
      "\"Oh my God.\"",
      "\"Cilla, he's dead. We've lost him.\" His voice broke.",
      "I began screaming, \"No! No, no, no, no, no!\" I started to sob, and I could hear Joe crying on the other end of the line.",
      "\"Joe, where's Lisa?\"",
      "\"She's okay. She's with Grandma.\" I asked Joe to send a plane for me, as quickly as he could, and hung up. The questions I needed answered would have to wait.",
      "A few minutes later, the phone rang again, and when I picked it up, I heard Lisa's voice saying, \"Mommy! Mommy! Something's happened to Daddy! Everybody's crying.\"",
      "I could hear Vernon's voice in the background, sobbing and saying, \"My son! My son!\"",
      "I told Lisa, \"I know, baby,\" and reassured her that Daddy's plane was coming for me soon. I told her to wait with Grandma until I got there. She said she was going outside to play with her friend.",
      "I hung up in a kind of daze. I couldn't absorb what Joe had told me. How could Elvis be dead? I had just talked to him two days before. He'd sounded good.",
      "Joe sent Elvis's private plane, the Lisa Marie, to pick up Michelle and me, my parents, Jerry Schilling, and a handful of other close friends to fly us to Memphis. When we got to Graceland, I found Lisa playing golf carts in the yard with one of her friends. At first, I thought it was an odd reaction, and I worried about what the paparazzi would make of Lisa playing in the wake of her father's death. But then I realized it was a child's way of escaping the reality of the silent house. I hugged her close, then went inside.",
      "I still didn't know what had happened, so Joe told me. Ginger had found Elvis unconscious, face down on the floor of the bathroom, that afternoon. She called downstairs for help, and Joe had raced upstairs. He knew immediately that Elvis had passed, but he didn't want to believe it. My heart plummeted as Joe confirmed that Lisa had seen Elvis's body. Elvis was still face down on the floor when she saw him, his face buried in the shag carpet. Lisa had been afraid he was suffocating. Joe wasn't sure if she'd understood what she was seeing. He'd sent her to see Grandma while the ambulance came. He did chest compressions while they waited for the ambulance. A doctor continued efforts to resuscitate Elvis as they raced to the hospital, but all the efforts were futile. Shortly after arrival, Elvis was pronounced dead. Apparently, it was a heart attack.",
      "Inside Graceland, the atmosphere was eerie. The house seemed hollow and dead. It was as if the energy had been sucked out of it\u2014Elvis's life force. We all walked around like zombies. Vernon was distraught. He felt Elvis's passing very, very deeply. It broke my heart to see such a strong man repeatedly call out his son's name, tears streaming down his face. He was losing his only child. A part of Vernon was lost that day as well. I never again saw the energy he once had. When- ever he'd come into a room and said, \"Hey, son,\" his face would light up with a smile. I never saw that smile again. Grandma struggled to believe that Elvis was gone. After he left us, she always carried a little handkerchief. I'd see her tearing up, and she'd wipe her eyes and whisper, \"My boy.\"",
      "There was no privacy for those of us closest to Elvis, including the family. People and cameras surrounded the property. Mourners waited to be admitted to the house for a public viewing of Elvis's open casket. The funeral was a nationally televised event. The streets near Graceland were thronged with tens of thousands of people. The crowds were so large by the second day that President Jimmy Carter called up the Air National Guard to help local police. It was hot and muggy, and some in the crowd fainted from the heat and from emotion. In the afternoon, thousands of people filed past the open casket that had been set up in the front hall. Lisa stayed with Elvis's body as much as she could. She didn't want to leave him. We sat on the stairs and watched as people walked by. Crowds of strangers in Elvis's home, crying and paying their respects. Some mourners had walked away from their jobs to drive sixteen hours or more to Memphis and line up along Elvis Presley Boulevard, hoping to be admitted to the house. The trip was a financial sacrifice for many of them, for much of the crowd was made up of the everyday people who identified with Elvis as one of their own. He, too, had come from poverty. He had remained loyal to his hometown and his family, and he never got above his upbringing. They felt compelled to pay their respects as they would to a family member. It was overwhelming. There wasn't room yet for our own grief.",
      "His memorial was an international event. While mourners gathered in Memphis, Christ's Church in London held a service in Elvis's honor. Over five hundred people crowded the sanctuary and the lawn outside. At the close of the service, they all sang \"Amazing Grace\" in his honor. Elvis's passing was felt not just in Memphis, but around the world.",
      "The private funeral service was held in the living room and adjoining music room, with the peacock glass framing an archway between the two. Elvis's coffin was moved into the room for the service. Vernon had hired a local preacher who didn't know Elvis and who talked primarily about Elvis's legendary generosity. The Blackwood Brothers, longtime friends and backup singers for Elvis, sang gospel songs. I sat on the couch with Lisa and Vernon, numb with grief. It was all a blur at the time, and it still is.",
      "Lisa and I waited until we could be alone with Elvis to say goodbye. I had bought a silver bracelet engraved with the words, \"I love you, Daddy,\" for Lisa to give him. I helped her put it around his wrist. Then we each kissed him one last time. I'm not sure it hit me until then that he was really gone. The body I had held and caressed so many times was now stiff and empty. It was an eerie, aching feeling.",
      "A line of white Cadillacs formed the funeral procession to the Forest Hill Cemetery. Lisa and I rode with Vernon in the car immediately following the hearse. Elvis was entombed in the Presley family crypt with his mother. Two days later, after two thieves tried to steal the coffin, he was moved to the Meditation Garden at Graceland and kept under security. Gladys was moved to Graceland shortly afterward, to lie beside him. Elvis and I used to sit in that garden in the small hours of the morning, in the peace and the moonlight. I was glad they had brought him home.",
      "Vernon had a bronze plaque made to cover the coffin, with an inscription ending, \"We miss you, Son and Daddy.\"",
      "I returned home to LA with Lisa, feeling that a large part of me had died with Elvis. I couldn't accept that he had passed. I'd felt Elvis would always be there. He was such a force of nature. Despite all my fears for him, I never thought he would die at the age he did. He was still so young. He'd talked so much about what he still wanted to do. He had plans for his music and for his life. Elvis wasn't ready to leave. I wasn't ready.",
      "It was a constant battle to accept that he was gone. Every morning, I would wake up and remember, \"Oh God, Elvis isn't here anymore. How can I live knowing that?\" I was frightened to be in a world without Elvis in it.",
      "There would be no more calls. I would never again pick up the phone and hear his voice. There would be no more visits, no more dropping by unexpectedly. I wouldn't be going to Graceland anymore, except to visit Grandma and Vernon. There was no more Memphis Mafia. Everybody scattered. Everything changed. I changed. I had been happy-go-lucky, always excited about where we were going or what we were doing next. I had finally adjusted to the separation, feeling free and adventurous. Optimistic. My memories of Elvis had been happy ones. When I went somewhere we'd been, I would think, \"Oh my gosh, we went here.\" I remembered the times fans would cling to him and want pictures. They loved him and didn't want to let him go, and when he tried to escape, a trail of girls would follow him. It had been fun. He had so much charm and was so generous to loved ones and strangers alike. It filled him with joy when he was able to do something special for other people.",
      "Now my mind was filled with images of loss. I couldn't get away from reminders of him. The media was filled with articles and broadcasts about Elvis, and his songs flooded the radio stations. If I went out, people would come over and say, \"I'm so sorry.\" I knew they meant well, but it was painful. For a long time after Elvis passed, I rarely went anywhere. I waited a while to continue with my life.",
      "Worst of all, I no longer had a father for my daughter. I was raising my child by myself, a brokenhearted child who had lost her daddy. When we got back home from the funeral, we were surrounded by reminders of his passing. I had to protect her from all the news reports, the unwanted attention, the nonstop condolence calls. It seemed like every newspaper and magazine had a headline about his passing. If Lisa and I went to the grocery store, I'd pull the ones with headlines out of the rack and turn them around in the checkout line so Lisa wouldn't see them. To get her away from the constant reminders, I decided to send her to summer camp. I hoped it would not only insulate her from the publicity but also take her mind off her thoughts. Joanie's kids and some of her other friends were there. I checked on her regularly at camp, and she seemed to be doing pretty well. She later said that camp had helped. When it ended for the summer, my sister and I took her out of the country to give her some privacy until the incessant publicity died down. We went to England and later to Europe.

    "summary": "In her new book, Priscilla Presley writes what she calls her final telling of what it was like to be a queen to the King, and what came after.",
    "story": [
      "It was a truly Vegas affair at the Aladdin Hotel; Elvis in a paisley tux, Priscilla with a rhinestone tiara. By the time they'd met, when Priscilla Beaulieu was just 14, Elvis Presley had already gyrated his way into pop culture, from his music to his movies.",
      "He redefined what celebrity was, and yet, Hollywood was no place for him. \"He would always go back to Memphis; that's where home was,\" said Priscilla.",
      "Priscilla met Elvis while he was in the Army stationed in Germany. The only thing that made more news than their relationship was their divorce in 1973. \"I mean, I was very much in love with Elvis, very much,\" said Priscilla, now 80. \"I am still very much in love with him. I didn't leave him because I didn't love him; I just couldn't live the life.\"",
      "Her split from Elvis is where she begins \"Softly, as I Leave You\" (to be published Tuesday), what she says is her final telling of what it was like to be a queen to the King, and what came after. \"I was living Elvis' life,\" she said. \"It was all about him. I had to find me. Who was I? I was Elvis' wife. I don't think we could ever have a life that I wanted. I wanted him for myself.\"",
      "But so did his fans. Elvis, it seemed was destined to be shared. \"I thought, well, what if he runs into someone he falls in love with?\" said Priscilla. \"And I mentioned it to him, and he goes, 'You don't have to worry. You never have to worry.' But when you see these beautiful girls hanging out, I'm going,\u00a0Could that be the one?",
      "\"I couldn't live a life of being in panic all the time, of losing him to someone else,\" she said.",
      "There were affairs on both sides, and yet after their divorce, they still couldn't quit each other. They stayed uncommonly close. Neither ever remarried. \"We couldn't find anyone else!\" she laughed.",
      "She started businesses, and began taking acting classes. She says it helped with her shyness, and grew her confidence. She was also busy raising her and Elvis' only daughter, Lisa Marie. They had joint custody for nearly four years \u2026 before it all ended.",
      "At age 42, Elvis was gone.",
      "Priscilla had seen the changes \u2013 the bloating, the slurred words, the drugs.",
      "I asked, \"Was there anybody around him who could convince him to stop?\"",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"You couldn't convince Elvis on anything unless he believed in it or, you know, thought about it.\"",
      "She said doctors would basically give him anything he wanted, enabling him. \"He was Elvis; you're not going to say no to Elvis,\" she said.",
      "In his absence sat Graceland, the Memphis mansion that had been hemorrhaging money. The urge was to sell. Priscilla said, \"And I looked at the guy who was telling me, the attorney, and I said, 'That will never happen, ever.'\"",
      "Instead, she opened it to the public. It went from a home to a family shrine.",
      "By the time Lisa Marie turned 25, Elvis' inheritance was hers. It was 1993, the same year another King popped the question \u2026 the King of Pop, Michael Jackson.",
      "Priscilla recalled, \"We were walking on the beach, and she said, 'Mom, you know, Michael wants to get married.' I said, 'Lisa, I'm not really for it.' And she goes, 'Why not.' And I go, 'Who are you? Michael Jackson, Lisa Presley?' And I knew that Michael loved attention, which he did. I knew that's the reason why. They didn't even know each other that long.\"",
      "Priscilla was no fan of another celebrity, O.J. Simpson. She worked with him on the \"Naked Gun\" series. \"He could be very, very nice, but I just didn't, I just felt something about him in the way he was with his wife, and it didn't set well with me,\" she said.",
      "That said, Priscilla was a huge fan of co-star Leslie Nielsen.",
      "Before \"Naked Gun,\" Priscilla had never done comedy. She was thought of in most circles as a more serious actor after her role in \"Dallas\" a few years before.",
      "\"Dallas\" was a spotlight the size of Texas, and Priscilla's role as Jenna Wade put her in the pop zeitgeist all over again.",
      "She left the series after having her second child, Navarone, with her longtime partner Marco Garibaldi.",
      "In 2023, her last physical link with Elvis left. Lisa Marie Presley died suddenly at her home in California from complications after bariatric surgery, and once again the Presley name was draped in grief.",
      "\"I miss her every day,\" Priscilla said. \"I miss her, but I have to let that go and live my life. But her spirit is still with me very, very much.\"",
      "She's buried at Graceland, like her dad. Priscilla says she will be there one day, too. For her, the first home she had as a married woman will be her last.\u00a0 That's not looking backward, she says; it's a comfort for the future.",
      "\"When you stop and think about it, we're not here that long. We're not,\" Priscilla said. \"All of a sudden we're older and we think, Wow, I don't want to hold on to bad things. I don't want to hold on to, you know, things that are in the past that happened. I want to move forward.\"",

    "story": [
      "There was a warm glow in the mountains above Sundance this past week: Hundreds standing in line for a chairlift vigil to honor a man whose legacy is as solid as the mountain itself.",
      "Robert Redford spent most of his life up in the Utah mountains. It's where \"Sunday Morning\" first met him back in 1994.",
      "There was a gentleness between him and our Charles Kuralt; the outdoors meant the world to both of them.",
      "\"Every time I come up this canyon, every time I see that, and feel it, I realize that I'm not taking it for granted,\" Redford said.",
      "For someone so big, so famous, so incandescent, he seemed heroically untouchable, and yet, he was always more than gracious with us.",
      "Years after that first interview, he sat down with our Rita Braver, and a few years after that, he met with me.",
      "Across the decades, he never really changed; his passions, his principles, his politics \u2014 each was as firmly grounded as he was.",
      "As a kid growing up in Southern California, he'd watch other stars romance their way across the screen; frankly back then, he thought it was all pretty silly. \"Any time there was a love scene on the screen, we'd go, Aww! Boo! You tell him lover! And make fun of the scene,\" Redford said. \"Suddenly, the idea that I would be that guy was just too much for me to take.\"",
      "He wasn't always the heartthrob, of course, especially in his later works. In \"All Is Lost,\" it was all him. For an hour and forty-five minutes, he rarely even spoke, but we watched, because it was Redford.",
      "He was 77 when he shot that. He was 81 when he did \"The Old Man and the Gun.\" It was that film, he told us, that would likely be his last. As hard as it was for us to hear him say that, Redford replied, \"It's hard for me to say it! Well, yeah, it's hard to talk about your end. I mean, who does?\"",
      "Among his more than 80 films, many have become classics. He defined what a leading man was.",
      "And yet, when it came to his cultivation of younger filmmakers, celebrity was never a part of the conversation.",
      "His Sundance Institute wasn't looking for stars; it was looking for storytellers.",
      "Glenn Close was in it from the beginning. \"I think he's an extraordinary man,\" she told us last January. \"And I think the fact that he put his money and his time and his influence where his mouth was in this industry is remarkable.\"",
      "His activism left us with a lot to think about \u2013 our place in the word, the false pride of celebrity, the need for wild places.",
      "At a time when Hollywood voices are being discounted, Robert Redford's legacy reminds us that a voice in the wilderness can indeed echo a long way.",

    "summary": "Sonny Curtis died Friday, his wife of more than a half-century, Louise Curtis, confirmed to The Associated Press.",
    "story": [
      "Sonny Curtis, a vintage rock 'n' roller who wrote the raw classic \"I Fought the Law\" and posed the enduring question \"Who can turn the world on with her smile?\" as the writer-crooner of the theme song to \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" has died at 88.",
      "Curtis, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Crickets in 2012, died Friday, his wife of more than a half-century, Louise Curtis, confirmed to The Associated Press. A statement from his family on his Facebook page Saturday said that he had become suddenly ill.",
      "\"He made a mark on this world, and he made a mark on the hearts of all who knew him. It's a sad day, but what a life. May we look at his life with joy rather than sadness. He would have wanted that,\" the statement read.",
      "The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum also acknowledged Curtis' death.",
      "\"Sonny Curtis was a gentle, humble man who wrote extraordinary songs,\" said Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, in a statement.",
      "Curtis wrote or co-wrote hundreds of songs, from Keith Whitley's country smash \"I'm No Stranger to the Rain\" to the Everly Brothers' \"Walk Right Back,\" a personal favorite Curtis completed while in Army basic training. Bing Crosby, Glen Campbell, Bruce Springsteen and the Grateful Dead were among other artists who covered his work.",
      "Curtis' start with Buddy Holly",
      "Born during the Great Depression to cotton farmers outside of Meadow, Texas, Curtis was a childhood friend of Buddy Holly's and an active musician in the formative years of rock, whether jamming on guitar with Holly in the mid-1950s or opening for Elvis Presley when Elvis was still a regional act. Curtis' songwriting touch also soon emerged: Before he turned 20, he had written the hit \"Someday\" for Webb Pierce and \"Rock Around With Ollie Vee\" for Holly.",
      "Curtis had left Holly's group, the Crickets, before Holly became a major star. But he returned after Holly died in a plane crash in 1959 and he was featured the following year on the album \"In Style with the Crickets,\" which included \"I Fought the Law\" (dashed off in a single afternoon, according to Curtis, who would say he had no direct inspiration for the song) and the Jerry Allison collaboration \"More Than I Can Say,\" a hit for Bobby Vee, and later for Leo Sayer.",
      "Meanwhile, it took until 1966 for \"I Fought the Law\" and its now-immortal refrain \"I fought the law \u2014 and the law won\" to catch on: The Texas-based Bobby Fuller Four made it a Top 10 song. Over the following decades, it was covered by dozens of artists, from punk (the Clash) to country (Johnny Cash, Nanci Griffith) to Springsteen, Tom Petty and other mainstream rock stars.",
      "\"It's my most important copyright,\" Curtis told The Tennessean in 2014.",
      "\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\"",
      "Curtis' other signature song was as uplifting as \"I Fought the Law\" was resigned. In 1970, he was writing commercial jingles when he came up with the theme for a new CBS sitcom starring Moore as a single woman hired as a TV producer in Minneapolis. He called the song \"Love is All Around,\" and used a smooth melody to eventually serve up lyrics as indelible as any in television history:",
      "\"Who can turn the world on with her smile? / Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile? / Well it's you girl, and you should know it / With each glance and every little movement you show it.\"",
      "The song's endurance was sealed by the images it was heard over, especially Moore's triumphant toss of her hat as Curtis proclaims, \"You're going to make it after all.\" In tribute, other artists began recording it, including Sammy Davis Jr., Joan Jett and the Blackhearts and Minnesota's H\u00fcsker D\u00fc. A commercial release featuring Curtis came out in 1980 and was a modest success, peaking at No. 29 on Billboard's country chart.",
      "Curtis would recall being commissioned by his friend Doug Gilmore, a music industry road manager who had heard the sitcom's developers were looking for an opening song.",
      "\"Naturally I said yes, and later that morning, he dropped off a four-page format \u2014 you know 'Girl from the Midwest, moves to Minneapolis, gets a job in a newsroom, can't afford her apartment etc.,' which gave me the flavor of what it was all about,\" said Curtis, who soon met with show co-creator (and later Oscar-winning filmmaker) James L. Brooks.",
      "\"James L. Brooks came into this huge empty room, no furniture apart from a phone lying on the floor, and at first, I thought he was rather cold and sort of distant, and he said 'We're not at the stage of picking a song yet, but I'll listen anyway,'\" Curtis recalled. \"So I played the song, just me and my guitar, and next thing, he started phoning people, and the room filled up, and then he sent out for a tape recorder.\"",
      "Curtis would eventually write two versions: the first used in Season 1, the second and better known for the remaining six seasons. The original words were more tentative, opening with \"How will you make it on your own?\" and ending with \"You might just make it after all.\" By Season 2, the show was a hit and the lyrics were reworked. The producers had wanted Andy Williams to sing the theme song, but he turned it down and Curtis' easygoing baritone was heard instead.",
      "Solo career",
      "Curtis made a handful of solo albums, including \"Sonny Curtis\" and \"Spectrum,\" and hit the country Top 20 with the 1981 single \"Good Ol' Girls.\" In later years, he continued to play with Allison and other members of the Crickets. The band released several albums, among them \"The Crickets and Their Buddies,\" featuring appearances by Eric Clapton, Graham Nash and Phil Everly. One of Curtis' more notable songs was \"The Real Buddy Holly Story,\" a rebuke to the 1978 biopic \"The Buddy Holly Story,\" which starred Gary Busey.",
      "Curtis settled in Nashville in the mid-1970s and lived there with his wife, Louise. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1991 and, as part of the Crickets, into Nashville's Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2007. Five years later, he and the Crickets were inducted into the Rock Hall, praised as \"the blueprint for rock and roll bands (that) inspired thousands of kids to start up garage bands around the world.\"",

      "Governors of the states, which make up the newly-formed West Coast Health Alliance, said in a joint press statement that their alliance was \"fighting back against the Trump administration's assault on science.\" Earlier this month, the states announced the formation of the alliance as a response to what it called the \"weaponization\" of the CDC, spearheaded by Health Secretary and vocal vaccine critic Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Kennedy's moves included firing all 17 members of the CDC's vaccine recommendations committee\u00a0and\u00a0replacing them with apointees that include vaccine skeptics, and\u00a0rolling back recommendations on who should receive COVID vaccines.",
      "\"Public health leaders warn these moves dismantle independent, science-based oversight and inject politics into decisions that protect Americans' health \u2014 undermining the CDC's credibility at a moment when trust and clarity are most needed,\" the alliance said Wednesday.",
      "The West Coast Health Alliance's recommendations for respiratory viruses say the COVID vaccine should be given to \"all who choose protection,\" and specifically children 6 months to 23 months old, all adults over 65, those younger than 65 with risk factors, and anyone pregnant or planning to get pregnant.",
      "The recommendations largely mirror what the CDC previously advised until this year, when Kennedy announced the CDC would no longer recommend the COVID vaccine for children and pregnant women.",
      "U.S. Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon criticized the alliance's recommendations in a statement to the Associated Press.",
      "\"Democrat-run states that pushed unscientific school lockdowns, toddler mask mandates, and draconian vaccine passports during the COVID era completely eroded the American people's trust in public health agencies,\" Nixon said. \"HHS will ensure policy is based on rigorous evidence and Gold Standard Science, not the failed politics of the pandemic.\"",
      "The alliance also recommended that everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine, and that all babies, people 50-74 years old with risk factors, and everyone 75 and\tolder receive the RSV vaccine.",
      "Separately, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced he had signed a new law, AB 144, which allows the state to base future immunization guidance on independent medical organizations rather than the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The law is designed to address which vaccines health insurance companies will cover, since insurers typically cover only those vaccines recommended by ACIP.",
      "Wednesday's announcement by the Western states comes on the same day former CDC chief Susan Monarez\u00a0told a Senate committee that she was fired by Kennedy for refusing to pre-approve childhood vaccine guidance regardless of the scientific data and refusing to dismiss career officials responsible for vaccine policy, without cause.",
      "Other states, including Colorado, Illinois,\u00a0Massachusetts, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania have issued COVID vaccine guidelines that differ from the CDC. Meanwhile, Florida this month announced it would be the first state to phase out all childhood vaccine mandates.",

    "story": [
      "A pair of e-commerce entrepreneurs who bought a number of well-known retail brands \u2014 including RadioShack, Modell's Sporting Goods and Pier 1 Imports \u2014 out of bankruptcy are accused of running a Ponzi scheme.",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday accused Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, founders of the Miami-based Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), of defrauding investors out of approximately $112 million.",
      "Through their holding company, Mehr and Lopez acquired distressed brick-and-mortar companies in order to turn them into successful, online-only brands. Dress Barn and Linens 'n Things were also among their acquisitions.",
      "REV acquired RadioShack in 2020, three years after the nearly century-old electronics chain filed for its second bankruptcy. RadioShack first filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2015.",
      "Modell's Sporting Goods filed for bankruptcy in March 2020, during which time it also announced it would be closing all of its stores. REV bought the Modell's brand name and assets in August 2020. Pier 1 Imports \u2014 which still exists as an online store \u2014 declared bankruptcy in early 2020. REV acquired its trademark name and assets later that same year.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/h-1b-visa-new-fee-immigration-impact-american-workers/",
    "published": "Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:23:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The large fee could help some U.S. workers find jobs, but there could be longer-term costs, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration says the new $100,000 fee for foreign employees to obtain an H-1B visa will spur companies to hire Americans instead of bringing in labor from overseas. Yet many economists predict the results will be more mixed, potentially fostering increased domestic hiring in some industries but slowing long-term economic growth with a knock-on effect on overall employment.",
      "\"I could envision a scenario in which otherwise available [American] employees see a large increase for their labor demand,\" Kirk Doran, associate professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame, said of the new visa policy. \"There is some evidence that for the kind of work H-1B employees do, there are available workers looking for jobs right now.\"",
      "In the near term, some technology industry workers in particular could see job gains as more companies seek to avoid the sharply higher costs of bringing in employees from overseas, Rutgers University labor economist Jennifer Hunt told CBS News.",
      "\"The winners would be U.S. native-born computer programmers,\" she said. \"If you're a native worker who is really similar to an immigrant, immigrants are usually bad for you. So we would expect current American, U.S. programmers to be helped.\"",
      "Yet the bigger picture is more complex. Other economic research shows that hiring immigrant workers often benefits companies, providing a ready source of skilled labor with the education and training that may not be widely available in the U.S.",
      "One 2024 study from the nonprofit IZA Institute of Labor Economics on the impact of U.S. immigration on employment said H-1B workers can \"help firms increase their employment, revenues and survival probabilities,\" while finding no evidence that hiring of foreign labor through the program displaced native-born American workers.",
      "The research \u2014 from economists at IZA, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, University of Delaware, University of Michigan and Queens College, CUNY \u2014 also found that every H-1B worker a company hired helped produce additional job gains. \"High-wage, high-productivity firms expand more and even crowd-in natives with college degrees\" when able to add H-1B workers, they wrote.",
      "George Mason University economics professor Michael Clemens underlined that H-1B workers with specialized skills can help boost a company's revenue and profits, potentially spawning other kinds of jobs at the employer, such as in sales and marketing, that can be filled by U.S. workers.",
      "As a result, Clemens worries that the policy change would hurt Americans' job prospects over the long term. \"It is going to choke off job opportunities for the people it is supposed to help,\" he said.",
      "Cost of restricting immigration",
      "To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company. Congress caps the number of H-1B visas \u2014 which are valid for three years and which can be extended for an additional three years \u2014 at 85,000 annually. Roughly 700,000 workers in the U.S. hold H-1B visas, according to Capital Economics.",
      "\"The costs of restricting immigration are widespread,\" Gaurav Khanna, a University of California San Diego professor of economics focusing on migration, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"On net, it benefits U.S. workers more than it hurts them, such that the benefits outweigh the costs. The visas allow the IT companies to grow quite rapidly, and these IT firms start hiring other workers in management positions and in HR, so it leads to employment growth at these firms.\"",
      "The White House dismissed the notion that hiring workers from abroad also benefits U.S. workers.",
      "\"President Trump continues to prove to so-called 'experts' wrong time and time again \u2013 no 'economic study' can change the reality lived by many Americans across the country who bore the brunt of the massive abuse of the H-1B system,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages.\"",
      "Rogers added that the visa fee protects \"Americans from cheap, foreign labor.\"",
      "In a\u00a0proclamation\u00a0last week, Mr. Trump said H-1B visas disadvantage Americans by allowing companies to exploit the program to \"replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.\" That has stunted job opportunities and undermined wages, he added.",
      "How much do H-1B workers earn?",
      "Some research supports this claim. For example, an August analysis\u00a0from The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, found that H-1B workers earn significantly less than their American counterparts.",
      "\"[M]any employers may be using the H-1B program not to attract top-tier global talent, but to fill roles at below-median wage levels\u2014raising questions about the program's alignment with its stated objectives,\" the report said.",
      "Other changes could be coming to the H-1B program, with the Trump administration aiming to tilt it toward better-paid foreign workers. On Monday, it proposed replacing the lottery with a system that would favor immigrants with advanced skills and higher incomes.",
      "The Heritage report also notes that the visas restrict worker mobility by tying a visa holder to a given company, preventing them from seeking other employment. That can make such workers more desirable to employers than native workers, who can leave their jobs at any time, the report explains.",
      "In this sense, companies' reliance on the program can hurt native workers, the group said.",
      "\"But this creates an uneven playing field: Native workers, who are free to switch jobs or negotiate better pay, may be overlooked not because they lack skills, but because they are not as easily retained or controlled,\" wrote Alexander Frei, the report's author and formerly a senior research associate at Heritage. \"As a result, employers may favor visa-bound workers who accept lower wages and fewer demands, driving down bargaining power and wage growth for equally or more qualified U.S. workers.\"",
      "Other groups have\u00a0criticized the H-1B program for disproportionately benefiting large, multinational firms that can enter thousands of visa applicants in the lottery and hire whomever is successful.",

      "U.S. District Judge Melissa Damian ruled Friday that the consumers who filed the class-action lawsuit failed to show that the lack of confectionary details on the chocolate and peanut butter candies, such as missing mouths and eyes on jack-'o-lanterns, ghosts and other Halloween-themed figures, had cause them economic harm.",
      "Damian pointed out that while the consumers may have been disappointed by the chocolates' unwrapped appearances, the candies were not \"so flawed as to render them worthless.\" In other words, the chocolate still tasted like chocolate, even if they weren't as haunting as the purchasers had expected from the packaging.",
      "The lawsuit focused on several Hershey candies that are marketed around Halloween, including its Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins and its Reese's White Ghost, as well as a few other holiday-themed chocolates like its Reese's Peanut Butter Shapes Assortment Snowmen Stockings Bells.",
      "The original lawsuit, filed in 2024, claimed that Hershey used deceptive advertising because the \"artistic designs\" depicted on the wrappers were absent from the actual candies.",
      "But the difference between the wrappers and the chocolates' actual appearances wasn't enough to prove \"a concrete economic injury,\" Damian wrote on Friday.",

    "published": "Wed, 24 Sep 2025 11:14:55 -0400",
    "summary": "The Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" spending and tax law will result in cuts to food stamp benefits for many Americans, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people who receive food stamps could soon see smaller benefits or even get kicked out of the program due to changes that are starting to roll out from the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, according to several analyses from the federal government and public policy think tanks.",
      "About 2.4 million people, or about 6% of enrollees, could lose access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), in an average month, because of the new law's changes, which include stricter work requirements, the Congressional Budget Office estimated last month.",
      "Millions more will see their monthly benefit amounts shrink because of other changes mandated by the law, such as a new restrictions on how an individual's benefits are calculated, it added. The total pool of people who will either be cut off from SNAP or see smaller monthly benefits could reach 22.3 million U.S. families, according to a July analysis from the Urban Institute.",
      "About 42 million individuals in 22.3 million households received food stamps in 2023, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report on the program.",
      "While SNAP is funded by the USDA, every U.S. state is in charge of administering the program to its residents, with those administrative costs split between the federal and state governments. Some states are already beginning to implement some of the new law's food stamp restrictions, such as Pennsylvania, which is mandating the stricter work rules starting Nov. 1.",
      "The changes are arriving at a precarious time for many, with grocery costs continuing to rise and poverty rates inching higher for senior citizens and Black Americans, according to new Census data. Anti-hunger advocates warn that reduced SNAP benefits could worsen food insecurity, undermining one of the nation's most effective safety nets credited with lifting 3.6 million people out of poverty last year, according to U.S. Census data.",
      "\"We are deeply concerned that the cuts to SNAP will lead to an increase in hunger,\" Carolyn Vega, associate director of policy analysis for Share Our Strength, an anti-hunger nonprofit, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You are looking at households that don't have a lot of extra wiggle room in their budget, so that makes every SNAP dollar very precious in extending that food budget.\"",
      "Tracking the impact of those SNAP cuts on food insecurity as the changes unfurl over the coming months and years may be difficult, given the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Sept. 20 announcement that it is halting its annual Household Food Security Report, which measures whether American families have access to healthy food.",
      "The USDA said it is nixing the report because it is \"redundant, costly, politicized and extraneous\" and leads to \"fear mongering.\" But anti-hunger advocates say scrapping the report could ultimately obscure the impact of the Republicans' cuts to the food stamp program.",
      "\"I don't see how it's redundant \u2014 the USDA puts out the only report on food insecurity,\" Vega said. \"It just indicates to me that they don't want to see the results of the reconciliation bill,\" referring to the Republican's \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law.",
      "The USDA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about that claim.",
      "New work requirements",
      "New work requirements for SNAP recipients are taking effect as the labor market stalls, raising the risk that more people could lose access to food stamps under the stricter rules mandated by the Republican law, advocates say.",
      "\"It's a tough workforce right now, and the work requirements come without any support,\" Gina Plata-Nino, a food stamp expert at the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our most vulnerable will have even less access to resources.\"",
      "The new work rules expand what the federal government considers so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, who are adults without young children who must prove they are either working, volunteering or engaged in an education or training program for at least 20 hours a week to qualify for food stamps.",
      "Previously, the work requirements only applied to people between 18 to 54 years old, but the new law pushes that to age 64. Additionally, people who are former foster youth between 18 to 24 years old, veterans or homeless are no longer exempt from the work requirements, as they were previously.",
      "People who don't meet the work requirements will be limited to receiving food stamps for three months within a three-year period.",
      "\"Just off the bat, those are veterans, youths aging out of foster care \u2014 think about what it means to be unhoused, trying to get a job when you don't have a place to shower,\" Plata-Nino said. \"Again, these populations are going to be worse off.\"",
      "Work requirements have been championed by Republican lawmakers because they say the rules encourage people to be gainfully employed or engaged in the community in exchange for food aid.",
      "But anti-hunger advocates argue the rules often bump people off the program because they may face difficulties in filing paperwork. Others point out that low-income workers may struggle to get enough hours from their employers to meet the new federal requirements, especially given the proliferation of \"just in time\" scheduling, which slots workers into short shifts to reduce costs for employers.",
      "Prior to the changes, most SNAP recipients who were required to work were doing so, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Stricter aid calculations",
      "Under the new GOP tax and spending law, there are other changes going into the SNAP program that could reduce benefits for millions.",
      "For instance, SNAP applicants can deduct their utility costs from their incomes when calculating their benefits, which can help to increase their food-stamp allotments. But the new law now prevents food-stamp recipients from counting internet expenses as part of their household costs when determining benefits. That change went into effect as soon as the law was signed on July 4 by President Trump.",
      "\"Roughly 65% of participating households will see their benefit drop by an average of $10 a month\" because of the exclusion in using internet costs to calculate benefits, Vega said.",
      "\"It's a relatively small amount but for a household facing rising grocery cost and facing tough decisions, $10 can make a difference,\" she added.",
      "Longer-term, there are additional changes that could strain states' ability to provide food stamps, such as a shift in fiscal year 2027 requiring that states cover 75% of administrative costs, up from 50% now. Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, states with high error rates \u2014 such as over- and underpayments of SNAP benefits \u2014 will also need to provide more funding for the program, starting in 2028.",
      "One concern, according to Vega, is whether states will have the financial resources to cover those additional costs.",
      "\"It's uncharted territory,\" she said. \"We do worry some states might decide they can't take that level of liability and won't participate in SNAP.\"",

    "summary": "Americans will pay 7.6% more to heat their homes this winter, study finds.",
    "story": [
      "Americans will dish out more money to heat their homes this winter as electricity and natural gas costs continue to soar.",
      "That's according to a new study from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) which predicts that\u00a0Americans will see their energy bill rise 7.6% to $976 on average this cold weather season. Those who rely on natural gas to heat their home could see an 8.4% jump in their bill, while those who use electricity could see a 10.2% increase.",
      "While electricity\u00a0prices vary\u00a0by state, overall the cost is rising. In August, prices increased by 6.2% compared with the same month last year, according to the latest inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Those costs will continue to escalate as much as 18% in the next few years, according to a May\u00a0report\u00a0from The U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "Natural gas prices are up 13.8% from last year, far outpacing the rate of inflation, which rose 2.9% in August on an annual basis.",
      "Not all Americans will see an increase in their winter energy bills. Heating oil and propane users \u2014 roughly only 10% of U.S. households \u2014 could see their energy bills decrease by 4% and 5% respectively.",
      "The overall rising home-heating costs follow greater summer air-conditioning use, amid warmer temperatures. \"The average summer household electricity bill reached an estimated $776 in 2025, the highest in at least 12 years compounding household strain,\" the report states.",
      "\"We had a period of relatively stable electric bills and then last year electricity went up twice the rate of inflation,\" Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "As a result, more American households are falling behind on their energy bills.",
      "Since Dec. 31, 2023, energy arrearages \u2014 unpaid energy bills that homeowners owe to their utility company \u2014 have risen by about 31%, from approximately $17.5 billion to $23.0 billion by June 30, 2025, NEADA said in its report.",
      "The surge in energy arrearages comes as Americans are carrying\u00a0record amounts of debt. With inflation continuing to ramp up the cost of daily living, ahead of wages, total household debt reached $18.39 trillion in the second quarter of 2025, with unpaid credit card balances exceeding $1.21 trillion.",
      "Why are energy prices rising?",
      "The main factors driving up energy prices is the ongoing high cost of maintaining and upgrading the grid, along with rising natural gas prices and increasing electricity demand from data centers according to the NEADA report.",
      "\"As demand goes up and supply is not matching that, prices are going to go up,\" Abe Scarr, director of the Energy and Utilities Program at the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), told CBS MoneyWatch",
      "Russia's invasion of Ukraine also\u00a0created volatility\u00a0in energy prices, government data shows.",
      "So far this year, approximately 60 utility companies have either increased electricity and gas prices or proposed further increases,\u00a0according to the Center for American Progress, a Washington D.C.-based think tank. With more rate hikes on the horizon, American households will have to try to stretch their income even further.",
      "\"Families just finished paying their high electric bills for the summer, and now they're looking at high bills for the winter,\" Wolfe said.",
      "How to lower your utility bills",
      "As winter approaches, what can Americans do to lower their utility bill?",
      "Scarr suggests that people check with their utility companies, which often offer incentive programs to help customers implement cost-saving measures. Offerings vary by utility, but many companies provide free home energy assessments and discounts for people who want to insulate their homes.",
      "For those interested in fortifying the envelope of their home to minimize heat loss, options include hiring a contractor for a professional retrofit or, for straightforward insulation projects, DIY tips, he said.",
      "When it comes to general energy conservation, experts suggest unplugging small appliances or electronics when you're not using them. While it might seem obvious, people can also turn down the temperature in the home a few degrees to save money, said Scarr.",
      "The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a federally funded initiative with a network of state-run programs, is another resource. LIHEAP provides financial assistance to help eligible low-income households cover energy costs.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-h1b-visa-faq-100000-fee-uscis/",
    "published": "Tue, 23 Sep 2025 11:09:15 -0400",
    "summary": "Heavy new H-1B visa fee raises numerous questions, immigration law experts told CBS News. Here's what employees and employers should know.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications is sowing confusion among some immigrant workers and their employers, including whether it's safe for current holders of the visa to travel outside the U.S.",
      "The new fee, which President Trump announced in a proclamation on Friday, represents a major change to a 35-year-old program that has enabled millions of immigrants to work legally in the U.S. The visa has become a mainstay in the technology industry, including among bellwethers such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, and is also widely used in the financial sector.",
      "Over the weekend, the White House sought to\u00a0clarify\u00a0the new policy, stating that the fee doesn't apply to current H-1B holders and that it is a one-time cost required only when initially applying for the visa.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said the addition of a $100,000 charge for H-1B visas on top of the existing fees reflects President Trump's promise \"to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages.\"",
      "She added, \"The text of the proclamation is very clear, and it is unfortunate that uninformed reporters and corporate lawyers attempt to sow chaos and confusion. Americans have another reason to celebrate unprecedented action by President Trump to protect Americans from cheap foreign labor.\"",
      "After the White House outlined the new policy on Friday, some tech companies including Google and Microsoft this weekend instructed H-1B employees who were traveling outside the U.S. to return immediately, expressing concern they might not be allowed to re-enter without the $100,000 payment, according to workers and immigration lawyers.",
      "Despite the White House's clarification that the new fee applies only to new visa applications, not existing H-1B holders, there remains \"a great degree of uncertainty on the ground,\" Parul Koul, president of the union that represents employees at Google owner Alphabet, said during a press conference on Monday to address the new policy.",
      "On Tuesday, the Trump administration published a proposal to change how H-1B visas are allotted, switching from a randomized lottery to a system that would favor immigrants with higher skills and incomes.",
      "CBS News spoke with attorneys and other sources about the new policy \u2014 here's what to know.",
      "Who pays the $100,000 fee?",
      "Under current H-1B rules, employers pay the application fees on behalf of workers. Assuming that approach continues, that could deter many employers from picking up the additional $100,000 fees \u2014 roughly 10 times what they previously paid for an applicant, Emily Neumann, an immigration attorney and managing partner at Houston-based Reddy Neumann Brown, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Very few employers would be willing to shell out that kind of money,\" she said.",
      "Such an outcome would appear to align with the White House's goals of spurring employers to hire within the U.S. rather than recruiting foreign workers.",
      "\"It is therefore necessary to impose higher costs on companies seeking to use the H-1B program in order to address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers,\" Mr. Trump said in his order.",
      "When does the fee go into effect?",
      "The new fee must be paid in submitting any new H-1B visa application and went into effect at 12:01 am EST on Sept. 21, according to a White House\u00a0statement.",
      "Each year, the federal government approves 85,000 H-1B visas for highly skilled non-U.S. workers, who typically require at least a bachelor's degree and a skill in a highly specialized field,\u00a0according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. An estimated 700,000 people in the U.S. hold a H-1B visa, according to Capital Economics.",
      "The USCIS says it has already reached its applicant cap for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. That means those applications would be excluded from having to pay the fee, but new applicants filing during the next fiscal year would be subject to it, Neumann explained.",
      "What are the main issues for current H-1B holders?",
      "According to the White House, the proclamation \"does not prevent any holder of a current H-1B visa from traveling in and out of the United States.\"",
      "H-1B visas are valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years. A White House official said the one-time $100,000 fee is only charged when applying for a visa for the first time \u2014 the payment is not required for current visa holders or those renewing the document, and those fees aren't changing.",
      "Yet the new rules leave some gray areas for current H-1B holders, Neumann said. For instance, the new fee is targeted at new visa applicants residing outside the U.S. That raises questions about whether current H-1B visa holders who are applying for changes, such as a visa renewal or a change of employer, might be caught up in the new requirement if they leave the U.S., Neumann and other immigration attorneys said.",
      "\"Where the question comes in is, what if after September 21 they file that extension and then they need to travel \u2014 are they going to be expected to pay that in order to get back into the U.S.?\" she said. \"That's kind of an open question right now.\"",
      "Although the White House said the fee doesn't apply to current H-1B holders and won't impact their travel, Neumann said she believes more guidance is needed because the White House's Sept. 21 FAQ notes the fee applies to \"any other H-1B petitions submitted after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025.\"",
      "\"This makes it sound like it could apply to an employee who travels with any petition filed after September 21, 2025. Although it seems clear that it does not apply to individuals currently in the United States, it is not clear how it impacts those who later travel and have a petition filed after the relevant date,\" she said.",
      "For now, Neumann said she is advising her corporate clients to direct their H-1B employees not to leave the U.S.. That was echoed by Jeff Joseph, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association and an immigration attorney.",
      "\"Until we have more clarification, which hopefully we'll have soon, we're telling people to just sit tight and not travel,\" Joseph said.",
      "Asked about the issue of H-1B holders who are applying for a change and who travel outside the U.S., the White House said the one-time $100,000 fee doesn't apply to renewals or current visa holders.",
      "How does the new fee impact the H-1B program?",
      "The $100,000 fee is likely to have a \"chilling effect\" on skilled foreign workers moving to the U.S.,\u00a0Joseph of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said.",
      "Although the tech industry has long been the biggest beneficiary of the H-1B program, the visa is designed for highly skilled workers across many industries, he added. Employers who rely on the visa include those in health care, which often recruit medical professionals outside the U.S. in areas where they have shortages, he said.",
      "More than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders come from a range of countries, including Canada, South Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a 2022 USCIS\u00a0report.",
      "What about the national security exemption?",
      "A provision in Mr. Trump's proclamation exempts some workers, companies and even entire industries from the new $100,000 fee if they are deemed to support the \"national interest\" and are adjudged not to pose a threat to the security or welfare of the U.S.",
      "For now, however, it's unclear how to receive such an exemption, including which federal agency will be charged with approving them, Neumann said.",
      "\"There's no guidance out there yet,\" she said. \"What are the national interest exemptions going to be? How would a company apply for that, if they can get the entire company to get the exemption? How would the individual apply?\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to questions about how the national security exemption would be applied or which agency will be handling the issue.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-algorithm-us-china-deal-trump/",
    "published": "Mon, 22 Sep 2025 17:12:12 -0400",
    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A deal between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok includes new stipulations over who controls the social media company's algorithm, a closely guarded secret which has proved to be a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market.",
      "In the meantime, a senior White House official said Monday that the U.S. and China had reached agreement on the basic details of the app's ownership. The new structure will move TikTok's U.S. operations under a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S. that will control the algorithm and oversee security, the official said.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Who will control the TikTok algorithm?",
      "According to the White House official, the new arrangement will operate and control a copy of the algorithm. Software maker Oracle will \"provide sort of top to bottom security\" throughout the company, the official said, noting that will involve monitoring the technology as well as managing how American data is stored.",
      "\"It's going to be continuously monitored as it operates to ensure that it's behaving appropriately, that it's not being used for any kind of malicious purpose, and that it's not being unduly influenced,\" the White House official said.",
      "Oracle's chairman and chief technology officer is Larry Ellison, whose son, David Ellison, is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.",
      "Mr. Trump, asked last week about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. Last week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, last week told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "Asked about this structure last week, Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization, told CBS MoneyWatch that as she understands it, ByteDance would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use the algorithm under certain terms.",
      "\"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it,\" she said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said last week that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch before details of the new structure were announced.",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, said the new arrangement has to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",

    "summary": "The two sides will spend the next two weeks presenting evidence in a \"remedy\" trial that threatens to dismantle the search giant's empire.",
    "story": [
      "After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department's attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising.",
      "The trial scheduled to begin Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court will revolve around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google's digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue.",
      "Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a \"remedy\" trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions.",
      "Although the judge hasn't set a timetable for making that decision, it's unlikely to come down before the end of this year because additional legal briefs and courtroom arguments are expected to extend into November before Brinkema takes the matter under submission.",
      "No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can't be filed until the remedy is determined.",
      "The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden's administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google's services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive.",
      "If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology \u2014 a proposal that the company's lawyers warned would \"invite disruption and damage\" to consumers and the internet's ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years.",
      "Google believes it has already made enough changes to its \"Ad Manager\" system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling.",
      "The legal battle over Google's advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct.",
      "In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month.",
      "Even though Google didn't agree with all aspects of Mehta's decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist \u2014 a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet's stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta's decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion \u2014 an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google's ad technology as a monopoly in April.",
      "In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta's decision during the upcoming trial.",
      "As they did in the search case, Google's lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department's \"radical\" proposals.",
      "The Justice Department is \"fighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed,\" Google's lawyers argued leading up to the trial.",

    "summary": "Members of the blind community have found new ways to use the AI technology to help manage everyday tasks, such as reading the mail.",
    "story": [
      "Emeline Lakrout, a busy New Yorker with a knack for running, rock climbing and swimming, doesn't let being legally blind stop her from living an active lifestyle.",
      "Despite being declared blind at 8 years old, Lakrout has taken on challenges, such as running the New York City Marathon and joining the U.S. National Paraclimbing Team. A new piece of technology \u2014 Meta's AI glasses \u2014 is her latest tool to help her stay savvy and adaptable on a daily basis.",
      "\"The glasses make my life easier,\" said the 27 year old. \"They make things faster and they make me able to do more in the day because it's just quicker and easier to do things and I feel less tired at the end of the day.\"",
      "Meta originally designed the glasses for users to stream video on the go and interact with the world around them using AI. The newest iteration of the technology was unveiled last week and includes the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses\u00a0and a new model of smart Oakley glasses aimed at sports enthusiasts.",
      "Members of the blind community have found new ways to use the technology.",
      "Users are able to connect their glasses to the \"Be My Eyes\" app which connects blind and visually impaired users with volunteers to assist with recognizing objects and managing everyday tasks in real time. Such activities may include going through mail, or helping individuals grocery shop.",
      "The new AI glasses also use optical character recognition, or OCR, which can recognize and read aloud text for users on menus, receipts and mail. For Lakrout, having access to text-based information like signs in a subway station or on street corners is what makes AI technology useful. She says Meta's AI glasses are bringing blind communities one step closer to accessing this information.",
      "The glasses, however, are work in progress says Mark Riccobono, president of the National Federation of the Blind.",
      "\"(They) work well for some things, doesn't work well in other situations,\" he said.",
      "Lakrout discovered this for herself. When she tried the glasses on in a restaurant, they read the menu to her perfectly but couldn't tell her the price for a specific item on second prompt. When using some of the AI-powered features, the glasses' battery died, and so she regularly had to keep them in their case to charge.",
      "More importantly, Riccobono said, is that Meta has \"taken an interest in working with blind people to make the technology better, make it more accurate, make it more meaningful to the experience of blind people.\"",
      "Lakrout and Riccobono both agree that AI technology and Meta's glasses are a useful step in enhancing the blind and visually impaired community's independence. But in the end, the glasses do not \"replace the need for human capacity,\" Riccobo said. \"So we need to teach blind people and we still need to make sure that blind people develop the skills that blind people need to be successful.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 22 Sep 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Even if people qualify for financial help with their hospital bills, the care they receive may not be covered.",
    "story": [
      "Quinn Cochran-Zipp went to the emergency room three times with severe abdominal pain before doctors figured out that she had early-stage cancer in the germ cells of her right ovary. After emergency surgery four years ago, the Greeley, Colorado, lab technician is cancer-free.",
      "The two hospitals that treated Cochran-Zipp at the time determined that she qualified for 100% financial assistance, since her income as a college student was extremely low. Not having to worry about the roughly $100,000 in bills she racked up for her care was an enormous relief, she said.",
      "Then she started receiving unexpected bills from doctors who worked at the hospitals but, because they weren't on staff there, didn't have to abide by the facilities' financial assistance policies.",
      "Those bills, which came from specialists in emergency medicine, anesthesiology, and radiology who treated her, totaled more than $5,000. Although it was a fraction of the total cost of her care, to Cochran-Zipp it was an enormous amount. She went on payment plans and used scholarship and COVID stimulus money to help cover the bills.",
      "Cochran-Zipp, now 25 and working at a community health center, is applying to medical schools and hopes to enroll next fall. Her experience as a patient has shaped how she thinks about becoming a doctor.",
      "\"I don't think that I could be a provider that, in good conscience, charges patients money in addition to the hospital fees,\" she said.",
      "Hospital financial assistance programs are commonplace, and many patients rely on them. Most offer varying amounts of financial help to uninsured and lower-income people. Eligibility is typically based on a sliding income scale. Some hospitals apply other tests, such as residency.",
      "But even if people qualify for assistance, they may not get discounts. That's because many physicians working at but not for a hospital aren't bound by its financial assistance policies. Hospitals themselves might limit the types of services eligible for discounted or \"charity care,\" as it's sometimes called.",
      "\"It's a hole in the system,\" said Caitlin Donovan, a senior director at the Patient Advocate Foundation, a nonprofit that helps patients with serious illnesses cover their medical bills. Case managers who work with patients report that they've seen these problems repeatedly, Donovan said.",
      "In the coming years, more patients will encounter difficulties as demand for financial assistance grows. More than 14 million people are projected to lose health insurance over the next decade, primarily because of changes to the federal Medicaid program and state insurance marketplaces in recently passed tax and spending legislation championed by the Trump administration. Some of these people will likely qualify for discounted care.",
      "Nonprofit hospitals do not pay taxes on the money they make, but to maintain that tax-exempt status, they are required to have policies to help patients pay for emergency and other medically necessary care. For-profit hospitals are not required to offer financial assistance to needy patients, but many do.",
      "However, physicians and other providers who work in a hospital as independent contractors rather than as employees are often not subject to a hospital's financial assistance policy. According to an analysis by the Lown Institute, a health care think tank, physician services in the emergency, radiology, anesthesia, and pathology specialties are commonly excluded from hospital charity care.",
      "For example, at Hartford HealthCare, a large nonprofit health system serving Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, services performed by physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants employed by HHC, including emergency department physicians at four of its hospitals, are covered by its financial assistance policy. But treatment by emergency physicians at three HHC hospitals is not covered by the financial assistance policy, since they are not employees. Care by doctors working in radiology, pathology, and anesthesia isn't covered by the financial assistance policy at any HHC facility.",
      "Hartford HealthCare declined to comment on the record for this article.",
      "Health system researchers have identified another potential barrier to patients' receiving help from hospital financial assistance policies. IRS rules require that nonprofit hospitals include emergency and medically necessary care in their charity care policies, but they give hospitals substantial leeway to define what \"medically necessary\" care means.",
      "Historically, excluded care has been limited to services that insurance doesn't typically cover, like cosmetic surgery or experimental treatment. But in recent years, hospitals appear to be defining medically necessary care more narrowly, eliminating financial assistance for care that is needed but not urgently required. Care that might fall into this category could be a kidney stone removal, a cancer biopsy, or a cardiac valve replacement, according to a study published this year in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "Although the study of 209 nonprofit hospitals with more than 200 beds found only isolated examples of hospitals \u2014 about 6% of them \u2014 that substantially excluded medically necessary care, researchers are concerned that it could be the leading edge of a larger trend, said Mark Hall, a professor of law and public health at Wake Forest University, who co-authored the study.",
      "\"There's not really much in the way of regulatory guidance in what should be in or out\" of a financial assistance policy, said Christopher Goodman, a clinical assistant professor at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine, who has published several studies examining hospital financial assistance policies.",
      "The American Hospital Association declined to comment for this article. American Medical Association spokesperson Robert Mills said that the AMA doesn't have a position on whether all contracted physicians should be required to participate in hospital financial assistance policies.",
      "For-profit hospitals have more latitude to fashion their financial assistance policies as they wish.",
      "At HCA Healthcare, one of the country's largest for-profit health care systems, with nearly 200 hospitals in 20 states and the United Kingdom, discounted or free care is available only for \"emergent or non-elective services.\"",
      "\"Facility charity policies and uninsured discounts are typically specific to emergency services\" at HCA Healthcare, said Harlow Sumerford, an HCA Healthcare spokesperson. \"Any third-party providers are independent and would have their own financial policies.\"",
      "In recent years, several states have passed medical debt protection laws. A few apply to some doctors and other health care providers who practice at health care facilities and bill patients separately for their care.",
      "Colorado's is the most expansive. Under its Hospital Discounted Care law that first took effect in September 2022, covered hospitals have to screen all uninsured people and others who request it for eligibility for Medicaid and other health programs, and provide discounted care to people whose income is up to 250% of the federal poverty level (about $80,000 for a family of four). There are limits on how much qualifying patients can be billed each month and, after three years, their debt is retired.",
      "Under the Colorado law, licensed health care professionals who work at a covered hospital can charge qualified patients no more than the rates set by the state.",
      "\"This rule has been a game changer for folks in Colorado,\" said Melissa Duncan, consumer assistance program manager at the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, which helps patients access health care and cover their bills.",
      "Unfortunately, the law didn't pass in time to help Cochran-Zipp.",
      "As hospitals grapple with the changes expected under the federal health care legislation passed this summer, discounted care programs may make a tempting target, say some health care financing experts. Facing higher rates of uncompensated care and trouble collecting payments from patients, facilities may reduce the financial assistance that they offer.",
      "Hospitals may say \"we are going to do all we can to protect our spending,\" said Ge Bai, a professor of accounting and health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University. \"In that environment, charity care will be a burden.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is targeting a visa widely used by tech companies and other employers to hire foreign workers.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is adding $100,000 to the existing fee for H-1B visa applications, taking aim at a program that is used to attract highly skilled workers to the U.S.",
      "President Trump signed a proclamation late Friday adding the new visa application fee and barring H-1B workers from entering the U.S. unless they had made the $100,000 payment.",
      "\"We're going to be able to keep people in our country that are going to be very productive people, and in many cases these companies are going to pay a lot of money for that, and they're very happy about it,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson clarified to CBS News in an email Saturday that the fee \"does not apply to anyone who has a current visa,\" and \"only applies to future applicants in the February [2026] lottery who are currently outside the U.S. It does not apply to anyone who participated in the 2025 lottery.\"",
      "\"The Proclamation does not impact the ability of any current visa holder to travel to/from the U.S.,\" Jackson said.",
      "A White House official told CBS News Saturday that the $100,000 is a one-time fee that only applies to new visas and is not an annual payment. It does not apply to renewals or current visa holders, the official said.",
      "This comes after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had told reporters Friday that the fee was \"annual.\"",
      "\"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down wages,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told CBS News in a statement Saturday. \"It also gives certainty to American businesses who actually want to bring high-skilled workers to our great country but have been trampled on by abuses of the system.\"",
      "The additional charge would impact employers including technology giants such as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Google, which have\u00a0relied on the program\u00a0to hire foreign workers.",
      "The plan was\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier by Bloomberg News.",
      "H-1B visas are already expensive, with the cost ranging from about $1,700 to $4,500, depending on whether the visa is expedited. The fees are typically considered a business expense for the employer.",
      "The new fee comes amid a debate over the H-1B visa, which some critics say enables companies to hire foreign applicants at lower salaries than American workers. Some employers also award H-1Bs for entry-level roles rather than for senior positions with greater skill requirements, detractors of the program say.",
      "Tech companies have been among the primary beneficiaries of the visa program. Amazon received the\u00a0most H1-B visas\u00a0of any business in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. This year, the online retailer remains the leading recipient of the visas, with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.",
      "\"This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers. So it'll protect American workers, but ensure that companies have a pathway to hire truly extraordinary people and bring them to the United States,\" a White House aide said.",
      "Still, Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research group, said the plan could backfire if it incentivizes U.S. companies to shift jobs overseas, especially in specialized areas like research and development.",
      "\"The second impact will further decrease the number of international students who have an interest in coming to study in the U.S. If there's no opportunity work in the U.S., it's much less likely they'll enroll in U.S. programs,\" Anderson told CBS News.",
      "Last year, the most popular type of job for H-1B visas was software developer. To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company.",
      "President Trump plans to order the Labor Secretary to start a new rule-making process that would update wage levels for the program, Bloomberg reported. Currently, U.S. companies must offer the prevailing wage or the actual wage of similarly qualified workers, whichever is higher, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.",
      "The program is capped at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be issued for employees with a master's degree or higher, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The cap and higher-degree exemption quota is already filled for fiscal year 2026, according to the USCIS.",
      "The H-1B program is already the most restrictive visa program in the U.S., with about 20% of applications resulting in approved workers, according to a March\u00a0study\u00a0from the nonpartisan National Foundation for American Policy.",

      "Americans' grocery bills are growing, causing some shoppers to cut back on discretionary spending as they find themselves struggling to afford the basics.",
      "Food prices grew by half a percent from July to August, marking the fastest monthly rate of change since the fall of 2022. Behind the rising cost of food items on store shelves are three main culprits, according to experts.",
      "The Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs, climate change and a shortage of agricultural workers in the U.S. are the leading causes of grocery inflation, Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst also known as the \"Supermarket Guru,\" told CBS News correspondent Jo Ling Kent.",
      "Price hikes, he added, have been steepest on goods that the U.S. imports from nations facing higher levies. For example, the U.S. imports about 35% of its coffee from Brazil, whose exports are taxed at a rate of 50%.",
      "The latest Consumer Price Index data shows that coffee prices rose 21% in August compared with a year ago.",
      "As companies see their costs rise, they pass along those burdens to consumers. In the case of tariffs, some businesses began raising prices on products even before the levies were in full force.",
      "\"There's no question that what we've seen is, we're seeing companies increased prices because of the impending tariffs,\" said Lempert.",
      "\"What they want to do is they want to protect themselves. A lot of these big food companies are public companies. So what they've gotta do is they've gotta report back to their shareholders on profit margins. So they've been hedging their bets,\" Lempert said.",
      "Sometimes, packaged-goods companies disguise price hikes by offering consumers less product for the same amount of money. The covert inflation strategy has been dubbed \"shrinkflation,\" Lempert explained.",
      "\"What they're doing is they're trying to put less in the package, hoping that you and I are not gonna observe that and keep that price either stable or just slightly increased,\" he said",
      "Climate change",
      "Increasing temperatures and\u00a0shifts in weather patterns have made conditions for growing some fruits and vegetables in the U.S. inhospitable. As a result, a lot of domestic production has been moved to Central and Latin America, according to Lempert.",
      "\"We can't grow our food where we used to grow it,\" he said.",
      "Labor shortage",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump's immigration policies, including raids on workplaces that employ large numbers of immigrants, plus waning interest in agricultural work, have led to an industrywide labor shortage, Lempert explained.",
      "Consumers are reacting to higher prices by looking for deals, purchasing store brand goods instead of name-brands and buying shelf-stable groceries in bulk at shopping clubs like Costco.",
      "Lempert said a little planning can go a long way to ensure that consumers can buy what they need.",
      "\"The number one thing that people want to do if they want to save money \u2014 stop wasting food,\" Lempert said.",
      "\"Forty percent of all of our food in this country is wasted. A lot of that's in our homes. So, take doggy bags from restaurants, use leftovers, freeze leftovers, don't waste food and you'll save a substantial amount of money,\" he said.",

      "\"The FTC alleges that in public, Ticketmaster maintains that its business model is at odds with brokers that routinely exceed ticket limits,\" the agency said in a news release. \"But in private, Ticketmaster acknowledged that its business model and bottom line benefit from brokers preventing ordinary Americans from purchasing tickets to the shows they want to see at the prices artists set.\"",

    "story": [
      "Many doctors and public health officials are taking issue with President Trump's claim that there's \"no downside\" to avoiding acetaminophen during pregnancy and his suggestion that expecting mothers should \"tough it out\" when it comes to fevers.",
      "Acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol and many cold and flu medications, is used to reduce pain and fever in pregnancy.",
      "\"Don't take it. There's no downside in not taking it,\" Mr. Trump said during an announcement Monday that linked the use of the drug during pregnancy to an increased risk of autism in children without giving new evidence and ignoring data that shows there is not a causal relation.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration is \"strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary,\" he said. \"That's, for instance, in cases of extremely high fever that you feel you can't tough it out, you can't do it. I guess there's that. It's a small number of cases, I think. But if you can't tough it out, if you can't do it, that's what you're going to have to do. You'll take a Tylenol.\"",
      "In an open letter to physicians released after Mr. Trump's announcement, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary was more cautious than the president, writing, \"clinicians should consider minimizing the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy for routine low-grade fevers.\"",
      "But doctors worry the suggestion to \"tough it out\" will harm women and their babies, as high fever and pain can be dangerous during pregnancy.",
      "\"The messaging of 'tough it out' is something that unfortunately we have said to women in health care in this country for far too long,\" Dr. Lucky Sekhon, an OB/GYN and infertility specialist in New York City, told CBS News.",
      "There's also a concern patients may turn to other pain medications that are proven to be unsafe during pregnancy. Makary noted in his letter that \"acetaminophen is the safest over-the-counter alternative in pregnancy among all analgesics and antipyretics.\"",
      "The risks of fever during pregnancy",
      "Medical experts warn that fevers during pregnancy can cause problems for a developing baby.",
      "Especially in early pregnancy, fevers are associated with cardiac issues, cleft lip, cleft palate and central nervous system abnormalities, Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told CBS News after Mr. Trump's announcement.",
      "\"The idea that we're going to let someone with a fever 'tough it out' may have much worse implications for a pregnant woman than taking a dose of acetaminophen to bring that fever down,\" he said. \"I think that's not really an appropriate way to handle medical issues in pregnancy.\"",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, echoed it's important to not let fevers go untreated due to the risk of brain development issues in the baby.",
      "\"Fever and infections during pregnancy can cause neurodevelopmental disorders including potentially autism,\" she said. \"I worry that this will scare women and that pregnant women may avoid Tylenol even when it's entirely appropriate, for example, to treat a fever.\"",
      "Internal medicine physician Dr. Shoshana Ungerleider said science does not support the administration's claims.",
      "\"What's far riskier is leaving a fever untreated during pregnancy which can harm both mom and baby, so Tylenol remains the safest option we have in those situations,\" she said.",
      "Why Tylenol or acetaminophen is advised",
      "Gounder said she's concerned that expectant mothers with a fever or pain may turn to other options that would be less safe.",
      "\"Will women end up taking other medications like aspirin or ibuprofen during pregnancy? Those actually can be dangerous, especially in the third trimester, you can end up with kidney issues, cardiac issues in the baby,\" she said.",
      "Fleischman agreed that acetaminophen is the safest option.",
      "\"You should not, under any circumstances, avoid taking acetaminophen if you have a fever early in pregnancy, if you have a headache, if you have some other condition in pregnancy, we want you to take that medication,\" he told CBS News. \"The overwhelming evidence that we have seen over the last 20 years does not show causation for acetaminophen causing autism.\"",
      "That research, he explained, includes a large study published last year\u00a0which analyzed data on 2.5 million pregnancies and found no increased risk of autism in children whose mothers took acetaminophen.",
      "The lead author of that study, Viktor H. Ahlqvist, PhD, of the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, said in an interview that acetaminophen continues to be \"the recommended option\" for use during pregnancy.",
      "He shared the concern that \"alternatives to acetaminophen in the U.S. might be other medications with less-safe profiles, such as opioids or other things to manage pain. We do know that these have serious consequences when used in pregnancy, both for the mom and for the baby.\"",
      "These doctors are not alone. Health experts from around the world have pushed back against the Trump administration's claims about acetaminophen and autism.",
      "The European Union's European Medicines Agency said Tuesday there is \"no new evidence\" that would require changes to the current recommendations for use of acetaminophen, also called paracetamol outside the U.S.",
      "\"Paracetamol remains an important option to treat pain or fever in pregnant women,\" Steffen Thirstrup, EMA's chief medical officer, said in the statement. \"Our advice is based on a rigorous assessment of the available scientific data and we have found no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children.\"",

      "In a joint U.S.-Mexican operation last month, authorities tracked down a cartel leader accused of running a gruesome infant trafficking ring in northern Mexico, according to senior intelligence officials.",
      "Martha Alicia Mendez Aguilar, known as \"La Diabla,\" was captured on Sept. 2 after officials say the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, referred to by the U.S. as CJNG, lured a handful of pregnant women \u2014 often in vulnerable or impoverished circumstances \u2014 to remote areas. Once there, CJNG traffickers allegedly performed illegal cesarean operations on the women, killing the mothers and allegedly harvesting their organs postmortem, and placing newborns into illicit markets, according to senior intelligence officials. The infants were then sold to couples in the United States for as much as 250,000 pesos or roughly $14,000 each, according to the senior intelligence officials.",
      "Mexican authorities were tipped off by intelligence provided by the National Counterterrorism Center, under the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. NCTC Director Joe Kent called the scheme an \"example of what terrorist cartels will do to diversify their revenue streams and finance operations,\" in a statement provided to CBS News, crediting NCTC analysts with tracking Aguilar's patterns and locations, then coordinating with U.S. intelligence and Mexican partners on the ground.",
      "Senior intelligence officials say the arrest involved support from the U.S. Marshals Service, FBI El Paso, Diplomatic Security Service and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, with Mexican law enforcement executing the operation alongside \"Fiscalia Especializada en la Mujer\" or the Special Prosecutor's Office for Women. Aguilar remains in Mexican custody, according to senior intelligence officials. The investigation into the alleged trafficking ring remains ongoing.",
      "The case underscores Washington's intensified targeting of Mexican cartels in recent years.",
      "In January, President Trump signed an executive order directing the State Department to designate cartels and transnational gangs as foreign terrorist organizations, or FTOs. The State Department in February announced the designation for eight gangs, including CJNG.",
      "The capture of \"La Diabla\" marks an expansion in the application of U.S. counterterrorism policy, with intelligence elements like NCTC now actively applying counterterrorism capabilities to target not only narcotraffickers, but also human trafficking rings and terroristic violence by groups like CJNG, notorious for brutal tactics and control over swaths of Mexico's territory.",
      "Under the new FTO framing, U.S. agencies wield more expansive tools, including intelligence, sanctions, and military support to track down the cartels and their affiliates, beyond reliance on traditional criminal prosecutions. Critics of the approach have warned of overreach and unintended consequences, while proponents argue that cartels increasingly function like hybrid terrorist groups to pick up territorial control and expand trafficking networks.",
      "According to NCTC, U.S. intelligence has added over 21,000 cartel members and associates into their classified terrorist database, creating over 35,000 identities related to the newly designated foreign terrorist organizations. Last month, the agency stated that 6,525 terrorists have been denied entry into the United States since the beginning of the Trump administration.",

    "story": [
      "Jimmy Kimmel returned to his long-running late-night show Tuesday, less than a week after network broadcaster ABC pulled \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" over remarks he made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "\"It's been overwhelming ... I've heard from all the people in the world over the last six days,\" Kimmel joked to open his monologue, going on to thank all those who came out in his defense, including conservatives.",
      "\"Most of all, I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,\" Kimmel said. \"I never would have imagined that Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, even my old pal Ted Cruz, who believe it or not said something very beautiful on my behalf. It takes courage for them to speak out against this administration. They did and they deserve credit for it.\"",
      "The Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, had announced Monday that Kimmel would return to the air.",
      "It followed a political and media firestorm that began after the comedian addressed Kirk's slaying in a Sept. 15 monologue, saying: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"",
      "An emotional Kimmel on Tuesday said, \"It's important to me as a human, and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man. I don't think there's anything funny about it,\" noting that he had taken to social media following Kirk's killing to send his condolences to Kirk's family.",
      "Kimmel didn't issue a blanket apology for his monologue remarks last week, but said he understood how it was offensive to some.",
      "\"Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what was obviously a deeply disturbed individual,\" Kimmel said of the suspected gunman. \"That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make. But I understand that to some, that felt either ill-timed or unclear, or maybe both. And for those who think I did, point a finger, I get why you're upset. If the situation was reversed, there's a good chance I'd have felt the same way.\"",
      "Kimmel gave a brief explanation for what took place behind the scenes between himself and ABC's brass.",
      "\"I was not happy when they pulled me off the air on Wednesday,\" Kimmel said. \"I did not agree with that decision, and I told them that, and we had many conversations. I shared my point of view, they shared theirs. We talked it through, and at the end, even though they didn't have to, they really didn't have to, this is a giant company \u2026 they welcomed me back on the air.\"",
      "On Tuesday night, before the show aired on the East Coast, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, \"I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled!\"",
      "He went on, \"I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars,\" Mr. Trump said in reference to his defamation lawsuit last year against ABC News over remarks made by anchor George Stephanopoulos, which the network settled in December by agreeing to contribute $15 million to Mr. Trump's presidential foundation and museum, and another $1 million toward Mr. Trump's legal fees.",
      "\"This one sounds even more lucrative,\" Mr. Trump wrote Tuesday. \"A true bunch of losers!\"",
      "Kimmel told his audience Tuesday that the president \"made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs. Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can't take a joke.\"",
      "\"One thing I did learn from Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and Howard Stern, is that a government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn't like, is anti-American,\" he added.",
      "In a Sept. 17 interview with right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr called Kimmel's remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" and said there was a \"path forward for suspension over this.\"",
      "\"The FCC is going to have remedies we could look at,\" Carr told Johnson. \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"",
      "Within hours of that interview, station operator Nexstar announced it would preempt Kimmel's show over the remarks. Nexstar owns and operates more than 200 stations nationwide, including more than two dozen ABC affiliates. Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it.",
      "A Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News last week that the decision to preempt Kimmel's show was \"made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision.\"",
      "ABC later said that it was \"indefinitely\" suspending the show.",
      "Another major station owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group, also said last week that it was pulling Kimmel's show.",
      "Despite its return to ABC on Tuesday night, both Nexstar and Sinclair said they would continue to preempt Kimmel's show.",
      "Sinclair on Monday night posted a statement on X saying it will preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" across its ABC affiliate stations and will be \"replacing it with news programming\" beginning Tuesday night. \"Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,\" Sinclair said.",
      "Nexstar on Tuesday said it will continue to preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and \"monitor the show as it returns to ABC.\"",
      "Regarding Carr, Kimmel on Tuesday\u00a0showed\u00a0the audience a social media post that the FCC chair wrote in May 2022 in which he said, \"Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech. It challenges those in power while using humor to draw more people in to the discussion. That's why people in influential positions have always targeted it for censorship.\"",
      "Disney on Monday did not delve into the details of what led to its decision to allow Kimmel's show to resume, only saying in a statement that the initial suspension was \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\" calling his comments \"ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"",
      "\"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,\" Disney said.",
      "The temporary removal of Kimmel's show sparked a nationwide debate over issues of free speech and censorship. Many in the Hollywood community rallied to Kimmel's side, with more than 400 celebrities \u2014 including actors Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep \u2014 signing an open letter with the American Civil Liberties Union that criticized the move as \"a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.\"",
      "Conservatives upset with Kimmel's comments about Kirk praised the decision, including President Trump, who congratulated ABC on his Truth Social platform \"for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also speculated last week whether networks that cover him negatively should have their broadcast licenses revoked.",
      "\"They give me only bad publicity or press,\" the president told reporters on Sept. 18. \"I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr.\"",
      "But one prominent conservative, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, was specifically critical of Carr's comments to Johnson.",
      "\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas,'\" Cruz said Friday on his podcast. \"That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it.'\"",

      "In response to the stabbing death of a Ukrainian refugee on Charlotte's light rail system, the North Carolina legislature gave final approval Tuesday to a criminal justice package that limits bail and seeks to ensure more defendants undergo mental health evaluations.",
      "The Republican-penned bill, called \"Iryna's Law,\" could also help restart executions in the state.",
      "The House voted 81-31 to accept the omnibus measure passed by the Senate on Monday, sending it next to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein. The governor, a former attorney general, has said he supports some pretrial reforms following the fatal Aug. 22 attack on 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear whether Stein would sign the bill into law or veto it. A Stein spokesperson said he was reviewing the measure.",
      "Surveillance footage showed Zarutska entering a light rail car on Aug. 22 and sitting in a row in front of Brown. Four minutes later, the suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., allegedly pulled a knife from his pocket and struck Zarutska three times from behind, according to an FBI\u00a0affidavit\u00a0accompanying the criminal complaint.",
      "Brown had been arrested more than a dozen times and was released earlier this year by a magistrate on a misdemeanor count without any bond. Brown is charged with first-degree murder in state court and a federal count in connection with Zarutska's death. Both crimes can be punishable by the death penalty.",
      "Brown \"should have never been allowed out of the jail. The catch-and-release practices for violent offenders will end today with your support,\" Charlotte-area Republican state Rep. Tricia Cotham told colleagues during two hours of House debate. \"This heinous act was preventable.\"",
      "Public outrage over Zarutska's death intensified with the release of security video showing the attack on the commuter train, leading President Trump and GOP allies to accuse Charlotte and statewide elected Democrats of promoting soft-on-crime policies.",
      "\"Iryna's Law\" addresses bail, magistrates, behavioral health",
      "Much of the bill focuses on eliminating cashless bail for many crimes and limiting the discretion that magistrates and judges have in making pretrial release decisions.",
      "\"When we have magistrates who are asleep at the wheel, like this one that obviously was, then we gotta make a change,\" North Carolina Speaker of the House Rep. Destin Hall said, CBS affiliate WBTV reported.",
      "But Charlotte defense attorney Tim Emry, who previously ran for district attorney, disagreed.",
      "\"The magistrate's not asleep at the wheel,\" Emry told WBTV. \"It would be totally unconstitutional for the magistrate to hold someone without bond on a low-level misdemeanor charge.\"",
      "The bill also lays out when offenders should be examined for possible involuntary commitment.",
      "Brown's mother told media outlets that her son has been diagnosed with schizophrenia.",
      "Several House Democrats took issue with the soft-on-crime label, pointing out that Republicans have controlled the General Assembly for over a decade. They said the bill falls well short in providing mental health services that advocates say could stop crimes before they occur, as well as funds to hire additional police officers and crisis responders and to house defendants being held for behavioral problems.",
      "\"Tough on crime doesn't only mean let's pay attention to punishment after the fact,\" said Democratic Rep. Marcia Morey of Durham, a former judge. \"We grieve the murder. It was senseless, it was horrible. But what you are voting on today does nothing to take it back or would have prevented it. Let's get smart on crime.\"",
      "Unlike Monday's party-line Senate vote, over one-third of House Democrats present joined all Republicans in voting for the bill Tuesday. The margins signal a Stein veto could be overridden.",
      "Bill aims to end nearly 20-year halt of executions",
      "The bill initially contained language that would require certain appeals for death-row inmates be heard and reviewed by courts by the end of 2027. More than 120 people are on death row in North Carolina, but an execution hasn't been carried out since 2006.",
      "But an amendment from powerful Senate leader Phil Berger would direct the state Adult Correction Department secretary to find another form of execution if lethal injection \u2014 currently the state's sole method \u2014 is declared unconstitutional or is \"not available,\" potentially if the drugs can't be accessed.",
      "\"For nearly two decades, judicial and administrative roadblocks have stopped true justice for victims, and it's time for that to end,\" Berger said in a post shared on X.",
      "The secretary would have to select another method that's been adopted by another state. That could include the use of a firing squad, a method used to execute South Carolina inmates twice this year, or perhaps electrocution.",
      "Capital punishment has been put on hold in North Carolina in part over legal challenges on the use of the injection drugs. Inmate challenges also have occurred under a now-repealed law that has allowed some prisoners to receive life without parole if they could show racial bias was the reason for their death sentence.",
      "\"For nearly two decades, judicial and administrative roadblocks have stopped true justice for victims, and it's time for that to end,\" Berger said in a news release Monday.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration has touted its crime crackdown in Washington, D.C., in recent weeks, with increased arrest numbers and reduced violent crime. But the surge of resources to the nation's capital hasn't extended to its courts, which have been hampered by judicial vacancies that have led to a backlog of cases and slowed the administration of justice.",
      "The crisis in the district's courts has persisted for years due to a high volume of open seats for judges. But whether, and when, it subsides rests with the president and Senate under the structure established by Congress more than 50 years ago.",
      "Today, there are 13 vacancies on the D.C Superior Court, the district's trial court, and another two judges are on extended medical leave. By January, another two sitting judges are set to retire, which would leave 15 of the Superior Court's 62 seats unfilled.",
      "On the D.C. Court of Appeals, two of its nine seats are open. One of those has been empty since November 2013, and neither have nominees awaiting approval by the Senate.",
      "\"With vacancy rates nearing 25% on the trial court, we are set up to fail those who are depending on us for fair and timely legal outcomes,\" said Douglas Buchanan, spokesman for the D.C. Courts. \"Now, in today's reality, our ability to operate is simply not sustainable. It's the case today, and it only stands to grow worse for those we serve.\"",
      "\"A lot of different gears\"",
      "The vacancy crisis underscores the unique position the district holds as the nation's capital. While judges are elected by voters or appointed by governors in other jurisdictions, the president nominates and the Senate confirms judges to the local courts in D.C., just like they do for federal courts.",
      "It's a process that Congress itself created under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973. The law established a seven-member Judicial Nomination Commission, which submits a list of three candidates to fill each vacancy on the Superior Court and Appeals Court. The president then selects a person from that list to nominate for Senate confirmation.",
      "\"That requires a lot of different gears to all mesh up together when the District of Columbia doesn't even have a single senator in that room to say, 'Hey, this is important to the district,'\" said Joe Musso, president of the Trial Lawyers Association of Washington, D.C.",
      "In recent years, presidents have prioritized confirmations to the federal courts, with Mr. Trump and President Joe Biden appointing more than 230 federal judges. But filling the vacancies on the D.C. courts has not been as important.",
      "In December, the Senate had a chance to approve 10 of Biden's picks to the local courts, but the nominees were blocked. Mr. Trump can now fill those seats with his own nominees.",
      "For its part, the Judicial Nomination Commission has submitted to the president a list of candidates for every existing vacancy on the Superior Court and Appeals Court.",
      "Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has made four nominations to the D.C. Superior Court, and one is poised for a vote by the full Senate after advancing out of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in July. Two of the president's four nominees are for vacancies that have existed since 2020.",
      "\"President Trump has been focused on filling vacancies in Superior Court and I strongly agree,\" Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said in a statement to CBS News. \"Not having enough judges is not only bad for the District, the prosecutors, and the attorneys, it's bad for those individuals who are awaiting a trial that will impact their civil liberties.\"",
      "While the Senate Judiciary Committee oversees nominations to the federal courts, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee handles confirmation hearings for picks to the D.C. courts.",
      "A spokesman for Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, told CBS News that the panel is processing the three other nominations \"according to our standing rules and procedures and will announce a hearing at the appropriate time.\"",
      "Still, it's unclear whether there is broad appetite in the Senate to move the president's picks for the D.C. courts, particularly as lawmakers face a fast-approaching Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government and are under pressure to approve a backlog of Mr. Trump's executive branch nominees.",
      "Meanwhile, cases filed in the Superior Court continue to stack up. In the criminal division, trials for people accused of the most serious felony offenses are being scheduled into late 2027 and early 2028, Buchanan said.",
      "\"This is not fair to the victims of these very serious crimes, nor to the defendants who stand accused and in custody while they await their day in court,\" he said.",
      "An \"urgent\" crisis",
      "Mr. Trump's crackdown on D.C. came in response to what he claimed is rampant crime that has made the nation's capital a dangerous place to live and visit, despite data showing that crime had been falling in recent years. Last month, the president deployed the National Guard to the district and placed the Metropolitan Police Department under federal control for 30 days, authority granted to him under the Home Rule Act.",
      "While the 30-day takeover of the local police department expired on Sept. 10, National Guard troops will remain on district streets through November. Muriel Bowser, the mayor of D.C., has said local police will continue close coordination with federal law enforcement indefinitely.",
      "As part of Mr. Trump's plans to address what he says is a \"crime emergency\" in the capital, the president signed an executive order last month that calls on prosecutors to pursue federal charges and pretrial detention for people arrested in the district.",
      "But government lawyers with the U.S. Attorney's Office in D.C, led by Pirro, have struggled to secure indictments in a string of recent cases. In at least one of those, involving a now-fired Justice Department employee accused of throwing a sandwich at a federal officer, prosecutors filed a misdemeanor charge, which doesn't require a grand jury indictment.",
      "Pirro's office also prosecutes felony offenses and most misdemeanors committed by adults in the local trial court. From January through March, the most recent data publicly available, there was a slight uptick in felony prosecutions and cases charged in the Superior Court compared to the first three months of 2024.",
      "But the president's efforts to tamp down on crime and the alleged perpetrators are meeting a court system that has for years lacked a full complement of judges to hear and adjudicate cases.",
      "\"You're looking at criminal defendants who are sitting in jail on nothing more than a charge, and they're presumed innocent under the Constitution,\" Musso said.",
      "The ballooning number of cases filed in the Superior Court began years before Mr. Trump's crackdown. From 2021 to 2024, the trial court saw an 83% increase in new case filings, data shows. For 2025, the Superior Court is on track to either meet or exceed the 56,627 new cases from last year.",
      "For the criminal division, there were nearly 40% more felony cases filed between 2022 and 2023, and roughly 51% more misdemeanor cases brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office, according to data from the court.",
      "In a branch of the Civil Division that handles most civil disputes, the number of cases on judges' calendars has nearly doubled to roughly 500.",
      "\"This is urgent,\" said Tianna Gibbs, a law professor at American University in Washington who studies access to justice issues. \"We have a lot on the line: the administration of justice, access to justice and public confidence in the courts as a forum that can fairly and efficiently resolve their disputes.\"",
      "Meg McKinney, a family law attorney who practices in D.C., said the high number of vacancies is a problem across the Superior Court, but she believes the impact is more acutely felt in the Criminal and Family Court Operations divisions.",
      "\"You're already dealing with families who have a fair amount of crisis or dysfunction, and they're basically just twisting in the wind while they make their way through the court system,\" she said.",
      "In the family court, there were between four and six vacancies throughout 2024, and a 46% spike in new or reopened cases from 2020 to 2024, according to an annual report to Congress submitted in March. In its Domestic Relations Branch, which processes cases for divorce, custody and adoptions, among other areas, initial hearings are taking place before a magistrate judge to help ensure families can get into court quickly.",
      "But even for the small number of cases that go to trial, it can take more than a year to get a trial date, and securing consecutive days on the calendar is difficult. The wait for an actual decision may be even longer, since the time available for judges to write opinions is sparse.",
      "\"It feels like D.C. has been forgotten\"",
      "Mr. Trump has heralded the operation in D.C. as a success, and crime in the district has dropped significantly since he deployed National Guard troops and other federal law enforcement officers to the district. But local officials have urged the president and the federal government to assist D.C. in other ways.",
      "\"We have 15 vacancies in the Superior Court, which we need to go down to the Congress for approval. We have two vacancies in the Court of Appeals which we need to go down,\" Bowser, the mayor, told MSNBC in an interview last month. \"So anytime you have a backlog in the courts you have delayed justice and people are less safe.\"",
      "Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat who represents D.C. in the House as a nonvoting delegate, warned last month that the D.C. courts are facing a \"perpetual vacancy crisis\" because of Senate inaction. She said the number of open seats on the Superior Court is \"significantly impeding D.C.'s ability to try criminal cases in court, harming public safety and access to justice.\"",
      "Norton introduced legislation in July that would give the D.C. Council authority over the jurisdiction and organization of the local courts. She has also proposed plans that would allow judicial nominees to the D.C. courts to be appointed without approval by the Senate after a 30-day congressional review period.",
      "But D.C. officials have been sounding the alarm about the vacancy crisis for years, though their appeals for help have gone unanswered. Letters sent from members of the D.C. Council, legal organizations and even sitting D.C. judges have not moved the White House or Senate to action.",
      "\"It feels like a problem where the grievance is not going to get to the person who has control of moving the levers in the process,\" said Gibbs, the American University law professor. \"It feels like D.C. has been forgotten in this way and there's no way to appeal to the powers that be to address the problem.\"",
      "Lawyers in the district pin the blame on its lack of representation in the Senate, which has left residents without a voice to pressure senators to act.",
      "\"No other jurisdiction has to go through all the hoops to get the courthouse filled with reasonable arbiters of the facts and the law,\" Musso said. \"And when it does, it has to appeal to a Senate that has no representation.\"",
      "Some senators in neighboring states have taken up the cause. In the last Congress, Sen. Tom Carper, a Democrat from Delaware, and senators from Virginia and Maryland introduced legislation that would streamline the nomination and confirmation process for D.C. judicial picks. But the Senate didn't act on the plan, and Carper retired last year.",
      "Carper told CBS News in an interview before his term ended that \"the way we treat the District of Columbia, especially with respect to selection of the judges, is, I think, shameful.\"",
      "\"We basically say, you know, 'You can come up with all the names within the district of who you think ought to be a judge, and we'll take our good old time to figure out if we're ever going to confirm some of these judges,'\" Carper said.",
      "That approach by the Senate has led to concerns that its delays in confirming D.C. judicial nominees is damaging the public's trust in the judicial system.",
      "\"The issue is that there's just this divide where the people who do have control over the process don't understand the impact that the delay in confirmations is having on D.C. families. And then the D.C. families don't understand how the process is working,\" Gibbs said. \"In their eyes, the delay is the problem of the court. Families begin to view the court as a broken system that doesn't meet the commitment that it has to the public, which is to administer justice in a way that is efficient, that is fair, that allows families to have the opportunity to be heard before the court.\"",
      "The Republican-controlled House has begun to take legislative steps related to the D.C. courts, and it has moved swiftly to exert its control over the district. GOP Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas introduced legislation earlier this month that would dismantle the D.C. Judicial Nomination Commission, and the House approved it in a party-line vote last week. It's unclear whether it would garner the 60 votes needed in the Senate to advance.",
      "In a letter to Congress, the members of the commission said D.C.'s judicial nomination process is \"one of the best nonpartisan processes\" in the nation and noted that Mr. Trump engaged in it during his first term and earlier this month with his nominations.",
      "\"The Commission process has been effective for over 50 years, working with both Republican and Democratic administrations,\" members wrote in a Sept. 9 letter. \"Our process is carefully designed to ensure that the over 700,000 residents of our city have a voice in judicial appointments, while also respecting the President's authority in nominating individuals for the critical role of judicial service in the District of Columbia.\"",
      "But allies of Mr. Trump and The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, have denounced the seven-member commission as composed of \"leftists\" and said the judicial appointment scheme, which was codified by Congress in 1973, is questionable under the Constitution. Members of the panel are appointed by the president, mayor, D.C. Council, D.C. Bar and the chief judge of the U.S. district court in the district.",
      "The member tapped by the chief judge in D.C. is Judge Tanya Chutkan, who presided over the criminal case against the president brought by then-special counsel Jack Smith involving his alleged attempt to hold onto power after the 2020 election. The charges were dropped in November after Mr. Trump won the election.",
      "While the House moved swiftly on Sessions' plan for the nomination commission, there's been no action on Norton's proposal related to the D.C. courts, and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs has not scheduled hearings for Mr. Trump's nominees.",
      "For stakeholders who have watched the vacancies in the D.C. courts languish for years, successfully securing an appointment to the D.C. courts appears to be a daunting task, requiring cooperation between three different bodies: the Judicial Nomination Commission, the president and the Senate.",
      "But Musso said the consequences of continued inaction are severe.",
      "\"When you're waiting years for justice, those years are filled with angst and difficulty and stress that you would otherwise not have but for these delays,\" he said. \"Real people are involved here. Real human beings need our justice system.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 23 Sep 2025 23:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A malfunctioning escalator and teleprompter at the United Nations' headquarters drew President Trump's frustration.",
    "story": [
      "A malfunctioning escalator and teleprompter at the United Nations' New York City headquarters drew President Trump's frustration on Tuesday \u2014 though the U.N. says a videographer from Mr. Trump's delegation may have triggered the escalator's safety shutoff.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump entered U.N. headquarters to address world leaders at this year's General Assembly session, they stepped onto an escalator. But the machine ground to a halt almost immediately, forcing both Trumps to start climbing the stairs on their own, videos of his arrival show.",
      "Later, as Mr. Trump began his speech to the General Assembly, he remarked that his teleprompter wasn't working. \"I can only say that whoever's operating this teleprompter is in big trouble,\" the president said, drawing laughs from the audience.",
      "The president brought up the two mishaps later in his speech, framing them as metaphors for what he views as the incompetence of the United Nations \u2014 which he accused of offering up little more than \"empty words.\"",
      "\"All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that, on the way up, stopped right in the middle. If the first lady wasn't in great shape, she would've fallen,\" the president said. \"These are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later floated a different explanation, writing in a post on X: \"If someone at the UN intentionally stopped the escalator as the President and First Lady were stepping on, they need to be fired and investigated immediately.\"",
      "Leavitt shared a screenshot from a Times of London article that reported U.N. workers had been overheard joking they might intentionally shut off escalators during Mr. Trump's visit and blame funding shortfalls. There is no evidence that U.N. staff followed through on those jokes.",
      "The press secretary later told Fox News that the Secret Service is looking into the matter.",
      "\"When you put all of this together, it doesn't look like a coincidence to me,\" Leavitt said on Fox News' \"Jesse Watters Primetime.\" \"And if we find that these were U.N. staffers who were purposefully trying to trip up, literally trip up, the president and the first lady of the United States, well, there better be accountability for those people.\"",
      "However, a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday the escalator may have suddenly stopped because of a videographer from the U.S. delegation who can be seen walking ahead of the president and first lady on the escalator, seemingly to film their arrival.",
      "\"A subsequent investigation, including a readout of the machine's central processing unit, indicated that the escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator. The safety mechanism is designed to prevent people or objects accidentally being caught and stuck in or pulled into the gearing. The videographer may have inadvertently triggered the safety function described above,\" St\u00e9phane Dujarric, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said in a statement.",
      "Separately, a U.N. official told CBS News that the White House operated the teleprompter for Mr. Trump when it malfunctioned during his speech.",
      "A federal law enforcement source confirmed to CBS News that the Secret Service is looking into the matter.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "Mr. Trump's speech came as his second administration distances itself from the U.N., withdrawing the U.S. from agencies like the Human Rights Council and the World Health Organization. The administration has also cut its financial contributions to the U.N. and criticized its approach to Israel.",
      "\"The U.N. has such tremendous potential,\" the president said in his speech, \"but it's not even coming close to living up to that potential.\"",

      "Mr. Trump wrote in a Truth Social post that Zelenskyy's forces are \"in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form\" with Europe's help.\u00a0 The unexpected remarks \u2014 which called the Russian military a \"paper tiger\" \u2014 came after Mr. Trump met with Zelenskyy for about an hour Tuesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.",
      "The comments appear to mark a dramatic shift for Mr. Trump, who said last month he expected \"some swapping of territories\" as part of an eventual Russia-Ukraine ceasefire deal. Russia occupies large parts of eastern Ukraine, including territories captured in 2014 and in the current war that began with Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Asked later Tuesday by Fox News' Bret Baier if he was surprised by the U.S. president's about-face, Zelenskyy laughed and responded, \"a little bit.\"",
      "Zelenskyy said he and Mr. Trump had a positive conversation on Tuesday, and he believes Mr. Trump's position on territorial swaps has changed.",
      "\"I think he understands for today that we can't just swap territories. It's not fair,\" he said.",
      "During their meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters that Zelenskyy was \"putting up one hell of a fight,\" and he believes the \"biggest progress\" is that the Russian economy is \"terrible.\" But the U.S. leader didn't appear optimistic about a quick resolution to the war, telling reporters, \"It looks like it's not going to end for a long time.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed both Russia and Ukraine to reach a ceasefire deal to end their more than three-year-long war, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "But a deal has remained elusive as both sides' public positions remain far apart. The Kremlin has pushed Zelenskyy to fully withdraw from large swaths of eastern Ukraine, an idea Zelenskyy has rejected as unfair and unconstitutional. Meanwhile, Ukraine has sought international security guarantees to deter another Russian attack if the current conflict ends.",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out at both Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin at various points. He met with Putin in Alaska last month, but he has criticized the Russian leader for continued strikes on Ukraine, and said last week that Putin had \"really let me down.\"",
      "The U.S. president also pressed NATO countries earlier this month to stop buying Russian oil and to impose hefty tariffs on China, which has remained aligned with Russia, writing that those moves could \"be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR.\"",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he believes NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter their airspace, after Russian drones entered Poland earlier this month and Russian fighter jets allegedly entered Estonian airspace.",
      "At other points, though, Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy have had a rocky relationship. An Oval Office meeting between the two leaders earlier this year descended into a shouting match, and Mr. Trump has occasionally blamed Zelenskyy for the war.",
      "During his interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said he believes his relationship with his American counterpart has improved.",
      "\"I think we have better relation[s] than before,\" Zelenskyy said. \"I think we didn't have close relation[s] because we didn't have, maybe, time. I don't know.\"",

      "In the largest seizure of its kind, the U.S. Secret Service announced Tuesday that the agency found active SIM farms at abandoned apartment buildings located at more than five sites. In total, law enforcement discovered 300 SIM servers \u2013 over 100,000 SIM cards \u2013 enabling encrypted, anonymous communication and capable of sending 30 million text messages per minute. Officials say the servers were so powerful they could have disabled cell phone towers and launched distributed denial of services attacks with the ability to block emergency communications like EMS and police dispatch.",
      "\"This network had the potential to disable cell phone towers and essentially shut down the cellular network in New York City,\" U.S. Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Matt McCool said in a video released by the agency.",
      "An official briefed on the investigation told reporters that this week, the sophisticated network \"could text message the entire country within 12 minutes,\" later adding, \"This was well organized and well funded.\"",
      "Telephonic threats to multiple senior U.S. officials this past spring \u2013 including multiple people protected by the Secret Service \u2013 first triggered the investigation, but officials say the network was seized within the last three weeks.",
      "\"We cannot share which officials were targeted out of concerns for their privacy, but as the forensics investigation continues, we do expect that we will find more targeted officials once we get through that data,\" McCool said.",
      "Early analysis shows the network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals known to U.S. law enforcement, including members of known organized crime gangs, drug cartels and human trafficking rings, according to multiple officials briefed on the investigation. The U.S. Secret Service says it is combing through the more than 100,000 SIM cards in an ongoing, exhaustive forensic analysis.",
      "\"Each SIM basically has the equivalent data of a cell phone. So we're working through every call, every text, every search made on those SIM cards,\" an official told CBS News, adding, \"Early analysis indicates that this network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals that are known to federal law enforcement here in the U.S.\"",
      "The equipment was found within 35 miles of the United Nations in New York, ahead of the U.N. General Assembly. Investigators also found 80 grams of cocaine, illegal firearms, plus computers and phones.",

    "summary": "The White House's autism announcement exaggerates links to Tylenol, misleads on vaccines, and sets back the field by ignoring decades of research, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Ann Bauer, a researcher who studies Tylenol and autism, felt queasy with anxiety in the weeks leading up to the White House's much-anticipated autism announcement.",
      "In August, Bauer and her colleagues published an analysis of 46 previous studies on Tylenol, autism, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Many found no link between the drug and the conditions, while some suggested Tylenol might occasionally exacerbate other potential causes of autism, such as genetics.",
      "Bauer, an epidemiologist at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell, and her team called for more judicious use of the drug until the science is settled.",
      "On Monday, President Trump stood beside Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for what he called a \"historic\" announcement on autism. \"If you're pregnant, don't take Tylenol, and don't give it to the baby after the baby is born,\" Mr. Trump said. \"There are certain groups of people that don't take vaccines and don't take any pills that have no autism,\" he added, without providing evidence. \"They pump so much stuff into those beautiful little babies, it's a disgrace.\"",
      "A fact sheet released alongside the White House briefing cited Bauer's analysis. But she was alarmed by Mr. Trump's comments. If prenatal Tylenol has any association, which it may not, it would help account for only a fraction of cases, she said. Further, research has not deeply examined Tylenol risks in young children, and many rigorous studies refute a link between vaccines and autism.",
      "Bauer worries such statements will cut both ways: People may put themselves at risk to avoid vaccines and Tylenol, the only safe painkiller for use during pregnancy. And she frets that scientists might outright reject her team's measured concerns about Tylenol in a backlash against misleading remarks from Mr. Trump and other members of his \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement.",
      "\"I'm really concerned about how this message is going to play out,\" she said. \"It's a sound-bite universe, and everyone wants a simple solution.\"",
      "Autism experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were neither consulted for the White House's long-awaited autism announcement nor asked to review a draft of the findings and recommendations, CDC scientists told KFF Health News, which agreed not to identify them because they fear retaliation.",
      "\"Typically, we'd be asked to provide information and review the report for accuracy, but we've had absolutely no contact with anyone,\" one CDC researcher said. \"It is very unusual.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Kennedy promised this year that under their leadership the federal government would swiftly figure out what causes autism. Scientists who work in the field have been skeptical, noting that decades of research has shown that no single drug, chemical, or other environmental factor is strongly linked to the developmental disorder. In addition, both Mr. Trump and Kennedy have repeated the scientifically debunked notion that childhood vaccines may cause autism.",
      "Helen Tager-Flusberg, director of the Center for Autism Research Excellence at Boston University, called Mr. Trump's comments dangerous. Fevers can harm the mother and the developing fetus, she said, adding that fevers are more strongly associated with autism than Tylenol.",
      "In an emailed response to queries, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, \"We are using gold-standard science to get to the bottom of America's unprecedented rise in autism rates.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai wrote, \"President Trump pledged to address America's rising rate of autism, and to do so with Gold Standard Science.\"",
      "Had CDC scientists been allowed to brief Kennedy, they say they would have cautioned that simple fixes won't make a dent in the number of autism cases in the United States: As many as 1 in 31 8-year-old children had autism spectrum disorder in 2022.",
      "Systemic changes, such as regulations on air pollution, which has been linked to asthma and developmental disabilities including autism, and assistance for parents of disabled children, could improve lives for far more Americans with autism and other conditions than actions taken by the Trump administration on Sept. 22, researchers say.",
      "One federal action is to consider updating the label on Tylenol and to \"encourage clinicians to exercise their best judgment in use of acetaminophen for fevers and pain in pregnancy by prescribing the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.\" The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists already recommends acetaminophen \"as needed, in moderation, and after consultation with a doctor.\"",
      "\"Political crusade\"",
      "Despite Kennedy's many years of speaking about autism, he rarely cites credible autism research or expert recommendations, Tager-Flusberg said. Instead, Kennedy repeats fringe, scientifically debunked theories linking vaccines to autism, despite rigorous studies published in peer-reviewed journals that refute a link.",
      "At the Sept. 22 briefing, Mr. Trump said he spoke with Kennedy about autism 20 years ago: \"We understood a lot more than a lot of people who studied it,\" he said. Ahead of Mr. Trump's first term in 2017, Kennedy said he met with the president to consider a commission on vaccine safety and autism. It didn't happen then. But soon after Kennedy was confirmed as health secretary, he called autism \"preventable,\" pointed to \"environmental toxins,\" and contradicted the results of a CDC study finding that the main driver of rising autism diagnoses was that doctors increasingly recognize the disorder.",
      "At a televised Cabinet meeting in April, Kennedy told Mr. Trump, \"By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we'll be able to eliminate those exposures.\"",
      "\"You stop taking something, you stop eating something, or maybe it's a shot,\" Mr. Trump replied.",
      "\"He is on a political crusade,\" Tager-Flusberg said of Kennedy, adding that vaccines, Tylenol, aluminum, and food dyes make for simple targets to rally against. \"We know genetics is the most significant risk factor,\" she said, \"but you can't blame Big Pharma for genetics, and you can't build a political movement on genetics research and ride to victory.\"",
      "\"RFK makes our work harder,\" said Peter Hotez, a vaccine researcher and the author of a book about his autistic daughter, \"Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel's Autism.\" He said the book stemmed from conversations with Kennedy in 2017, in which Hotez shared studies pinpointing more than a hundred genes linked to autism, and research into the complex interplay between genetics, biological processes, and things that children and fetuses encounter during development.",
      "\"I sat down with him and explained what the science says, but he was unwilling or incapable of thinking deeply about it,\" Hotez said. \"He is extremely careless.\"",
      "In addition to its focus on Tylenol, the White House said it would move to update \"prescribing information\" on leucovorin \u2014 a medication related to the B vitamin folate \u2014 to reflect its use as an autism treatment. A small clinical trial in 2012-13 suggested the drug may help treat language problems in some children with autism. Tager-Flusberg said the findings warrant further study but clarified these were \"old data, not a breakthrough.\"",
      "Likewise, studies finding a modest association between autism and prolonged Tylenol use were published years ago. Researchers have suggested the medicine might occasionally exacerbate factors associated with autism, such as genetics and oxidative stress, a biological condition that occurs for a variety of reasons that scientists are still unraveling.",
      "Still, these studies couldn't rule out the possibility that fevers prompting women to take Tylenol, rather than the medicine itself, might instead be to blame. Fevers and infections \u2014 including those prevented by vaccines \u2014 have also been linked to autism.",
      "Nonetheless, Bauer's recommendation would be to pause before taking acetaminophen while pregnant \u2014 blanket advice that doctors give for all medications during that period, but which may be ignored. \"Try to alleviate discomfort in some other ways, like with a cold compress, hydration, or massage, before taking it,\" Bauer said.",
      "She welcomed the White House's motion to consider labeling Tylenol to emphasize judicious use of the drug but worries about how the MAHA movement might distort a careful message. On Sept. 2, the right-wing news outlet One America News Network posted an interview with newly appointed CDC vaccine adviser Robert Malone, writing that Malone \"speculates RFK Jr. may have an important announcement this month regarding a potential link between Tylenol, multiple vaccinations and autism in children.\"",
      "\"I was sick to my stomach,\" Bauer said, concerned that Kennedy would link her study to discredited theories, causing doctors and scientists to reject her far more measured work.",
      "\"The boy who cried wolf\"",
      "Several medical and scientific associations have called for Kennedy's removal or resignation. Many scientists are skeptical of what he says because much of it has been misleading or wrong. For example, he's said HIV isn't the only cause of AIDS (it is), that antidepressant drugs cause mass shootings (they don't), that older adults don't have severe autism (some do), that the measles vaccine causes brain swelling (it doesn't), that COVID vaccines were the deadliest vaccines ever made (they aren't), that vaccines aren't safety-tested (they are), and that vaccines contribute to autism (they don't).",
      "\"This is like the boy who cried wolf,\" said Brian Lee, an epidemiologist at Drexel University. \"One day he might be right about something and Americans who are not prone to conspiracies won't trust it because it's coming from RFK's mouth. And that could be a problem.\"",
      "What's more, the Trump administration is eroding scientists' ability to probe the safety of pharmaceuticals, said Robert Steinbrook, head of health research at Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer protection group.",
      "\"Public Citizen is very supportive of research on medications that could be linked to diseases,\" he said. \"But it needs to be through an open process, which looks at scientific evidence, and which doesn't cherry-pick studies to support a preconceived point of view.\"",
      "Steinbrook said the administration has undermined his confidence in the government's ability to conduct credible work. The Food and Drug Administration has held less than a third the number of advisory committee meetings this year as it did last, meaning fewer opportunities for experts to discuss research on the risks and benefits of drugs. The Trump administration has fired hundreds of career scientists at the CDC and FDA and cut millions of dollars in research funds, including to projects studying autism.",
      "In early September, the CDC issued an unusual contract with the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to analyze datasets for signs that vaccinated children were more likely to have autism. Unlike with other research initiatives, the CDC didn't post an open call for applications in advance. This allows agency experts to review proposals and select studies best designed to answer the question at hand.",
      "CDC researchers told KFF Health News that experts in the agency's autism and disability group weren't aware of the contract or asked to review the proposal. That's important, they said, because researchers digging through data to find clues about autism must show how they'll rule out biological and environmental exposures that muddy the results, and ensure that children have been accurately diagnosed. One researcher said, \"It absolutely looks like Kennedy has subverted the grantmaking process.\"",
      "The CDC and HHS did not respond to KFF Health News' requests for information on the grant, including through a Freedom of Information Act request.",
      "The new vaccine study is separate from Kennedy's autism data-science initiative, which was posted as an open call at the National Institutes of Health. \"The hope is that something good comes of it, and that the government won't cherry-pick or censor what scientists find out,\" Lee said.",
      "Bauer said she didn't apply to be part of the initiative because of Kennedy's outsize presence at HHS.",
      "\"I would not take his funding because it could take away from the credibility of my study,\" she said, \"in the same way that taking money from pharmaceutical companies does.\"",

      "Health experts from around the globe are joining the chorus of doctors and organizations pushing back against the Trump administration's announcement Monday\u00a0linking the use of acetaminophen \u2014 the active ingredient in Tylenol and many cold and flu medications \u2014 during pregnancy to an increased risk of autism in children.",
      "\"Effective immediately, the FDA will be notifying physicians that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,\" President Trump said at a news conference with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the European Union's European Medicines Agency said there is currently \"no new evidence\" that would require changes to the current EU recommendations for use of acetaminophen, also commonly called paracetamol outside the U.S.",
      "\"Paracetamol remains an important option to treat pain or fever in pregnant women,\" Steffen Thirstrup, EMA's chief medical officer, said in the statement. \"Our advice is based on a rigorous assessment of the available scientific data and we have found no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children.\"",
      "The United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said Tuesday, \"taking paracetamol during pregnancy remains safe.\"",
      "\"There is no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children,\" the agency's chief safety officer Dr. Alison Cave said in the statement.",
      "In a combined statement, Australia's chief medical officer and the country's medicine regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, said they were joining \"other global medicines regulators, leading clinicians and scientists worldwide in rejecting claims regarding the use of paracetamol in pregnancy, and the subsequent risk of development of ADHD or autism in children.\"",
      "\"Robust scientific evidence shows no causal link between the use of paracetamol in pregnancy and autism or ADHD, with several large and reliable studies directly contradicting these claims,\" the statement continued.",
      "While sharing a statement from Spain's Ministry of Health that stated paracetamol can be used during pregnancy, the country's minister of health, M\u00f3nica Garc\u00eda, called out Mr. Trump specifically for misinformation and lack of evidence.",
      "\"Trump's new crusade is against paracetamol during pregnancy, ignoring all scientific evidence,\" she wrote on X. \"This denialism only sows alarm and misinformation. It's better to listen to health authorities than to the person who suggested injecting bleach against COVID,\" referring to a remark Mr. Trump made in 2020.",
      "A World Health Organization spokesperson said Tuesday that evidence of a link between the use of paracetamol during pregnancy and autism \"remains inconsistent,\" according to Reuters.",
      "International-based studies have been part of the evidence that shows acetaminophen use during pregnancy is safe.",
      "In a\u00a0major study published last year, for example, researchers followed nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years and found that acetaminophen use during pregnancy did not increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children.",
      "In the U.S., organizations \u2014 including one that represents those who treat pregnant patients, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \u2014 have countered the claimed link, saying there's \"no clear evidence.\"",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents some of the largest makers of over-the-counter medications, including acetaminophen, said, \"Safety is the top priority for manufacturers,\" and \"the well-established profile of acetaminophen is supported by decades of research and real-world use.\"",
      "And the\u00a0Autism Science Foundation\u00a0said in a statement that any association between acetaminophen and autism is based on \"limited, conflicting, and inconsistent science.\"",

    "story": [
      "London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office called President Trump's comments \"bigoted,\" after the president appeared to make the false claim that London wants to \"go to sharia law\" and was a city that had \"changed\" under the mayor's leadership.",
      "\"I have to say, I look at London where you have a terrible mayor \u2014 terrible, terrible mayor \u2014 and it's been so changed, so changed,\" Mr. Trump said during his address to world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday. \"Now they want to go to sharia law ... Both their immigration and their suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump used the word \"they\" without clarifying if he meant Khan and London, his comments echoed long running far-right conspiracy theories online linking Khan, who is the first Muslim to be elected mayor of London, to Islamic fundamentalism. There is no evidence that Khan has advocated for London to officially adopt Sharia, a system of religious laws that is used in some Muslim countries but not by the U.K. government.",
      "\"We are not going to dignify his appalling and bigoted comments with a response,\" a spokesperson for London's mayor told CBS News in an e-mailed statement Tuesday. \"London is the greatest city in the world, safer than major US cities, and we're delighted to welcome the record number of US citizens moving here.\"",
      "In response, White House spokesman Davis Ingle said: \"President Trump is right \u2014 unchecked migration into western countries is making the world a more dangerous place.\"",
      "A number of politicians in Britain came to Khan's defense following Mr. Trump's comments, including members of U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government. Khan is a member of Starmer's ruling, left-leaning Labour party.",
      "\"Sadiq Khan is not trying to impose Sharia Law on London,\" U.K. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said in a post on X Tuesday. \"This is a Mayor who marches with pride, who stands up for differences of background and opinion, who's focused on improving our transport, our air, our streets, our safety, our choices and chances.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks \u2014 made within a wider context of criticizing the immigration policy of European countries \u2014 revived a spat between Khan and the president that stretches back nearly a decade.",
      "In 2015, Sadiq Khan roundly condemned then-candidate Donald Trump after he called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\" on national security grounds, following a terrorist attack in California. Early in his first term, Mr. Trump moved to restrict travel to the U.S. by residents of several mostly Muslim countries, though it did not explicitly ban entry to the U.S. by all Muslims.",
      "That initial criticism has led to a colorful back-and-forth between the two over the years. Just last week, Mr. Trump said Khan was \"among the worst mayors in the world,\" and told reporters that he asked that Khan not be present at the banquet hosted by King Charles III during the president's state visit to the U.K.",
      "Mr. Trump has also often claimed that crime in London has risen dramatically during Khan's tenure, including in last week's comments to reporters, when he said crime in London was \"through the roof.\"",
      "Overall recorded crime in London has increased by 31.5% over the past 10 years, with violent crime increasing by 40%, according to U.K. office for National Statistics data cited by CBS News' partners at the BBC. Khan first took office as London's mayor in May 2016.",
      "But data from the Metropolitan Police shows that London had a homicide rate of 11.8 per million people in 2024. That makes the homicide rate in England's capital lower than in a number of major U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., according to data cited by the White House.",

      "Routh represented himself in the trial. He was found guilty of all five charges, which included attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate and assaulting a federal officer.",
      "Routh was arrested in September 2024 at Mr. Trump's golf course. A Secret Service agent testified last week that he spotted Routh before the then-presidential candidate came into view. Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot, the agent said.",
      "After the verdict was read, Routh apparently tried to harm himself, possibly using a pen that was on his desk, to stab himself in the neck. His daughter cried out during the incident and U.S. marshals eventually tackled him.",
      "It was the second assassination attempt against Mr. Trump in 2024, after shots were fired in a separate incident at a Pennsylvania rally. A bullet grazed Mr. Trump's ear in that incident.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that the guilty verdict against Routh \"illustrates the Department of Justice's commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence,\" and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the verdict sends \"a clear message\" that an \"attempt to assassinate a presidential candidate is an attack on our Republic and on the rights of every citizen.\"",
      "A federal district judge will determine his sentence. He faces life in prison.",
      "In a nearly hourlong closing argument on Tuesday, Routh said that there was no intent to kill because the trigger was never pulled, the gun was never fired and that no one was hurt, so \"no crime.\"",
      "\"I wanted to kill, my actions within the community and toward my co-workers and family should show my obvious non-violence and gentleness,\" Routh said. Speaking about himself in the third person, he said the shooting was never going to happen because it was \"never in his heart.\"",
      "But prosecutors said Routh spent weeks plotting to kill Mr. Trump, who was then running for president. Prosecutors laid out Routh's actions ahead of the incident, saying \"those aren'tcoincidences \u2026 that's a plan,\" prosecutor Christopher Brown said in his closing argument.",
      "\"He had a loaded round in the chamber and the safety off,\" Brown said. \"We don't have to prove motive, but you already have it. You only have to decide intent.\"",
      "Prosecutors also alleged in court filings that Routh attempted to acquire an anti-aircraft weapon to shoot down Mr. Trump's plane.",
      "Routh had initially submitted a witness list that included Mr. Trump, as well as Columbia activists Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi \u2014 to whom his connections are unclear \u2014 and several prominent authors. Judge Aileen Canon had rejected many of these potential witnesses.",

      "\"After reviewing the details of the unserious and ridiculous demands being made by the Minority Radical Left Democrats in return for their Votes to keep our thriving Country open, I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Last week, the House approved a measure to keep the government funded until Nov. 21, along with funds for additional security for lawmakers and other officials in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination. Democrats put forward their own proposal, which would extend government funding until Oct. 31 and boost security funding. The Democrats' proposal also includes a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, and a clawback of the some of the policies put in place by Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year.",

      "Congress is now in recess until next week, when the Senate will return with just days to act. House GOP leaders extended the lower chamber's break past the Oct. 1 deadline to pressure the Senate to adopt their bill.",
      "Meanwhile, Schumer and Jeffries have repeatedly asked GOP leaders to negotiate with them on a short-term funding extension. In a letter to Mr. Trump over the weekend, Schumer and Jeffries demanded a meeting with the president, saying Democrats would not support a \"dirty spending bill\" that does not address their health care priorities. Earlier Tuesday, the Democrats announced that following \"weeks of Republican stonewalling in Congress, President Trump has agreed to meet this week in the Oval Office.\"",
      "In his Truth Social post, the president railed against the Democratic proposal to extend government funding, which would roll back cuts to Medicaid, and restore funding for public radio and TV stations that was cut earlier this year in a rescissions package. He said \"I look forward to meeting with them if they get serious about the future of our Nation.\"",
      "\"To the Leaders of the Democrat Party, the ball is in your court. I look forward to meeting with you when you become realistic about the things that our Country stands for,\" he said. \"DO THE RIGHT THING!\"",
      "In a post on X in response, Jeffries said \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump just cancelled a high stakes meeting in the Oval Office with myself and Leader Schumer,\" Jeffries said. \"The extremists want to shut down the government because they are unwilling to address the Republican healthcare crisis that is devastating America.\"",
      "Schumer also chimed in, telling the president, \"When you're finished ranting, we can sit down and discuss health care.\"",
      "\"Trump is running away from the negotiating table before he even gets there,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"While Americans face rising costs and a Republican healthcare crisis, Trump would rather throw a tantrum than do his job. Democrats are ready to work to avoid a shutdown\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Trump and Republicans are holding America hostage. Donald Trump will own the shutdown.\"",

    "summary": "Trump administration figures have vowed to pursue anyone who mocks or celebrates Kirk's death, alarming First Amendment advocates.",
    "story": [
      "In the week since conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated at a Utah university event, comments from some of his critics have ignited a battle over free speech in an increasingly polarized nation.",
      "Kirk, who routinely debated progressive students at his Turning Point USA events and espoused controversial opinions on his podcast, was a stalwart proponent of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Hate speech does not exist legally in America,\" he wrote on X last year. \"There's ugly speech. There's gross speech. There's evil speech. And ALL of it is protected by the First Amendment.\"",
      "But over the last several days, the administration he supported and the president he helped reelect have vowed to crack down on some speech about his death.",
      "Last week, Pentagon officials promised to \"address\" federal employees who mock or celebrate Kirk's death. And the State Department said it would\u00a0revoke visas\u00a0over social posts that \"celebrate\" Kirk's death.",
      "On Monday, Sept. 15, Vice President JD Vance hosted Kirk's podcast and encouraged listeners to call the employers of anyone \"celebrating Charlie's murder.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday said people who post \"hate speech\" should be \"shut down\" and suggested that the Trump administration would pursue people who engage in hate speech.",
      "\"There's free speech, and then there's hate speech,\" Bondi said in an\u00a0interview. \"We will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.\" The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld free speech rights, even if it is hate speech. She later said on X that \"hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected.\" The Justice Department referred CBS News to Bondi's comments when asked whether the administration considers celebrations of Kirk's assassination as threats of violence.",
      "\"Democrat critics are lying about the Administration's actions \u2014 this effort will target those committing criminal acts and hold them accountable,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Asked about Bondi's remarks, President Trump told ABC News' Jonathan Karl on Tuesday: \"We'll probably go after people like you because you treat me so unfairly; it's hate.\"",
      "Kimmel taken off air",
      "Late Wednesday, Sept. 17, ABC announced it would \"indefinitely\" pre-empt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" after Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr said the network should \"take action\" for the comedian's suggestion that Kirk's alleged killer is a Trump supporter. ABC's move came after station owners Nexstar and Sinclair said they were pulling the show indefinitely. Carr thanked Nexstar and Sinclair for taking action.",
      "Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the FCC to approve it. Nexstar told CBS News in a statement it made the decision to pre-empt Kimmel \"unilaterally\" and did not consult with the FCC beforehand.",
      "On Truth Social, Mr. Trump referred to it as a cancellation and congratulated ABC for \"finally having the courage to do what had to be done,\" and added: \"That leaves Jimmy [Fallon] and Seth [Meyers], two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!!\"",
      "Anna Gomez, one of two FCC commissioners working with Carr and the lone Democrat on the commission, called Kimmel's penalty a dangerous new precedent.",
      "\"This administration is increasingly using the weight of government power to suppress lawful expression, not because it glorifies violence or breaks the law, but because it challenges those in power and reflects views they oppose,\" she said on CNN.",
      "In a statement the following day, she added: \"This FCC does not have the authority, the ability, or the constitutional right to police content or punish broadcasters for speech the government dislikes. \u2026 Free speech is the foundation of our democracy, and we must push back against any attempt to erode it.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, also criticized the move.",
      "\"When the head of the FCC is talking openly about taking away the broadcast license, then that is the government trying to exercise censorship. It's not a question of whether you agree with Mr. Kimmel or disagree with Mr. Kimmel. The point is one of the government not coming in and making decisions about whose speech gets heard,\" she said, adding, \"Everyone should care, no matter what your political view is.\"",
      "After nearly a week of controversy, Disney said Kimmel's show would return on Tuesday, Sept. 23. The company said some of the host's comments were \"ill-timed and thus insensitive,\" but after several days of \"thoughtful conversations with Jimmy ... we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.\"",
      "The First Amendment and hateful speech",
      "In general, the First Amendment \u2014 which bars the government from \"abridging the freedom of speech\" \u2014 protects most forms of hateful speech, aside from a narrow set of exceptions that include threats of violence and incitement.",
      "Bondi's initial comments about hate speech stood out among those made by administration officials because of her position as the nation's top prosecutor, said Adam Goldstein, vice president of strategic initiatives at the nonprofit Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.",
      "\"I especially don't want to see an attorney in charge of the Justice Department saying that,\" he said. \"It's the kind of thing that would get you a bad grade in your constitutional law class.\"",
      "Jenin Younes, a First Amendment attorney who worked on a case accusing the Biden administration of social media censorship, told CBS News, \"These are all the same people who were railing against cancel culture and the idea of hate speech just a few years ago, when it was the left doing it.\"",
      "\"The worry is that lawmakers will just define hate speech to mean anything the opposite party says, and so that's why the court has said it's not up to the government to decide what's within the bounds of acceptable discourse and what's not,\" Genevieve Lakier, a University of Chicago law professor, told CBS News. \"There's no definition of hate speech, because the whole point is there's no neutral definition of hate speech.\"",
      "In most cases, Lakier said, \"simply saying 'he had it coming' \u2026 does not fit the very, very, very narrow definition of incitement that is available in the case law.\"",
      "Are offensive comments illegal?",
      "First Amendment legal scholar Eugene Volokh told CBS News that, in most circumstances, the government cannot go after ordinary people for making insensitive or offensive public comments about Kirk's killing.",
      "\"It may be in bad taste. It may be bad for the country when people are trying to normalize political violence. But it is protected by the First Amendment,\" said Volokh, a professor emeritus of law at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "\"I would say it's basically prohibited for the government to say you can't mock or make fun of or even celebrate his death,\" said Younes, who currently serves as national legal director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.",
      "Volokh says comments like Bondi's \"are likely to further confuse people, whether citizens or law enforcement or others, about what's protected and what's not protected.\"",
      "\"I think they may also kind of send a message that we are going to try to find a way of punishing this speech,\" Volokh added.",
      "Bondi also said the Justice Department could prosecute businesses that refuse to print photos of Kirk for customers, citing a worker at an Office Depot who declined to print flyers for a Kirk vigil. Office Depot called the incident \"completely unacceptable\" and said the staff member no longer works for the company.",
      "\"There is no federal law that prohibits copy shops or print shops from discriminating based on the content of the message,\" Volokh said.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said Bondi was solely referencing the Office Depot incident, which the department's civil rights division looked into.",
      "Less clear, according to legal experts, is whether the federal government can deport non-citizens or revoke their visas over their views on Kirk, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio has floated. Volokh says the laws around this are \"unsettled.\"",
      "\"While it is true that the executive's power when it comes to immigration is very vast, I think the First Amendment constrains it,\" Younes said. She pointed to the Trump administration's attempts to remove students for participating in pro-Palestinian protests, which have been met with pushback at the district court level.",
      "What can private companies do?",
      "The First Amendment doesn't stop private employers from choosing to fire people for speech, though some states like California have their own legal protections.",
      "However, in some cases, it can be illegal for the government to use its power to pressure a private company into firing a staff member \u2014 a concept known as \"jawboning.\"",
      "Government officials can try to persuade private companies to take a certain action, according to Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, but they cannot coerce companies by making threats.",
      "Volokh said it likely doesn't qualify as jawboning if elected officials merely express the view that people should be fired, as long as they don't cross the line into threatening to take action. For example, on Vance's call for people to contact the employers of anybody who celebrates Kirk's death, Volokh said, \"it's hard to see that as unconstitutional.\"",
      "\"You would have to show the private employer didn't want to fire you, but they were just acting because they were afraid of some kind of repercussions from the government,\" noted Younes.",
      "There's a fine line between broadly encouraging companies to fire employees who praised Kirk's assassination, and giving instructions to specific firms, according to Goldstein. He pointed to a contrast between Vance's comments advising podcasts listeners to call people's employers, and a tweet by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.",
      "Duffy praised American Airlines, United and Delta for suspending employees, and wrote, \"The next step should be to fire them.\"",
      "\"A rational airline who sees this message might feel some coercive effect on their decision making,\" said Goldstein, noting Duffy's power over the airline industry.",
      "Lakier said it's not a violation of the First Amendment if a company fires an employee of their own volition. But, she said, \"the problem is, in many of these cases, it's going to be because of political sympathy.\"",
      "\"The employers who are firing them, maybe implicitly fear that if they don't, they're going to face the government's wrath or they want to curry favor by firing,\" she said.",
      "In general, however, \"If we're talking about private companies and you are an at-will employee, then that means exactly as it sounds like, which is that an employer can fire you at will,\" said CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School.",
      "Government workers have some free speech protections, but it's complicated",
      "In many cases, Trump allies have spotlighted public employees who criticize Kirk.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called celebrations of Kirk's death by service members or civilian workers \"unacceptable\" last week, and said the Pentagon is \"tracking\" them. Since then, at least one Marine officer has been relieved of his recruiting duties pending an investigation into his post about Kirk, and two Army officers have been suspended pending a review into their posts, according to a Marine official and an Army official.",
      "A Secret Service agent who expressed negative opinions about Kirk on Facebook was also placed on leave last week.",
      "At the state level, Oklahoma's top education official has said teachers who celebrate Kirk's assassination \"will be banned from teaching,\" and teachers in several other states have been investigated or placed on leave over their comments. Others have pushed for action against employees at public colleges like Clemson University.",
      "People who work for the government have some free speech protections, especially for speech that they make while off the clock, legal experts say.",
      "\"Government employees do have First Amendment rights of freedom of speech,\" said Calvert. \"However, those rights are not unlimited and may be restricted if the employee's speech somehow interferes with the ability of the employer \u2026 to effectively and efficiently deliver its services to the public.\"",
      "Calvert said \"every case is going to be unique.\"",
      "Prior court rulings have established several factors for assessing the speech rights of government employees, according to Calvert and Volokh. Those include whether the worker spoke in their personal capacity, whether it relates to a matter of public concern and whether the worker's right to speak out outweighs the government's interest in delivering its services.",
      "But the military is a slightly separate case, according to Volokh, because \"there are more restrictions that are permissible on service members' speech.\"",
      "Volokh said the military is different \"in part because of a sense that \u2026 this is an environment where discipline is really important, where self-discipline is really important, where unit cohesion is really important, where commitment to the right ideas is very important.\"",
      "\"It's going very, very far\"",
      "Some First Amendment advocates are uncomfortable with vocal calls for people to be fired \u2014 even if they don't run afoul of the Constitution.",
      "\"It's going very, very far. This is not being limited to people saying, 'I'm glad Charlie Kirk is dead and I wish everyone like him was dead, too,'\" Younes said. \"It's being applied to people who just are saying they didn't like Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "Goldstein said that some officials may be understandably lashing out after the death of their friend, but particularly in the context of Kirk's career as free speech advocate, the reaction has gone too far.",
      "\"What a weird way to react in memory of Charlie Kirk, who was known for listening to people and disagreeing with them, and moving on,\" Goldstein said.",
      "Graham  Kates, \n                                                  \n                                  Eleanor  Watson, \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen and \n                                                  \n                      Alan  He\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have discovered a new dinosaur from Argentina with powerful claws, feasting on an ancient crocodile bone.",
      "The new find was possibly 23 feet long and hailed from a mysterious group of dinosaurs called megaraptorans. They prowled across what's now South America, Australia and parts of Asia, splitting off into different species over millions of years.",
      "Megaraptorans were known for their stretched-out skulls and \"huge and very powerful claws,\" said Lucio Ibiricu with the Patagonian Institute of Geology and Paleontology, who was part of the discovery team.",
      "But it's not yet clear how these creatures hunted and where they fall on the evolutionary timeline \u2014 mainly because the fossils recovered so far were incomplete.",
      "\"Megaraptorans are among the least understood dinosaurs of all,\" Ibiricu told the Reuters news agency.",
      "In a new study, researchers said they uncovered part of a skull as well as arm, leg and tail bones from the Lago Colhu\u00e9 Huapi rock formation in Patagonia. They noticed unique features in the bones that made them realize this could be a new species.",
      "This latest member of the megaraptoran clan named Joaquinraptor casali \"fills a major gap by providing one of the most complete skeletons yet,\" Federico Agnolin with the Argentine Museum of Natural Science Bernardino Rivadavia said in an email. Agnolin was not involved with the research, which was published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "The creature likely lived between 66 and 70 million years ago \u2014 close to the time dinosaurs went extinct \u2014 and was at least 19 years old when it died, though scientists don't know what killed it.",
      "The front leg bone pressed against its jaws \u2014 belonging to an ancient relative of crocodiles \u2014 could yield some clues to its diet and whether it was the top predator on the humid prehistoric flood plains.",
      "Study co-author Matt Lamanna told Reuters that unlike the T. rex, which had massive teeth and small arms, the Joaquinraptor likely used its long arms to capture prey.",
      "\"This suggests that these two predatory dinosaur lineages evolved different adaptations to accomplish basically the same thing - that is, to capture, subdue, kill and eat other animals such as other dinosaurs,\" Lamanna told Reuters. \"Precisely why these groups evolved along these different evolutionary pathways remains a mystery, but it shows that, during the Cretaceous, there was more than one way to be a top predator.\"",
      "Ibiricu named the new dinosaur in memory of his son Joaquin. While Joaquin was very young and hadn't yet developed a fascination with dinosaurs, Ibiricu still thinks he would have appreciated being named after one.",
      "\"All children love dinosaurs so he would probably be a fan too,\" he said.",
      "The discovery comes just a few months after\u00a0 scientists identified the Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, a new T. rex ancestor that researchers called the \"missing link\" between apex predators.",

      "Vibrio vulnificus is a bacteria that occurs in warm coastal waters, CBS News previously reported, and is more common between May and October. It can cause illness including life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis, according to the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About one in five people with a Vibrio vulnificus infection die, according to the CDC.",
      "It's not clear how the person contracted the bacteria. The person was not identified in a news release from state health officials.",
      "People can contract the bacteria by exposing an open wound to contaminated water or by eating raw or undercooked seafood, including oysters. Two of the Vibrio vulnificus deaths in Louisiana this year were in people who ate contaminated raw oysters, the state health department said in August.",
      "Louisiana and other states have been seeing an increase in Vibrio vulnificus diagnoses. Experts suggest the trend may be because of\u00a0warming oceans. The bacteria is usually found in the Gulf Coast, but has begun to become more common further north, said Dr. Fred Lopez, an infectious disease specialist at LSU Health.",

      "Scientists have discovered prehistoric insects preserved in amber for the first time in South America, providing a fresh glimpse into life on Earth at a time when flowering plants were just beginning to diversify and spread around the world.",
      "Many of the specimens found at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador date to 112 million years ago, said Fabiany Herrera, curator of fossil plants at the Field Museum in Chicago and co-author of the study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth and Environment. At least six types of arthropods were found preserved, according to the study.",
      "Almost all known amber deposits from the past 130 million years have been in the Northern Hemisphere, and it's long been \"an enigma\" that scientists have found few in southern regions that once comprised the supercontinent Gondwana, said David Grimaldi, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History who was not involved in the discovery.",
      "This marks the first time researchers have identified ancient beetles, flies, ants and wasps in fossilized tree resin in South America, said Ricardo P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente, a paleoentomologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, who also was not involved in the new study.",
      "\"Amber pieces are little windows into the past,\" P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente said, adding that the discovery will help researchers understand the evolving interactions between flowering plants and insects that lived during the era of the dinosaurs.",
      "The researchers uncovered hundreds of fragments of amber, some containing ancient insects, pollen and tree leaves, at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador that's on the edge of what is today the Amazon basin.",
      "Two types of amber were discovered, according to the study: There was a more common form of amber found around the roots of resin-producing plants, and a rarer form of the material formed from resin exposed to air. The amber formed around the roots did not hold any specimens, the study said.",
      "\"A different kind of forest\"",
      "The discoveries provide evidence that the area was once a \"humid, resinous forest ecosystem,\" according to the study.",
      "But today's rainforest is much different from what dinosaurs roamed through, Herrera said. Based on an analysis of fossils in the amber, the ancient rainforest contained species of ferns and conifers, including the unusual Monkey Puzzle Tree, that no longer grow in Amazonia.",
      "\"It was a different kind of forest,\" said Herrera.",
      "The amber deposits were previously known to geologists and miners who worked at the Genoveva quarry. Study co-author Carlos Jaramillo at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute first heard of them about a decade ago and set out to find the exact location, aided by geology field notes.",
      "\"I went there and realized this place is amazing,\" Jaramillo said. \"There's so much amber in the mines,\" and it's more visible in the open quarry than it would be if hidden under dense layers of vegetation.",
      "Researchers will continue to analyze the amber trove to learn more about Cretaceous-era biodiversity \u2014 including the insects that contributed to evolution by feeding on flowering plants. \"Amber tends to preserve things that are tiny,\" said Grimaldi.",

      "\"No pressure, NASA, we have some work to do,\" he said.",
      "Meet the astronauts",
      "This is NASA's first astronaut class with more women than men. It includes six pilots with experience in high-performance aircraft, a biomedical engineer, an anesthesiologist, a geologist and a former SpaceX launch director.",
      "Among the new astronaut candidates is 39-year-old Anna Menon, a mother of two who flew to orbit in 2024 aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon as a private astronaut on a commercial, non-NASA flight.",
      "\"I am so thrilled to be back here with the NASA family,\" Menon said. \"As more and more people venture into space ... we have this awesome opportunity to learn a tremendous amount to help support those astronauts ... and help keep them healthy and safe. So it's an exciting time to be here.\"",
      "Menon worked for NASA for seven years as a biomedical researcher and flight controller before joining SpaceX in 2018. She served as a senior engineer and was later selected as the onboard medical officer during the commercial Polaris Dawn\u00a0mission, chartered by billionaire Jared Isaacman.",
      "She married her husband, Anil, in 2016 while both were working for NASA. A former Air Force flight surgeon, Anil Menon joined SpaceX as its first medical officer in 2018. He joined NASA's astronaut corps in 2021 and is now assigned to a long-duration space station crew scheduled for launch aboard a Russian Soyuz next summer.",

    "story": [
      "Running a day late because of software issues, Northrop Grumman's Cygnus XL cargo ship caught up with the International Space Station early Thursday and then stood by while the lab's robot arm latched on to a grapple fixture to wrap up a successful, if extended, rendezvous.",
      "The capture came after Northrop Grumman engineers adjusted the sensitivity of the main engine fault detection software that prematurely triggered shutdowns during two rendezvous thruster firings Tuesday.",
      "As it turned out, the main engine was healthy all along and once the software was adjusted, the spacecraft was able to press ahead with the rendezvous, pulling up to a point just below the station so robot arm operator Jonny Kim, assisted by Zena Cardman, could capture the ship.",
      "\"A big congratulations to the NASA and Cygnus teams for a successful Cygnus launch, rendezvous and capture,\" Kim radioed mission control. \"Adapting and overcoming unforeseen challenges is something we do at NASA, and I'm very proud to be a part of this team.\"",
      "Unlike SpaceX's cargo Dragon and Russian Progress freighters, which carry out autonomous dockings at their respective ports, the Cygnus was designed to be captured by the station's arm and pulled in for berthing.",
      "After locking onto the Cygnus XL at 7:24 a.m. EDT, Kim handed off arm operations to flight controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston so the ship could be pulled in for berthing at the Earth-facing port of the central Unity module.",
      "Northrop Grumman names its cargo ships after notable figures in the space community. The Cygnus XL was named in honor of shuttle pilot William \"Willie\" McCool, who lost his life in the 2003 Columbia disaster.",
      "Space station astronaut Mike Fincke, a member of the 1996 astronaut class along with McCool, said he was \"a gifted pilot, a devoted crewmate and a man of deep humility, his life continues to inspire us.\"",
      "\"To see a ship bearing his name safely arrive at the station is a reminder that his courage and kindness are still circling our beautiful planet Earth,\" he said.",
      "On board: more than 5 tons of needed spare parts, research material and crew supplies, including holiday treats for the station crew.",
      "\"The (Cygnus) is packed with consumables, like nitrogen, oxygen, food and toilet parts, and it has a large number of spare parts that are required for systems like, for example, our urine processor,\" said Dina Contella, deputy manager of the space station program at the Johnson Space Center.",
      "\"We're stocking up on these items since we were short over the past year, and we'd like to have a good reserve for the future,\" she said.",
      "That shortfall was caused, in part, by damage an earlier Cygnus suffered during shipment from a subcontractor in Europe to Cape Canaveral, Florida. That vehicle is still grounded pending analysis and repairs.",
      "Sunday's launch of the Cygnus XL marked the maiden flight of an upgraded version of the cargo ship, which is about 5 feet longer than the original, allowing it to carry about 2,600 pounds of additional cargo.",
      "NASA pays for cargo delivery flights using Cygnus and Dragon spacecraft. To date, SpaceX has successfully carried out 32 Dragon resupply missions while Northrop Grumman has executed 21 successful flights, including the current mission.",
      "Bill Spetch, operations integration manager for the space station, said the resupply flights \"and especially this great capability that Cygnus brings and the amount of cargo that it brings to us, is critical for us to keep us running smooth and doing the things that we need ... to do the research.\"",

In total, law enforcement discovered 300 SIM servers \u2013 over 100,000 SIM cards \u2013 enabling encrypted, anonymous communication and capable of sending 30 million text messages per minute. Officials say the servers were so powerful they could have disabled cell phone towers and launched distributed denial of services attacks with the ability to block emergency communications like EMS and police dispatch.",

      "An official briefed on the investigation told reporters that this week, the sophisticated network \"could text message the entire country within 12 minutes,\" later adding, \"This was well organized and well funded.\"",
      "Telephonic threats to multiple senior U.S. officials this past spring \u2013 including multiple people protected by the Secret Service \u2013 first triggered the investigation, but officials say the network was seized within the last three weeks.",
      "\"We cannot share which officials were targeted out of concerns for their privacy, but as the forensics investigation continues, we do expect that we will find more targeted officials once we get through that data,\" McCool said.",
      "Early analysis shows the network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals known to U.S. law enforcement, including members of known organized crime gangs, drug cartels and human trafficking rings, according to multiple officials briefed on the investigation. The U.S. Secret Service says it is combing through the more than 100,000 SIM cards in an ongoing, exhaustive forensic analysis.",
      "\"Each SIM basically has the equivalent data of a cell phone. So we're working through every call, every text, every search made on those SIM cards,\" an official told CBS News, adding, \"Early analysis indicates that this network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals that are known to federal law enforcement here in the U.S.\"",
      "The equipment was found within 35 miles of the United Nations in New York, ahead of the U.N. General Assembly. Investigators also found 80 grams of cocaine, illegal firearms, plus computers and phones.",

Challenges must be made by a pitcher, catcher or batter \u2014 signaled by tapping their helmet or cap \u2014 and a team retains its challenge if successful. Reviews will be shown as digital graphics on outfield videoboards.",
      "Adding the robot umps is likely to cut down on ejections.

Currently, it calls strikes solely based on where the ball crosses the midpoint of the plate, 8.5 inches from the front and the back. The top of the strike zone is 53.5% of batter height and the bottom 27%.",

      "The challenge system introduces ABS without eliminating pitch framing, a subtle art where catchers use their body and glove to try making borderline pitches look like strikes. Framing has become a critical skill for big league catchers.

    "story": [
      "A deal between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok includes new stipulations over who controls the social media company's algorithm, a closely guarded secret which has proved to be a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market.",
      "In the meantime, a senior White House official said Monday that the U.S. and China had reached agreement on the basic details of the app's ownership. The new structure will move TikTok's U.S. operations under a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S. that will control the algorithm and oversee security, the official said.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Who will control the TikTok algorithm?",
      "According to the White House official, the new arrangement will operate and control a copy of the algorithm. Software maker Oracle will \"provide sort of top to bottom security\" throughout the company, the official said, noting that will involve monitoring the technology as well as managing how American data is stored.",
      "\"It's going to be continuously monitored as it operates to ensure that it's behaving appropriately, that it's not being used for any kind of malicious purpose, and that it's not being unduly influenced,\" the White House official said.",
      "Oracle's chairman and chief technology officer is Larry Ellison, whose son, David Ellison, is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.",
      "Mr. Trump, asked last week about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. Last week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, last week told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "Asked about this structure last week, Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization, told CBS MoneyWatch that as she understands it, ByteDance would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use the algorithm under certain terms.",
      "\"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it,\" she said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said last week that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch before details of the new structure were announced.",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, said the new arrangement has to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",

      "More importantly, Riccobono said, is that Meta has \"taken an interest in working with blind people to make the technology better, make it more accurate, make it more meaningful to the experience of blind people.\"",
      "Lakrout and Riccobono both agree that AI technology and Meta's glasses are a useful step in enhancing the blind and visually impaired community's independence.

      "The\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics\u00a0(AAP) also recommends that everyone 6 months and older without medical contradictions get vaccinated.",
      "For pregnant women, flu shots \u2014 specifically the injection, not\u00a0the nasal spray \u2014 are also recommended by both the CDC and AAP.",
      "Protecting kids from the flu is important because infections can lead to hospitalizations and sometimes be deadly, the CDC says. During the 2023-24 flu season, for example, the CDC reported nearly 200 flu-related deaths among\u00a0children in the U.S. Most of them were eligible for a vaccine but were not fully vaccinated, the CDC said.",

      "In their latest meeting, the ACIP voted for people to make individual, informed decisions about COVID vaccination, and it declined to specifically recommend COVID vaccination. This is a change from current guidance, since it drops recommendations for even children at high risk.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office where a gunman opened fire on Wednesday was also the target of an alleged bomb threat in August, underscoring a pattern of attacks and threats targeting federal facilities and officials in recent months.",
      "On Wednesday, ICE said in a statement that a gunman began firing \"indiscriminately\" at the field office and its entryway early in the morning. Three detainees were shot, and one died, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE. (The department initially said two detainees had died before issuing a correction.)",
      "No ICE officials were injured, and the gunman died of a self-inflicted gunshot, according to ICE.",
      "Joe Rothrock, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Dallas office, said the bureau was investigating the shooting as an \"act of targeted violence.\"",
      "\"Early evidence that we've seen from rounds that were found near the suspected shooter contain messages that are anti-ICE in nature,\" Rothrock said at a news conference. FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo on X showing a bullet with \"ANTI-ICE\" written on it.",
      "\"This isn't the first time this location has been targeted; less than a month ago, a man walked in with what he claimed was a bomb. This violence must stop,\" ICE said in its statement.",
      "On Aug. 25, a 36-year-old man was arrested outside the same ICE facility after he approached security officers and showed them what he claimed to be a \"detonator\" on his wrist. The man, Bratton Dean Wilkinson, allegedly said he had a bomb in his backpack. A bomb squad cleared the scene and the suspect was charged with false reporting to induce an emergency response.",
      "Officials have not identified the gunman in Wednesday's shooting, and have not said whether the August bomb threat was related. But Homeland Security officials have highlighted a spate of threats and attacks against federal facilities and personnel, including two other recent incidents in Texas.",
      "ICE has said law enforcement officials within the agency have faced a 1,000% increase in assaults since the beginning of the Trump administration, which has dramatically ramped up arrests and deportations.",
      "On July 4, a police officer was shot in the neck outside an ICE detention facility in Alvarado, Texas. Officials have called the attack a \"planned ambush.\" Ten suspects have been charged with three counts of attempted murder of a federal officer and three counts of discharging a firearm in relation to a crime of violence. If convicted, each faces a mandatory sentence of 10 years to life in prison.",
      "Three days later, on July 7, a shooter opened fire at a Border Patrol facility in McAllen, Texas. Two officers and a Border Patrol employee were injured. The gunman, identified as 27-year-old Ryan Louis Mosqueda, had an assault rifle and was carrying a utility vest, officials said. Mosqueda died after Border Patrol agents and local police returned fire.",
      "On Aug. 15, a threatening letter with what was determined to be a non-hazardous white powdery substance was sent to an ICE office in New York City. Sources told CBS News New York there were a total of five envelopes received with letters containing \"anti-ICE rhetoric.\"",
      "Also in August, an anti-ICE protester was charged with assault and destruction of federal property in San Francisco. According to court filings, 35-year-old Adrian Guerrero of Oakland, California, allegedly slashed the tire of a government vehicle and threatened to stab a law enforcement officer during a targeted law enforcement operation. He allegedly made repeated threats against law enforcement in San Francisco, warning, \"I'm going to f--- you up,\" and \"I'm going to go after your family,\" according to court papers. DHS said Guerrero was part of a group of roughly 15 to 20 violent rioters who assaulted, grabbed, punched and pepper-sprayed ICE agents.",

    "summary": "The family of one of the people killed when an airliner and an Army helicopter collided over Washington, D.C., in January has filed a lawsuit seeking accountability.",
    "story": [
      "The family of one of the 67 people killed earlier this year when an American Airlines plane and a United States Army helicopter collided over Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against the government and the airlines involved in the crash. It accuses them of failing to recognize the warning signs after more than 30 documented near misses in the area.",
      "At least 60 lawsuits from other families are expected to join this first lawsuit that seeks to hold the Federal Aviation Administration, the Army, American Airlines and its regional partner, PSA Airlines, accountable for the deadliest U.S. plane crash since 2001. PSA Airlines operated Flight 5342 that crashed Jan. 29.",
      "The widow of Casey Crafton from Connecticut, who is raising three young boys without her husband, filed the lawsuit. Her lawyers also represent the majority of the families of people who died in the crash.",
      "\"Casey was a devoted father and husband, and we built a beautiful life together,\" said Rachel Crafton in a statement about the lawsuit, in which she described her husband as \"a loving brother, a supportive son, a committed employee, a selfless friend\" and someone who \"made everyone around him feel valued and respected.\"",
      "Casey Crafton's brother read his sister-in-law's statement aloud during a news conference Wednesday where her attorneys also spoke along with others who lost loved ones in the collision. As her husband had worked as an aviation mechanic, Rachel Crafton said he \"was betrayed by this system he trusted\" when Flight 5342 crashed.",
      "\"As his wife, I cannot stand by and allow his life to be lost in vain,\" her statement continued. \"Today, we are taking legal action because the accountability of American Airlines, PSA Airlines, and the Army and FAA is the only way to ensure this never happens again and no other family has to live with the pain we have to endure each day without Casey.\"",
      "Doug Lane, whose wife and child both died on Flight 5342, appeared at Wednesday's news conference, too.",
      "\"I, along with a number of other family members affected by this collision, are here to the deliver the message that the Crafton family are not on this journey alone,\" said Lane. He said families of the people killed have \"turned grief into action\" in the months since, prompting an investigation into the FAA and pushing for another into the Army.",
      "The FAA didn't immediately respond to the legal action but the airlines and Army both said they are focused on supporting the families who lost loved ones in the crash and ensuring the safety of their flights. The Army declined to discuss the details of the lawsuit, but American and PSA defended their actions and said they will fight any claim that they caused or contributed to this accident.",
      "\"Flight 5342 was on a routine approach to DCA (Reagan airport) when the Army helicopter \u2014 that was above the published helicopter route altitude \u2014 collided with it,\" the airlines said in their statement. \"American has a strong track record of putting the safety of our customers and team members above everything else.\"",
      "Determining the cause of the crash",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has already highlighted a long list of things that likely contributed to the crash, although the final report identifying the cause won't be ready until next year.",
      "The Black Hawk helicopter was flying well above the 200-foot limit, but even if it had been at the correct altitude, the route it was flying provided a scant 75 feet of separation between helicopters and planes landing on Ronald Reagan International Airport's secondary runway. The helicopter's altimeter may have provided faulty readings.",
      "The NTSB has also said the FAA failed to recognize an alarming pattern of near misses at the busy airport in the years before the crash and ignored concerns about helicopter traffic around the airport. Investigators also said that overworked controllers were trying to squeeze as many planes as possible into the landing pattern with minimal separation on a regular basis. If any of those things \u2014 or a number of other factors \u2014 had been different that night, the collision might have been avoided.",
      "The lawsuit says the airlines failed in their duty to protect the passengers because they were aware of the helicopter traffic around Reagan airport but failed to adequately train pilots to handle it and take other steps to mitigate the risks. Other airline policies, such as allowing pilots to accept an alternative runway that intersects with the helicopter route and heavily scheduling flights in the second half of every hour may have contributed.",
      "\"There is clear evidence that there were dozens of near-misses and thousands of reports of congestion between commercial aircraft and military aircraft at Reagan National that were being ignored by the airlines,\" said lawyer Bob Clifford, who is representing the families.",
      "The lawsuit says the PSA pilots should have reacted sooner when they received an alert about traffic in the area 19 seconds before the crash instead of waiting until the last second to pull up. The lawsuit says a yellow icon appeared on the pilots' warning system showing the relative direction and altitude of the Army helicopter.",
      "The PSA pilots would also have heard controllers warn the helicopter about their aircraft although the controller never warned the PSA pilots directly.",
      "\"A mission to make sure this doesn't happen again\"",
      "Among the jet's passengers were several members of the Skating Club of Boston, who were returning from an elite junior skaters' camp following the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas. A figure skating tribute event in Washington raised $1.2 million for the crash victims' families.",
      "Others on the flight from Wichita included a group of hunters returning from a guided trip in Kansas; four members of a steamfitters' union in suburban Maryland; nine students and parents from schools in Fairfax County, Virginia; and two Chinese nationals. There were also four crew members on the plane and three people in the helicopter's crew who were killed.",
      "Bill and Renee Parente said they are hoping the lawsuit can answer the lingering questions about the crash that killed their 34-year-old son, Anthony Parente, less than six months before he was due to get married.",
      "Bill Parente said his family is mad because this crash didn't have to happen.",
      "\"We are on a mission to make sure this doesn't happen again,\" Bill Parente said after the news conference. \"We have to live with this for the rest of our lives.\"",

      "\"No matter the political atmosphere, YouTube will continue to enable free expression on its platform, particularly as it relates to issues subject to political debate,\" the letter read, noting that a number of accounts were kicked off the platform between 2023 and 2024 for violating misinformation rules that don't exist anymore.

    "published": "Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:23:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The large fee could help some U.S. workers find jobs, but there could be longer-term costs, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration says the new $100,000 fee for foreign employees to obtain an H-1B visa will spur companies to hire Americans instead of bringing in labor from overseas. Yet many economists predict the results will be more mixed, potentially fostering increased domestic hiring in some industries but slowing long-term economic growth with a knock-on effect on overall employment.",
      "\"I could envision a scenario in which otherwise available [American] employees see a large increase for their labor demand,\" Kirk Doran, associate professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame, said of the new visa policy. \"There is some evidence that for the kind of work H-1B employees do, there are available workers looking for jobs right now.\"",
      "In the near term, some technology industry workers in particular could see job gains as more companies seek to avoid the sharply higher costs of bringing in employees from overseas, Rutgers University labor economist Jennifer Hunt told CBS News.",
      "\"The winners would be U.S. native-born computer programmers,\" she said. \"If you're a native worker who is really similar to an immigrant, immigrants are usually bad for you. So we would expect current American, U.S. programmers to be helped.\"",
      "Yet the bigger picture is more complex. Other economic research shows that hiring immigrant workers often benefits companies, providing a ready source of skilled labor with the education and training that may not be widely available in the U.S.",
      "One 2024 study from the nonprofit IZA Institute of Labor Economics on the impact of U.S. immigration on employment said H-1B workers can \"help firms increase their employment, revenues and survival probabilities,\" while finding no evidence that hiring of foreign labor through the program displaced native-born American workers.",
      "The research \u2014 from economists at IZA, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, University of Delaware, University of Michigan and Queens College, CUNY \u2014 also found that every H-1B worker a company hired helped produce additional job gains. \"High-wage, high-productivity firms expand more and even crowd-in natives with college degrees\" when able to add H-1B workers, they wrote.",
      "George Mason University economics professor Michael Clemens underlined that H-1B workers with specialized skills can help boost a company's revenue and profits, potentially spawning other kinds of jobs at the employer, such as in sales and marketing, that can be filled by U.S. workers.",
      "As a result, Clemens worries that the policy change would hurt Americans' job prospects over the long term. \"It is going to choke off job opportunities for the people it is supposed to help,\" he said.",
      "Cost of restricting immigration",
      "To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company. Congress caps the number of H-1B visas \u2014 which are valid for three years and which can be extended for an additional three years \u2014 at 85,000 annually. Roughly 700,000 workers in the U.S. hold H-1B visas, according to Capital Economics.",
      "\"The costs of restricting immigration are widespread,\" Gaurav Khanna, a University of California San Diego professor of economics focusing on migration, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"On net, it benefits U.S. workers more than it hurts them, such that the benefits outweigh the costs. The visas allow the IT companies to grow quite rapidly, and these IT firms start hiring other workers in management positions and in HR, so it leads to employment growth at these firms.\"",
      "The White House dismissed the notion that hiring workers from abroad also benefits U.S. workers.",
      "\"President Trump continues to prove to so-called 'experts' wrong time and time again \u2013 no 'economic study' can change the reality lived by many Americans across the country who bore the brunt of the massive abuse of the H-1B system,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages.\"",
      "Rogers added that the visa fee protects \"Americans from cheap, foreign labor.\"",
      "In a\u00a0proclamation\u00a0last week, Mr. Trump said H-1B visas disadvantage Americans by allowing companies to exploit the program to \"replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.\" That has stunted job opportunities and undermined wages, he added.",
      "How much do H-1B workers earn?",
      "Some research supports this claim. For example, an August analysis\u00a0from The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, found that H-1B workers earn significantly less than their American counterparts.",
      "\"[M]any employers may be using the H-1B program not to attract top-tier global talent, but to fill roles at below-median wage levels\u2014raising questions about the program's alignment with its stated objectives,\" the report said.",
      "Other changes could be coming to the H-1B program, with the Trump administration aiming to tilt it toward better-paid foreign workers. On Monday, it proposed replacing the lottery with a system that would favor immigrants with advanced skills and higher incomes.",
      "The Heritage report also notes that the visas restrict worker mobility by tying a visa holder to a given company, preventing them from seeking other employment. That can make such workers more desirable to employers than native workers, who can leave their jobs at any time, the report explains.",
      "In this sense, companies' reliance on the program can hurt native workers, the group said.",
      "\"But this creates an uneven playing field: Native workers, who are free to switch jobs or negotiate better pay, may be overlooked not because they lack skills, but because they are not as easily retained or controlled,\" wrote Alexander Frei, the report's author and formerly a senior research associate at Heritage. \"As a result, employers may favor visa-bound workers who accept lower wages and fewer demands, driving down bargaining power and wage growth for equally or more qualified U.S. workers.\"",
      "Other groups have\u00a0criticized the H-1B program for disproportionately benefiting large, multinational firms that can enter thousands of visa applicants in the lottery and hire whomever is successful.",

      "In a joint U.S.-Mexican operation last month, authorities tracked down a cartel leader accused of running a gruesome infant trafficking ring in northern Mexico, according to senior intelligence officials.",
      "Martha Alicia Mendez Aguilar, known as \"La Diabla,\" was captured on Sept. 2 after officials say the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, referred to by the U.S. as CJNG, lured a handful of pregnant women \u2014 often in vulnerable or impoverished circumstances \u2014 to remote areas. Once there, CJNG traffickers allegedly performed illegal cesarean operations on the women, killing the mothers and allegedly harvesting their organs postmortem, and placing newborns into illicit markets, according to senior intelligence officials. The infants were then sold to couples in the United States for as much as 250,000 pesos or roughly $14,000 each, according to the senior intelligence officials.",
      "Mexican authorities were tipped off by intelligence provided by the National Counterterrorism Center, under the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. NCTC Director Joe Kent called the scheme an \"example of what terrorist cartels will do to diversify their revenue streams and finance operations,\" in a statement provided to CBS News, crediting NCTC analysts with tracking Aguilar's patterns and locations, then coordinating with U.S. intelligence and Mexican partners on the ground.",
      "Senior intelligence officials say the arrest involved support from the U.S. Marshals Service, FBI El Paso, Diplomatic Security Service and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, with Mexican law enforcement executing the operation alongside \"Fiscalia Especializada en la Mujer\" or the Special Prosecutor's Office for Women. Aguilar remains in Mexican custody, according to senior intelligence officials. The investigation into the alleged trafficking ring remains ongoing.",
      "The case underscores Washington's intensified targeting of Mexican cartels in recent years.",
      "In January, President Trump signed an executive order directing the State Department to designate cartels and transnational gangs as foreign terrorist organizations, or FTOs. The State Department in February announced the designation for eight gangs, including CJNG.",
      "The capture of \"La Diabla\" marks an expansion in the application of U.S. counterterrorism policy, with intelligence elements like NCTC now actively applying counterterrorism capabilities to target not only narcotraffickers, but also human trafficking rings and terroristic violence by groups like CJNG, notorious for brutal tactics and control over swaths of Mexico's territory.",
      "Under the new FTO framing, U.S. agencies wield more expansive tools, including intelligence, sanctions, and military support to track down the cartels and their affiliates, beyond reliance on traditional criminal prosecutions. Critics of the approach have warned of overreach and unintended consequences, while proponents argue that cartels increasingly function like hybrid terrorist groups to pick up territorial control and expand trafficking networks.",
      "According to NCTC, U.S. intelligence has added over 21,000 cartel members and associates into their classified terrorist database, creating over 35,000 identities related to the newly designated foreign terrorist organizations. Last month, the agency stated that 6,525 terrorists have been denied entry into the United States since the beginning of the Trump administration.",

      "Damian pointed out that while the consumers may have been disappointed by the chocolates' unwrapped appearances, the candies were not \"so flawed as to render them worthless.\" In other words, the chocolate still tasted like chocolate, even if they weren't as haunting as the purchasers had expected from the packaging.",
      "The lawsuit focused on several Hershey candies that are marketed around Halloween, including its Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins and its Reese's White Ghost, as well as a few other holiday-themed chocolates like its Reese's Peanut Butter Shapes Assortment Snowmen Stockings Bells.",

      "Pink meanie jellyfish, or\u00a0Drymonema\u00a0larsoni,\u00a0can grow to have 70-foot tentacles and can weigh more than 50 pounds, Tunnell said. The common name comes from their bright color. Tunnell said the jellyfish \"look like floating cotton candy in the water,\" but noted that they tend to lose their color if they wash up on the shore, making them harder for beachcombers to identify.",

    "summary": "The Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" spending and tax law will result in cuts to food stamp benefits for many Americans, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people who receive food stamps could soon see smaller benefits or even get kicked out of the program due to changes that are starting to roll out from the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, according to several analyses from the federal government and public policy think tanks.",
      "About 2.4 million people, or about 6% of enrollees, could lose access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), in an average month, because of the new law's changes, which include stricter work requirements, the Congressional Budget Office estimated last month.",
      "Millions more will see their monthly benefit amounts shrink because of other changes mandated by the law, such as a new restrictions on how an individual's benefits are calculated, it added. The total pool of people who will either be cut off from SNAP or see smaller monthly benefits could reach 22.3 million U.S. families, according to a July analysis from the Urban Institute.",
      "About 42 million individuals in 22.3 million households received food stamps in 2023, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report on the program.",
      "While SNAP is funded by the USDA, every U.S. state is in charge of administering the program to its residents, with those administrative costs split between the federal and state governments. Some states are already beginning to implement some of the new law's food stamp restrictions, such as Pennsylvania, which is mandating the stricter work rules starting Nov. 1.",
      "The changes are arriving at a precarious time for many, with grocery costs continuing to rise and poverty rates inching higher for senior citizens and Black Americans, according to new Census data. Anti-hunger advocates warn that reduced SNAP benefits could worsen food insecurity, undermining one of the nation's most effective safety nets credited with lifting 3.6 million people out of poverty last year, according to U.S. Census data.",
      "\"We are deeply concerned that the cuts to SNAP will lead to an increase in hunger,\" Carolyn Vega, associate director of policy analysis for Share Our Strength, an anti-hunger nonprofit, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You are looking at households that don't have a lot of extra wiggle room in their budget, so that makes every SNAP dollar very precious in extending that food budget.\"",
      "Tracking the impact of those SNAP cuts on food insecurity as the changes unfurl over the coming months and years may be difficult, given the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Sept. 20 announcement that it is halting its annual Household Food Security Report, which measures whether American families have access to healthy food.",
      "The USDA said it is nixing the report because it is \"redundant, costly, politicized and extraneous\" and leads to \"fear mongering.\" But anti-hunger advocates say scrapping the report could ultimately obscure the impact of the Republicans' cuts to the food stamp program.",
      "\"I don't see how it's redundant \u2014 the USDA puts out the only report on food insecurity,\" Vega said. \"It just indicates to me that they don't want to see the results of the reconciliation bill,\" referring to the Republican's \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law.",
      "The USDA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about that claim.",
      "New work requirements",
      "New work requirements for SNAP recipients are taking effect as the labor market stalls, raising the risk that more people could lose access to food stamps under the stricter rules mandated by the Republican law, advocates say.",
      "\"It's a tough workforce right now, and the work requirements come without any support,\" Gina Plata-Nino, a food stamp expert at the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our most vulnerable will have even less access to resources.\"",
      "The new work rules expand what the federal government considers so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, who are adults without young children who must prove they are either working, volunteering or engaged in an education or training program for at least 20 hours a week to qualify for food stamps.",
      "Previously, the work requirements only applied to people between 18 to 54 years old, but the new law pushes that to age 64. Additionally, people who are former foster youth between 18 to 24 years old, veterans or homeless are no longer exempt from the work requirements, as they were previously.",
      "People who don't meet the work requirements will be limited to receiving food stamps for three months within a three-year period.",
      "\"Just off the bat, those are veterans, youths aging out of foster care \u2014 think about what it means to be unhoused, trying to get a job when you don't have a place to shower,\" Plata-Nino said. \"Again, these populations are going to be worse off.\"",
      "Work requirements have been championed by Republican lawmakers because they say the rules encourage people to be gainfully employed or engaged in the community in exchange for food aid.",
      "But anti-hunger advocates argue the rules often bump people off the program because they may face difficulties in filing paperwork. Others point out that low-income workers may struggle to get enough hours from their employers to meet the new federal requirements, especially given the proliferation of \"just in time\" scheduling, which slots workers into short shifts to reduce costs for employers.",
      "Prior to the changes, most SNAP recipients who were required to work were doing so, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Stricter aid calculations",
      "Under the new GOP tax and spending law, there are other changes going into the SNAP program that could reduce benefits for millions.",
      "For instance, SNAP applicants can deduct their utility costs from their incomes when calculating their benefits, which can help to increase their food-stamp allotments. But the new law now prevents food-stamp recipients from counting internet expenses as part of their household costs when determining benefits. That change went into effect as soon as the law was signed on July 4 by President Trump.",
      "\"Roughly 65% of participating households will see their benefit drop by an average of $10 a month\" because of the exclusion in using internet costs to calculate benefits, Vega said.",
      "\"It's a relatively small amount but for a household facing rising grocery cost and facing tough decisions, $10 can make a difference,\" she added.",
      "Longer-term, there are additional changes that could strain states' ability to provide food stamps, such as a shift in fiscal year 2027 requiring that states cover 75% of administrative costs, up from 50% now. Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, states with high error rates \u2014 such as over- and underpayments of SNAP benefits \u2014 will also need to provide more funding for the program, starting in 2028.",
      "One concern, according to Vega, is whether states will have the financial resources to cover those additional costs.",
      "\"It's uncharted territory,\" she said. \"We do worry some states might decide they can't take that level of liability and won't participate in SNAP.\"",

    "summary": "Jimmy Kimmel returned to his late-night show just less than a week after network broadcaster ABC pulled \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" over remarks he made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
    "story": [
      "Jimmy Kimmel returned to his long-running late-night show Tuesday, less than a week after network broadcaster ABC pulled \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" over remarks he made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "\"It's been overwhelming ... I've heard from all the people in the world over the last six days,\" Kimmel joked to open his monologue, going on to thank all those who came out in his defense, including conservatives.",
      "\"Most of all, I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,\" Kimmel said. \"I never would have imagined that Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, even my old pal Ted Cruz, who believe it or not said something very beautiful on my behalf. It takes courage for them to speak out against this administration. They did and they deserve credit for it.\"",
      "The Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, had announced Monday that Kimmel would return to the air.",
      "It followed a political and media firestorm that began after the comedian addressed Kirk's slaying in a Sept. 15 monologue, saying: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"",
      "An emotional Kimmel on Tuesday said, \"It's important to me as a human, and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man. I don't think there's anything funny about it,\" noting that he had taken to social media following Kirk's killing to send his condolences to Kirk's family.",
      "Kimmel didn't issue a blanket apology for his monologue remarks last week, but said he understood how it was offensive to some.",
      "\"Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what was obviously a deeply disturbed individual,\" Kimmel said of the suspected gunman. \"That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make. But I understand that to some, that felt either ill-timed or unclear, or maybe both. And for those who think I did, point a finger, I get why you're upset. If the situation was reversed, there's a good chance I'd have felt the same way.\"",
      "Kimmel gave a brief explanation for what took place behind the scenes between himself and ABC's brass.",
      "\"I was not happy when they pulled me off the air on Wednesday,\" Kimmel said. \"I did not agree with that decision, and I told them that, and we had many conversations. I shared my point of view, they shared theirs. We talked it through, and at the end, even though they didn't have to, they really didn't have to, this is a giant company \u2026 they welcomed me back on the air.\"",
      "On Tuesday night, before the show aired on the East Coast, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, \"I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled!\"",
      "He went on, \"I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars,\" Mr. Trump said in reference to his defamation lawsuit last year against ABC News over remarks made by anchor George Stephanopoulos, which the network settled in December by agreeing to contribute $15 million to Mr. Trump's presidential foundation and museum, and another $1 million toward Mr. Trump's legal fees.",
      "\"This one sounds even more lucrative,\" Mr. Trump wrote Tuesday. \"A true bunch of losers!\"",
      "Kimmel told his audience Tuesday that the president \"made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs. Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can't take a joke.\"",
      "\"One thing I did learn from Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and Howard Stern, is that a government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn't like, is anti-American,\" he added.",
      "In a Sept. 17 interview with right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr called Kimmel's remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" and said there was a \"path forward for suspension over this.\"",
      "\"The FCC is going to have remedies we could look at,\" Carr told Johnson. \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"",
      "Within hours of that interview, station operator Nexstar announced it would preempt Kimmel's show over the remarks. Nexstar owns and operates more than 200 stations nationwide, including more than two dozen ABC affiliates. Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it.",
      "A Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News last week that the decision to preempt Kimmel's show was \"made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision.\"",
      "ABC later said that it was \"indefinitely\" suspending the show.",
      "Another major station owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group, also said last week that it was pulling Kimmel's show.",
      "Despite its return to ABC on Tuesday night, both Nexstar and Sinclair said they would continue to preempt Kimmel's show.",
      "Sinclair on Monday night posted a statement on X saying it will preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" across its ABC affiliate stations and will be \"replacing it with news programming\" beginning Tuesday night. \"Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,\" Sinclair said.",
      "Nexstar on Tuesday said it will continue to preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and \"monitor the show as it returns to ABC.\"",
      "Regarding Carr, Kimmel on Tuesday\u00a0showed\u00a0the audience a social media post that the FCC chair wrote in May 2022 in which he said, \"Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech. It challenges those in power while using humor to draw more people in to the discussion. That's why people in influential positions have always targeted it for censorship.\"",
      "Disney on Monday did not delve into the details of what led to its decision to allow Kimmel's show to resume, only saying in a statement that the initial suspension was \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\" calling his comments \"ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"",
      "\"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,\" Disney said.",
      "The temporary removal of Kimmel's show sparked a nationwide debate over issues of free speech and censorship. Many in the Hollywood community rallied to Kimmel's side, with more than 400 celebrities \u2014 including actors Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep \u2014 signing an open letter with the American Civil Liberties Union that criticized the move as \"a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.\"",
      "Conservatives upset with Kimmel's comments about Kirk praised the decision, including President Trump, who congratulated ABC on his Truth Social platform \"for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also speculated last week whether networks that cover him negatively should have their broadcast licenses revoked.",
      "\"They give me only bad publicity or press,\" the president told reporters on Sept. 18. \"I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr.\"",
      "But one prominent conservative, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, was specifically critical of Carr's comments to Johnson.",
      "\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas,'\" Cruz said Friday on his podcast. \"That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it.'\"",
      "Kimmel's show, which launched in 2003, tapes in front of a studio audience on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. The guests for Tuesday's show included actor Glen Powell and singer Sarah McLachlan.",
      "Joe  Walsh, \n                                                  \n                                  Aimee  Picchi, \n                                                  \n                                  Kathryn  Watson and \n                                                  \n                                  Mary  Cunningham\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "A former stylist for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs \u2014 who testified against the disgraced music mogul in his federal criminal trial earlier this year \u2014 filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing Combs of sexual abuse and violence while he was in Combs' employ.",
      "The 37-page lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on behalf of Deonte Nash against Combs and Combs' label, Bad Boy Entertainment, also accuses Combs of sexual battery, human trafficking and false imprisonment.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Nash said he was hired to be Combs' stylist around 2008, at the age of 21, and worked for him until about 2018. Nash said that during that time period, he also worked as a stylist and creative director for Combs' then-girlfriend, R&B singer Cassandra Ventura, who also accused Combs of sexual abuse in a 2023 lawsuit and gave graphic testimony against him in his trial.",
      "\"Nash personally experienced sexual, physical, mental, and emotional abuse at the hands of Defendants during his ten-year employment,\" including \"forced tests of loyalty and manipulation, sexual harassment and sexual assaults, physical violence and manhandling, labor trafficking, threats of harm, and threats of death,\" the lawsuit against Combs reads.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that Nash was sexually assaulted by Combs on \"multiple occasions.\"",
      "Nash said the alleged abuse prompted him to resign in 2018, but Combs \"continued to threaten Mr. Nash after his employment ended.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Combs' attorneys for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "In one incident that Nash claims occurred in 2013 or 2014, Combs discovered that Nash and Ventura had gone out to dinner in L.A. without Combs' permission. The following day, the lawsuit states, Combs \"threw\" Nash \"onto the car and violently strangled him.\"",
      "On another occasion in 2014, Combs and his security team allegedly entered Nash's home without permission, during which they \"confiscated Mr. Nash's keys and phone while they forcibly searched the house\" for Ventura, the lawsuit says.",
      "\"After enduring years of abuse, I finally found the courage during the criminal trial, and I am now ready to take action,\" Nash said in a statement. \"Sean Combs has never taken accountability for the years of harm he inflicted on me and so many others.\"",
      "In July, following a lengthy trial, the 55-year-old Combs was found guilty of two counts of prostitution-related charges, but acquitted on more serious charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.",
      "He is\u00a0scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 3.",
      "During the trial, Ventura testified that she was repeatedly physically and sexually abused by Combs over the course of their relationship. She testified about a 2016 incident, which was caught on\u00a0surveillance video, that showed Combs violently assaulting her in the hallway of a California hotel.",
      "Nash also testified in the trial that Combs threatened Ventura and that he \"would beat her.\"",
      "Nash testified about a time when Combs allegedly grabbed a sleeping Ventura by the hair and started hitting her \"pretty hard.\" Nash said Ventura's head hit a bed frame and started bleeding, and Combs then told her, Nash and an assistant, \"Look what y'all made me do.\"",
      "Nash testified he dialed 911 but was told to hang up. He said he feared retaliation but did tell some of Combs' employees about the alleged abuse and told jurors Combs got physical with him a few times.",
      "During the trial,\u00a0Combs' attorneys denied the sexual abuse allegations brought by Ventura against their client, and argued that while evidence showed Combs may have lived a party lifestyle, they claimed he did not engage in racketeering conspiracy or sex trafficking.",
      "Nash's lawsuit seeks both compensatory and punitive damages and demands a jury trial.",

      "A Florida jury on Tuesday found Ryan Routh guilty of an assassination attempt against then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.",
      "Routh represented himself in the trial. He was found guilty of all five charges, which included attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate and assaulting a federal officer.",
      "Routh was arrested in September 2024 at Mr. Trump's golf course. A Secret Service agent testified last week that he spotted Routh before the then-presidential candidate came into view. Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot, the agent said.",
      "After the verdict was read, Routh apparently tried to harm himself, possibly using a pen that was on his desk, to stab himself in the neck. His daughter cried out during the incident and U.S. marshals eventually tackled him.",
      "It was the second assassination attempt against Mr. Trump in 2024, after shots were fired in a separate incident at a Pennsylvania rally. A bullet grazed Mr. Trump's ear in that incident.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that the guilty verdict against Routh \"illustrates the Department of Justice's commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence,\" and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the verdict sends \"a clear message\" that an \"attempt to assassinate a presidential candidate is an attack on our Republic and on the rights of every citizen.\"",
      "A federal district judge will determine his sentence. He faces life in prison.",
      "In a nearly hourlong closing argument on Tuesday, Routh said that there was no intent to kill because the trigger was never pulled, the gun was never fired and that no one was hurt, so \"no crime.\"",
      "\"I wanted to kill, my actions within the community and toward my co-workers and family should show my obvious non-violence and gentleness,\" Routh said. Speaking about himself in the third person, he said the shooting was never going to happen because it was \"never in his heart.\"",
      "But prosecutors said Routh spent weeks plotting to kill Mr. Trump, who was then running for president. Prosecutors laid out Routh's actions ahead of the incident, saying \"those aren'tcoincidences \u2026 that's a plan,\" prosecutor Christopher Brown said in his closing argument.",
      "\"He had a loaded round in the chamber and the safety off,\" Brown said. \"We don't have to prove motive, but you already have it. You only have to decide intent.\"",
      "Prosecutors also alleged in court filings that Routh attempted to acquire an anti-aircraft weapon to shoot down Mr. Trump's plane.",
      "Routh had initially submitted a witness list that included Mr. Trump, as well as Columbia activists Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi \u2014 to whom his connections are unclear \u2014 and several prominent authors. Judge Aileen Canon had rejected many of these potential witnesses.",

Challenges must be made by a pitcher, catcher or batter \u2014 signaled by tapping their helmet or cap \u2014 and a team retains its challenge if successful. Reviews will be shown as digital graphics on outfield videoboards.",
      "Adding the robot umps is likely to cut down on ejections. MLB said 61.5% of ejections among players, managers and coaches last year were related to balls and strikes, as were 60.3% this season through Sunday. The figures include ejections for derogatory comments, throwing equipment while protesting calls and inappropriate conduct.",

The independent Atlantic League trialed the system at its 2019 All-Star Game and MLB installed the technology for that year's Arizona Fall League of top prospects. The ABS was tried at eight of nine ballparks of the Low-A Southeast League in 2021, then moved up to Triple-A in 2022.",
      "In 2019, Fred DeJesus became the first umpire in a regular-season game to use ABS. He remembers the first pitch he tested \u2013 it was a strike \u2013 and how he was hesitant about the new technology at first.",
      "\"Initially, it was like, no way, we're not doing this. I spent way too much money trying to learn the craft of calling balls and strikes,\" he told CBS News in 2021.",

Currently, it calls strikes solely based on where the ball crosses the midpoint of the plate, 8.5 inches from the front and the back. The top of the strike zone is 53.5% of batter height and the bottom 27%.",
      "This will be MLB's first major rule change since sweeping adjustments in 2024. Those included a pitch clock, restrictions on defensive shifts, pitcher disengagements such as pickoff attempts and larger bases.",
      "The challenge system introduces ABS without eliminating pitch framing, a subtle art where catchers use their body and glove to try making borderline pitches look like strikes. Framing has become a critical skill for big league catchers. While there was concern that full-blown ABS would make some strong defensive catchers obsolete, not everyone considers the skill a good thing.",
      "\"The idea that people get paid for cheating, for stealing strikes, for moving a pitch that's not a strike into the zone to fool the official and make it a strike is beyond my comprehension,\" former manager Bobby Valentine said.",

      "Ryan Routh declined to testify Monday while on trial for allegedly attempting to assassinate President Trump at his Florida golf club last year.",
      "Routh \u2014 who is representing himself \u2014 rested his case after questioning three witnesses earlier Monday: a firearms expert and two character witnesses. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon asked if Routh wanted to testify himself, and he said no. Closing arguments are slated for Tuesday, and jurors will deliberate after that.",
      "Routh has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations. It was the second assassination attempt against Mr. Trump during last year's campaign, following a shooting at a rally in Pennsylvania in July 2024 in which a bullet grazed Mr. Trump's ear.",
      "Prosecutors have said Routh spent weeks plotting to kill Trump before aiming a rifle through shrubbery as Mr. Trump played golf on September 2024, at his golf club in West Palm Beach. A Secret Service agent testified last week that he spotted Routh before the then-presidential candidate came into view. Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot, the agent said.",
      "Under questioning from Routh on Monday, firearms expert Michael McClay\u2014 a former Marine sniper and former Honolulu police officer \u2014 testified that Routh would have been able to have a view of the sixth green of the golf course, where he was allegedly hiding in the bushes. McClay testified that he had also tested Routh's firearm for the trial, and a court permitted him to fire two shots as part of the test. However, McClay said that the second shot attempt jammed during the test, suggesting that Routh would have been unable to get off multiple shots.",
      "McClay also testified that a scope found at the scene had been mounted to the firearm by tape and glue, which likely would have made it ineffective.",
      "During cross-examination, federal prosecutors made the point that investigators would have used corrosive acid to retrieve the gun's serial number, and nobody performed maintenance on the gun for months after that, so the metal may have rusted, causing it to operate less effectively.",
      "The two character witnesses, a former employee and a friend of Routh's son, testified that Routh was a peaceful man, but they conceded under cross examination that they hadn't seen the suspect in years. Routh questioned his son's friend for about 10 minutes, but the judge shut it down after Routh asked, \"would you be willing to go to Taiwan with me and host a music festival?\" Both character witnesses were cross-examined by prosecutors.",
      "Prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida rested their case Friday afternoon after spending seven days questioning 38 witnesses in an attempt to make sure Routh spends the rest of his life in prison.",
      "Cannon signed off on Routh's request to represent himself following two hearings in July. Routh told the judge that his court-appointed federal public defenders were diligent, but they didn't listen to him and were afraid of him.",
      "\"How are they supposed to represent me and say I'm not a dangerous person when they don't believe that?\" Routh said in July.",
      "The Supreme Court has held that criminal defendants have a right to represent themselves in court proceedings, as long as they can show a judge they are competent to waive their right to be defended by an attorney. Routh's former defense attorneys have served as standby counsel since Routh took over his own defense and have been present during trial the past two weeks.",
      "Cannon said attorneys should be prepared to deliver their closing arguments Tuesday, giving each side one hour and 45 minutes. Cannon had initially blocked off more than three weeks for the trial at the Fort Pierce federal courthouse, but Routh's relatively short cross-examinations and defense presentation have led to a quicker pace than anticipated.",
      "Routh was a North Carolina construction worker who in recent years had moved to Hawaii. A self-styled mercenary leader, Routh spoke out to anyone who would listen about his dangerous, sometimes violent plans to insert himself into conflicts around the world, witnesses have told The Associated Press.",
      "In the early days of the war in Ukraine, Routh tried to recruit soldiers from Afghanistan, Moldova and Taiwan to fight the Russians. In his native Greensboro, North Carolina, he was arrested in 2002 for eluding a traffic stop and barricading himself from officers with a fully automatic machine gun and a \"weapon of mass destruction,\" which turned out to be an explosive with a 10-inch (25-centimeter) fuse, police said.",
      "In 2010, police searched a warehouse Routh owned and found more than 100 stolen items, from power tools and building supplies to kayaks and spa tubs. In both felony cases, judges gave Routh either probation or a suspended sentence.",
      "In addition to the federal charges, Routh also has pleaded not guilty to state charges of terrorism and attempted murder.",
      "Two other people were accused of selling Routh the rifle he allegedly brought to Mr. Trump's golf course, though both told law enforcement they did not have any advance knowledge of Routh's alleged plans.",
      "One of those defendants has pleaded guilty to firearm trafficking, and the other pleaded guilty to possessing an unregistered firearm after police found a short-barreled shotgun in his storage building.",

    "summary": "As President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. raise concerns about autism and the use of Tylenol by pregnant women, here's what medical research shows.",
    "story": [
      "As President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0prepared to announce that they believe the use of acetaminophen \u2014 the active ingredient in Tylenol \u2014 by pregnant women may be linked to autism in children, many top medical experts in the field stressed that scientific evidence does not support such a claim.",
      "The administration's announcement\u00a0came after Kennedy said in April that HHS would undertake a \"massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism. Kennedy at the time said the plan was to release a comprehensive report in September. However, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said later that month the findings could take up to a year.",
      "Kennedy has in the past made the unfounded claim that autism is a \"preventable disease,\" drawing heavy criticism from many medical experts, who say evidence shows there are multiple factors, including genetics, that play a role.",
      "Plans for the announcement were first reported by the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0and \u00a0Washington Post.",
      "What does Tylenol maker Kenvue say about autism?",
      "In response to the WSJ report on Sept. 5, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol \u2014 whose active ingredient is acetaminophen \u2014 said: \"We have continuously evaluated the science and continue to believe there is no causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and leading medical organizations agree on the safety of acetaminophen, its use during pregnancy, and the information provided on the label.\"",
      "Kenvue added, \"We appreciate the Secretary acknowledging media coverage on the upcoming HHS report is 'nothing more than speculation.'\"",
      "In another statement on Sept. 21, the company said:",
      "\"We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.",
      "Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy. Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives.",
      "The facts are that over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators, confirms there is no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism. We stand with the many public health and medical professionals who have reviewed this science and agree. We will continue to explore all options to protect the health interests of American women and children.\"",
      "What do medical experts say?",
      "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement provided to CBS News that \"there is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues.\"",
      "\"Neurodevelopmental disorders, in particular, are multifactorial and very difficult to associate with a singular cause,\" ACOG said. \"Pregnant patients should not be frightened away from the many benefits of acetaminophen, which is safe and one of the few options pregnant people have for pain relief.\"",
      "Dr. Christopher Zahn, ACOG's chief of clinical practice, said, \"Pregnant patients should not be frightened away from the many benefits of acetaminophen, which is safe and one of the few options pregnant people have for pain relief.\"",
      "\"If you have a high fever during pregnancy, that can cause neurodevelopment issues in the baby, so you don't want to let that fever go untreated,\" said Dr. C\u00e9line Goudner, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. She said pregnant women should talk with their OB-GYN, especially if they're needing it frequently, and use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time.",
      "While some research suggested there could be a possible association between acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders, those studies involved relatively small groups and did not prove a link. Larger and more robust studies have\u00a0found no connection\u00a0between acetaminophen and autism.",
      "\"I spoke this afternoon to a researcher who was part of a\u00a0major study\u00a0published just last year that followed 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years,\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said after the WSJ report came out. \"He said use of acetaminophen ... was not associated with an increased risk of autism in children.\"",
      "LaPook said he is looking forward to reading the upcoming report pledged by Kennedy, \"especially the evidence behind any conclusions and recommendations.\"",
      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years, according to\u00a0statistics compiled\u00a0by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But there is no scientific consensus on the reasons why.",
      "Research shows the causes of autism \"are complex,\" Dr. Christine Ladd-Acosta, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the vice director for the Wendy Klag Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities, told CBS News in an interview.",
      "\"There have been a few dozen studies looking at Tylenol and whether use during pregnancy is associated with risk of autism in those women's children, and the evidence has been really kind of conflicting,\" Ladd-Acosta said. \"Some studies have shown no association. Some have shown a positive association. Some have shown negative associations. And I think part of that is because it's really hard to tease apart ... whether it's the medication itself that is influencing autism risk in the child, or if it has to do with the condition ... the mother is using the medicine to treat that is the thing that is important in autism risk.\"",
      "Ladd-Acosta noted that the dosage, the length of time that pregnant women take Tylenol, and the \"specific condition\" they are taking it for are all factors that have been considered when attempting to determine if there is a potential association between the medication and autism.",
      "\"There have been some associations, but there has been no conclusive evidence I've seen to show that Tylenol itself causes autism definitively,\" Ladd-Acosta said.",

    "summary": "Trump administration figures have vowed to pursue anyone who mocks or celebrates Kirk's death, alarming First Amendment advocates.",
    "story": [
      "In the week since conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated at a Utah university event, comments from some of his critics have ignited a battle over free speech in an increasingly polarized nation.",
      "Kirk, who routinely debated progressive students at his Turning Point USA events and espoused controversial opinions on his podcast, was a stalwart proponent of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Hate speech does not exist legally in America,\" he wrote on X last year. \"There's ugly speech. There's gross speech. There's evil speech. And ALL of it is protected by the First Amendment.\"",
      "But over the last several days, the administration he supported and the president he helped reelect have vowed to crack down on some speech about his death.",
      "Last week, Pentagon officials promised to \"address\" federal employees who mock or celebrate Kirk's death. And the State Department said it would\u00a0revoke visas\u00a0over social posts that \"celebrate\" Kirk's death.",
      "On Monday, Sept. 15, Vice President JD Vance hosted Kirk's podcast and encouraged listeners to call the employers of anyone \"celebrating Charlie's murder.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday said people who post \"hate speech\" should be \"shut down\" and suggested that the Trump administration would pursue people who engage in hate speech.",
      "\"There's free speech, and then there's hate speech,\" Bondi said in an\u00a0interview. \"We will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.\" The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld free speech rights, even if it is hate speech. She later said on X that \"hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected.\" The Justice Department referred CBS News to Bondi's comments when asked whether the administration considers celebrations of Kirk's assassination as threats of violence.",
      "\"Democrat critics are lying about the Administration's actions \u2014 this effort will target those committing criminal acts and hold them accountable,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Asked about Bondi's remarks, President Trump told ABC News' Jonathan Karl on Tuesday: \"We'll probably go after people like you because you treat me so unfairly; it's hate.\"",
      "Kimmel taken off air",
      "Late Wednesday, Sept. 17, ABC announced it would \"indefinitely\" pre-empt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" after Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr said the network should \"take action\" for the comedian's suggestion that Kirk's alleged killer is a Trump supporter. ABC's move came after station owners Nexstar and Sinclair said they were pulling the show indefinitely. Carr thanked Nexstar and Sinclair for taking action.",
      "Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the FCC to approve it. Nexstar told CBS News in a statement it made the decision to pre-empt Kimmel \"unilaterally\" and did not consult with the FCC beforehand.",
      "On Truth Social, Mr. Trump referred to it as a cancellation and congratulated ABC for \"finally having the courage to do what had to be done,\" and added: \"That leaves Jimmy [Fallon] and Seth [Meyers], two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!!\"",
      "Anna Gomez, one of two FCC commissioners working with Carr and the lone Democrat on the commission, called Kimmel's penalty a dangerous new precedent.",
      "\"This administration is increasingly using the weight of government power to suppress lawful expression, not because it glorifies violence or breaks the law, but because it challenges those in power and reflects views they oppose,\" she said on CNN.",
      "In a statement the following day, she added: \"This FCC does not have the authority, the ability, or the constitutional right to police content or punish broadcasters for speech the government dislikes. \u2026 Free speech is the foundation of our democracy, and we must push back against any attempt to erode it.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, also criticized the move.",
      "\"When the head of the FCC is talking openly about taking away the broadcast license, then that is the government trying to exercise censorship. It's not a question of whether you agree with Mr. Kimmel or disagree with Mr. Kimmel. The point is one of the government not coming in and making decisions about whose speech gets heard,\" she said, adding, \"Everyone should care, no matter what your political view is.\"",
      "After nearly a week of controversy, Disney said Kimmel's show would return on Tuesday, Sept. 23. The company said some of the host's comments were \"ill-timed and thus insensitive,\" but after several days of \"thoughtful conversations with Jimmy ... we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.\"",
      "The First Amendment and hateful speech",
      "In general, the First Amendment \u2014 which bars the government from \"abridging the freedom of speech\" \u2014 protects most forms of hateful speech, aside from a narrow set of exceptions that include threats of violence and incitement.",
      "Bondi's initial comments about hate speech stood out among those made by administration officials because of her position as the nation's top prosecutor, said Adam Goldstein, vice president of strategic initiatives at the nonprofit Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.",
      "\"I especially don't want to see an attorney in charge of the Justice Department saying that,\" he said. \"It's the kind of thing that would get you a bad grade in your constitutional law class.\"",
      "Jenin Younes, a First Amendment attorney who worked on a case accusing the Biden administration of social media censorship, told CBS News, \"These are all the same people who were railing against cancel culture and the idea of hate speech just a few years ago, when it was the left doing it.\"",
      "\"The worry is that lawmakers will just define hate speech to mean anything the opposite party says, and so that's why the court has said it's not up to the government to decide what's within the bounds of acceptable discourse and what's not,\" Genevieve Lakier, a University of Chicago law professor, told CBS News. \"There's no definition of hate speech, because the whole point is there's no neutral definition of hate speech.\"",
      "In most cases, Lakier said, \"simply saying 'he had it coming' \u2026 does not fit the very, very, very narrow definition of incitement that is available in the case law.\"",
      "Are offensive comments illegal?",
      "First Amendment legal scholar Eugene Volokh told CBS News that, in most circumstances, the government cannot go after ordinary people for making insensitive or offensive public comments about Kirk's killing.",
      "\"It may be in bad taste. It may be bad for the country when people are trying to normalize political violence. But it is protected by the First Amendment,\" said Volokh, a professor emeritus of law at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "\"I would say it's basically prohibited for the government to say you can't mock or make fun of or even celebrate his death,\" said Younes, who currently serves as national legal director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.",
      "Volokh says comments like Bondi's \"are likely to further confuse people, whether citizens or law enforcement or others, about what's protected and what's not protected.\"",
      "\"I think they may also kind of send a message that we are going to try to find a way of punishing this speech,\" Volokh added.",
      "Bondi also said the Justice Department could prosecute businesses that refuse to print photos of Kirk for customers, citing a worker at an Office Depot who declined to print flyers for a Kirk vigil. Office Depot called the incident \"completely unacceptable\" and said the staff member no longer works for the company.",
      "\"There is no federal law that prohibits copy shops or print shops from discriminating based on the content of the message,\" Volokh said.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said Bondi was solely referencing the Office Depot incident, which the department's civil rights division looked into.",
      "Less clear, according to legal experts, is whether the federal government can deport non-citizens or revoke their visas over their views on Kirk, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio has floated. Volokh says the laws around this are \"unsettled.\"",
      "\"While it is true that the executive's power when it comes to immigration is very vast, I think the First Amendment constrains it,\" Younes said. She pointed to the Trump administration's attempts to remove students for participating in pro-Palestinian protests, which have been met with pushback at the district court level.",
      "What can private companies do?",
      "The First Amendment doesn't stop private employers from choosing to fire people for speech, though some states like California have their own legal protections.",
      "However, in some cases, it can be illegal for the government to use its power to pressure a private company into firing a staff member \u2014 a concept known as \"jawboning.\"",
      "Government officials can try to persuade private companies to take a certain action, according to Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, but they cannot coerce companies by making threats.",
      "Volokh said it likely doesn't qualify as jawboning if elected officials merely express the view that people should be fired, as long as they don't cross the line into threatening to take action. For example, on Vance's call for people to contact the employers of anybody who celebrates Kirk's death, Volokh said, \"it's hard to see that as unconstitutional.\"",
      "\"You would have to show the private employer didn't want to fire you, but they were just acting because they were afraid of some kind of repercussions from the government,\" noted Younes.",
      "There's a fine line between broadly encouraging companies to fire employees who praised Kirk's assassination, and giving instructions to specific firms, according to Goldstein. He pointed to a contrast between Vance's comments advising podcasts listeners to call people's employers, and a tweet by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.",
      "Duffy praised American Airlines, United and Delta for suspending employees, and wrote, \"The next step should be to fire them.\"",
      "\"A rational airline who sees this message might feel some coercive effect on their decision making,\" said Goldstein, noting Duffy's power over the airline industry.",
      "Lakier said it's not a violation of the First Amendment if a company fires an employee of their own volition. But, she said, \"the problem is, in many of these cases, it's going to be because of political sympathy.\"",
      "\"The employers who are firing them, maybe implicitly fear that if they don't, they're going to face the government's wrath or they want to curry favor by firing,\" she said.",
      "In general, however, \"If we're talking about private companies and you are an at-will employee, then that means exactly as it sounds like, which is that an employer can fire you at will,\" said CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School.",
      "Government workers have some free speech protections, but it's complicated",
      "In many cases, Trump allies have spotlighted public employees who criticize Kirk.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called celebrations of Kirk's death by service members or civilian workers \"unacceptable\" last week, and said the Pentagon is \"tracking\" them. Since then, at least one Marine officer has been relieved of his recruiting duties pending an investigation into his post about Kirk, and two Army officers have been suspended pending a review into their posts, according to a Marine official and an Army official.",
      "A Secret Service agent who expressed negative opinions about Kirk on Facebook was also placed on leave last week.",
      "At the state level, Oklahoma's top education official has said teachers who celebrate Kirk's assassination \"will be banned from teaching,\" and teachers in several other states have been investigated or placed on leave over their comments. Others have pushed for action against employees at public colleges like Clemson University.",
      "People who work for the government have some free speech protections, especially for speech that they make while off the clock, legal experts say.",
      "\"Government employees do have First Amendment rights of freedom of speech,\" said Calvert. \"However, those rights are not unlimited and may be restricted if the employee's speech somehow interferes with the ability of the employer \u2026 to effectively and efficiently deliver its services to the public.\"",
      "Calvert said \"every case is going to be unique.\"",
      "Prior court rulings have established several factors for assessing the speech rights of government employees, according to Calvert and Volokh. Those include whether the worker spoke in their personal capacity, whether it relates to a matter of public concern and whether the worker's right to speak out outweighs the government's interest in delivering its services.",
      "But the military is a slightly separate case, according to Volokh, because \"there are more restrictions that are permissible on service members' speech.\"",
      "Volokh said the military is different \"in part because of a sense that \u2026 this is an environment where discipline is really important, where self-discipline is really important, where unit cohesion is really important, where commitment to the right ideas is very important.\"",
      "\"It's going very, very far\"",
      "Some First Amendment advocates are uncomfortable with vocal calls for people to be fired \u2014 even if they don't run afoul of the Constitution.",
      "\"It's going very, very far. This is not being limited to people saying, 'I'm glad Charlie Kirk is dead and I wish everyone like him was dead, too,'\" Younes said. \"It's being applied to people who just are saying they didn't like Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "Goldstein said that some officials may be understandably lashing out after the death of their friend, but particularly in the context of Kirk's career as free speech advocate, the reaction has gone too far.",
      "\"What a weird way to react in memory of Charlie Kirk, who was known for listening to people and disagreeing with them, and moving on,\" Goldstein said.",
      "Graham  Kates, \n                                                  \n                                  Eleanor  Watson, \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen and \n                                                  \n                      Alan  He\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "The Israeli Foreign Ministry has accused organizers of being linked to Hamas, an accusation organizers reject. Israel has proposed that the activists unload their aid in the Israeli port of Ashkelon for it to be transported into Gaza, saying it will not accept any breach of its blockade.",
      "Italy condemned the attack and activated a navy frigate to be on hand for possible rescue operations, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said. Crosetto said the Italian Navy's frigate Fasan, which was sailing north of Crete, was \"already heading towards the area for possible rescue operations.\" Italy has informed Israel about the decision.",
      "\"In a democracy, demonstrations and forms of protest must also be protected when they are carried out in accordance with international law and without resorting to violence,\" Crosetto said.",
      "Italy's Foreign Ministry meanwhile said its computer systems had been overwhelmed by a \"mail bombing\" campaign in which thousands of what it said were fake emails flooded its servers after the attack on the flotilla.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, the Global Sumud Flotilla had sent out an urgent appeal to its supporters asking them to email the ministry demanding it take a firm position to condemn the attack on the flotilla, protect the participants and put diplomatic pressure on those responsible.",
      "The emails \"had the effect of hindering the work\" of the ministry's crisis unit, which has been the main point of contact for Italian citizens aboard the flotilla, the foreign ministry said in a statement.",
      "Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told lawmakers earlier this month he had personally called Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar to urge Israel to respect the rights of Italian activists participating in the flotilla.",
      "Tajani said at the time that 58 Italians were in the flotilla, including some lawmakers.",
      "The European Union also warned against any use of force.",
      "\"The freedom of navigation under international law must be upheld,\" said Eva Hrncirova, a European Commission spokesperson.",

      "Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who is on board one of the boats, called the strikes a \"scare tactic\" and implored the flotilla's supporters to stay focused on Gaza rather than on the activists.",
      "\"We were aware of the risks of these kind of attacks and that's not something that's going to stop us,\" Thunberg said on a livestream. \"The most important thing isn't that we were hit by drones. Drones are something that Palestinians experience 24-7.\"",
      "Italian activist Simone Zambrin said drones \"have been flying over our heads for days now\" and on Wednesday \"dropped devices at our boats, damaging both the sails and the hearing of some of our crew members.\"",
      "She said Israel was trying \"to instill fear because it is afraid of our arrival.\"",
      "Greg Stoker, an American activist on board one of the boats, said in a social media post that the vessel's radio communications also suffered interference, with the jammers playing an ABBA song over the radio channel the flotilla was using.",
      "The flotilla has reported several attacks since it set sail from Spain on Sept. 1, including two while some of its boats were in Tunisian waters.",
      "Activists say it's the largest attempt to date to break the Israeli maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has now lasted 18 years, long predating the current war in Gaza. Israel says the blockade is needed to prevent Hamas from importing arms, while critics consider it collective punishment.",
      "The almost two-year war has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The ministry does not say how many were civilians or combatants, but says around half were women and children.",
      "The world's leading authority on hunger crises said last month that Israel's blockade and ongoing offensive had already pushed Gaza City into famine. More than 300,000 people have fled the city in recent weeks as Israel has ordered the population to move south, but an estimated 700,000 remain, according to U.N. agencies and aid groups.",
      "The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel and killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took 251 others hostage. Israel says its operation in Gaza is aimed at pressuring Hamas to surrender and return the remaining 48 hostages, about 20 of whom Israel believes are still alive. Most of the rest were released in ceasefires or other deals.",
      "Activists have launched several flotillas aimed at breaking the blockade over the years, and nearly all of them intercepted by Israeli forces. The crew of another vessel said they were attacked by drones in May in international waters off Malta. An overland convoy traveling across North Africa also attempted to reach Egypt's border with the Gaza Strip, but was blocked by security forces aligned with Egypt in eastern Libya.",
      "In 2010, Israeli commandos raided the Mavi Marmara, a boat participating in an aid flotilla attempting to breach the maritime blockade of Gaza, killing 10 Turkish activists in clashes on board.",

    "summary": "Kremlin spokesman shoots back at Trump's suggestion that Russia is \"a paper tiger,\" declaring: \"There are no paper bears. And Russia is a real bear.\"",
    "story": [
      "Russia pushed back Wednesday at comments made by President Trump, who disparaged Moscow's military capabilities and economy and said Ukraine could potentially recapture all of the territory seized by Russian forces since President Vladimir Putin launched the full-scale invasion over three years ago.",
      "It marked a dramatic shift in rhetoric for Mr. Trump, who has previously urged Ukraine to make concessions to end the conflict, but there was no indication that the president would also shift U.S. policy to offer more direct support for Kyiv.",
      "\"Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win. This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like 'a paper tiger,'\" Mr. Trump said in a social media post on Tuesday, shortly after he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York.",
      "\"I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form. With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act.\"",
      "\"President Trump heard about what is happening in Zelenskyy's version, and apparently, at that moment, this version became the reason for such an assessment,\" Peskov said in an interview with Russia's RBC radio Wednesday morning. \"We continue our special military operation in order to ensure our interests and achieve the goals that the supreme Commander-in-Chief Putin and the president of our country set in the very beginning.\"",
      "Peskov said Russia's \"premium markets\" were no longer in Europe, but in the East, and that the country was economically stable.",
      "\"Russia is associated with a bear. There are no paper bears. And Russia is a real bear\u2026 There is nothing paper here,\" Peskov said. \"Russia maintains macroeconomic stability. Yes, Russia is experiencing certain points of tension and problematic points in different sectors of the economy, which is inevitably connected with those myriads of economic restrictions, sanctions which we face, and so on, with the global economic disorder. This is not just sanctions. Let's not forget that the world has entered an absolutely unpredictable economic situation.\"",
      "Separately, in a briefing later on Wednesday, Peskov told journalists: \"The fact that they are trying in every way to encourage Ukraine to continue military operations, and the idea that Ukraine can recapture anything, is, in our view, a misguided proposition.\"",
      "Zelenskyy appeared Wednesday before the United Nations General Assembly, making a plea that \"we need to restore international cooperation for peace and security.\"",
      "\"People are still dying every week, yet there is no ceasefire, because Russia refuses,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "The U.S. is the most important contributor to NATO and the largest weapons supplier to Ukraine, but Mr. Trump wants America's European allies to take on more of the continent's defense burden - including supporting Ukraine. The president has, at times, echoed the Kremlin's narrative about the war, alarming NATO allies, and it was unclear whether U.S. policy on Ukraine would change after Mr. Trump's apparent rhetorical shift.",
      "\"He has acknowledged that the conflict is more complicated and he's clearly frustrated with Putin, so that I think it is perhaps a success for Ukrainian and European diplomacy that that explanation has got through,\" Neil Melvin, Director of International Security at the British think-tank RUSI, told the Reuters news agency. \"The narrative around what he is saying has shifted but he still seems to be making it about distancing the U.S. from leading on the conflict. He's putting it back onto Europe all the time.\"",
      "Melvin told Reuters that Mr. Trump's rhetoric could shift again.",
      "\"I think we are always just one call to Putin away from a shift, and that's why I think fundamentally the first eight months have eroded trust in Europe in the Trump administration's approach, and this doesn't restore trust,\" Melvin said.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's apparent shift on Ukraine, Peskov said the relationship between the U.S. and Russian leaders remained friendly.",
      "\"They have known each other for a very long time, and indeed they respect each other. They treat each other warmly,\" Peskov said. \"This does not prevent them from talking about sharp topics. It does not stop them from diverging on many issues. After all, each of them has his own interests.\"",

      "In an\u00a0episode\u00a0of his podcast The Tim Dillon Show released online on Sept. 20, the comedian said he had been \"fired\" from the festival because of jokes he had previously made referencing the alleged use of\u00a0forced labor in the conservative Islamic kingdom.",

    "summary": "The Rijksmuseum museum said that it had finally sniffed out a sketch that inspired the dog in Rembrandt's iconic \"Night Watch\" painting.",
    "story": [
      "It didn't exactly take dogged detective work for an art sleuth in Amsterdam to solve a canine conundrum dating back to the Dutch Golden Age.",
      "Anne Lenders, a curator at the city's landmark Rijksmuseum, said Tuesday that it was more or less by accident that she discovered that the barking dog in\u00a0Rembrandt van Rijn's famous \"The Night Watch\" is a near-identical copy of one that features in a 1619 pen and ink drawing by fellow Dutch artist Adriaen van de Venne.",
      "\"I wasn't looking for this; it was really unexpected,\" Lenders said in the glass room where \"Night Watch\" is undergoing extensive restoration.",
      "She was visiting an exhibition at the Zeeuws Museum in the southern Netherlands when her eye fell on a picture of a dog by Van de Venne that was printed in a book by the poet Jacob Cats. The original drawing \u2014 which turned out to be part of the Rijksmuseum's own vast collection \u2014 was also on display.",
      "Using her phone to compare the two images side by side, the 39-year-old Dutchwoman saw \"striking similarities\" between van de Venne's dog and the canine depicted in Rembrandt's 1642 masterpiece.",
      "\"The resemblance is so strong that at the very first moment I thought he (Rembrandt) must have used this,\" she added.",
      "That's when the research started: a comparison of Van de Venne's and Rembrandt's dogs; their pose, even the collar they wear.",
      "\"The head turns in exact the same angle with the mouth slightly opened. ... Both dogs have long hair and ears that hang vertical,\" said Lenders.",
      "In the \"Night Watch,\" the dog adds tension to a dark corner of the crowded composition, crouching and apparently barking near a drummer called Jacob Jorisz and just behind one of the iconic 1642 painting's main characters, Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch.",
      "The discovery is the latest in a series of revelations to emerge during a yearslong project to reexamine the 379.5 by 453.5-centimeter (149.4 by 178.5-inch) canvas using modern techniques. \"Operation Night Watch\" began in 2019 with an extensive study of the painting and is continuing with restoration work that is likely to take years to complete.",
      "\"'The Night Watch' is Rembrandt's most famous painting and we always think that it was created out of nothing, out of his genius,\" Taco Dibbits, the director of the Rijksmuseum, told Agence France-Presse. \"But Rembrandt, like the great Italian masters Michelangelo and Raphael, used works of art by artists before him to make his own compositions.\"",
      "One thing the Rijksmuseum couldn't figure out was exactly what kind of dog it is, with expert opinions divided between a French or a Dutch breed. Most likely, the two artists used a little poetic license.",
      "\"We will never have a conclusion on which breed it is,\" Dibbits said. \"But it's definitely very much loved.\"",
      "While Dibbits credited \"well informed luck\" for the find, he said such discovery could only have happened with the help of \"Operation Night Watch,\" a large-scale public restoration project launched in 2019.",
      "\"You would say, well, the painting is so famous, everything has already been discovered,\" he said. \"But of course you always with art discover new things and that's why Rembrandt is such a great artist.\"",

      "The comments appear to mark a dramatic shift for Mr. Trump, who said last month he expected \"some swapping of territories\" as part of an eventual Russia-Ukraine ceasefire deal. Russia occupies large parts of eastern Ukraine, including territories captured in 2014 and in the current war that began with Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",

      "\"Paracetamol remains an important option to treat pain or fever in pregnant women,\" Steffen Thirstrup, EMA's chief medical officer, said in the statement. \"Our advice is based on a rigorous assessment of the available scientific data and we have found no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children.\"",

      "\"There is no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children,\" the agency's chief safety officer Dr. Alison Cave said in the statement.",
      "In a combined statement, Australia's chief medical officer and the country's medicine regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, said they were joining \"other global medicines regulators, leading clinicians and scientists worldwide in rejecting claims regarding the use of paracetamol in pregnancy, and the subsequent risk of development of ADHD or autism in children.\"",
      "\"Robust scientific evidence shows no causal link between the use of paracetamol in pregnancy and autism or ADHD, with several large and reliable studies directly contradicting these claims,\" the statement continued.",
      "While sharing a statement from Spain's Ministry of Health that stated paracetamol can be used during pregnancy, the country's minister of health, M\u00f3nica Garc\u00eda, called out Mr. Trump specifically for misinformation and lack of evidence.",
      "\"Trump's new crusade is against paracetamol during pregnancy, ignoring all scientific evidence,\" she wrote on X. \"This denialism only sows alarm and misinformation. It's better to listen to health authorities than to the person who suggested injecting bleach against COVID,\" referring to a remark Mr. Trump made in 2020.",
      "A World Health Organization spokesperson said Tuesday that evidence of a link between the use of paracetamol during pregnancy and autism \"remains inconsistent,\" according to Reuters.",
      "International-based studies have been part of the evidence that shows acetaminophen use during pregnancy is safe.",
      "In a\u00a0major study published last year, for example, researchers followed nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years and found that acetaminophen use during pregnancy did not increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children.",

    "published": "Tue, 23 Sep 2025 19:42:14 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump suggested Tuesday that London officials want to \"go to sharia law,\" a comment London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office called \"bigoted\" and \"appalling.\"",
    "story": [
      "London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office called President Trump's comments \"bigoted,\" after the president appeared to make the false claim that London wants to \"go to sharia law\" and was a city that had \"changed\" under the mayor's leadership.",
      "\"I have to say, I look at London where you have a terrible mayor \u2014 terrible, terrible mayor \u2014 and it's been so changed, so changed,\" Mr. Trump said during his address to world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday. \"Now they want to go to sharia law ... Both their immigration and their suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump used the word \"they\" without clarifying if he meant Khan and London, his comments echoed long running far-right conspiracy theories online linking Khan, who is the first Muslim to be elected mayor of London, to Islamic fundamentalism. There is no evidence that Khan has advocated for London to officially adopt Sharia, a system of religious laws that is used in some Muslim countries but not by the U.K. government.",
      "\"We are not going to dignify his appalling and bigoted comments with a response,\" a spokesperson for London's mayor told CBS News in an e-mailed statement Tuesday. \"London is the greatest city in the world, safer than major US cities, and we're delighted to welcome the record number of US citizens moving here.\"",
      "In response, White House spokesman Davis Ingle said: \"President Trump is right \u2014 unchecked migration into western countries is making the world a more dangerous place.\"",
      "A number of politicians in Britain came to Khan's defense following Mr. Trump's comments, including members of U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government. Khan is a member of Starmer's ruling, left-leaning Labour party.",
      "\"Sadiq Khan is not trying to impose Sharia Law on London,\" U.K. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said in a post on X Tuesday. \"This is a Mayor who marches with pride, who stands up for differences of background and opinion, who's focused on improving our transport, our air, our streets, our safety, our choices and chances.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks \u2014 made within a wider context of criticizing the immigration policy of European countries \u2014 revived a spat between Khan and the president that stretches back nearly a decade.",
      "In 2015, Sadiq Khan roundly condemned then-candidate Donald Trump after he called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\" on national security grounds, following a terrorist attack in California. Early in his first term, Mr. Trump moved to restrict travel to the U.S. by residents of several mostly Muslim countries, though it did not explicitly ban entry to the U.S. by all Muslims.",
      "That initial criticism has led to a colorful back-and-forth between the two over the years. Just last week, Mr. Trump said Khan was \"among the worst mayors in the world,\" and told reporters that he asked that Khan not be present at the banquet hosted by King Charles III during the president's state visit to the U.K.",
      "Mr. Trump has also often claimed that crime in London has risen dramatically during Khan's tenure, including in last week's comments to reporters, when he said crime in London was \"through the roof.\"",
      "Overall recorded crime in London has increased by 31.5% over the past 10 years, with violent crime increasing by 40%, according to U.K. office for National Statistics data cited by CBS News' partners at the BBC. Khan first took office as London's mayor in May 2016.",
      "But data from the Metropolitan Police shows that London had a homicide rate of 11.8 per million people in 2024. That makes the homicide rate in England's capital lower than in a number of major U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., according to data cited by the White House.",

Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes in Lebanon, and the two sides became locked in conflict.",
      "Since the ceasefire took effect, Israel has continued to launch near-daily airstrikes in southern Lebanon.

Hezbollah has only acknowledged firing across the border once since the ceasefire, but Israel says the militant group is trying to rebuild its capabilities.",

      "Scientists have discovered a new dinosaur from Argentina with powerful claws, feasting on an ancient crocodile bone.",
      "The new find was possibly 23 feet long and hailed from a mysterious group of dinosaurs called megaraptorans. They prowled across what's now South America, Australia and parts of Asia, splitting off into different species over millions of years.",
      "Megaraptorans were known for their stretched-out skulls and \"huge and very powerful claws,\" said Lucio Ibiricu with the Patagonian Institute of Geology and Paleontology, who was part of the discovery team.",
      "But it's not yet clear how these creatures hunted and where they fall on the evolutionary timeline \u2014 mainly because the fossils recovered so far were incomplete.",
      "\"Megaraptorans are among the least understood dinosaurs of all,\" Ibiricu told the Reuters news agency.",
      "In a new study, researchers said they uncovered part of a skull as well as arm, leg and tail bones from the Lago Colhu\u00e9 Huapi rock formation in Patagonia. They noticed unique features in the bones that made them realize this could be a new species.",
      "This latest member of the megaraptoran clan named Joaquinraptor casali \"fills a major gap by providing one of the most complete skeletons yet,\" Federico Agnolin with the Argentine Museum of Natural Science Bernardino Rivadavia said in an email. Agnolin was not involved with the research, which was published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "The creature likely lived between 66 and 70 million years ago \u2014 close to the time dinosaurs went extinct \u2014 and was at least 19 years old when it died, though scientists don't know what killed it.",
      "The front leg bone pressed against its jaws \u2014 belonging to an ancient relative of crocodiles \u2014 could yield some clues to its diet and whether it was the top predator on the humid prehistoric flood plains.",
      "Study co-author Matt Lamanna told Reuters that unlike the T. rex, which had massive teeth and small arms, the Joaquinraptor likely used its long arms to capture prey.",
      "\"This suggests that these two predatory dinosaur lineages evolved different adaptations to accomplish basically the same thing - that is, to capture, subdue, kill and eat other animals such as other dinosaurs,\" Lamanna told Reuters. \"Precisely why these groups evolved along these different evolutionary pathways remains a mystery, but it shows that, during the Cretaceous, there was more than one way to be a top predator.\"",
      "Ibiricu named the new dinosaur in memory of his son Joaquin. While Joaquin was very young and hadn't yet developed a fascination with dinosaurs, Ibiricu still thinks he would have appreciated being named after one.",

      "The 45-year-old woman was arrested in South Korea in September 2022 and extradited one month later. She denied the charges, with her lawyers arguing that she was insane at the time of the murders.",
      "Lawyers for Lee admitted she had killed the children by giving them an anti-depressant medication called nortriptyline, but they said the deaths happened after their client had \"descended into madness.\" Lee had always been \"fragile,\" said lawyer Lorraine Smith, but her mental illness became worse after her husband's death.",
      "During the trial, a palliative care counselor said in a statement read to the court that Lee had said she \"wanted it all to be over\" and often mentioned ending both her and her husband's life, the Australian national broadcaster ABC reported.",
      "At one point, Lee thought it would be best if the whole family died, Smith said, but that she had got the dose wrong and when she woke up, the children were dead.",
      "After Tuesday's verdict, Justice Geoffrey Venning ordered that Lee remain in custody until she is sentenced on Nov. 26. Murder carries a mandatory life sentence in New Zealand, with judges required to set a prison term of at least 10 years before an offender can apply for parole.",
      "Prosecutors said Lee had likely suffered from depression but that it was not severe enough to support an insanity defense. In New Zealand, such a claim requires a murder defendant to prove they were incapable of understanding what they were doing or that it was wrong.",
      "There was a \"cold calculation\" to Lee's actions, prosecutor Natalie Walker told the court. Walker said Lee had killed her children out of selfishness and planned to begin a new life without them.",
      "The children's remains were discovered after Lee stopped paying rental fees for an Auckland storage unit when she ran into financial difficulties in 2022.",
      "The pair were found in separate peach-colored suitcases, wrapped in plastic, a police officer who first investigated the matter told the court. The grisly discovery came after an unsuspecting family bought a trailer-load of items \u2014 including the suitcases \u2014 at an auction for abandoned goods near Auckland.",
      "Venning said when the trial began on Sept. 8 it would be distressing to Lee and granted her permission to watch the proceedings from another room in the courthouse. She returned to the dock for the verdict, and stood with her head bowed and her hair covering her face, New Zealand news outlets reported.",

    "summary": "Archaeologists say they've discovered an ancient, long-submerged Mediterranean port, but for the head of the mission, the real treasure is still hidden.",
    "story": [
      "Cairo \u2014\u00a0Archaeologists say they have discovered evidence of an ancient, long-submerged Mediterranean port that was linked to the Taposiris Magna Temple near Egypt's northern coastal city of Alexandria. The Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities announced the discovery last week, expanding on what's known about the temple complex about 30 miles west of Alexandria that dates to the Ptolemaic period, more than 2,000 years ago.",
      "The Egyptian-Dominican archaeological mission, led by Dr. Kathleen Martinez from the Universidad Nacional Pedro Henriquez Ure\u00f1a, along with Dr. Robert Ballard, who located the Titanic shipwreck in 1985, has been conducting geological and archaeological surveys of the coastal area surrounding the temple.",
      "Working in collaboration with Dr. Larry Mayer, from the University of New Hampshire, and the Egyptian Navy Hydrographic Department (ENHD) and the Egyptian Department of Underwater Antiquities, it was this team that uncovered the evidence of an ancient submerged port.",
      "Martinez told CBS News that after mapping the seabed with state-of-the-art sonar technologies, and then using software to simulate pre-submersion conditions, the team revealed a submerged ancient shoreline about 2.5 miles from the present coast, including a site with an old inner harbor that would have been protected by coral reefs.",
      "Their research also revealed an extension of a tunnel linking the temple, the remains of which are about half of a mile from the current coastline, to the old port. The tunnel extended to an area known as \"Salam 5,\" where divers found basalt base fragments similar to those from statues inside the sanctuary.",
      "The team also found several stone and metal anchors of various shapes and sizes scattered near the reef, along with numerous broken amphorae that were recovered from inside the sunken harbor, all dating to the Ptolemaic period.",
      "Martinez told CBS News that, along with the discovery of seven shafts connected to an underground passage near the sanctuary of Taposiris Magna, linked with other subsurface structures and some contemporary buildings in front of the sanctuary, the findings \"strongly indicate that Taposiris Magna functioned as an active maritime zone with at least an inner harbor in antiquity.\"",
      "\"The development of peripheral harbors, towards the decongestion of the central one in Alexandria, would be a matter of necessity. Taposiris Magna would be part of the network of peripheral harbor towns, providing access to Egypt from the west, and assisting in the distribution of Egyptian products across the Mediterranean,\" she said.",
      "As no ancient texts refer to a harbor at Taposiris Magna, the results of the research represent a significant contribution of new knowledge, throwing open an entirely new chapter in the history of the site, Martinez said.",
      "The quest for Cleopatra's tomb",
      "But while discovering the port is important, she's looking for something else. Like many other archaeologists, Martinez wants to find the tomb of Egypt's last queen, Cleopatra VII, who ruled from about 51 B.C. - 30 B.C.",
      "While many of her contemporaries in the field have long focused their hunt for Cleopatra's tomb among the ruins of Alexandria's Royal Quarters, Martinez has trained her sights for the last 20 years on Taposiris Magna.",
      "\"I dedicated 10 years previous to that to studying Cleopatra's life and death,\" said Martinez.",
      "The ancient queen allied herself with Roman general Mark Antony after Julius Caesar's death, to jointly face Caesar's heir Octavian (or Octavius).",
      "When they were defeated at the Battle of Actium, they fled to Egypt. Octavius pursued them, and in 30 B.C. they both committed suicide separately, but they are believed by many historians to have been buried together in Alexandria.",
      "Martinez, however, believes the tomb is actually in Taposiris Magna, about 30 miles further southwest down Egypt's Mediterranean coast. She considers it \"the perfect final resting place for Queen Cleopatra.\"",
      "When she started the project, Martinez presented her hypothesis to Egyptian officials.",
      "\"Of course, they didn't believe me,\" she told CBS News.",
      "She said she predicted they would find a necropolis at the site, likely from the time of Cleopatra.",
      "\"We did,\" she told CBS News. \"We have already discovered and excavated 21 catacombs. We have a projection that at least we have 20 or 25 more\u2026\u00a0 We have more than 600 human remains and more than 30 mummies\u2026 And we will discover the tomb [of Cleopatra].\"",
      "There are archeologists who disagree with Martinez and stand by the theory that Cleopatra's tomb is in the Royal Quarters, in the center of ancient Alexandria. But she's unmoved.",
      "\"It's not there, because the Romans hated Queen Cleopatra. And they wanted desperately to take her to Rome and parade her,\" Martinez told CBS News. \"Octavius would have done anything to bring Cleopatra to Rome and parade her in chains, and maybe give her the most horrible death that the Romans could inflict.\"",
      "\"But Cleopatra didn't want to go to Rome, and she tried to find a way to escape from that destiny and she wanted to stay in Egypt.\"",
      "Martinez said the new Roman emperor could have taken her alive, or brought her remains to Rome, so she needed to secure a location where her remains could not be easily discovered, which she believes would have made the Royal Quarters a very unlikely choice.",
      "Taposiris Magna was built as a temple dedicated to the goddess Isis, and Cleopatra, Martinez said, \"presented herself always, as the new Isis.\"",
      "She explained that the location had a strong religious context, and crucially, it was not under the control of the Romans at the time, unlike the Royal Quarters.",
      "\"She outsmarted the Romans,\" said Martinez.",
      "Martinez told CBS News that the team will continue their exploration of the harbor site in about a week, and it is set to go on for at least another two months.",
      "\"This is the first time that we're going to actually excavate underwater. It is going to be very exciting,\" she said, adding that nobody is known to have ever dived at the site before. \"We don't know what we're going to discover there because this is the beginning of the search.\"",
      "\"It's a mystery. There was very little information about this place,\" she said. \"The site itself sometimes leads you in a certain direction.\"",
      "For two millennia, Cleopatra has been successful in hiding the location of her remains, not just from the Romans, but from archaeologists.",
      "Martinez has no hangups about dedicating herself to the quest for Cleopatra for nearly three decades.",
      "\"Well, it's a 2,000-year-old puzzle, and you are putting the pieces together,\"\u00a0 she told CBS News, adding that she remains \"100% convinced that it's a matter of time\" before her work finally pays off.",

      "Behnam Taleblu of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said Trump was also making a point about the U.N.\u2019s lack of engagement. \"The President also foot-stomped the fact that he has received relative silence from the U.N. system and its leaders in the face of numerous ceasefires and deconfliction agreements he helped broker in warzones around the world. For an organization aimed at stemming or resolving conflict, the silence is deafening.\""

      "A true living room, not just a chair",
      "Robeta makes it clear they really mean luxury. Instead of adding the typical swivel seat like most models, they built an actual, fully realized living room. There is a partition between the driving cab and the main cabin. The star of the show is an L-shaped couch that runs over six feet long. And it's not just any couch. It is deep, plush and inviting. It's the kind of seating where you can stretch out on without bumping into a dinette table or a cabinet corner.",
      "Robeta Mobil is offering a luxury camping experience via its newest camper model, available in 2026. (Robeta Mobil)",
      "Bedtime gets an upgrade",
      "When the sun goes down, that beautiful lounge transforms. A double bed lowers from the ceiling, turning the room into a proper bedroom without having to rearrange cushions or fold anything in a weird way. In the morning, it lifts right back up, making space for coffee and conversation. It is a smooth trick that makes the van feel more like a studio apartment than a rolling compromise. Neither the couch nor the bed needs to sacrifice comfort the way sofa beds typically do.",
      "Laundry on the road",
      "Let's talk about the washer and dryer. Yes, really. A compact Tiny Wash unit is built right into the wardrobe. It handles just enough for a quick refresh, and it actually dries, too. No more hanging socks from cabinet knobs or relying on campground and public laundromats. For extended trips, this little feature is a money saver and an absolute game changer.",

This setup is ready for real cooking, not just boiling water or reheating prepackaged meals. If you like to eat well on the road, this one is built with you in mind.",
      "A bathroom that feels like a bathroom",
      "At the rear of the van, the bathroom doesn't feel like an afterthought. It has a sink, a full-standing shower and a macerating toilet. Instead of cramming it all into a tiny box, Robeta gave it a soft curtain enclosure that keeps the look minimal and the space functional. It feels clean, intentional and refreshingly roomy.",
      "Power to keep you out there",
      "This luxury van even has the chops for off-roading. The Ananya packs a 10-kilowatt-hour EcoFlow power system with stackable batteries and 450 watts of solar. You can stay off the cord for days without blinking. Add in a 160-liter freshwater tank, diesel heat and hot water via Webasto, and the freedom to wander suddenly looks very comfortable.

      "Stay connected while you roam",
      "When you're traveling in a camper van, nothing kills the vibe faster than losing cell service, especially if you rely on your phone for maps, music, work or keeping in touch. Thankfully, there are two handy solutions to keep you connected: cell phone boosters and mobile hotspots.",
      "Cell phone boosters amplify weak signals from nearby towers, making calls clearer, boosting data speeds and reducing dropped calls. They're ideal for rural drives, national parks or even just passing through patchy areas. Installation typically involves an outside antenna to capture the signal, an amplifier to boost it and an inside antenna to rebroadcast it inside your van.",
      "Mobile hotspots, on the other hand, turn a cellular signal into a private Wi-Fi network for your devices. They're perfect for working remotely from the road, streaming movies or sharing the internet with multiple passengers. Many can run off your phone plan or use a dedicated SIM card for more robust coverage.",
      "Pro tip:\u00a0If your adventures often take you far from towns or highways, a cell phone booster is your best bet for call reliability. If you need strong Wi-Fi for work or entertainment, pair it with a mobile hotspot for the ultimate on-the-road connectivity.",

Fake accounts, misleading checkmarks and smooth-talking profiles are everywhere, and not everyone knows how to spot them. I recently received an email from Marie from Boynton Beach, Florida, with a similar concern:",
      "\"I have been on X, and it seems quite a few people turn out to be not who they say they are. Mostly the ones that are verified. I am not that good tech-wise.

      "It is a fair concern, Marie. With scams becoming more polished, the line between real and fake accounts is harder to see. Let's break down why fraud is so common on social media, the red flags you should look out for, and the simple habits that can keep you from getting duped.",

      "Why social media is a playground for scammers",
      "Social platforms are built for speed and visibility. Anyone can create an account in minutes, post content instantly and connect with strangers worldwide. This openness is what makes social media engaging, but it is also what makes it ripe for abuse. Fraudsters exploit the fact that posts, comments and messages are consumed quickly and often without much scrutiny.",
      "Verification systems that were once meant to help users identify legitimate accounts have also lost some of their power. On platforms where checkmarks can be purchased, scammers can buy credibility without earning it. Add in the algorithms that reward viral content and sudden spikes in engagement, and you get the perfect environment for fraud to spread unnoticed.",
      "Scammers know people often lower their guard on social media. In these spaces, users share personal details, build emotional ties with influencers and trust posts that look familiar. As a result, the combination of speed, trust and visibility creates an ideal environment for fraud to spread rapidly.",

      "The cost of falling for a scam",
      "When people think of scams, they often imagine losing a one-time sum of money. The reality is far more damaging. Clicking a bad link or handing over credentials can snowball into long-term consequences. Once scammers get access to your information, it can be sold on dark web marketplaces, used to open fraudulent accounts or leveraged for identity theft.",
      "There is also the reputational cost. If your social media account is hijacked, scammers can use it to trick your friends, family or followers, spreading fraud even further under your name. Cleaning up that mess can take weeks and may permanently damage your credibility.",
      "Social media apps are prime hunting grounds for scammers who rely on speed and trust to deceive victims. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Practical steps you can take to stay safe on social media",
      "There are simple ways to protect yourself without needing technical expertise. I have listed some of the crucial steps below.",
      "Fake accounts often have clear giveaways. Look at how long the account has existed, whether it posts original content and the kind of followers it has. Scammers usually recycle generic profile photos or steal images from real people. Reverse image searches can help you confirm if a photo belongs to someone else.",
      "Even with verification, be skeptical. On platforms where checkmarks can be purchased, anyone can appear \"official\" without being trustworthy. Treat every new interaction with caution until proven otherwise.",
      "FACEBOOK CRYPTO ADS LEAD TO DANGEROUS MALWARE SCAMS",
      "Fraudsters often send links over DMs, comments or even ads. These links may lead to phishing sites designed to steal your credentials or malware that installs silently on your device. One careless click can expose your information.",
      "This is where having strong antivirus software comes in. Even if you accidentally land on a malicious site, a strong antivirus can block harmful downloads and warn you before malware runs. Think of it as a safety net for moments when curiosity gets the better of you.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Phishing scams frequently mimic login screens for X, Instagram or Facebook. They are designed to trick you into typing your username and password into a fake form. Once you do, the scammer immediately takes over your account.",
      "A password manager can be a lifesaver here. It only fills in your login details on the genuine site you have saved. If it does not recognize the page, that is a red flag that you are looking at a fake. On top of that, a password manager makes it easier to use strong, unique passwords for each account, which limits damage if one gets compromised.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/.",
      "The less information fraudsters can find about you, the weaker their scams become. Many impersonators use details like your hometown, job or relatives to build trust. If your email, phone number or address is floating around the web, scammers can weaponize that too.",
      "A personal data removal service can help here by scrubbing your details from people-search sites and data brokers. While not foolproof, reducing your digital footprint makes you a harder target for impersonation or social engineering scams.

      "SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION PHISHING SCAM TARGETS RETIREES",
      "Fraudsters often pretend to be well-known figures, influencers or even customer support staff. They use urgency like \"limited offer,\" \"you have won\" or \"your account will be closed\" to pressure you into responding fast.",
      "When money, gift cards or personal details are involved, slow down. Contact the real brand or person through official channels to verify. If you are unsure, simply ignore the request.",
      "One of the strongest defenses you have is your gut feeling. If a verified profile is asking for money, if a giveaway sounds too good to be true or if someone's tone feels off, it probably is. Scammers rely on you ignoring that little voice that says something is not right.",

      "As AI data centers use more electricity, the solar industry is ramping up to provide more power.",
      "Wisconsin has launched a groundbreaking project that could reshape how the state generates and uses electricity. The Paris Solar-Battery Park in Kenosha County combines a massive solar farm with a powerful battery storage system to make renewable energy available day and night.",

      "How Wisconsin's solar battery park powers 130,000 homes",
      "The Paris Solar farm began producing power in December 2024 and generates 200 megawatts of renewable electricity during the day. That amount is enough to supply about 55,000 homes each year.",
      "Wisconsin\u2019s first large-scale solar battery park combines solar power with storage, providing reliable clean energy day and night. (We Energies)",
      "Now, a 110-megawatt battery storage system has been added. These batteries capture excess energy from the solar panels and release it at night, during cloudy weather, or when demand suddenly rises. The battery system can power about 130,000 homes for up to four hours.",

      "NEW TESLA SOLAR-POWERED CHARGING STATION OPENS",
      "Why Wisconsin's solar battery park is a historic energy shift",
      "Energy use is climbing, and nearly 79 percent of electricity in the United States still comes from fossil fuels. That dependence contributes to increased carbon pollution, higher costs and leaves the grid vulnerable during extreme conditions.",
      "The Paris Solar-Battery Park reduces reliance on fossil fuels while strengthening Wisconsin's grid. It also provides a model other states can follow.",
      "Mike Hooper, president of project partner We Energies, called the project\u00a0\"historic\" and stressed that customers can count on dependable and affordable power in any weather. That level of reliability is especially crucial as storms, heatwaves and cold snaps put additional pressure on power systems.",
      "Massive battery storage units at the Paris Solar-Battery Park capture solar energy for use during nights and peak demand. (We Energies)",
      "What Wisconsin's solar battery park means for clean energy",
      "Battery storage is becoming a cornerstone of the clean energy movement. Without storage, solar power only helps while the sun is shining. With it, renewable energy becomes flexible, consistent and available around the clock.",
      "This shift benefits both the environment and consumers. Solar farms have been shown to cut electric bills by 5 to 20 percent. Additionally, the Paris Solar-Battery Park is eligible for federal tax credits, which can pass on savings to residents.",
      "Recent policy changes may reduce some of those incentives in the future. Even so, pairing solar with battery storage remains one of the most effective ways to lower costs and reduce emissions.",

      "Earlier this year, Australian police arrested a passenger for running a malicious Wi-Fi network both at an airport and during a flight. The setup looked just like the airline's own Wi-Fi service, but it wasn't. Instead, it was what cybersecurity researchers call an \"evil twin,\" a fake hotspot designed to trick people into handing over their credentials.",
      "The idea isn't new, but the setting is. For years, fake Wi-Fi networks have been a common trick in cafes, hotels, and airports. What makes this case stand out is that the attacker took it to the skies, exploiting the growing reliance on in-flight Wi-Fi for entertainment and internet access.",

      "What is an evil twin Wi-Fi attack?",
      "An evil twin hotspot is a wireless network that impersonates a legitimate one by copying its name, also known as the SSID. When multiple networks with the same name exist, your phone or laptop often connects to the one with the stronger signal, which is usually the attacker's.",
      "Travelers check their phones while navigating delays and flight cancellations at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on July 19, 2024, in Austin, Texas. (Brandon Bell/Getty Images)",
      "Once connected, victims are often redirected to a fake login or landing page. In this case, the malicious portal requested passengers' email addresses, passwords, or even social media credentials under the pretense of granting access to the airline's entertainment system. The stolen information could then be used for account takeovers, identity theft, or further attacks.",
      "Why travel Wi-Fi is a prime target",
      "Travel creates a perfect storm for these kinds of attacks. Whether you're in a hotel, airport, cruise ship or airplane, you often have limited choices for getting online. Mobile data may be patchy or expensive, which pushes people toward the available Wi-Fi networks. Because these services feel official and are tied to trusted brands, travelers tend to assume they're safe and let their guard down when login requests pop up.",
      "Another trend adds to the risk. Travel providers are increasingly moving entertainment and services onto personal devices instead of offering built-in options. Airlines replace seatback screens with streaming portals, cruise lines promote app-based services and hotels direct guests to digital check-in platforms. All of these require a Wi-Fi connection, which means more people are logging on than ever before.",
      "QANTAS DATA BREACH EXPOSES MILLIONS OF CUSTOMER RECORDS",
      "How hackers trick you with fake in-flight Wi-Fi",
      "Here's how it worked in the Australian case. The attacker carried a portable hotspot onboard and named it to match the airline's official Wi-Fi network. Passengers, seeing the fake network with stronger signal strength, connected automatically. They were then taken to a counterfeit login page asking for personal details.",

      "YOUR DISCARDED LUGGAGE TAGS ARE WORTH MONEY TO SCAMMERS",
      "Why you need a VPN for in-flight Wi-Fi security",
      "One of the best defenses against rogue Wi-Fi is a Virtual Private Network, or VPN. A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet, making it far harder for attackers to intercept your data even if you connect to the wrong hotspot.",
      "There is a catch, though. In-flight Wi-Fi systems often require you to disable your VPN temporarily to access the onboard portal. Even then, a VPN remains an important safeguard. Once you have cleared the login page and, if you have paid, connected to the internet, enabling your VPN ensures that any browsing, messaging, or app traffic stays private.",

      "A VPN is important, but it isn't the only defense you should rely on. Here are some other ways to stay safe when connecting midair:",
      "Before you even think about connecting to in-flight Wi-Fi, make sure your device has a strong antivirus installed. It's your first line of defense against malicious sites and apps that attackers may try to push through fake portals. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Even if an attacker manages to steal your login credentials,\u00a02FA can stop them from getting into your accounts. Use app-based authenticators rather than SMS codes whenever possible, since they work offline and are harder to intercept.",
      "Most phones and laptops are set to reconnect automatically to familiar networks. This makes it easier for a fake hotspot with the same name to trick your device. Before you board, switch off auto-connect and manually choose the correct airline Wi-Fi.",
      "When browsing in-flight, check for the padlock icon in your browser's address bar. HTTPS encrypts the connection between your device and the website, making it harder for attackers on public Wi-Fi to intercept your data.",
      "Even with precautions, in-flight Wi-Fi should be treated as untrusted. Avoid logging in to sensitive accounts like online banking or work systems. Stick to light browsing, streaming or messaging until you're back on a secure connection.",
      "Outdated operating systems and apps often have security holes attackers exploit. Before your trip, install the latest updates on your phone, tablet or laptop. Many updates include security patches that protect you against known vulnerabilities.",
      "When possible, switch your device to airplane mode and then enable only Wi-Fi. This reduces exposure from other radios (like Bluetooth or cellular roaming) that attackers sometimes target on flights.",
      "Some fake in-flight portals use pop-ups or redirects designed to trick you into entering login details or clicking on malicious links. If a page asks for unnecessary information, like your full Social Security number, banking details or unrelated logins, treat it as a red flag. Close the page immediately and don\u2019t click.",

Next time you fly, think twice before blindly connecting to the first Wi-Fi network that pops up. Sometimes, the safest choice is to stay offline until you land.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "AI browsers are no longer just an idea; they're already here. Microsoft has built Copilot into Edge, OpenAI is testing a sandboxed browser in agent mode and Perplexity's Comet is one of the first to fully embrace the concept of browsing for you.",
      "This is agentic AI stepping into our daily routines, from searching and reading to shopping and clicking. Instead of simply assisting us, these tools are beginning to replace us.",
      "But with this shift comes a new era of digital deception. AI-powered browsers may promise convenience by handling shopping, emails and other tasks, yet research shows they can stumble into scams faster than humans ever could. This dangerous mix of speed and trust is what experts call Scamlexity, a complex, AI-driven scam landscape where your agent gets tricked, and you pay the price.",

      "Falling for the same old tricks",
      "AI browsers are not immune to classic scams. In fact, they can fall for them even faster. When researchers at Guardio Labs told an AI browser to buy an Apple Watch, it confidently completed the purchase on a fake Walmart store set up in minutes. It autofilled personal and payment details without hesitation. The scammer got the money, while the human never saw the red flags.",
      "AI browsers promise convenience, but security experts warn they can fall for online scams faster than humans. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Handling phishing emails from \"your bank\"",
      "Old phishing tactics also remain effective. In testing, researchers at Guardio Labs sent a fake Wells Fargo email to the AI browser. The browser clicked the malicious link with no verification and even helped the user fill out login credentials on the phishing page. By removing human intuition from the loop, the AI created a perfect trust chain that scammers could exploit.",
      "PromptFix: A modern AI injection scam",
      "The real danger comes from attacks designed specifically for AI. Researchers at Guardio Labs created PromptFix, a scam disguised as a CAPTCHA page. While humans would only see a checkbox, the AI agent read hidden malicious instructions in the page code. Believing it was \"helping,\" the AI clicked the button, triggering a download that could have been malware. This type of prompt injection bypasses human awareness and targets the AI's decision-making directly. Once compromised, the AI can send emails, share files or execute harmful tasks without the user ever knowing.",
      "The growing risks of AI browsers",
      "As agentic AI becomes mainstream, scams will scale at an alarming speed. Instead of fooling millions of people individually, attackers need only to compromise one AI model to reach millions at once. Security experts warn this is a structural risk, not just a phishing problem.",
      "Tips to protect yourself from AI browser scams",
      "AI browsers can save time, but they can also put you at risk if you rely on them too much. Use these practical steps to stay in control and reduce your chances of becoming a victim.",
      "Always double-check sensitive actions like purchases, downloads or logins. Keep final approval in your hands instead of letting the AI complete tasks on its own. This way, you prevent scammers from sneaking past your awareness.",
      "Scammers rely on exposed personal details to make their tricks more convincing. A trusted data removal service can help scrub your information from broker sites, reducing the chance that your AI agent hands over details that are already floating around online. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

    "published": "Sat, 20 Sep 2025 06:37:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Expert tips for buying refurbished electronics reveal what to check before purchase, including warranty policies and seller reputation.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt the CyberGuy joins 'Fox & Friends' to share his tips to stay safe from online scammers and recent warnings on how AI toys can harm children.",
      "Buying refurbished electronics sounds like a no-brainer. You get the latest gadgets at a fraction of the cost while giving devices a second life, which is better for the environment. It seems like the perfect solution for those on a budget, but it isn't always that simple. Not every refurbished device is equal, and the fine print matters more than you think.",
      "Some sellers do a fantastic job restoring products, while others barely touch them before reselling. If you're considering refurbished tech, here are important lessons I wish I knew beforehand. These insights will help you make smarter choices, avoid headaches and get real value for your money.",

      "AMAZON'S SECRET RENEWED STORE DEALS: SAVE ON APPLE PRODUCTS, NINJA AIR FRYERS, SHARK VACUUMS AND MORE",
      "Researching a seller\u2019s track record is more important than chasing after the lowest refurbished price point. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Imo/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "1) Refurbished does not always mean like new",
      "In the tech industry, the label refurbished carries no uniform standard. From factory-certified devices that meet stringent quality checks to third-party refurbishments that address only surface-level defects, the range is vast. My experience shows that treating refurbished items as \"like new\" is a mistake. Many come with cosmetic blemishes or partially worn components, and some sellers stop at a basic reset and cleaning.",
      "The key is to scrutinize the seller's refurbishment process and request detailed specifications or photos to ensure the item is in good condition. Look for transparency about what has been repaired or replaced. A reputable refurbisher will disclose whether critical components such as screens, batteries or motherboards were replaced or simply tested.",
      "Pro tip: Many refurbishers use a grading system (A, B, C). Grade A means near new, Grade B usually has light scratches, while Grade C shows heavier wear. Knowing the grade helps set realistic expectations.",
      "2) Check the warranty and return policy",
      "One of the most overlooked yet critical aspects of buying refurbished electronics is the warranty and return policy. Through years of testing products, I've seen warranties vary wildly from generous 90-day coverage to none at all. A solid warranty is not just a formality; it's a reflection of the refurbisher's confidence in the quality of the product. Without it, you're taking a gamble.",
      "Industry best practices suggest opting for sellers who provide at least a 90-day warranty and a clear, no-hassle return window. I have consistently seen reliable refurbishers like Amazon Renewed, eBay Certified Refurbished and Back Market stand by their work with transparent policies.",
      "Also look at Apple Certified Refurbished and Dell Outlet, which are industry leaders for high-quality laptops, tablets and phones.",
      "3) Know the seller's reputation",
      "Not all sellers are equal when it comes to refurbished tech. My years covering consumer electronics have made it clear that choosing a reputable seller is more important than chasing the lowest price. Factory-certified refurbishers and authorized resellers tend to follow strict testing and quality control procedures. In contrast, independent sellers often vary in quality and reliability.",
      "I always emphasize researching the seller's history, reading verified customer reviews and ensuring they offer clear refurbishment guarantees. Established marketplaces and brand-certified stores provide additional layers of security, including dispute resolution mechanisms.",
      "Red flags include: vague warranty language, listings with only stock photos, \"open box\" items marketed as refurbished and any product sold \"as-is.\" If you see those, walk away.",
      "4) Don't forget accessories and packaging",
      "A less obvious but important consideration is the state of accessories and packaging. In industry practice, refurbished products rarely arrive in original packaging or with the full set of accessories. I've seen that some sellers ship devices with generic boxes and subpar third-party accessories or omit chargers and manuals altogether.",
      "If accessories are important to your workflow, don't assume they'll be included. Always verify the listing description and, when in doubt, ask the seller directly. Knowing exactly what comes in the box prevents surprises and ensures you don't have to hunt for compatible chargers or cables after the fact, potentially eroding any savings you initially gained.",
      "5) Battery life may not be the same",
      "A common misconception is that refurbished devices come with batteries that perform like new, but that's not the case. Batteries naturally degrade with use, and not all refurbishers replace them.",
      "Some sellers disclose battery replacement while others do not. It is critical to confirm whether the battery is new, tested or original. Otherwise, expect performance issues such as rapid discharge or failure to hold a charge. A device with a worn-out battery is rarely worth the lower upfront cost, as you'll likely need to replace the battery soon after purchase.",
      "SAVE UP TO 64% ON DYSON, DEWALT, ANKER, ADIDAS AND MORE DURING EBAY'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY SALE",
      "A good warranty and return policy are essential safeguards for choosing refurbished devices. (Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "6) Software updates and compatibility",
      "You should only use electronic items like phones, laptops, tablets and smartwatches as long as they're receiving software updates. Many might disagree with this, but the truth is that once software support ends, your device becomes vulnerable to all kinds of unpatchable security flaws. Some good brands known for reliable software support are Apple, Samsung, Google, MSI and Lenovo.",
      "Before purchasing, always verify that the device is still supported with regular updates. This information is often available on the manufacturer's website or through trusted tech resources.",
      "7) Test the device thoroughly after purchase",
      "Testing a refurbished device thoroughly upon arrival is a best practice I've recommended repeatedly in my writing. Even trusted sellers can occasionally miss a defect. I always advise checking every essential function, such as the screen, charging port, Wi-Fi, sound and camera, within the seller's return period. Many problems won't be obvious from photos or descriptions alone.",
      "Immediate testing ensures you catch issues early enough to return or replace the product without hassle. It's a small investment of time that prevents far bigger frustrations later.",
      "And don't forget to perform your own factory reset on\u00a0iPhone,\u00a0Android,\u00a0PC or Mac to ensure no old accounts, locks or data are lingering on the device. For Apple devices, make sure \"Find My iPhone\" has been disabled before purchase, or it may be unusable.",
      "8) Install strong antivirus software",
      "Refurbished devices can sometimes carry hidden risks, especially if the previous owner didn't wipe the device properly or if the seller missed deep software issues. Installing\u00a0 strong antivirus software is essential to protect your device from malware, spyware or other security threats that may be lurking.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "9) Use a password manager",
      "Security doesn't end with antivirus protection. Many refurbished devices come with pre-installed software or misconfigured settings that could expose you to risk. One of the smartest moves you can make is using a reliable password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "10) Know the real value of your savings",
      "Refurbished doesn't always mean a bargain. As a rule of thumb, expect to save 20-40% compared to new, depending on the brand, age and condition. If you're only saving 10-15%, the trade-off on warranty, lifespan or battery may not be worth it. Calculate the long-term cost, especially if you'll need to buy a new battery or accessories soon after.",
      "6 KITCHEN ITEMS THAT EXPERTS 'WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND' BUYING AT SECONDHAND SHOPS",
      "Refurbished products often arrive without original packaging or accessories, leaving buyers unprepared. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Bonus: The eco-friendly upside",
      "Every refurbished device purchased keeps one more gadget out of the landfill and reduces carbon emissions from manufacturing. Studies show buying refurbished can cut a product's carbon footprint nearly in half. That means you're not only saving money but also helping the planet.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Buying refurbished electronics can be a great way to save money and reduce e-waste. But it pays to be careful. By sticking with certified sellers, knowing what \"refurbished\" really means and insisting on warranties and clear return policies, you can protect both your wallet and your data.",

      "Watch for anyone loitering near the carousel and observing passengers closely. Stay aware of your surroundings while handling travel documents.",
      "Opt for mobile boarding passes instead of printed ones. This removes the risk of discarded paper passes falling into the wrong hands.",
      "Avoid printing your full home address or primary phone number. Instead, use your name, a travel-only email and either a P.O. box or work address. You can even create a simple alias email just for travel, which forwards to your main inbox but keeps your real address private. This way, airlines and honest finders can still reach you without exposing sensitive personal details to scammers.",
      "For recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Another way to protect yourself is by putting a small tracker inside your luggage, such as an\u00a0Apple AirTag or a\u00a0similar Bluetooth tracker. These devices connect to your phone and let you see where your bag is in near real-time. If your suitcase goes missing or ends up in the wrong place, you\u2019ll know faster than waiting for the airline to track it down.",
      "Place the tracker inside your bag rather than on the handle so it can\u2019t be easily removed. Check its location through your phone before leaving the airport, and keep an eye on it during layovers. While AirTags can\u2019t prevent someone from misusing an old luggage tag, they give you proof of where your bag actually is if you ever need to dispute a lost luggage claim or theft.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "While the luggage tag scam may not be widespread yet, it exploits a simple oversight that most travelers rarely consider. Until airlines and airports put better safeguards in place, the burden falls on passengers to protect their own information. That means treating something as ordinary as a bag tag like sensitive data.",

      "Al-Sharaa, who led the Islamist rebel group Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) to victory over Assad, ditched his military fatigues for a Western-style suit and has been on a charm offensive, hosting European and Western diplomats and politicians in hopes of bringing Syria out from its international pariah status.",

      "He will also be looking to secure much-needed reconstruction aid to rebuild a country ravaged by 13 years of civil war.

      "\"I came to the sense that he was already making a shift from being a military commander to being a politician, to being a political leader,\" Ambassador Leaf noted.",

      "That figure dipped to 4,216 drones fired in August. Though notably, the majority of those UAVs were fired between Aug. 16th and the 31st, when some 3,001 drones were deployed beginning the day after Trump met with Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15.",

      "\"We have to admit and adapt to this new reality. High intensity war by Russia against Ukraine is ongoing,\" the defense minister said. \"That means that more and more UAVs are going to wander off into the territories of the bordering countries, and even further.\"",

      "Stefanik described several hostages who required specialized care. One hostage was being treated for cancer on Oct. 7. Another lost his hand during a grenade explosion at the Nova festival. A third was kidnapped while nine months pregnant and gave birth while held captive. \"None is included in MSF\u2019s \u2018humanitarian\u2019 advocacy,\" Stefanik said.",
      "Stefanik also called into question the \"extremist actions and rhetoric\" of MSF staff, which have led to criticism of the organization. In one case, after MSF lamented the death of a staffer who was killed in Gaza in June 2024; the Israel Defense Forces confirmed he was a rocket expert for Palestinian Islamic Jihad. In another, a staffer publicly called for Palestinians to \"fight and die as martyrs\" according to the French publication Le Journal du Dimanche in March 2024.",

      "Members of the Trump administration have for days signaled that a deal was being finalized between Chinese and U.S. officials.",
      "A senior White House official confirmed to NBC News on Wednesday that once the deal is implemented, TikTok's U.S. operations would be run by a new joint-venture company. ByteDance, TikTok's current China-based owner, will hold less than 20% of the stock of the new company, the official said.",
      "NBC News reached out to TikTok for comment.",
      "This structure will comply with a bipartisan law passed in 2024 that sought to ban TikTok if the platform wasn't sold to U.S.-based owners this year. The app briefly shut down in the U.S. in January, just a day before Trump was inaugurated to his second term.",
      "The app came back online in the U.S. after Trump promised not to enforce the penalties against TikTok that were in the law and said he would seek to make a deal with China for the platform's sale to the U.S.",
      "Trump has extended the deadline to avoid a TikTok ban several times this year. On Wednesday, a senior White House official said that he plans to extend the pause for another 120 days to allow time for the deal to go through.",
      "For years, technology experts and U.S. officials warned that TikTok, which has over 170 million U.S. users, was a national security risk and that ByteDance could give the Chinese government access to user data and to the app's algorithm.",
      "During Trump's first term, he signed an executive order in 2020 aimed at banning TikTok, but then-President Joe Biden reversed it the following year. Biden ultimately signed the bipartisan TikTok bill into law.",
      "On Wednesday, a senior White House official confirmed that as part of the deal, American users' data will be stored in the U.S. and overseen by the software and cloud computing company Oracle. They added that the platform's algorithm will be retrained and continuously monitored to ensure that U.S. content is free from any outside manipulation.",
      "On Saturday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that the deal was almost over the finish line and that the \u201cdeal just needs to be signed.\u201d",

      "The pair have traded many barbed comments since Khan was elected to lead London in 2016 \u2014 Khan strongly criticized the president the same year for pledging a travel ban on a number of majority-Muslim countries, which was enacted in 2017.

      "\"I think people are wondering what it is about this Muslim mayor who leads a liberal, multicultural, progressive, successful city that means I appear to be living in Donald Trump's head, rent free,\" Khan said.",

      "Initially, Khan's team at City Hall released a statement saying: \"We are not going to dignify his appalling and bigoted comments with a response.\"",
      "But Wednesday, speaking from the top deck of a London bus, Khan said he was thankful for the \"record numbers of Americans\" coming to live in London, which he said was the highest since records began. \"There must be a reason for that,\" he said.",

      "Asked whether Britain should be extending such friendship to Trump, Khan said: \"If you have a best friend, you should expect more from them \u2014 it's very different to an acquaintance or somebody who's a distant friend.\"",
      "While he said the U.K. and the U.S. have important economic and military ties, Khan said such a relationship should mean one side has the confidence to call out the other. \"I think that President Trump is wrong in many, many ways,\" he said.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News.",
      "Khan, who represents Britain's Labour Party and is characterized as being on the center-left, social democratic wing of the party, won a third third term in office in 2024.",
      "The prevalence of Sharia law in the U.K. features in many right-wing conspiracy theories about the role of Muslims in the country, often partnered with the similarly false assertion that parts of big cities are dangerous \"no-go areas\" for non-Muslims.",
      "In reality, there are Sharia councils, which base decisions on traditional Muslim beliefs and religious texts, but they have no legal jurisdiction \u2014 as a government review found in 2018.",
      "Anger persists over the president's comments about London: Rosena Allin-Khan, the Labour lawmaker who now represents Khan's old constituency in south London, has called for the U.S. ambassador to the U.K. to be summoned over the remarks."

Macron had just announced that France would become the latest country to recognize Palestinian statehood \u2014 something Trump decried as a reward for Hamas' terror attack of Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "\"I think it honors Hamas and you can't do that because of October 7. You just can't do that,\" Trump told reporters while sitting next to Macron on Tuesday.",
      "The French leader retorted that \"nobody forgets the 7th of October, but after almost two years of war, what is the result.\" He added, \"This is not the right the right way to proceed.\"",
      "Macron added later Tuesday that if Trump wants his long-coveted Nobel Peace Prize then he needs to stop the war in Gaza.",
      "\"There is one person who can do something about it, and that is the U.S. president,\" Macron told France's BFMTV.  \"And the reason he can do more than us, is because we do not supply weapons that allow the war in Gaza to be waged. We do not supply equipment that allows war to be waged in Gaza. The United States of America does.\"",
      "Echoing the nuanced nature of their relationship, Trump did also say that Macron was \u201cdoing a really good job. He\u2019s fighting hard. He\u2019s fighting on a lot of fronts. He\u2019s helping with regard to the Russia, Ukraine catastrophe. And his words of wisdom mean a lot.\" He added, \"We\u2019ve been friends for a long time now, really from the first term on.\u201d",
      "France is the latest European country to formally recognize Palestine as a state, joining the United Kingdom and adding to a growing list of global nations that now numbers more than 145. The United States, along with Germany, Italy, Japan and a handful of others, are firmly in the minority.",

The legal challenges filed over the past two weeks will be important test cases on whether public employees can post statements deemed offensive, said Adam Goldstein, vice president of strategic initiatives at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate necessity that the courts will have to weigh in here,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cThere\u2019s no option here other than a number of cases where courts hopefully reinstruct us on how the First Amendment is supposed to work.\u201d",
      "In the days after Kirk was shot earlier this month, Vice President JD Vance and other top Republicans urged citizens to report people who mock Kirk\u2019s assassination to their employers. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon told Fox News last week that she\u2019d \u201clike to see more\u201d college faculty who celebrate Kirk\u2019s death fired or suspended.",
      "Some Democrats have shared similar sentiments. In Iowa, a leading Democratic gubernatorial candidate echoed calls to remove the Oskaloosa teacher. \u201cI\u2019d be pretty uncomfortable with my kids having teachers that celebrated someone\u2019s murder,\u201d Rob Sand, the candidate and current state auditor, told the Des Moines Register this week.",
      "Because the cases involve public employees, the employers have a higher bar to meet before firing them for speaking out, legal experts say. They will have to show the staff members\u2019 posts created a disruption that interfered with classes, for instance, or the operation of a school. Goldstein said generating controversy or complaints is typically not enough to warrant a firing.",
      "Michael Hook, the University of South Dakota art professor, deleted his remarks after a few hours, and shared an apology that stated he regretted the original post. Through his lawyer, Hook declined to be interviewed.",
      "Hook filed a motion Tuesday to get an emergency order to block the university from moving forward with the next step in his termination process. He alleges his firing stems from angering \u201cthe wrong people,\u201d noting that the governor and speaker of the state house had called for his termination. \u201cWhen I read this post, I was shaking mad,\u201d Gov. Larry Rhoden posted on X.",
      "An online petition to reinstate Hook has over 8,000 signatures.",
      "In many cases, Goldstein said, the teacher's punishment seems disproportionate to their alleged offense, noting that an inappropriate post could be flagged without termination.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very weird to live in a world where Charlie\u2019s wife can forgive the shooter,\u201d Goldstein said, \u201cbut we can\u2019t forgive a teacher who quoted him.\u201d"

      "Oscar-winning actor Jessica Chastain said Wednesday she isn't \"aligned\" with Apple on the company\u2019s decision to postpone the debut of \"The Savant,\" a streaming series about an investigator who infiltrates online hate groups.",
      "\"I want to say how much I value my partnership with Apple. They\u2019ve been incredible collaborators and I deeply respect their team,\" Chastain said in a post on her Instagram account. \"That said, I wanted to reach out and let you know that we\u2019re not aligned on the decision to pause the release of The Savant.\"",
      "The first two episodes of \"The Savant\" were scheduled to premiere Friday. But in a brief statement to Variety this week, an Apple TV+ spokesperson said the platform decided to postpone the show\u2019s rollout after \"careful consideration,\" adding: \"We appreciate your understanding and look forward to releasing the series at a future date.\"",
      "Apple TV+ did not identify an exact reason for the show\u2019s delay or specify the considerations it weighed. The decision came two weeks after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot at an event in Utah. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, has said the suspect in Kirk\u2019s killing was influenced by what he characterized as \"leftist ideology.\"",
      "\"The Savant\" was adapted from a 2019 article published in the magazine Cosmopolitan titled \"Is It Possible to Stop a Mass Shooting Before It Happens?\" The miniseries stars Chastain as a woman who \"infiltrates online hate groups in an effort to stop domestic extremists before they act,\" according to Apple\u2019s press materials.",
      "\"In the last five years since we\u2019ve been making the show,\" Chastain said in her Instagram post, \"we\u2019ve seen an unfortunate amount of violence in the United States.\"",
      "She listed examples of such violence, including the attempted kidnapping of Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol; the two assassination attempts on President Donald Trump; the assassination of a Democratic lawmaker in Minnesota; and the fatal shooting of Kirk.",
      "\"These incidents, though far from encompassing the full range of violence witnessed in the United States, illustrate a broader mindset that crosses the political spectrum and must be confronted,\" Chastain said. \"I've never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish this show wasn\u2019t so relevant, unfortunately it is.\"",
      "\"While I respect Apple's decision to pause the release for now, I remain hopeful the show will reach audiences soon,\" Chastain added.",
      "Spokespeople for Apple TV+ did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment on Chastain's post.",
      "Apple postponed \"The Savant\" at an especially tense moment for American media companies as they navigate political pressure, regulatory scrutiny and a polarized viewing public.",
      "Disney, for example, became embroiled in a national firestorm over its decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s late-night talk show following criticism from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr. Kimmel returned to ABC\u2019s lineup Tuesday night, but two companies that own affiliate stations are still refusing to air his show.",
      "Apple CEO Tim Cook is also attempting to walk a fine line with the Trump administration. Apple has pledged to invest $600 billion in the U.S. over the next four years as it works to avoid tariffs on items used in iPhones and other key products.",
      "Chastain is best known for the movies \"The Help,\" \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and \"Interstellar.\" She won an Academy Award for best actress in 2022 for her title role in the biopic \"The Eyes of Tammy Faye.\""

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/private-health-insurers-use-ai-approve-deny-care-soon-medicare-will-rcna233214",
    "published": "Wed, 24 Sep 2025 09:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Taking a page from the private insurance industry\u2019s playbook, Medicare will launch an AI program for prior authorizations.",
    "story": [
      "Taking a page from the private insurance industry\u2019s playbook, the Trump administration will launch a program next year to find out how much money an artificial intelligence algorithm could save the federal government by denying care to Medicare patients.",
      "The pilot program, designed to weed out wasteful, \u201clow-value\u201d services, amounts to a federal expansion of an unpopular process called prior authorization, which requires patients or someone on their medical team to seek insurance approval before proceeding with certain procedures, tests, and prescriptions. It will affect Medicare patients, and the doctors and hospitals who care for them, in Arizona, Ohio, Oklahoma, New Jersey, Texas, and Washington, starting Jan. 1 and running through 2031.",
      "The move has raised eyebrows among politicians and policy experts. The traditional version of Medicare, which covers adults 65 and older and some people with disabilities, has mostly eschewed prior authorization. Still, it is widely used by private insurers, especially in the Medicare Advantage market.",
      "And the timing was surprising: The pilot was announced in late June, just days after the Trump administration unveiled a voluntary effort by private health insurers to revamp and reduce their own use of prior authorization, which causes care to be \u201csignificantly delayed,\u201d said Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "\u201cIt erodes public trust in the health care system,\u201d Oz told the media. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we can\u2019t tolerate in this administration.\u201d",
      "But some critics, like Dr. Vinay Rathi, an Ohio State University doctor and policy researcher, have accused the Trump administration of sending mixed messages.",
      "On one hand, the federal government wants to borrow cost-cutting measures used by private insurance, he said. \u201cOn the other, it slaps them on the wrist.\u201d",
      "Administration officials are \u201ctalking out of both sides of their mouth,\u201d said Rep. Suzan DelBene, a Washington Democrat. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely concerning.\u201d",
      "Patients, doctors and other lawmakers have also been critical of what they see as delay-or-deny tactics, which can slow down or block access to care, causing irreparable harm and even death.",
      "\u201cInsurance companies have put it in their mantra that they will take patients\u2019 money and then do their damnedest to deny giving it to the people who deliver care,\u201d said Rep. Greg Murphy, a North Carolina Republican and a urologist. \u201cThat goes on in every insurance company boardroom.\u201d",
      "Insurers have long argued that prior authorization reduces fraud and wasteful spending, as well as prevents potential harm. Public displeasure with insurance denials dominated the news in December, when the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO led many to anoint his alleged killer as a folk hero.",
      "And the public broadly dislikes the practice: Nearly three-quarters of respondents thought prior authorization was a \u201cmajor\u201d problem in a July poll published by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Indeed, Oz said during his June press conference that \u201cviolence in the streets\u201d prompted the Trump administration to take on the issue of prior authorization reform in the private insurance industry.",
      "Still, the administration is expanding the use of prior authorization in Medicare. CMS spokesperson Alexx Pons said both initiatives \u201cserve the same goal of protecting patients and Medicare dollars.\u201d",
      "Unanswered questions",
      "The pilot program, WISeR \u2014 short for \u201cWasteful and Inappropriate Service Reduction\u201d \u2014 will test the use of an AI algorithm in making prior authorization decisions for some Medicare services, including skin and tissue substitutes, electrical nerve stimulator implants, and knee arthroscopy.",
      "The federal government says such procedures are particularly vulnerable to \u201cfraud, waste, and abuse\u201d and could be held in check by prior authorization.",
      "Other procedures may be added to the list. But services that are inpatient-only, emergency or \u201cwould pose a substantial risk to patients if significantly delayed\u201d would not be subject to the AI model\u2019s assessment, according to the federal announcement.",
      "While the use of AI in health insurance isn\u2019t new, Medicare has been slow to adopt the private-sector tools. Medicare has historically used prior authorization in a limited way, with contractors who aren\u2019t incentivized to deny services. But experts who have studied the plan believe the federal pilot could change that.",
      "Pons told KFF Health News that no Medicare request will be denied before being reviewed by a \u201cqualified human clinician,\u201d and that vendors \u201care prohibited from compensation arrangements tied to denial rates.\u201d While the government says vendors will be rewarded for savings, Pons said multiple safeguards will \u201cremove any incentive to deny medically appropriate care.\u201d",
      "\u201cShared savings arrangements mean that vendors financially benefit when less care is delivered,\u201d a structure that can create a powerful incentive for companies to deny medically necessary care, said Jennifer Brackeen, senior director of government affairs for the Washington State Hospital Association.",
      "And doctors and policy experts say that\u2019s only one concern.",
      "Rathi said the plan \u201cis not fully fleshed out\u201d and relies on \u201cmessy and subjective\u201d measures. The model, he said, ultimately depends on contractors to assess their own results, a choice that makes the results potentially suspect.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure they know, even, how they\u2019re going to figure out whether this is helping or hurting patients,\u201d he said.",
      "Pons said the use of AI in the Medicare pilot will be \u201csubject to strict oversight to ensure transparency, accountability, and alignment with Medicare rules and patient protection.\u201d",
      "\u201cCMS remains committed to ensuring that automated tools support, not replace, clinically sound decision-making,\u201d he said.",
      "Experts agree that AI is theoretically capable of expediting what has been a cumbersome process marked by delays and denials that can harm patients\u2019 health. Health insurers have argued that AI eliminates human error and bias and will save the health care system money. These companies have also insisted that humans, not computers, are ultimately reviewing coverage decisions.",
      "But some scholars are doubtful that\u2019s routinely happening.",
      "\u201cI think that there\u2019s also probably a little bit of ambiguity over what constitutes \u2018meaningful human review,\u2019\u201d said Amy Killelea, an assistant research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.",
      "A 2023 report published by ProPublica found that, over a two-month period, doctors at Cigna who reviewed requests for payment spent an average of only 1.2 seconds on each case.",
      "Cigna spokesperson Justine Sessions told KFF Health News that the company does not use AI to deny care or claims. The ProPublica investigation referenced a \u201csimple software-driven process that helped accelerate payments to clinicians for common, relatively low-cost tests and treatments, and it is not powered by AI,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cIt was not used for prior authorizations.\u201d",
      "And yet class-action lawsuits filed against major health insurers have alleged that flawed AI models undermine doctor recommendations and fail to take patients\u2019 unique needs into account, forcing some people to shoulder the financial burden of their care.",
      "Meanwhile, a survey of physicians published by the American Medical Association in February found that 61% think AI is \u201cincreasing prior authorization denials, exacerbating avoidable patient harms and escalating unnecessary waste now and into the future.\u201d",
      "Chris Bond, a spokesperson for the insurers\u2019 trade group AHIP, told KFF Health News that the organization is \u201czeroed in\u201d on implementing the commitments made to the government. Those include reducing the scope of prior authorization and making sure that communications with patients about denials and appeals are easy to understand.",
      "\u2018This is a pilot\u2019",
      "The Medicare pilot program underscores ongoing concerns about prior authorization and raises new ones.",
      "While private health insurers have been opaque about how they use AI and the extent to which they use prior authorization, policy researchers believe these algorithms are often programmed to automatically deny high-cost care.",
      "\u201cThe more expensive it is, the more likely it is to be denied,\u201d said Jennifer Oliva, a professor at the Maurer School of Law at Indiana University-Bloomington, whose work focuses on AI regulation and health coverage.",
      "Oliva explained in a recent paper for the Indiana Law Journal that when a patient is expected to die within a few years, health insurers are \u201cmotivated to rely on the algorithm.\u201d As time passes and the patient or their provider is forced to appeal a denial, the chance of the patient dying during that process increases. The longer an appeal, the less likely the health insurer is to pay the claim, Oliva said.",
      "\u201cThe No. 1 thing to do is make it very, very difficult for people to get high-cost services,\u201d she said.",
      "As the use of AI by health insurers is poised to grow, insurance company algorithms amount to a \u201cregulatory blind spot\u201d and demand more scrutiny, said Carmel Shachar, a faculty director at Harvard Law School\u2019s Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation.",
      "The WISeR pilot is \u201can interesting step\u201d toward using AI to ensure that Medicare dollars are purchasing high-quality health care, she said. But the lack of details makes it difficult to determine whether it will work.",
      "Politicians are grappling with some of the same questions.",
      "\u201cHow is this being tested in the first place? How are you going to make sure that it is working and not denying care or producing higher rates of care denial?\u201d asked DelBene, who signed an August letter to Oz with other Democrats demanding answers about the AI program. But Democrats aren\u2019t the only ones worried.",
      "Murphy, who co-chairs the House GOP Doctors Caucus, acknowledged that many physicians are concerned the WISeR pilot could overreach into their practice of medicine if the AI algorithm denies doctor-recommended care.",
      "Meanwhile, House members of both parties recently supported a measure proposed by Rep. Lois Frankel, a Florida Democrat, to block funding for the pilot in the fiscal 2026 budget of the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "AI in health care is here to stay, Murphy said, but it remains to be seen whether the WISeR pilot will save Medicare money or contribute to the problems already posed by prior authorization.",
      "\u201cThis is a pilot, and I\u2019m open to see what\u2019s going to happen with this,\u201d Murphy said, \u201cbut I will always, always err on the side that doctors know what\u2019s best for their patients.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Anyone scrolling through TikTok this week may be wondering what's fueling chatter about the Rapture.",
      "Videos with the hashtag #Rapture have gone viral in recent days, with some Christians stating Jesus Christ will return to Earth on Sept. 23 or 24 to collect true believers and bring them back to heaven with him. The event would mark the beginning of what some believers call the \"end times\" \u2014 or essentially, the end of human history.",
      "On the flip side, others are creating their own videos satirizing the idea of the Rapture. In other words, it's been a lively week on social media. Read on to learn what #RaptureTok is all about.",
      "What is the Rapture?",
      "\u201cRapture is a theological belief within some strands of Christianity,\" Malynda Hale, activist and executive director of the progressive Christian nonprofit the New Evangelicals, tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"They believe that all the good Christians that have given their life over to Jesus and declare him as their Lord and Savior will be taken up. Those who are not saved will remain on Earth to endure prolonged suffering,\" she continues.",
      "Some Christians, particularly evangelical Christians, believe the Bible predicts the rapture with the passage 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17. The passage describes a moment that believers are \"caught up together ... in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air,\" per the King James Bible.",
      "\"Not all sectors of Christianity believe it,\" Hale says, but adds the reason it's \"popular\" with American evangelicals is because of the faith's focus on the afterlife.",
      "\"The afterlife is what matters. That's eternity. That's where we are immortal. Earth is just a small blip,\" she summarizes.",
      "Why did people think the Rapture will happen on Sept. 23 and 24?",
      "The dates this week were predicted by Joshua Mhlakela, a man from South Africa interviewed in a video posted to the Centtwinz TV YouTube channel.",
      "\"The time of The Rapture is at hand,\" Mhlakela said in the June 2025 video.",
      "Mhlakela said that Jesus told him in a 2018 dream, \u201cOn the 23rd and the 24th of September, 2025, I will come to take my church.\u201d",
      "\"He says to me \u2014 another thing that I forgot \u2014 is, 'In these two days, no one knows which days, or which hour, I will come,\" he said. Mhlakela was emphatic: \"There are many dates out there, but the one that I'm telling you is the true one.\"",
      "He also predicted that the end of the world would come after the Rapture, and that Jesus would rule on Earth in September 2032. In a livestream on Sept. 23, Mhlakela stood by his predictions, saying \"everything in me knows\" he would not be here on Sept. 25.",
      "Hale isn't sure what about Mhlakela's predictions made them take off recently, but has a feeling it has to do with the dates' alignment Rosh Hashanah, or the Jewish New Year, which he pointed out in the initial prediction.",
      "Still, Hale says, \"I couldn't tell you what it was about him that has really made people kind of panic and believe that this is actually the one.\"",
      "Have other dates for the Rapture been predicted?",
      "The prophecy has since gone viral, with many sharing the video on social media \u2014 but, Hale points out, Mhlakela is hardly the first person to make such a prediction.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time that we\u2019ve had Rapture theology come to the forefront,\u201d Hale says.",
      "There\u2019s a long history of people predicting when the Rapture will happen, in fact. Countless people have shared their own predictions \u2014 on social media and otherwise \u2014 which are often based on visions, biblical interpretations and, sometimes, numerology.",
      "Take Harold Camping, for example. In 2005, the American radio broadcaster and evangelist relied on his own interpretation of the book of Genesis to predict the Rapture was coming in 2011, according to NBC News' reporting at the time. (Camping had previously predicted the event would occur on three different dates in 1994.)",
      "As for TikTok, as long as the platform has been active, believers have gathered to discuss the Rapture and other theological issues, even tackling the question of whether our pets get taken to heaven with us when the Rapture finally happens.",
      "What are people saying about the Rapture on TikTok?",
      "Some Christians on TikTok have shared videos filled with tips for other believers so they can be sure Jesus takes them home.",
      "\"The day of the lord is near, folks. Are you ready? Repent of your sins. Put your faith in Jesus,\" one user instructed viewers.",
      "An account called christwillreturn has posted several videos of believers happily waiting for Jesus Christ's return. Another account called christianquotes89 posted a video of two men sharing calm words to non-believers who will be left behind during the Rapture.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering, where did the missing people go? What\u2019s going on? I imagine you\u2019re pretty afraid and looking for answers,\u201d one of the men explains.",
      "He goes on to say he and others believers are now \"with Jesus.\"",
      "Others are stressed by the idea of the Rapture. One TikToker who spent an hour on RaptureTok cried at the thought of only having a few more days with her children.",
      "The \"actual logistics\" of the Rapture are \"terrifying\" to those who believe, Hale says. \"But for them, it's really like, 'I finally get to go be with Jesus. That's eternal life.'\"",
      "As of Sept. 24, the Rapture hasn't happened. \"I think it could leave people really disoriented,\" Hale says of the experience, adding that they could be \"spiritually shaken.\"",
      "\"I think it's very concerning that people aren't thinking about the ramifications of pushing this theory because they're so convinced it's the truth.\""

    "summary": "How does the new Jude Law and Jason Bateman series end? What happens to Jake and Vince? Who dies? Who are the robbers?",
    "story": [
      "Whose ears weren't pricked up by hearing about Jude Law and Jason Bateman being tapped to play estranged brothers in Netflix's new drama \"Black Rabbit\"?",
      "We 100 percent bounced into that limited series the minute it dropped Sept. 18. So did the rockers-turned-restaurateurs patch up their differences and find a happily ever after?",
      "Spoiler alert: Yes, and no. \"Rabbit\" took viewers down a long, twisting road of broken relationships, bad debts, and family trauma. So how did things end up for Vince (Bateman) and Jake (Law) in the end?",
      "Here\u2019s what we know. Warning, even more spoilers lie ahead!",
      "What Is 'Black Rabbit' About?",
      "When \"Black Rabbit\" begins, Jake and Vince haven't seen each other in years. (There are a lot of time-jump flashbacks so we can see where and how things went wrong.)",
      "The bros used to be in a somewhat popular band together (watching Law do Kurt Cobain-esque grunge is a particular treat), but after that ended they poured their hearts and money into a restaurant/VIP lounge called Black Rabbit based in Brooklyn, right by the iconic bridge.",
      "But demons from his past have let Vince rack up several sorts of trouble, including substance abuse and debts \u2014 and years ago he fled New York City, leaving a daughter, his brother, the restaurant and those debts behind.",
      "Meanwhile, Jake has been working hard to turn Black Rabbit into the next \u201cit\u201d restaurant while also turning a blind eye to activities among his shadier patrons in the upstairs lounge. Throughout the series he bounces between relationships with his ex-wife; his bartender Anna (who is drugged and sexually assaulted by art gallery owner Jules, played by John Ales); Joe, an old family friend (and small-time mob boss played by Oscar-winner Troy Kotsur); Wes (Sope Dirisu), one of his investors in the restaurant, and Roxie (Amaka Okafor), his talented chef, among many others.",
      "When Vince returns to town after burning bridges out West, though, the juggling act Jake has been starting to master crumbles bit by bit \u2014 thanks in part to Vince\u2019s outstanding debts with Joe.",
      "Why Did Vince and Jake Have Problems with Each Other?",
      "Money is the current-day problem for both brothers \u2014 Vince owes Mancuso, who alternates between trying to make it right with him and sending his bumbling, vicious henchmen (Junior, played by Forrest Weber; and Babbit, played by Chris Coy)  after him, while Jake keeps juggling funds to try and take over the kitchen at a classic New York City restaurant (the real-life, former Four Seasons).",
      "But both are plagued by issues dating back to childhood. Viewers learn early on that their parents are no longer in the picture, and that their childhood home has to be cleaned out and sold (again, to give them some liquid cash) \u2014 and they know the Friedken brothers\u2019 father died many years ago.",
      "What viewers don't know until the end of the series is just how their father died \u2014 and why.",
      "Turns out that the brothers\u2019 parents had a tumultuous relationship that came to a head one night when their father abused their mother \u2026 and Vince tried protecting her by dropping a bowling ball on their father\u2019s head. For years he thought he\u2019d saved Jake from knowing what happened, but Jake admits he did witness what happened, but said nothing.",
      "What Happened to Anna?",
      "Bartender Anna is one of the true tragedies of the story. Sexually assaulted at the club early on, she refuses to come back to work. Jake, not knowing at the time what happened, fires her.",
      "Over time, the chance that she might tell her story to a reporter leads to two separate sets of visitors: Campbell, lawyer of the art gallery dealer who raped her (\"The Gilded Age's\" Morgan Spector), who convinces her to leave the country \u2014 and Babbit and Junior.",
      "Babbit and Junior, sent by Vince, show up as she's preparing to go to the airport. As she tries to escape them, she falls and hits her head in the bathroom, which kills her.",
      "Who Are the 'Black Rabbit' Robbers?",
      "The idea to rob the Rabbit originates with Jake, who knows there will be valuable jewelry in the Rabbit on a particular night, and that the jewelry can be turned into cash to pay for various debts.",
      "But he backs out of the plan, thinking it will collapse without him. Junior and Vince go forward with it, storming the restaurant wearing masks and waving guns.",
      "How Does \u2018Black Rabbit\u2019 End?",
      "Before Vince left town originally, he and a co-worker/friend named Trevor (Michael Patrick Thornton) drunkenly dared one another to leap from one building to another, and while Vince dodged the jump at the last minute, his friend was seriously injured.",
      "Trevor relates this story in front of a crowd at the Rabbit early on in the series, ending with, \u201cSo as I see it, you owe me a jump.\u201d",
      "This might seem like a passing mention \u2014 but in the series\u2019 final episode, as everything crashes down around the brothers, Vince and Jake both have to reckon with the decisions they\u2019d made, and their relationships. Trying to outrun the cops, the brothers take a moment to finally confess their sins to one another \u2014 including Vince telling Jake, \u201cI killed our dad.\u201d And Jake saying, \u201cI know.\u201d",
      "The pair end up on the roof of the Rabbit with the walls closing in. Vince calls in his location to the police and confesses to his recent crimes and some old ones. Jake tries to tell him they\u2019d figure it all out and everything would be fine, but Vince says, \u201cI should have untied you years ago,\u201d then looks out at the Brooklyn Bridge and notes, \u201cI owe a jump.\u201d",
      "A moment later, when Jake turns his back on Vince for a moment \u2014 Vince pays his debt, purposefully falling backwards off the roof.",
      "As the series concludes, Jake listens to his brother on old tapes they\u2019d made when they were in the band, then later goes back to work as a bartender at someone else\u2019s restaurant while Ella Fitzgerald\u2019s classic \u201cManhattan\u201d plays in the background."

      "Fishel and Pashkov received scores of 7, 6 and 6, which will keep them on the show for another week, despite facing a double elimination. Cast members Corey Feldman and Baron Davis were sent home at the end of the night.",
      "Fishel first mentioned that her hamstring had a \"minor tear\" on the Sept. 17 episode of her \"DWTS\" podcast, \"Danielle With the Stars.\"",
      "\u201cRight before I went out for the live show, after having gone all out for five other runs for dress rehearsal and practice, my legs started really getting tight and I was like, \u2018What am I going to do?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I kept trying to stretch a little bit, wasn\u2019t really working. It was really cramping and then adrenaline just took over in the middle of the dance and I was able to do it.\u201d",
      "She said she had been icing her leg twice per night, plus taking Epsom salt baths and ibuprofen to help with the pain.",
      "For Episode 3, Fishel and the remaining 11 dancers will be tackling \"TikTok Night\" on Sept. 30 as they dance to songs that have become popular from the app.",
      "\"Dancing With the Stars\" airs on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC and Disney+, and can be streamed the next day on Hulu."

      "Daly explained that he\u2019s seen singers \u201cfall through the cracks and I\u2019ve never been able to do anything about it, until right now.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re just too good to let go,\u201d Daly told Mitchell, adding that he believes that in his \u201csecond and last chance\u201d he could get a chair turn.",
      "In the Sept. 23 episode, Mitchell returned to the stage and sang \u201c...Baby One More Time\u201d by Britney Spears. This time, McEntire turned her chair and secured Mitchell's participation in the show.",
      "\u201cBeing a callback from Carson Daly, wouldn\u2019t that be cool if he won the whole thing,\u201d McEntire said."

      "Fast forward February 2024. Sen announced on Tumblr that they had signed a book deal for their debut novel \"Alchemised,\" describing it as \"a standalone dark fantasy set in a war-torn world of necromancy and alchemy.\"",
      "In their post, they confirmed \"Alchemised\" will be \"a reimagined version of 'Manacled.'\"",
      "\"Alchemised\" officially hit shelves on Sept. 23. The film rights were also sold this month, the author confirmed in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. Here's what to know about SenLinYu's debut novel and how it relates to \"Manacled.\"",
      "What Is 'Manacled' About?",
      "\"Manacled\" opens with a dark alternate ending to the original plot of the \"Harry Potter\" books and movies. The first scene sees Hermione held captive in darkness for an indeterminate amount of time. It's later revealed that she's been imprisoned for years after the bloody end of the war. Harry Potter and her allies are long dead, and Lord Voldemort has established a totalitarian regime.",
      "Hermione soon realizes she's missing years worth of memories. As one of the final members of the Order of the Phoenix, Voldemort tries to extract any intel she may have, but he fails, as the memories are concealed even to herself.",
      "The story then takes inspiration from \"The Handmaid's Tale.\" After the devastation of the war, the government seeks to repopulate the wizarding world, and Hermione is forced into a surrogacy program. She's assigned to be a surrogate for the High Reeve, one of the most senior operatives in Voldemort's army, eventually revealed to be Hermione's old school nemesis, Draco Malfoy.",
      "The fan fiction is firmly for mature audiences, with dark themes and trigger warnings including non-consensual sex, graphic violence and psychological torture.",
      "As Hermione tries to resurface her memories and survive in Draco's manor, she realizes why they were concealed in the first place. The narrative eventually introduces a collection of flashbacks, which force Hermione to rethink everything she thought she knew about the war and her role in it.",
      "How To Read 'Manacled'",
      "While \"Manacled\" was originally free to read on AO3, it was officially removed from the platform at the end of 2024, prior to the release of \"Alchemised.\"",
      "At present, there's no way to read \"Manacled\" unless a reader had downloaded it from AO3 prior to its removal.",
      "\"People are being given lots of time to save a copy,\u201d Sen told TODAY.com in an interview in February 2024. \u201cSo if they want that version, if that\u2019s the version that\u2019s the most special to them, they are welcome to keep that. \u2026 But this is sort of my way of taking ownership back.\u201d",
      "Do You Have to Read 'Manacled' Before Reading 'Alchemised'?",
      "No, you do not have to have read \"Manacled\" to appreciate \"Alchemised.\"",
      "Sen emphatically made this point with a post to their Instagram story on Sept. 20.",
      "\"Stop telling people that it's necessary to read Manacled before reading Alchemised,\" they wrote in all-caps, later adding, \"people making this claim have not read both and are speaking from a place of zero authority.\"",
      "\"There's been an absolutely massive explosion in illegal sales and listings because of this,\" they concluded.",
      "In their initial announcement of \"Alchemised,\" Sen said part of the of the goal in reimagining \"Manacled\" was to combat illegal sales of the fan fiction.",
      "They previously told TODAY.com that \"Alchemised\" was mostly being written for new readers.",
      "\u201cThe priority is to try to tell a similarly moving story, but to people that haven\u2019t already experienced it once,\" Sen said at the time.",
      "What To Expect From 'Alchemised'",
      "\"Alchemised,\" like \"Manacled,\" will spotlight a rebel healer with amnesia who's sent to live with her world's High Reeve. And like \"Manacled,\" it's a massive story, clocking in at 1,040 pages.",
      "But the rest of the story will introduce readers to a brand new world, brand new characters and a brand new magic system.",
      "Read the full synopsis here:",
      "\u201cWhat is it you think you\u2019re protecting in that brain of yours? The war is over. Holdfast is dead. The Eternal Flame extinguished. There\u2019s no one left for you to save.\u201d",
      "Once a promising alchemist, Helena Marino is now a prisoner \u2014 of war and of her own mind. Her Resistance friends and allies have been brutally murdered, her abilities suppressed, and the world she knew destroyed.",
      "In the aftermath of a long war, Paladia\u2019s new ruling class of corrupt guild families and depraved necromancers, whose vile undead creatures helped bring about their victory, holds Helena captive.",
      "According to Resistance records, she was a healer of little importance within their ranks. But Helena has inexplicable memory loss of the months leading up to her capture, making her enemies wonder: Is she truly as insignificant as she appears, or are her lost memories hiding some vital piece of the Resistance\u2019s final gambit?",
      "To uncover the memories buried deep within her mind, Helena is sent to the High Reeve, one of the most powerful and ruthless necromancers in this new world. Trapped on his crumbling estate, Helena\u2019s fight \u2014 to protect her lost history and to preserve the last remaining shreds of her former self \u2014 is just beginning. For her prison and captor have secrets of their own ... secrets Helena must unearth, whatever the cost."

    "story": [
      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 You'd forgive Ukrainians double-checking their Truth Social feeds.",
      "There was a mix of astonishment and reservation in Kyiv on Wednesday \u2014 contrasted with bitter dismissal and some mocking defiance in Moscow \u2014 after President Donald Trump said Ukraine could reclaim all of its territory, a dramatic change in rhetoric on the war.",
      "The Kremlin rejected Trump\u2019s description of Russia as a \u201cpaper tiger,\u201d saying its military was advancing and its economy stable rather than suffering \"big\" problems as the president suggested. But in Ukraine, the sudden reversal was greeted cautiously as a welcome shift from the U.S. leader that still left much to be answered.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly insisted that giving up territory to Russia in a peace deal was not an option, and hailed the \u201cbig shift\u201d in Trump\u2019s position after meeting with him in New York.",
      "\"Of course, we are doing everything to make sure Europe really helps, and of course we count on the United States,\" he told the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, while expressing his appreciation for the support.",
      "\"But in the end, peace depends on all of us,\" he said.",
      "Trump had long maintained that an end to the war would require Ukraine ceding territory, but months of failed diplomacy have seemingly fueled frustrations with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.",
      "\"I was almost amazed to hear it from him, it was powerful,\" Maryna Lozova, 32, said. \"But there is one huge \u201cbut\u201d \u2014 we should definitely remember how often he changes his mind, and how crazy some of his ideas are,\" the housewife in Kyiv told NBC News.",
      "Others were similarly reluctant to celebrate given what they saw as a number of recent U-turns on the subject, as Trump first welcomed Putin to Alaska, then met with Zelenskyy and European leaders, each time leaving his guests feeling positive about their efforts.",
      "\u201cI would like to believe in deeds, not words,\u201d said Volodymyr Rzhavskyy, a 44-year-old entrepreneur from the front-line Donetsk region. He called on Trump to \u201cprovide Ukraine with maximum opportunity to regain its territorial integrity.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that if we really are provided with enough weapons and the support we need, then we have the opportunity to return our land,\u201d he said.",
      "Lozova said she knew \"for sure, that Ukraine can return the territories,\" and was thankful that \u201cfinally, someone recognizes this and does not question it.\u201d",
      "But she pointed to Trump's comment in his lengthy Truth Social post that it was with help from Europe and NATO, not the U.S., that Ukraine might retake its land. \"That raises some questions,\" she said.",
      "For once, there was a similar message from some prominent voices in Russia.",
      "\u201cYes, Trump suddenly told the world about his love for Ukraine,\u201d said Konstantin Malofeyev, an ultranationalist tycoon and political influencer.",
      "\u201cBut the main point ... is that the U.S. is washing its hands of the matter,\" he said.",
      "The Kremlin was eager to push back on Trump's argument, which it said defied the reality on the battlefield, where Russia has continued to make slow and costly gains.",
      "The idea that Ukraine can \"win back something is, from our point of view, an erroneous talking point,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Russia was not a paper tiger, he said in an earlier radio interview, but \"more often associated with a bear. And paper bears don\u2019t exist.\"",
      "Russia currently controls roughly 19% of Ukraine following its full-scale invasion of the country in 2022, according to open source maps of the battlefield cited by Reuters. Peskov claimed its advance may be slow in a deliberate bid to minimize casualties.",
      "\u201cOf course, President Trump heard Zelenskyy\u2019s version of events. And apparently at this point, this version is the reason for the assessment we heard,\u201d Peskov said.",
      "Moscow will be able to make its case later Wednesday, when Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov meets with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "The U.S. is just \u201cone phone call to the Kremlin away from a potential shift back again,\u201d said Neil Melvin, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute.",
      "\u201cIf Trump feels that there is a possibility of a peace agreement, then I think he would put all options back on the table again,\u201d he told NBC News, adding it was \u201cout of the scope for Ukraine, at the moment, to reclaim the lost territories.\u201d",
      "And there was confidence in Russia that another Trump reversal may be on the cards.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll be back,\u201d said former President Dmitry Medvedev, who accused Trump of having slipped \u201cinto an alternate reality\u201d with his Ukraine-friendly comments. \u201cHe always comes back.\u201d",

      "Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) which was sailing near Greece as of early Wednesday, according its online tracker, also saw its communications \u201cjammed,\u201d its organizers said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWe are witnessing these psychological operations first-hand, right now, but we will not be intimidated,\u201d they added. \u201cSumud\u201d in Arabic means \u201csteadfastness\u201d or \u201csteadfast perseverance.\u201d",
      "In an online video shared by GSF overnight, a bright light can be seen piercing the darkness, before a loud blast rings out. Organizers said that the video was filmed from one of its boats, Spectre, and that it captured one of the explosions heard by crew members.",
      "In a separate video posted by Yasemin Acar on the vessel Alma, music from the pop group ABBA, whose members, like Thunberg hail from Sweden, can be heard ringing out. \u201cThey\u2019re jamming our radio,\u201d Acar says in the post, adding, \u201cWe do not know where this is coming from, the sound, but other vessels are experiencing the same thing.\u201d",
      "Thunberg told Reuters in a video interview Tuesday that drones were flying above them every night \u201cbut for Palestinians, especially in Gaza, those drones are dropping bombs constantly.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis mission is about Gaza, it isn\u2019t about us. And no risks that we could take could even come close to the risks the Palestinians are facing every day,\u201d she said.",

      "But the Israeli Foreign Ministry condemned the flotilla Monday. Without providing any evidence, Oren Marmorstein, a spokesperson for the ministry, said in a statement on X that  the flotilla was \u201corganized by Hamas\u201d and \u201cintended to serve Hamas.\u201d",
      "He added that Israel would not allow the flotilla to \u201center an active combat zone and will not allow the breach of a lawful naval blockade.\u201d",

      "The Tunisian Interior Ministry said at the time that reports of a drone hitting a boat at its Sidi Bou Said port had \u201cno basis in truth,\u201d and that a fire broke out on the vessel itself, according to Reuters.",
      "The latest accusations come as Israeli forces continue their devastating assault on Gaza City that has seen scores killed in recent days and forced the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. Deaths from starvation have also continued to rise in the enclave this month, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led attacks in 2023, when 1,200 people were killed and around 250 were taken hostage, according to Israeli officials, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict. Since then, Palestinian health officials say, more than 65,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, while much of the enclave has been reduced to rubble.",
      "This week, Tom Barrack, the U.S. special envoy to Syria and ambassador to Turkey, accused Israel of \u201cattacking everybody,\u201d in an interview with The National, the state-owned English-language daily newspaper based in the United Arab Emirates.",

But without further action, including sanctions against Israel, he said the move will do little to \"change the lives of Palestinians\" on the ground.",
      "\"It's really a step in the right direction,\" Baskin said in a phone interview Monday of the summit at the General Assembly.

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has said he hopes to see Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan returned to U.S. control, suggesting a renewed American presence in the country now again ruled by the Taliban.",
      "\"We're trying to get it back,\" Trump said of Bagram during a news conference Thursday alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer that capped a whirlwind state visit to the United Kingdom.",
      "Taking aim at the Biden administration's fraught withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan as a \"total disaster,\" Trump criticized the decision to relinquish Bagram Airfield, which quickly fell under the control of the Taliban as they swept back into power in 2021.",
      "\"We gave it to them for nothing,\" said Trump, who has long criticized the Biden administration's handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. \"We want that base back,\" he said.",
      "About an hour's drive north of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, Bagram served for years as a crucial hub in the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. At its peak around 2012, the sprawling airfield saw more than 100,000 U.S. troops pass through its compound.",
      "Late Thursday, Zakir Jalaly, an official at the Afghan Foreign Ministry, dismissed the idea of Bagram returning to the U.S.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan and the U.S. need to interact with each other and can have economic and political relations based on mutual respect and common interests,\u201d Jalaly said on the social platform X. \u201cThe Afghans have not accepted a military presence in history, and this possibility was completely rejected during the Doha talks and agreement, but the door is open for further interaction.\u201d",
      "Trump made clear at least one motivating factor for his interest in reclaiming Bagram, noting its proximity to rival superpower China.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,\u201d Trump said during his comments Thursday, which came a day before he was spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid ongoing trade negotiations.",
      "Addressing journalists later on Air Force One, Trump said Bagram was \"one of the most powerful bases in the world in terms of runway strength and length,\" adding: \"You could land anything there.\" He emphasized again that the base was \"an hour away from where they make their missiles \u2014 China.\"",
      "Addressing Trump's comments Friday, Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that China \"respects Afghanistan\u2019s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.",
      "\"Afghanistan\u2019s future should be decided by its own people,\" Lin said, adding: \"Stirring up tension and creating confrontation in the region won\u2019t be popular.\"",
      "China, which has made strides in rapidly expanding its nuclear stockpile, is estimated to have accumulated about 600 warheads, according to the Chicago-based nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.",
      "Of course, greater surveillance on China wouldn't be the only advantage to regaining Bagram.",
      "A presence at the base could also aid in regional counterterrorism efforts, among other factors that could appeal to Trump.",
      "It remains unclear to what extent, if any, the U.S. has been in talks with the Taliban on the future of Bagram.",
      "\u201cEven if the Taliban considered this, China most certainly would do everything it can to entice the Taliban to keep the U.S. out of Afghanistan and has far more leverage and enticements to make this happen,\" Bill Roggio, editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 Long War Journal, cautioned in comments shared online Thursday.",
      "\"The Trump administration should be very careful not to grant the Taliban concessions only to be prevented access to Bagram in the end,\" he said.",
      "The Taliban have been working to rehabilitate their global standing, with the militant group freeing American George Glezmann, a Delta Air Lines mechanic, in March amid efforts to normalize relations between Afghanistan and the U.S.",
      "On Friday, the Taliban also released British couple Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband, Peter Reynolds, 80, who were detained by the Interior Ministry in February, according to Sky News, NBC News' sister outlet in the United Kingdom.",
      "Trump's comments came as the Pentagon continues to push ahead with a review into the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, during which 13 U.S. service members and 170 Afghans were killed at Kabul's airport in a bombing by the Islamic State terrorist group.",
      "Trump, who began the process for the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan during his first term, has been a fierce critic of the Biden administration's handling of the drawdown.",
      "The White House under President Joe Biden largely blamed the Trump administration for the chaotic withdrawal, with a National Security Council report released in 2023 arguing that Biden's options for executing the operation were \"severely constrained by conditions created by his predecessor.\""

    "summary": "A message from first Czech President Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk was sealed in an envelope before his death in 1937 and unveiled in a live broadcast Friday.",
    "story": [
      "\u201cIt is the end, but I\u2019m not afraid.\u201d",
      "That's the message delivered Friday to a nation on tenterhooks, sealed for nearly a century inside an envelope thought to carry its founding father's final words.",
      "The words of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk \u2014 the first president of an independent Czechoslovakia, which has since split into Czechia and Slovakia \u2014 were unveiled in a live broadcast attended by current Czech President Petr Pavel.",
      "Speculation had gone into overdrive prior to the announcement, with experts wondering whether Masaryk may have conveyed a fateful warning before Europe's descent back into war. His words are believed to have been dictated to his son Jan, surviving both World War II and subsequent communist rule.",
      "Jan\u2019s former secretary handed the envelope to the National Archives in 2005 on the condition that it not be opened for another 20 years.",
      "Even the Masaryk family did not know what mystery the white envelope contained. But when it was opened early Friday, it still managed to surprise.",
      "Inside was another yellow envelope, containing five pages of handwritten notes in Czech and English (Masaryk's wife, Charlotte Garrigue, was born in the United States.)",
      "Rather than a final message before his death in 1937, experts assessed that the message was instead dictated three years earlier.",
      "\u201cI am ill, seriously ill \u2014 it is the end, but I am not afraid. You will continue the work, you know how, but you must be careful. You know how to behave; I don\u2019t need to tell you anything more,\u201d the letter read, according to the country's official broadcaster.",
      "At the time, Masaryk was gravely ill after a stroke, and those around him thought his days were numbered.",
      "Masaryk became the first president of Czechoslovakia in 1918 after it declared independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was defeated in World War I. He served until 1935. Jan became foreign minister at the end of World War II, until his sudden death in 1948.",
      "In the envelope, Masaryk talked extensively about his death and subsequent funeral and reflected on the complex political situation in the ethnically diverse country.",
      "As well as derisive comments about a Slovak politician, he urged keeping the German minority part of the state. \u201cGive them what they deserve, but no more,\u201d he said of the Germans, according to the state broadcaster.",
      "\u201c[This was a] crucial time in Czechoslovakia with Hitler just coming to power in Germany,\u201d said Mark Cornwall, an emeritus professor of modern European history at the University of Southampton in England.",
      "\u201cIt was a very turbulent period in Europe about what was going to happen,\u201d said Cornwall, nodding to the Nazis' subsequent annexation of the Sudetenland, a Czech region that had a significant German-speaking population, and the later outbreak of World War II.",
      "\u201cMasaryk is still very revered\u201d in the country, Cornwall told NBC News in a telephone interview. \u201cI can\u2019t think of an American equivalent. Perhaps he\u2019s George Washington or Abraham Lincoln.\u201d"

      "But Wednesday, speaking from the top deck of a London bus, Khan said he was thankful for the \"record numbers of Americans\" coming to live in London, which he said was the highest since records began. \"There must be a reason for that,\" he said.",

      "Beneath the minor traffic-related indignity there was genuine friction between the two leaders this week. Macron had just announced that France would become the latest country to recognize Palestinian statehood \u2014 something Trump decried as a reward for Hamas' terror attack of Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "\"I think it honors Hamas and you can't do that because of October 7. You just can't do that,\" Trump told reporters while sitting next to Macron on Tuesday.",
      "The French leader retorted that \"nobody forgets the 7th of October, but after almost two years of war, what is the result.\" He added, \"This is not the right the right way to proceed.\"",
      "Macron added later Tuesday that if Trump wants his long-coveted Nobel Peace Prize then he needs to stop the war in Gaza.",
      "\"There is one person who can do something about it, and that is the U.S. president,\" Macron told France's BFMTV.  \"And the reason he can do more than us, is because we do not supply weapons that allow the war in Gaza to be waged. We do not supply equipment that allows war to be waged in Gaza. The United States of America does.\"",
      "Echoing the nuanced nature of their relationship, Trump did also say that Macron was \u201cdoing a really good job. He\u2019s fighting hard. He\u2019s fighting on a lot of fronts. He\u2019s helping with regard to the Russia, Ukraine catastrophe. And his words of wisdom mean a lot.\" He added, \"We\u2019ve been friends for a long time now, really from the first term on.\u201d",
      "France is the latest European country to formally recognize Palestine as a state, joining the United Kingdom and adding to a growing list of global nations that now numbers more than 145. The United States, along with Germany, Italy, Japan and a handful of others, are firmly in the minority.",
      "Macron has sought to cast himself as a Trump-whisperer who can act as a counterweight to the American leader: Someone who gets on with the president personally but is unafraid to stand up for European interests when the need arises.",
      "Nevertheless, their relationship has blown hot and cold.",
      "Personal interactions have been characterized by uncomfortably long handshakes and macho knee-slapping. And in June, Trump branded Macron as \u201cpublicity seeking\u201d leader who \u201calways gets it wrong,\u201d after Macron made comments about his counterpart\u2019s decision to leave the G-7 summit in Canada early.",
      "Though he didn't mention France by name, Trump during his U.N. address told European nations that \"your countries are going to hell\" because of their \"failed experiment of open borders.\""

    "story": [
      "MIAMI \u2014 A Florida retiree has been convicted of cyber crimes and blocked from leaving Saudi Arabia until next year over social media posts critical of the kingdom\u2019s crown prince, according to the man\u2019s son.",
      "Saad Almadi, 75, was found guilty of distributing online content that undermines public order, according to a Sept. 14 ruling provided by his son. The conviction, which has not been previously reported, carries a three-year sentence but spares Almadi additional prison time after he spent more than a year behind bars following his arrest in 2021.",
      "Instead, it blocks Almadi from leaving the kingdom until March. The Saudi government, which did not respond to a request for comment, doesn\u2019t recognize dual citizenship and regularly rejects criticism of its actions, saying they are part of a multiyear crackdown on corruption, terrorism and other security threats.",
      "The ruling comes after Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman gave a lavish welcome to President Donald Trump during a May trip to Saudi Arabia, a key strategic partner of the United States. It built on efforts to reengage with the kingdom after the crown prince\u2019s reputation was badly damaged by a U.S. intelligence determination that he had likely ordered the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Prince Mohammed denies his involvement.",
      "Son believes ruling looks to keep his father quiet",
      "Almadi\u2019s son, Ibrahim Almadi, says he believes the sentence is aimed at prompting his family \u2014 and those of a handful of other American citizens facing similar exit bans \u2014 to stay silent and not get in the way of the crown prince\u2019s diplomatic comeback.",
      "\u201cThe government keeps changing its mind, and there\u2019s no consequences every time it does,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "A retired project manager who immigrated to the U.S. in the 1970s, the elder Almadi was arrested upon his arrival in Saudi Arabia for what was supposed to be a short trip to see family. Officials confronted him with tweets he had posted over the past several years, including one about Khashoggi\u2019s killing and another on the crown prince\u2019s consolidation of power, his family says.",
      "Almadi was quickly sentenced to more than 19 years in prison on terrorism-related charges stemming from the tweets. Saudi Arabia freed him after more than a year and dropped the terrorism charges but imposed an exit ban that keeps him from returning to his home in Boca Raton, near Miami.",
      "The Associated Press reported in January that Saudi officials were pressuring the elder Almadi to renounce his American citizenship",
      "Trump, who has made freeing Americans held by foreign adversaries a top priority, has remained mostly silent. When asked by a reporter in May about the case, he said he didn\u2019t know about it but promised to take a look. A few weeks later, one of his national security aides, Sebastian Gorka, met with the younger Almadi at the White House.",
      "The U.S. State Department said it is monitoring the elder Almadi\u2019s case, providing him with appropriate consular services and has been in contact with his family, but it declined to provide further comment, citing privacy considerations. The White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump deepens ties with Saudi Arabia",
      "Trump, since returning to the White House, has intensified an effort started during the Biden administration to bury any criticism of the Saudi royals over allegations of their involvement in Khashoggi\u2019s killing inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.",
      "During his visit to Riyadh in May, Trump described Prince Mohammed as an \u201cincredible man\u201d and \u201cmy friend.\u201d Trump\u2019s family has extensive business dealings with the world\u2019s top oil exporter, which have only deepened since voters returned him to the White House.",
      "In April, the Trump Organization struck a deal with a developer close to the Saudi royal family, London-based Dar Global, to build a Trump-branded beachside villa and 18-hole golf course in neighboring Qatar. The Trump Organization also is partnering with the firm in a luxury high-rise apartment building in the coastal city of Jeddah, a project that was announced last December.",
      "A private equity firm controlled by Trump\u2019s son-in-law and former White House adviser Jared Kushner received a $2 billion investment from the sovereign wealth fund controlled by the crown prince.",
      "Abdullah Alaoudh, a senior director at the Middle East Democracy Center, a Washington-based human rights group, is tracking cases of Americans under exit bans in Saudi Arabia. He said he knew of four others \u2014 an American citizen, two dual U.S.-Saudi nationals and a U.S. green-card holder \u2014 facing a similar plight to Almadi\u2019s.",
      "Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producer in the Middle East. It\u2019s also a key player in regional conflicts involving Iran and Yemen as well as the chief prize in U.S. efforts to get Arab states to normalize relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords \u2014 a hallmark foreign policy achievement during Trump\u2019s first term."

      "\u201cIt\u2019s an actor who has the capabilities, the will and the tools to show off in this way,\u201d he said, adding that no suspects had been identified and that it was too soon to tell if the events in Denmark and Norway were linked.",
      "Officials chose not to shoot down the drones because the risk was too great with the airport being full of passengers, planes on the runways and the nearby fuel depots, Jespersen added.",

      "LONDON \u2014 Health officials across the globe on Tuesday rejected President Donald Trump's warning that pregnant women should limit the use of acetaminophen over unsubstantiated claims of a link to autism.",
      "Authorities from Australia to Europe moved swiftly to respond to the U.S. announcement, which Trump made with great fanfare while flanked by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t take Tylenol. Don\u2019t take it. Fight like hell not to take it,\u201d Trump said.",
      "But a range of experts worldwide noted there was not conclusive evidence to support the possible association between autism and acetaminophen \u2014 the active ingredient in Tylenol and other widely used medications \u2014 and no new evidence to warrant a change in guidance.",
      "\u201cAvailable evidence has found no link between the use of paracetamol during pregnancy and autism,\u201d said the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Paracetamol is a widely used name for Tylenol beyond the U.S.",
      "The EMA said it would not be making changes to the region\u2019s current recommendations, maintaining that pregnant women should take the lowest effective dose of the drug for the shortest possible time and as infrequently as possible.",
      "\u201cA large amount of data from pregnant women who used paracetamol during pregnancy indicates no risk of malformations on the developing fetus or on newborns,\u201d the EMA said in a statement to NBC News.",
      "The World Health Organization said that \u201cthe evidence remains inconsistent\u201d regarding any link between the use of Tylenol during pregnancy and autism.",
      "WHO spokesperson Tarik Ja\u0161arevi\u0107 cited unspecified studies that pointed to a possible link but said that this was not confirmed by subsequent research. \u201cThis lack of replicability really calls for caution in drawing casual conclusions,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump on Monday also suggested that additives in vaccines may cause autism, which the WHO was similarly quick to dispute.",
      "\u201cWe know that vaccines do not cause autism. Vaccines, as I said, save countless lives. So, this is something that science has proven, and these things should not be really questioned,\u201d Ja\u0161arevi\u0107 told a Geneva press briefing.",
      "Australian health officials were among the first to reject the claims, labeling them \u201ca misrepresentation of the science.\u201d",
      "Australia\u2019s medicines regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, together with the country\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, said Tuesday that it was joining other global medicines regulators in repudiating Trump\u2019s claims.",
      "\u201cRobust scientific evidence shows no causal link between the use of paracetamol in pregnancy and autism or ADHD, with several large and reliable studies directly contradicting these claims,\u201d they said in a statement.",
      "A number of other countries restated their existing guidance, which differs from the new warning issued by the Trump administration.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of Health reiterated that its guidance had not changed, describing paracetamol as \u201cthe safest medicine to take in pregnancy\" for treatment of pain or fever.",
      "A spokesperson for the German Health Ministry told NBC News that there was no link between taking paracetamol during pregnancy and developmental abnormalities. \"In certain situations, taking medication is necessary to avoid endangering the mother and unborn child, for example in the case of high fever,\" they said in an emailed statement.",
      "The U.K.\u2019s health regulator, MHRA, issued a similar statement, stressing that \u201cparacetamol remains the recommended pain relief option for pregnant women when used as directed.\u201d",
      "\u201cUntreated pain and fever can pose risks to the unborn baby, so it is important to manage these symptoms with the recommended treatment,\u201d Dr Alison Cave, chief safety officer at the MHRA, said in a statement on the agency\u2019s website.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting told ITV early Tuesday: \u201cI would just say to people watching, don\u2019t pay any attention whatsoever to what Donald Trump says about medicine.\u201d",
      "Spain\u2019s health minister, M\u00f3nica Garc\u00eda G\u00f3mez, also called out Trump by name, accusing him of \u201cignoring all medical studies.\u201d",
      "\u201cDenialism not only destroys trust in science: it puts lives at risk,\u201d she wrote on X on Monday.",
      "Scott White, chair of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Women\u2019s Health Committee, said he was \"worried\" about the messaging from the U.S.",
      "\u201cParacetamol is safe and actually important to use because pain and fever are associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes themselves,\u201d White told NBC News in a phone interview.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really worried about the messaging that says pregnant women should just tough it out, that pregnant women should be denied access to pain relief, which is a fundamental human right. It\u2019s every woman\u2019s right,\u201d White said.",
      "\u201cTo suggest that women can\u2019t access a medication that we feel has been shown to be safe simply because they\u2019re pregnant women, is misogynistic.\u201d",

      "While other studies have suggested some kind of link, including research published last month that Trump administration officials are citing, White argues many struggled to exclude factors like genetics or environment.",
      "Outside autism researchers have said that literature review, by researchers from Harvard and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, wasn\u2019t rigorously conducted and that it cherry-picked studies that supported its conclusion.",
      "White also said the reason a woman is taking paracetamol, such as to treat a fever or infection, could be what affects the mental development of the child.",
      "\u201cWe know that women who\u2019ve got complicated pregnancies in some way are more likely to go on to have babies that are neurodevelopmentally impacted,\u201d he added, citing fever as a prime example."

Our alliance is defensive, but be under no illusion: We stand ready to defend NATO\u2019s skies and NATO\u2019s territory,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we need to confront planes operating in NATO space without permission then we will do so.\u201d",
      "That drew an immediate rebuke from Moscow, which dismissed Europe\u2019s concerns as groundless and hysterical.",
      "NATO's response to this ratcheting Russian activity amounts to the launch of operation \"Eastern Sentry\" earlier this month to bolster the defense of Europe\u2019s eastern flank in response to a series of Russian drone incursions over Poland.",
      "After Germany and Sweden scrambled fighter jets Sunday to intercept and track a Russian surveillance plane flying unidentified over the Baltic Sea, one regional leader said Russia was not just testing NATO\u2019s response, but was also aiming to reduce support for Ukraine by compelling countries to redirect resources.",
      "Calibrating how to respond to Russia was not easy, Latvian President Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds said on social media, adding that Russia was doing just enough not to cross a red line.",
      "European confidence about backing from Washington has been shaken by Ukraine, where Trump has so far stopped short of imposing his promised punishment of further sanctions on the Kremlin for refusing peace talks.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he was preparing for an \u201cintense week\u201d at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, where he hopes to build support for efforts to stop Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine's presidential office, said in a post on Telegram on Monday that he spoke with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the leadup to an \"important meeting\" between Zelenskyy and Trump.",
      "\"We discussed the preparation of security guarantees for Ukraine, as well as the expansion of cooperation in the military, defense, and economic spheres,\" he wrote in the post.",
      "Ukraine has also submitted a request to attend the Security Council meeting and present its position.",
      "But Europe's security will require decisive action, and that will not happen at a Security Council meeting, \u201cfor the very simple reason that Russia has a veto on the council,\u201d said Keir Giles, a senior fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank",
      "Unable to rely on Trump\u2019s \u201cshifting position\u201d on Russia, Giles told NBC News, the \"coalition of the willing\" \u2014 European nations that say they are prepared to underwrite security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 must become the \u201ccoalition of the able and actually doing something.\u201d",
      "Poland will not hesitate to shoot down objects that violate its airspace and pose a threat, its prime minister said Monday. But, he said, his country would take a more cautious approach when dealing with situations that are less clear-cut, and would need to know it had its allies' support.",
      "\"You really need to think twice before deciding on actions that could trigger a very acute phase of conflict,\u201d Donald Tusk told a news conference.",
      "Hesitation, analysts said, risks sending a dangerous signal.",
      "\u201cEurope and NATO have to show the will to respond forcefully to Russia,\u201d said Moritz Brake, a senior fellow at the Center for Advanced Security, Strategic and Integration Studies.",
      "\u201cRussia is trying to gauge whether it\u2019s possible to single out individual elements of the alliance,\u201d he said in a phone interview.",
      "A forceful approach, Brake argued, would involve not just intercepting Russian aircraft, but also sending \u201cmanned fighter jets\u201d that could shoot Russian jets down \u201cat any minute.\u201d",
      "As an example, he pointed to 2015, when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian warplane seconds after it violated the country\u2019s airspace near the Syrian border. Moscow did not retaliate militarily.",
      "\u201cRussia didn\u2019t declare war on Turkey,\u201d Brake said. \u201cWavering is much more dangerous than a forceful approach.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 After having showcased its finest pomp and pageantry during President Donald Trump\u2019s state visit last week, Britain\u2019s royal family has quickly been plunged back into all-too familiar controversy.",
      "Just days after Trump, the royals and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer largely skirted questions about Jeffrey Epstein that had threatened to complicate the sunny spectacle of his trip, the British press offered new revelations.",
      "A newly surfaced email revealed that Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, described Epstein, the disgraced financier, as a \u201csupreme friend\u201d despite his conviction for sex offenses.",
      "The email was published in two newspapers Sunday. It was sent by the duchess \u2014 the former wife of Prince Andrew, the Duke of York \u2014 in 2011, just weeks after she had publicly distanced herself from Epstein.",
      "A spokesperson for the duchess said the email was sent to counter a threat Epstein had made to sue her for defamation.",
      "But the duchess was dropped as a patron of several U.K. charities after the email was published. Both cited her correspondence with Epstein as the reason.",
      "And the story will add new fuel to damaging media coverage about royal links to Epstein, which have centered on Andrew's own close relationship and a lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse \u2014 he denied the allegations by Virginia Giuffre and settled out of court. Giuffre died by suicide this year.",
      "In a 2011 interview, the duchess said her involvement with Epstein \u2014 who was jailed in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor \u2014 had been a \u201cgigantic error of judgment,\u201d promising she would never have anything to do with him again.",
      "\u201cI abhor pedophilia and any sexual abuse of children,\u201d she said at the time, adding that what Epstein did was \"wrong and for which he was rightly jailed.\u201d",
      "But \u201cThe Sun\u201d and \u201cThe Mail on Sunday\u201d reported that shortly after the interview, Ferguson emailed Epstein to reassure him she had not used the word \u201cpedophilia\u201d in reference to him.",
      "\u201cAs you know, I did not, absolutely not, say the \u2018P word\u2019 about you but understand it was reported that I did,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI know you feel hellaciously let down by me. You have always been a steadfast, generous and supreme friend to me and my family.\u201d",
      "The duchess was \u201ctaken in\u201d by Epstein\u2019s lies, her spokesperson said Sunday.",
      "\u201cAs soon as she was aware of the extent of the allegations against him, she not only cut off contact but condemned him publicly, to the extent that he then threatened to sue her for defamation for associating him with pedophilia.\u201d",
      "The spokesperson said Ferguson stood by her public condemnation of Epstein. \u201cThis email was sent in the context of advice the Duchess was given to try to assuage Epstein and his threats,\u201d the spokesperson added",
      "But the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, a food allergy charity, said in a statement to NBC News that it was \u201cdisturbed to read\u201d Ferguson\u2019s correspondence with Epstein and that it would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d for her to continue to be associated with the charity.",
      "A spokesperson for Julia\u2019s House, a children\u2019s hospice charity, also said it would be \u201cinappropriate for her to continue as a patron,\u201d and several other charities lso dropped the duchess.",
      "All of them thanked the duchess for her past support.",
      "Epstein was found dead by suicide in 2019 while he was awaiting a trial on sex trafficking charges in New York.",
      "Andrew returned his military affiliations and royal patronages in January 2022 after his lawyers failed to persuade a U.S. judge to dismiss Giuffre\u2019s lawsuit.",
      "Andrew later paid a substantial sum to Giuffre, who alleged he abused her when she was 17. Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegation.",
      "Giuffre died in April, with her family saying in a statement that \u201cthe toll of abuse is so heavy that it became unbearable for Virginia to handle its weight.\u201d",
      "Other royals have rarely appeared in public with Andrew since his fall from grace.",
      "In December, Andrew was caught up in an alleged spying case after he cultivated an \u201cunusual degree of trust\u201d with a Chinese man who was barred from the U.K. on national security grounds, according to court documents."

      "The backlash highlights Chinese consumers\u2019 growing preference for practicality and sustainability over grand spectacles that could lead to waste and degradation, said Sho Hu, a Beijing-based public relations consultant and commentator.",
      "\u201cThis is a shift shaped by different stages of China\u2019s economic growth,\u201d Hu said Monday in a phone interview. \u201cPeople are no longer interested in pursuing grand celebrations.

      "\u201cToday, to revive the hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis, and a two state solution, the United Kingdom formally recognizes the State of Palestine,\u201d British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement.",
