      "NEW YORK -- Green tears were flowing when Lencia Kebede made history this week on Broadway, becoming the first Black actor to assume the role of Elphaba full time in the Broadway company of \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to even pinpoint a single emotion because I feel that it changes like every five minutes,\u201d she told The Associated Press, still buzzing a day after her debut. \u201cI woke up and I still sort of felt in the world of Oz.\u201d",
      "Kebede, a first-generation Ethiopian American from Los Angeles, spent five years touring with \u201cHamilton,\u201d most recently in the role of Angelica Schuyler. Stepping into \u201cWicked\u201d on Tuesday marked her Broadway debut.",
      "Kebede had already gone through an emotional wringer by the time the curtain finally came down. She sings the Act 1 showstopper \u201cDefying Gravity,\u201d shooting into the air and the power of the moment ripped through her.",
      "\u201cWhen the lights went off at the end of the song, I started sobbing. Not like just a gentle tear. Viscerally, I had to release,\u201d she says.",
      "\"I really felt like I was flying, is the simplest way to put it. I felt like I\u2019m doing it myself, though my own power \u2014 my vocal power, my emotional power, the power of all of my African ancestors.\"",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m flying solo/At least I\u2019m flying free/To those who ground me, take a message back from me/Tell them how I am defying gravity,\u201d she sang.",
      "\u201cEveryone deserves a chance to fly,\u201d says Kebede. \u201cI'm projecting this message that no matter who you are, what you look like, where you come from, you deserve liberation and you deserve empowerment in the way that the character feels in that moment. It just feels like I\u2019m taking the entire audience in my arms.\u201d",
      "Thank goodness it was intermission. \u201cI needed to regroup,\u201d she says, laughing. \"My makeup artist was like, \u2018Just let it out, just cry, and then we can clean it up.\u2019\u201d",
      "In the audience were some 60 family and friends \u2014 mom and her aunts and uncles, her many cousins, her boyfriend, pals from other shows, her agent and casting directors, even her college choir director.",
      "\u201cMy whole family was in the audience \u2014 just everyone who I\u2019ve ever loved, with everyone who has loved me and supported me through my life is just like under me, lifting me and holding me,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cIt was just so important to me to have people there that I could share this moment with, so I could say to their faces, \u2019I couldn\u2019t be here without a piece of your heart that you gave me.'\u201d",
      "The popularity of the Cynthia Erivo-led movie hasn't dampened the appetite for the Broadway version, which opened in 2003 with songs by Stephen Schwartz and a book by Winnie Holzman. Over Christmas, it took in a staggering $5 million over nine performances, marking the highest weekly gross in history for any Broadway show.",
      "Kebede joins a sisterhood of green-clad Black women who have played Elphaba, a list that includes Saycon Sengbloh and Lilli Cooper, both Broadway standbys; Brandi Chavonne Massey, a Broadway understudy; and Alexia Khadime, a full-time West End Elphaba.",
      "Others who have played the role over the years include Shoshana Bean, Stephanie J. Block, Jessica Vosk, Eden Espinosa, Ana Gasteyer and, of course, Idina Menzel, who won a Tony Award in the role in 2004.",
      "Kebede graduated from Occidental College in 2016 with a double major of diplomacy & world affairs and politics, intending on a career in law or public policy. By her senior year, she had an itch she needed to scratch.",
      "\u201cI just had this creative craving in terms of storytelling in the theatrical way that I was missing,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I sat my mother down and I was like, \u2018Look, I think I need just a couple years to explore this creative endeavor.\u2019\u201d",
      "Her first professional job was a production of \u201cMemphis\u201d at Musical Theatre West and then a stint at Tokyo Disney and touring in \u201cRent.\u201d In addition to years on the road with \u201cHamilton,\u201d Kebede also sang backup for Beyonc\u00e9 during her Coachella rehearsals.",
      "\u201cThe rigorous nature of touring, I think, prepared me immensely for this,\u201d she says. \u201cI do feel very equipped \u2014 physically, vocally, emotionally. I feel like I know how to take care of my body and my mind, how I need to cool down emotionally after such an intense experience for three hours.\u201d",
      "On debut night, Kebede tried to keep a set of mental screenshots, a reel of faces and feelings. As she turned to get backstage, she was feeling the love.",
      "\u201cMy grandmother and my father passed when I was in high school and I just took a moment to connect with my angels,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was, oh God, it was electric.\u201d",
      "Family came backstage after the show for photos and a tour, she was toasted at a nearby bar by friends, she finally ate something and then got home to try to sleep.",
      "\u201cMy battery was dead. I mean, I couldn\u2019t even move. I couldn\u2019t move my face. I was just drinking my tea, playing calming jazz. I had to just turn it off,\u201d she says.",
      "And then she had to do it all over again the next night."

      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- A New Mexico state district judge who presided over the widely publicized trial of actor Alec Baldwin for a fatal movie set shooting is getting ready to retire from the bench.",
      "Court administrators announced Mary Marlowe Sommer\u2019s upcoming retirement on Thursday. She will step down at the end of May after serving 15 years on the First Judicial District Court in Santa Fe, New Mexico. She served as the district's chief judge from 2019 to 2022.",
      "Her decades-long career also includes work as a law clerk, a defense attorney, an assistant attorney general and a hearing officer who has handled thousands of cases involving domestic violence and family matters.",
      "Marlowe Sommer said it's been an honor and privilege to serve but that it's time to step away from what she called \"the hectic schedule of court business.\"",
      "\"During my time on the bench, I have admired and deeply appreciated those who work so hard each day to ensure the court delivers the fair and timely justice that people are entitled to in our legal system,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Last summer, Marlowe Sommer dismissed a charge of involuntary manslaughter against Baldwin in the October 2021 death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during a rehearsal for the movie \u201cRust\u201d at a film-set ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe.",
      "Baldwin, the lead actor and co-producer, was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when it fired, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 but not the trigger \u2014 and the revolver fired.",
      "The trial was upended by revelations that ammunition was brought into the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office by a man who said it could be related to Hutchins\u2019 killing. Prosecutors said they deemed the ammo unrelated and unimportant, while Baldwin\u2019s lawyers say investigators \u201cburied\u201d the evidence in a separate case folder and filed a successful motion to dismiss the case.",
      "Baldwin then filed a civil lawsuit for malicious prosecution and civil rights violation.",
      "Separately, the shooting led to an involuntary manslaughter conviction against movie weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed. Marlowe Sommer also presided over that case.",
      "Current Chief Judge Bryan Biedscheid said Marlowe Sommer has served with distinction, integrity and an unswerving commitment to the rule of law.",
      "In all, court administrators say Marlowe Sommer has presided over about 21,600 cases during her tenure, starting with family, abuse and neglect, and juvenile delinquency cases. She began taking on criminal cases in 2012, with the most notable being that of Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed.",
      "She also presided over the child molestation cases of former teacher Gary Gregor, and the trial of Jeannine Jaramillo, who killed a police officer and retired firefighter during a wrong-way crash while attempting to evade law enforcement.",
      "Marlowe Sommer's term was set to expire in 2028. A judicial nominating commission will consider applicants for the vacancy and recommend to the governor for an appointment to serve the remainder of the term."

On Friday, she becomes the latest to drop a debut solo studio album, the English-language \u201cRuby.\u201d It's a kaleidoscope of different sounds for Jennie, full of incongruous, polished pleasures.",
      "\u201cSOLO,\u201d her debut single, was a product of its time \u2013 nostalgic EDM-pop with pitched up whistle effects and simple, declarative lyrics. \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 solo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo,\" she repeated on the chorus. You had to believe her: She wasn\u2019t leaving her band, but a lackluster relationship, an ex so innocuous they're barely a player in the song. \u201cThis time I\u2019m only lookin\u2019 at me, myself and I,\u201d she sang, \u201cI\u2019ma do it on my own now.\u201d A lot has changed in the time since, but the core of her and her band's sonic messaging \u2014 self-empowerment above all else \u2014 hasn't wavered.",

Or \u201cExtraL\u201d with the innovative Doechii, whose acicular raps give additional weight to \u201cYeah, we lappin\u2019 the men,\u201d a line delivered with laughter.",
      "But it isn't all assertions of autonomy. On the languid \u201cLove Hangover\u201d with Dominic Fike, she's falling into destructive patterns with an undeserving partner; in a falsetto, her chameleonic vocal performance is so convincing, the recording almost doesn't even sound like Jennie. Or maybe it just doesn't sound like the Jennie fans have grown to known?",
      "Across \u201cRuby,\u201d don\u2019t expect cuts that would make a Blackpink record. Prior to \u201cRuby,\u201d Jennie had only worked with one producer \u2014 Teddy Park, a man synonymous with her girl group hits. This time around, she worked with an eclectic team ranging from Diplo to El Guincho \u2014 new voices to explore different facets of her personality. It's ambitious and glossy, moving from an acoustic ballad here (\u201cTwin\u201d), virtuosic rapping there (\u201cZen\u201d), to familiar beats on (\"With the IE (Way Up)\" and \u201cStart A War\u201d). And it pays off.",
      "Jennie tries her best Rihanna phrasing on the SZA-channeling \u201cStart A War,\" and maybe spends too much time with robust collaborations \u2014 Childish Gambino and Kali Uchis on the nostalgic R&B of \u201cDamn Right,\u201d Dua Lipa on \u201cHandlebars\" that launches straight into the chorus \u2014 perfect for TikTok.",
      "In whole, Jennie's \u201cRuby\u201d is a solid re-introduction to the Blackpink superstar. The songs are strong and diverse and nostalgic \u2014 but maybe not wholly distinctive. It is still a reason to be excited for her future solo work."

      "Research by the charity English Heritage suggests it may have found a portrait of England's shortest-reigning queen Lady Jane Grey",
      "LONDON -- A painting that has gone on public display Friday could be the only portrait of England's shortest-reigning queen, Lady Jane Grey, painted during her lifetime, according to the conservation group English Heritage.",
      "It said there is \u201ccompelling\u201d evidence to suggest that the portrait, on loan from a private collection, shows Jane, who was no older than 17 when she became queen for just nine days in the summer of 1553.",
      "One of England's most tragic regal figures, she was executed at the Tower of London in 1554. Jane was a devout Protestant at a time of religious upheaval, the ultimate innocent victim of the chicanery of the Tudor court in the chaotic aftermath of Henry VIII\u2019s reign.",
      "She is perhaps best-known from Paul Delaroche\u2019s painting, \u201cThe Execution of Lady Jane Grey,\u201d which hangs in the National Gallery in central London. Jane, who may have been as young as 16, is shown blindfolded as an executioner with an axe waits to behead her.",
      "But that painting, like the few others that purport to show Jane, all date from after her death.",
      "Now, English Heritage says a Tudor-era work could be a \u201clive\u201d painting of Jane. The portrait, along with six others, will hang at Wrest Park, a country estate west of London managed by English Heritage, and which incidentally is the location of many scenes of Netflix's steamy period drama \"Bridgerton.\"",
      "The charity worked with the Courtauld Institute of Art and scientist Ian Tyers, who specializes in dendrochronology, or the dating of tree rings. It said there is enough evidence to raise the question: \"Could this mysterious portrait be Lady Jane Grey?\"",
      "Among the evidence presented, English Heritage said the tree-dating points to the wooden panel having been constructed between 1539 and around 1571 \u2014 Jane is believed to have been born in 1536 or 1537 and was executed in early 1554. It also said the back of the panel displays a merchant or cargo mark, identical to one used on a royal portrait of King Edward VI, who, in an ultimately tragic turn, anointed his first cousin once removed as his successor.",
      "It also noted a \u201cstriking change\" in the eyes of the sitter to the left rather than the right and that at some point, the eyes, mouth and ears were deliberately scratched out. In addition, it said the sitter was likely wearing a more elaborate costume.",
      "Rachel Turnbull, English Heritage\u2019s Senior Collections Conservator, said the evidence points to the possibility that \u201cwe are looking at the shadows of a once more royal portrait of Lady Jane Grey, toned down into subdued, Protestant martyrdom after her death.\u201d",
      "Jane was bright, reportedly spoke multiple languages and a big fan of Plato. But it was her commitment to Protestantism that interested Edward VI.",
      "Edward VI, the only surviving son of Henry VIII, was the first monarch to be raised a Protestant after his father split from Rome in order to divorce his first wife Catherine of Aragon. His mother was Henry's third wife, Jane Seymour, who Lady Jane was named after.",
      "On being informed in 1553 that he was terminally ill, the 15-year-old Edward wanted to bypass his older sisters Mary and Elizabeth, and named Lady Jane his heir to prevent the realm reverting to Catholicism.",
      "On July 10, Jane became queen but was deposed nine days later after her support melted away in the wake of an uprising by Mary's supporters. Jane was subsequently convicted of treason and sentenced to death."

      "He died Sunday in Lakeland, Florida, two of his business representatives said.

      "Until this past year, he continued to make regular appearances at comic book and sci-fi conventions.",

      "There were no details available on his survivors. His family said there will be a private service.",

      "When he was 17 years old, German artist Anselm Kiefer retraced the footsteps of Vincent van Gogh from the Netherlands through Belgium and into France",
      "AMSTERDAM -- When he was just 17 years old, German artist Anselm Kiefer retraced the footsteps of Vincent van Gogh from the Netherlands through Belgium and into France.",
      "Now, more than half a century later, the museum named for the Dutch master is joining forces for the first time with the neighboring Stedelijk modern and contemporary art museum in Amsterdam to stage a blockbuster exhibition of Kiefer's work, titled \u201cSag mir wo die Blumen sind,\u201d a reference to folk singer Pete Seeger's iconic pacifist anthem \u201cWhere have all the flowers gone?\u201d",
      "Kiefer said he did not set out to make an exclusively anti-war exhibition, even though he closely follows world events including the conflict triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t say \u2018I do now an exhibition against the war.\u2019 This I don\u2019t do because this is a program; I\u2019m not a programmatic artist,\" he said. \"I do what is in me, what has to come out. And that is about all kinds of things, about the dead, about the war.\u201d",
      "Kiefer's sometimes bleak work, rooted in growing up in post-World War II Germany, might not immediately feel closely related to Van Gogh's vibrant and richly colored landscapes and vases of sunflowers.",
      "But take a look at Kiefer's 2019 \u201cThe Crows,\u201d alongside Van Gogh's 1890 \u201cWheatfield with Crows,\u201d and the inspiration for the German's work jumps from the wall.",
      "The brooding black birds aren't the only shared subjects that the two artists depict.",
      "One of Van Gogh's most famous inspirations \u2014 sunflowers \u2014 also appear in Kiefer's works.",
      "A huge dried sunflower hangs upside down in a glass cabinet, shedding its seeds on a book made from lead sheets, while \u201cSol Invictus\u201d shows a sunflower towering over the artist, who is lying in a yoga position known as the corpse pose.",
      "The show also includes some of his sketches from his trip retracing Van Gogh's footsteps.",
      "The 79-year-old German artist has a long relationship not just with Van Gogh, but also with the Stedelijk and Dutch collectors who bought some of his early works. The Stedelijk is showing early pieces such as a sculpture of an aeroplane resembling a B-1 bomber that is made of lead and called \u201cJourney to the end of the Night.\u201d",
      "The centerpiece of the Stedelijk is the installation for which the show is named. Built up around the museum's central staircase, it features paint-splattered clothes on hangers and flower petals spilling down paintings and into piles on the floor, among many things.",
      "Kiefer said that he wrote one of the lines in the Seeger song, which was later also sung in German by Marlene Dietrich, on the wall as part of the installation: \u201cWho will ever learn?\u201d",
      "\"This sentence makes the song philosophical,\" he told reporters. \"You know, because we cannot understand. We cannot understand, for example, that today things happened in (19)33 in the world.\u201d",
      "Asked about the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party that surged in last month's German election, he said: \u201cIt's horrible.\u201d",
      "The huge central work is made up of a long list of components including emulsion, oil, acrylic, shellac, golf leaf, sediment of electrolysis, dried flowers, straw, fabric and steel.",
      "The straw features in many of Kiefer\u2019s paintings, giving them a complex surface that sometimes echoes Van Gogh\u2019s bold brush strokes.",
      "\"He\u2019s working like a sort of ... alchemist transforming material into an art,\u201d curator Edwin Bakker of the Van Gogh Museum told The Associated Press.",
      "The exhibition opens March 7 and runs until June 9 at the Van Gogh Museum and Stedelijk Museum."

But on the runway, designer Olivier Rousteing shifted from red carpet opulence to a new kind of luxury, built on sculptural knitwear, fluid draping and dazzling blown-up zebra motifs.",
      "The Wednesday night collection opened with a now-familiar silhouette from Rousteing \u2014 a swooping hooded sweater, this time paired with a leather peplum and relaxed leather trousers. Knitwear remained the focus \u2014 draped mohair, wool jersey dresses and cocooning sweaters gave the collection a sense of ease.",

      "The footwear was a standout. Sculpturally twisted pumps and fuzzy or buttery-soft leather boots injected a playful contrast into the collection\u2019s rhythm of black, white and bursts of citrus orange.",
      "Though the emphasis on draping and ease was a shift, the Balmain DNA shone through in the accessories. Rousteing\u2019s experiment with volume felt like a recalibration rather than a reinvention, proving once again that luxury isn\u2019t just about excess, but knowing when to let the clothes breathe."

      "The abuse last summer quickly escalated, including attacks based on Jolly's sexual orientation and wrongly assumed Israeli roots, and reportedly aimed to silence the artistic intent of the show. Jolly responded by filing a formal complaint with the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office on July 31, prompting an investigation that led to arrests in the south of France in October 2024.",
      "The seven people charged, ranging in age from 22 to 79, face counts of death threats, aggravated insults, and cyberbullying \u2014 serious allegations carrying the weight of potential prison time and heavy fines.",
      "A verdict in the Jolly\u2019s case is expected at a later date.",

      "Jolly\u2019s complaint came after the opening ceremony prompted a storm of outrage in the wake of a contentious scene featuring drag queens and other performers. Although Jolly has repeatedly said that he wasn\u2019t inspired by \u201cThe Last Supper,\u201d vocal criticism of the show from some quarters interpreted it as a mockery of Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s painting depicting Jesus Christ and his apostles.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron extended full support to Jolly and all performing artists who were part of the Olympics opening show. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo also expressed \u201cunwavering support\u201d of Jolly in the face of the threats and harassment.",

      "The Glastonbury Festival in southwest England is clearly aiming to go out with a bang this summer before it takes a year off to allow the farmland to recover",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Glastonbury Festival is clearly aiming to go out with a bang this summer before taking one of its regular fallow years off to allow the southwest England farmland where the music fest takes place to recover after hosting some 200,000 revelers.",
      "Festival organizers announced the lineup on Thursday, including the headline acts, for arguably the world\u2019s most famous music festival. This year, it will take place at Worthy Farm from June 25 to June 29.",
      "The main news is that English band The 1975 will headline the main Pyramid Stage on the festival's Friday night, while American singer and actress Olivia Rodrigo will take top billing on the Sunday evening.",
      "Neil Young, the legendary 79-year-old Canadian-American singer-songwriter, was previously announced as the headliner for the Saturday night, while his Scottish peer Rod Stewart had been confirmed for the coveted legends slot on the Pyramid Stage on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Not making the top of the bill, but very much in vogue and likely to draw huge crowds, is Charli XCX, who will perform on the Other Stage on the Saturday night. Last week, the singer behind the \u201cBrat summer\" phenomenon, won five Brit awards.",
      "The word \u201cbrat,\u201d used by the singer as the title of her sixth studio album, was declared word of the year by Collins Dictionary. For those not in the know, it's been defined as \u201ccharacterized by a confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude.\u201d",
      "Closing out the Other Stage on the festival's Sunday night will be English electronic group The Prodigy, most famous for the pumping 1996 track \u201cFirestarter.\" The performance will be particularly poignant as it will mark the band's first at the festival since the death of frontman Keith Flint in 2019.",
      "Other acts include Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, making her Glastonbury debut, and the recently reformed U.S. pop group Scissor Sisters.",
      "There are no scheduled performers on the festivals first two days, Wednesday and Thursday, though many ad hoc events take place as attendees arrive and pitch up their tents.",
      "A lot of interest will focus on Manchester-formed The 1975, which is fronted by Matty Healy. The band has headlined various festivals in the United Kingdom \u2014 but not Glastonbury \u2014 and elsewhere, with controversial stage antics.",
      "Last month, a London judge ruled that the band cannot be held personally liable for losses of a Malaysian music festival that was shut down by authorities after lead singer Healy kissed a male bandmate on stage. The organizers of the Good Vibes Festival were claiming 1.9 million pounds ($2.4 million) in losses after Healy criticized the country\u2019s anti-homosexuality laws and then kissed bassist Ross MacDonald at the Kuala Lumpur show in July 2023.",
      "Footage of the kiss sparked a backlash in the predominantly Muslim country, where homosexuality is a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning. Some LGBTQ+ groups also criticized the band for endangering its community and disrupting the work of activists pushing for change.",
      "There will be more acts named over the coming weeks and those who haven't got tickets yet will be able to do so in a resale. As always, the festival, which was first held in 1970, was sold out quickly despite the ticket price \u2014 nearly 380 pounds ($490) each.",
      "While the price may be fixed, the mid-summer weather isn't. As always, the hopes of everyone going are the same: Please, no mudbath!"

    "story": [
      "Lady Gaga rediscovered her passion for music through self-discovery, channeling her personal transformation into her new album \u201cMayhem.\u201d",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When Lady Gaga walked into a New York City bar she frequented five years ago, the memories hit hard: Back then, she wrote songs there, feeling lost and disconnected from herself.",
      "But this time was different. While sitting in the bar, Gaga felt a sense of peace and rejuvenation, reminiscent of her teenage years spent scribbling lyrics on napkins.",
      "In recent years, Gaga rediscovered her passion for music by taking a step back from the limelight, cutting ties from fake friendships, swapping the spotlight for quiet nights at home and surrounding herself with people she truly trusts. That personal transformation became the soul of her new album, \u201cMayhem,\u201d which is being released Friday.",
      "\u201cI reclaimed myself as an artist,\u201d said Gaga, a 14-time Grammy and one-time Oscar winner who returned to her dark pop music roots on the album, which spans 14 tracks. Her new project follows last year\u2019s \u201c Harlequin,\u201d a jazz-inspired companion album for the film \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux,\u201d which stalled at No. 20 on the Billboard 200.",
      "But Gaga's singles for the 14-track \u201cMayhem\u201d have been received well on the charts, including \u201c Disease,\u201d \u201c Abracadabra \u201d and \u201c Die With a Smile,\u201d a collaboration with Bruno Mars, spending five weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 1 and winning a Grammy for best pop duo/group performance earlier this month.",
      "While recording \u201cMayhem,\u201d Gaga refused to rest on her past hits or accolades to define her new work. She credited her renewed creative drive to a journey of self-discovery, which ultimately empowered her to step back into the spotlight for several big moments last month. The superstar performed with Bruno Mars at the Grammys \u2014 including a tribute song \u201cCalifornia Dreamin'\u201d to Los Angeles wildfire victims, closed out the FireAid benefit concert with \u201cAll I Need is Time\u201d and delivered a surprise performance singing \u201cHold My Hand\u201d before the Super Bowl in New Orleans.",
      "Next month, Gaga will headline Coachella and perform a free concert on Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Copacabana Beach in May.",
      "\u201cI built a routine in my daily life around music all the time, and not around self-promotion,\u201d said Gaga, 38, who was a producer and co-executive producer with her fianc\u00e9 Michael Polansky, 41, on \u201cMayhem.\u201d \u201cWhen my life was circulating self-promotion, I think I lost a lot of my passion. When my life was around my family, my partner and my music, it gave me back that realness.\u201d",
      "In an AP interview, Gaga digs deeper into what it took to regain her passion, showing she's more than just a character and her pulling double duty on \u201cSaturday Night Live\" on Saturday.",
      "While Gaga was dropping early hits like \u201cJust Dance\u201d and \u201cPoker Face,\u201d she noticed critics who downplayed her role in the success, giving more credit to producers and even stylists.",
      "With \u201cMayhem,\u201d Gaga aimed to showcase that her talent was the true driving force behind her rise. Fueled by the skeptics, the singer is determined to show she's the architect of her success, not just another industry creation.",
      "\u201cThey tried to qualify and quantify me,\u201d she said. \u201cVery often as a woman in music, they say it was other people. You\u2019re a product, like you were made. Something that was really important to me on this was really taking from myself my own inventions.\u201d",
      "When Gaga began recording her new album, she focused on crafting the kind of dark pop melodies that defined her early career, pairing them with lyrics that spoke in code. She said it all came back naturally, giving her reassurance that she was on the right path to fully owning her identity as an artist instead of a made-up character",
      "\u201cThis was a way for me actually to feel like I wasn\u2019t. That it was the real me,\u201d she said. \"I was the creator. This was my work. It was just not a character I was playing. It was something that I made.\u201d",
      "Early in her career, fame came with a price that Gaga wasn't willing to pay. She felt isolated, trapped in transactional relationships and struck in an environment that prioritized competition over creativity.",
      "The spotlight began to feel like an endless race, draining her passion for making music. She began to notice a shift as her sales climbed beyond the first 10 million records.",
      "Gaga realized that staying in that energy would ultimately stifle her creativity, knowing it was time to break free.",
      "\u201cI lost the thing that I would teach my child, which is to sit alone with your thoughts and write a poem,\" Gaga said. \"Sit alone and write a song. Just put good old-fashioned hard work and craftsmanship into what you believe in. I lost that for a long time.\u201d",
      "Eventually, Gaga hit reset. She cut loose draining relationships and building a stable family with Michael Polansky and their beloved dogs.",
      "It helped Gaga channel her energy back into her artistry.",
      "\u201cThis is the first day I\u2019ve done interviews without makeup on, and it\u2019s nice,\u201d she said. \u201cI just get to share with you about my experience with music, and I\u2019m not feeling pressure to perform for you in any other way than as a female artist.\u201d",
      "In her appearance on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d Gaga will showcase her range as both the musical guest and host. But her versatility might shine even brighter in the show\u2019s sketch comedy skits.",
      "\u201cI get to work in all different kinds of art that I love so much,\u201d said Gaga, who will make her second appearance as \u201cSNL\u201d host and fifth as its musical guest. The first time she appeared as host and musical guest was in 2013.",
      "Gaga performed during the \u201c SNL50: The Homecoming Concert \u201d last month.",
      "\u201cDoing \u2018SNL\u2019 is all about hard work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a labor of love for the audience on Saturday night because we just want everybody to feel happy at home.\u201d",
      "To prepare, Gaga is synching up with the cast and building rapport, which she says will help balance her roles throughout the night.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll just be like really close with the cast,\u201d she said. \u201cThey write like all the sketches and they work like all week long on planning, so I feel like the better my relationship is with them and just like getting in there and being one of them, the better the show will be.\u201d",
      "Gaga added: \u201cI\u2019m treating my musical performances separately. I have to wear like a few different hats. There\u2019s hosting and then there\u2019s being the actor in the sketch, and being the artist that I am in my music. I\u2019m ready to do it though.\u201d"

      "Carnival always breathes life into the economy of Vila Vintem, on Rio de Janeiro\u2019s west side, but this year there\u2019s even more, with its Unidos de Padre Miguel samba school back in the top parade league for the first time in 57 years",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Carnival always breathes life into the economy of Vila Vintem, a favela on Rio de Janeiro's west side, but this year the pulse is even stronger with its Unidos de Padre Miguel samba school returning to the top samba parade league for the first time in almost 60 years.",
      "As one of Rio's 12 top-tier samba schools, Unidos de Padre Miguel will have its shot at fame, perhaps even glory \u2014 all while bringing in more money into its community.",
      "Last year, competing in the second division, Padre Miguel received about 900,000 reais ($150,000) from City Hall, missing out on the lucrative sponsorship deals and revenue from television rights, pre-Carnival parties and ticket sales enjoyed by top-flight samba schools. But their victory in last year's Carnival secured their place in the main event that kicks off Sunday night.",
      "The shift has sent Padre Miguel\u2019s budget this year ballooning more than tenfold, to about 11 million reais ($2 million), including nearly 2 million reais from the city, according to the samba school's deputy chairman Dr. Willie Baracho.",
      "The school has already invested a significant portion into the community, funding local seamstresses, carpenters and welders for parade preparations.",
      "Vila Vintem is already experiencing the positive effects. Several of the favela's formerly jobless residents told The Associated Press they have bought smartphones and household appliances.",
      "Padre Miguel's new headquarters, nearing completion, will relocate rehearsals and other community activities from a hangar-like space that served as a vital center for the community during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cOur samba school has projects, it helps people, distributes food, throws parties for our children,\u201d Luana Borges, 42, said as she fixed details on several costumes, some bearing the school's traditional red and white colors.",
      "\u201cWhen Carnival comes, it offers opportunities to people like me,\" said Borges, who used to be unemployed.",
      "Nearly all samba schools sit in working-class neighborhoods around Rio\u2019s metropolitan region and compete against each other in the legendary Sambadrome parade grounds. Favelas in Rio are typically associated with dense, hillside neighborhoods, but they feature other geographies, too. The 14,000-resident Vila Vintem cropped up almost a century ago on flatlands next to a railway under construction.",
      "When first settled, the swampy area was said to be worth not even a \u201cvintem,\u201d the cheapest coin at the time, akin to a penny. Decades passed before basic services arrived, sometimes only after residents agreed to do the work themselves.",
      "Even with its new Carnival windfall, Padre Miguel remains a financial underdog.",
      "Baracho said its more popular rivals don\u2019t depend as much on city money, and can bring in up to 18 million reais ($3 million) when accounting for corporate sponsorships, sales of merchandise, coveted parade positions and cover charges for their pre-Carnival parties.",
      "While Padre Miguel employs almost all locals, Baracho said wealthier samba schools can spend over 1 million reais, for instance, on coaches and dancers, whose performance is one of the categories scored by judges.",
      "\u201cThe sky is the limit for some, but we fight,\u201d Baracho said. \u201cWe managed to get promoted because we are invested in our people, we work hard to foster our own creativity.\"",
      "Padre Miguel will be the first samba school to parade on Sunday night. Their procession will tell the story of Iya\u0301 Nasso\u0302, the founder of the first space in Brazil for rituals of the Afro-Brazilian faith Candomble.",
      "Experts say the best path for scrappy samba schools like Padre Miguel to sustain their community impact is to focus on avoiding relegation, rather than pursuing Carnival\u2019s top prize, amounting to 20% of the revenue of the tickets sold for the Champions Parade, which takes place the following weekend.",
      "\u201cThere's little chance for a samba school to win the title coming from the second division,\" said F\u00e1tima Costa de Lima, a Carnival researcher and scenic arts professor at Santa Catarina State University. \u201cIt happened before, but it is rare. The main goal for a samba school like (Padre Miguel) is to stay on.\u201d",
      "Ingrid Lima Leal has worked for Padre Miguel for 15 years, and paraded with the school for even longer. The 66-year-old says that creating jobs in Vila Vintem and being at the world-famous parade is worth every cent. She wants to see more next year \u2014 hopefully still in the top division.",
      "While sewing a white costume in her home workshop, Leal expressed the \u201camazing emotion\u201d of marching in the parade wearing something she helped create.",
      "\u201cCarnival brings a lot of jobs. Not only here, but everywhere,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cMr. Hackman showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d Jarrell said. \u201cHe was in a very poor state of health. He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that\u2019s what resulted in his death.\u201d",
      "Authorities didn't suspect foul play after the bodies of Hackman, 95, and Betsy Arakawa, 65, were discovered Feb 26. Immediate tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative.",
      "Investigators found that the last known communication and activity from Arakawa was Feb. 11 when she visited a pharmacy, pet store and grocery before returning to their gated neighborhood that afternoon, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said Friday.",
      "Hackman's pacemaker last showed signs of activity a week later and that he had an abnormal heart rhythm Feb. 18, the day he likely died, Jarrell said.",
      "Although there was no reliable way to determine the date and time when both died, all signs point to their deaths coming a week apart, Jarrell said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite possible he was not aware she was deceased,\u201d Jarrell said.",
      "Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner, said he believes Hackman was severely impaired due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and unable to deal with his wife\u2019s death in the last week of his life.",
      "Most older Americans with dementia live at home, and many receive care from family or friends.",
      "Their bodies were found a little over a week later. Hackman was found in the home\u2019s entryway. His death was tied to heart disease with Alzheimer\u2019s disease contributing.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom. Authorities linked her death to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings. Thyroid medication pills prescribed to Arakawa were found nearby and weren\u2019t listed as contributing to her death, Jarrell said.",
      "Hantavirus typically is reported in spring and summer, often due to exposures that occur when people are near mouse droppings in homes, sheds or poorly ventilated areas. This is the first confirmed case of hantavirus in New Mexico this year.",
      "While hantavirus is found throughout the world, most cases in the U.S. have been found in western states. The virus can cause a severe and sometimes deadly lung infection.",
      "Jarrell said it was not known how quickly Arakawa died.",
      "One of the couple\u2019s three dogs also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs survived. Authorities initially misidentified the breed.",
      "Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, said Erin Phipps, a veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department. The sheriff considers this an open investigation until they receive results of the dog's necropsy and finish checking into data from personal cellphones retrieved from the home.",
      "When Hackman and Arakawa were found, the bodies were decomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fe\u2019s especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200 feet (2,200 meters).",
      "\u201cAll of us that knew him should have been checking on him,\u201d said Stuart Ashman, co-owner of Artes de Cuba gallery who cherished his encounters with Hackman at a local Pilates exercise studio, where they used to swap stories. \u201cI had no idea. ... It's just really sad. And that she died a week before him. My God.\u201d",
      "Dr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist in Virginia, said when two bodies are found at the same time, the usual assumption would be that they died at the same time. But Hackman\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease added a complicating factor: He apparently was unable to seek help after his wife died.",
      "\u201cThey died several days apart: One dying of a viral infection, the hantavirus, which can kill quite quickly. And the other death occurring from heart disease. And that too can be a relatively sudden death,\" Weedn said. \"Their (the authorities\u2019) explanation, I thought, was quite clear and plausible. I believe they really discovered what truly happened in this case.\u201d",
      "Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \u201cHoosiers\u201d and \u201cSuperman\u201d from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.",
      "Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym.",
      "Hackman dedicated much of his time in retirement to painting and writing novels far from Hollywood\u2019s social circuit. He served for several years on the board of trustees at the Georgia O\u2019Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, and he and his wife were investors in local businesses.",

      "If you\u2019re about to go to the gym, should you eat something beforehand",
      "If you listen to some self-proclaimed exercise experts on social media, they swear that working out on an empty stomach burns more fat.",
      "But it\u2019s a common misconception that exercising in a fasted state improves performance or burns more calories, said Abby Langer, a dietitian in Toronto.",
      "\u201cThe research shows that in terms of gains, it doesn\u2019t really make much of a difference,\u201d she said.",
      "Does that mean you should load up on protein and carbs right before a workout? No, that\u2019s not true either.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at when \u2014 and how \u2014 you should eat, before, after or even during a workout. (And remember, experts say what you eat is more important than when you eat.)",
      "The calories in food literally are energy, so you need them to fuel your body for a proper workout. Eating too much too soon beforehand, though, can be problematic.",
      "Exercising diverts blood from organs including the stomach to the muscles, said Langer, author of \u201cGood Food, Bad Diet.\u201d So exercising on a full stomach affects the digestive process, which could cause cramping or even make you feel sick.",
      "That\u2019s particularly the case with meals high in fat, protein or fiber, which take longer to digest than carbohydrates. Langer recommends eating a high ratio of carbs beforehand and waiting two to three hours before intense exercise.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to eat a big steak an hour before you play hockey,\u201d she said.",
      "If you exercise first thing in the morning or before dinner, it\u2019s OK to have a carb-rich snack like a banana with peanut butter or yogurt with fruit beforehand. It will give you the energy to perform well, and you can fuel up afterward with a full meal.",
      "That steak may serve you better afterward because that\u2019s when a higher ratio of protein is easier to digest, said Krista Austin, a physiologist in Colorado Springs.",
      "Austin said if it will be an hour or longer before you can have a full meal, it\u2019s better to have a high-protein snack in the meantime to help curb your appetite. The reason has little to do with muscle recovery or nutrient absorption: Rather, people who are too hungry make poor dietary choices.",
      "\u201cA lot of people get very hungry about an hour after exercise, and you don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d said Austin, author of \u201cPerformance Nutrition: Applying the Science of Nutrient Timing.\u201d \u201cYou want to catch it early, or you go and overeat.\u201d",
      "But it\u2019s another myth that you need to grab a protein shake within minutes of finishing to build the biggest muscles, Langer said.",
      "Many exercise enthusiasts point to what\u2019s known as an \u201canabolic window\u201d of about an hour within exercising that the body is primed to repair muscle. For the average person, you have a much longer window, and nutrient timing is less important than making sure you consume some protein at every meal, Langer said. The body needs a continuous supply of amino acids like protein for muscle repair and maintenance, she said, which means about 25 to 30 grams at every meal, depending on various factors.",
      "\u201cPrioritizing that will help with goals, either muscle building, satiety, weight loss, all of that,\u201d Langer said.",
      "Most people who are eating enough throughout the day don\u2019t need anything during a workout. Langer and Austin said the threshold is about an hour of intense exercise. Longer than that \u2014 say you're training for a marathon \u2014 and you can benefit from a carb-rich snack in the middle.",
      "Instead of focusing on when to eat, Austin said to focus on what and how much. She cautioned against overcomplicating the topic and recommended following the USDA\u2019s My Plate recommendations for a balanced diet.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing we need to teach people is that nutrition is simple,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you need to stop focusing on the concept of nutrient timing and just make sure that you\u2019re consistently eating throughout the day and focus on health.\u201d",

      "WARSAW, Poland -- Polish abortion rights activists opened a center across from the parliament building in Warsaw on Saturday where women can go to have abortions with pills, either alone or with other women.",
      "Opening the center on International Women's Day across from the legislature was a symbolic challenge to authorities in the traditionally Roman Catholic nation, which has one of Europe's most restrictive laws.",
      "A small but loud group of protesters stood outside the center as activists gathered inside for its inauguration. The activists had private security guards, while police also separated the protesters from those inside.",
      "Activists with the group Abortion Dream Team say it is the first stationary abortion center in Poland. It is meant to offer support to women who prefer not to have abortions alone in their bathrooms at home.",
      "They also say they want to put pressure on politicians and to destigmatize abortion in a society where they say one in four women have had the procedure but it remains a taboo topic.",
      "The country's centrist prime minister, Donald Tusk, came to power in an election in 2023 in which he vowed to liberalize the country's abortion law. But the coalition he leads spans a broad ideological divide, with lawmakers on the left who want to legalize abortion and conservatives strongly opposed.",

      "The Trump administration is dropping an emergency abortion case in Idaho in one of the administration\u2019s first moves on the issue since President Donald Trump's second term began",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration on Wednesday moved to drop an emergency abortion case in Idaho in one of its first moves on the issue since President Donald Trump began his second term.",
      "The Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which was originally filed by the Biden administration, in a reversal that could have national implications for urgent care.",
      "The lawsuit had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences in Idaho, which has one of the country's strictest abortion bans.",
      "The Democratic administration had given similar guidance to hospitals nationwide in the wake of the Supreme Court 2022 decision overturning the right to abortion. It's being challenged in other conservative states.",
      "In Idaho, the state argued that its law does allow life-saving abortions and the Biden administration wrongly sought to expand the exceptions. The state agrees with the dismissal, so it does not need judicial approval, Justice Department attorneys wrote in court documents.",
      "Idaho doctors, meanwhile, say it remains unclear which abortion are legal, forcing them to airlift pregnant women of state if a termination might be part of the standard of care. It's often unclear in fast-moving emergencies whether pregnancy complications could ultimately prove fatal, doctors said in court documents.",
      "A judge has blocked Idaho from any abortion ban enforcement that would change emergency treatment at the state's largest hospital system for now.",
      "In his first term, Trump, a Republican, appointed many of the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturned the constitutional right to abortion. He has since said the issue should be left to the states.",
      "Complaints that pregnant women were turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked after the overturning of Roe v. Wade amid questions about what care hospitals could legally provide, federal records showed.",
      "The Supreme Court stepped into the Idaho case last year. It ultimately handed down a narrow ruling that allowed hospitals to keep making determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations but left key legal questions unresolved.",
      "The case went before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December. Those judges have not yet ruled.",
      "About 50,000 people in the U.S. develop life-threatening pregnancy complications each year, including major blood loss, sepsis or the loss of reproductive organs. In rare cases, doctors might need to terminate a pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant person, especially in cases where there is no chance for a fetus to survive.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions since 2022. Currently, 12 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant."

      "A new study finds the number of butterflies has dropped 22% since 2000, a new study finds",
      "WASHINGTON -- America's butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds.",
      "The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday's journal Science.",
      "\u201cButterflies have been declining the last 20 years,\u201d said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. \u201cAnd we don't see any sign that that's going to end.\"",
      "A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.",
      "Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.",
      "David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is \u201ccatastrophic and saddening\u201d when compounded over time.",
      "\u201cIn just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!\u201d Wagner said in an email. \"The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.\u201d",
      "The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn't show up in the data and another 212 species weren't found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cI'm probably most worried about the species that couldn't even be included in the analyses\u201d because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies \u2014 which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina \u2014 \u201cso it could be extinct.\u201d",
      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cYou can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cThat could really improve the situation for a lot of species.\u201d",

      "Dr. Marty Makary \u2014 a surgeon, author and researcher \u2014 is known for his contrarian views and outspoken criticism of the medical establishment. Like health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Makary traces many of the health issues afflicting Americans to food additives, overprescribing of drugs and the influence of drugmakers, insurers and food companies.",
      "To become commissioner, he\u2019ll need a majority vote from members of the Senate\u2019s health committee, who will question him Thursday morning. A confirmation vote by the full Senate is expected later this month.",
      "The FDA has long been a target for Kennedy, who last year vowed to \u201cclear out\u201d entire departments at the agency, including those overseeing nutrition. Kennedy recently called for a \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d commission to review the safety of vaccines, antidepressants, stimulants and weight-loss drugs \u2014 all products regulated by the FDA \u2014 particularly in children.",
      "The approach has been lauded by most Republicans. But Senate Democrats are expected to push Makary on his willingness to break with Kennedy on key issues, including the safety and benefits of childhood vaccinations.",
      "FDA commissioners aren\u2019t typically involved in the agency\u2019s day-to-day scientific reviews, but they often serve as a buffer between FDA staff and political appointees elsewhere in government.",
      "For his part, Makary has been critical of the agency he would lead. While working as a Fox News contributor during COVID-19, he called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Despite such views, Makary is considered one of Trump\u2019s more conventional health nominees and is widely expected to be confirmed. Before the pandemic, Makary was mainly known for influential studies of medical errors, hospital costs and overprescribing of opioids.",
      "Headquartered in the suburbs outside Washington, the FDA oversees medical products plus billions of dollars in consumer goods, including most foods, cosmetics and vaping products.",
      "Makary would take over at a particularly turbulent period for the agency. Last month, the FDA abruptly fired hundreds of medical reviewers, researchers and inspectors, only to rehire some of them a week later. Several senior FDA officials have resigned or retired in recent months. The agency is also expected to lose more staffers to buyouts, further layoffs and return-to-office requirements.",
      "Among other issues facing the agency:",
      "\u2014 Pressure from anti-abortion groups to restrict the abortion pill mifepristone",
      "\u2014 Efforts to keep up with a wave of artificial intelligence-based medical systems",
      "\u2014 Legal battles with compounding pharmacies and telehealth companies over off-brand versions of weight-loss drugs",
      "In government ethics forms, Makary recently said he has cut financial ties with several companies that could be impacted by his work at FDA, including telehealth and drug companies that sell compounded versions of FDA-approved drugs.",

    "story": [
      "Menopause affects about half the world\u2019s population at some point in life",
      "NEW YORK -- It took five years for Crystal Burke to put a name to the symptoms that haunted her.",
      "Heart palpitations. Insomnia so severe she slept only two to four hours a night. A newfound struggle to make decisions in her job as a nurse. Confusion when dealing with statistics, which she used to handle with ease.",
      "\u201cIt affected my work, it affected my relationships, it affected everything,\" Burke said. \"I felt lost. I didn\u2019t talk to anybody about it.\u201d",
      "Then Burke saw an advertisement about a face cream which contained estrogen, one of the two hormones ovaries produce less and less of with aging. She began talking with friends about her symptoms. And she connected the dots: menopause.",
      "At just 38, Burke had thought she was too young to be going through the life stage when menstrual periods stop and women no longer can become pregnant. But menopause is more than the pop culture stereotype featuring women in their 50s having hot flashes. Symptoms can start much earlier \u2014 during perimenopause, the time leading up to menopause \u2014 and go well beyond hot flashes.",
      "The many manifestations include insomnia, migraines, brain fog, loss of concentration, memory problems, mood swings, depression, anxiety, heart palpitations, hair loss and weight gain. If that wasn\u2019t enough, some people experience heavy, painful periods or recurring urinary tract infections.",
      "Chronic insomnia can make it difficult to concentrate. Brain fog leaves the afflicted struggling to find words during meetings. But social stigma and a lack of information have left menopausal people dealing alone with severe symptoms that may impact their work. Many stay silent, fearing they\u2019ll be viewed as underperformers or weak.",
      "Some women in senior leadership positions leave their jobs or reduce their hours as a result of debilitating side effects from menopause, said Lauren Redfern, executive director of Hormonally, a nonprofit that provides workplace training and education about women\u2019s health. But those who feel supported by employers during the transition are more likely to remain at work, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you open up a space to talk about these things, people are desperate to have a conversation,\u201d Redfern said. \u201cThe symptoms are so diverse and so far-reaching and so prolific they impact every area of someone\u2019s life.\u201d",
      "Menopause affects about half the world\u2019s population at some point in life. Yet due to the epidemic of silence around it, women, nonbinary people and transgender individuals often don't recognize the onset of unpleasant physical and emotional changes as side effects of declining hormone levels.",
      "Finding health care providers who are trained to identify and treat their symptoms can be challenging. Some startups have sought to change that by providing access to referrals or telehealth appointments with doctors or therapists who specialize in treating menopausal patients.",
      "\u201cWhen you don\u2019t know that something can get fixed, it\u2019s very scary,\u201d said Midi Health founder Joanna Strober, whose company connects women with professionals who understand menopause. \u201dIf you think, \u2018For the rest of my life I\u2019m going to have brain fog and not remember anyone\u2019s name, and I\u2019m going to keep losing my car in the parking lot and I\u2019m going to keep gaining weight,\u2019 then it\u2019s very demoralizing.\u201d",
      "Burke found relief when she began hormone replacement therapy. Inspired to help others, she co-founded The Menopause Clinic in Louisiana to offer telehealth services focused on menopause.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing is for women to know what perimenopause is, what menopause is, and that there are options,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThe suffering isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d",
      "Hormone replacement therapy is not an option for those with certain medical histories, and some doctors are unwilling to prescribe it. Some experts recommend acupuncture, dietary changes and exercise to help manage symptoms.",
      "The Mayo Clinic estimates that menopause symptoms lead to $1.8 billion in lost work time per year in the U.S. About 5% of employers offer menopause benefits or accommodations such as the ability to work from home or a cool room, according to benefit consulting company NFP.",
      "Here are some steps you or your employer can take to make the workplace more hospitable for people experiencing menopause.",
      "Finding supportive colleagues can help bridge knowledge gaps. If your organization doesn't have a menopause support group, you can start one. Once established, the group or human resources department can bring in facilitators to teach the entire workforce \u2014 not just women \u2014 about menopause.",
      "Sarah Daniels, a communications manager, started a support group called \u201cMenopause Matters\u201d at Arriva Group, a U.K.-based public transportation company. The male-dominated company already had a gender inclusion group, so Daniels joined and organized the menopause group as an offshoot.",
      "The group's monthly meetings are held online during business hours. Participants swap notes on supplements, teas, treatments and beauty products. Daniels believes the group improves productivity because it gives members a sense of belonging within the organization.",
      "\u201cI know how lonely it is when you are going through these things, because you think, \u2018Is this just happening to me?'\" she said. \u201cI had a UTI (urinary tract infection) that was so severe that I fainted on a train. My periods were so heavy that I couldn\u2019t leave the house.\u201d",
      "Arriva has a policy that says bosses must listen to and make reasonable adjustments for employees struggling with menopause. That could mean more restroom breaks, uniform adaptations to help with hot flashes or flexible working hours, Daniels said.",
      "People working for employers who do not subsidize menopause-related care and programs can model requests for similar benefits after the small percentage of companies that do.",
      "When Shevonya Noble joined biotechnology firm Genentech as a principal quality and compliance leader, she was connected with a care advocate who helped her find a nutritionist, wellness coach, career coach, mental health provider and physical support coach to address her menopause symptoms.",
      "Appointment costs were covered through a benefit provided by Maven, which partners with employers and health plans to deliver care targeted to women. Genentech\u2019s benefits also include menopause-specific classes and support groups.",
      "At a former employer, Noble felt she had to hide the hot flashes that interrupted her sleep and disrupted her concentration while giving presentations because she didn't see anyone else furiously fanning themselves at their desks.",
      "\u201cThe conversation about menopause needs to be broadened to include men, not just men in our lives but in the workplace as well,\u201d Noble said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we not shy away from the topic but include it in our conversations and to just take the mystique away from what goes on with women at this stage in life.\u201d",
      "Speaking up about symptoms also may help. When women experience hot flashes and brain fog at work, they\u2019re often seen as less competent, but if they say, \u201cIt\u2019s menopausal, I\u2019m getting treated for it,\u2019\u201d the discrimination goes away and they\u2019re seen as powerful leaders again, according to Midi founder Strober.",
      "\u201cYou have to call it out. You have to say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a hot flash,\u2019 not just look sweaty in a meeting, because then they just discount you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you call it out, you can take your power back.\u201d",

      "At 27 years and more than 250 days, the selfie- and snuggle-loving llama called Whitetop dethroned Dalai Llama, the Guinness World Records announced last week. Dalai lived on a ranch in Albuquerque and was announced as the oldest in 2023 shortly after his 27th birthday.",
      "Whitetop was donated to the Victory Junction camp in 2006, just two years after race car driver Kyle Petty \u2014 the son of NASCAR great Richard Petty \u2014 and his family founded the camp in honor of Petty's own son, Adam, who was 19 when he was killed in a 2000 crash while practicing for a race.",
      "The year-round free camp sits on 84 acres (34 hectares) in the Petty hometown of Randleman, North Carolina, about 75 miles (121 kilometers) west of Raleigh. It\u2019s designed for children with conditions that include cancer, kidney and heart disease, cerebral palsy, Spina Bifida and an array of neurological and physical disabilities.",
      "Whitetop has become known for his relaxed, sweet and empathetic personality. His go-to move is to lie still while campers pet him, which can comfort children and give them important sensory input, said Billie Davis, the camp's barn director.",
      "\u201cHe really gets to help campers come out of their shell when they interact with him,\" she said. \"He can be kind of intimidating at first, but once they come over to him and love on him and pet on him, they just realize how sweet he is.\u201d",
      "One of his best friends is a miniature highland cow named Gus-Gus, who tends to forget Whitetop is a llama and enjoys jumping on him. Whitetop also likes to roll in fresh wood chippings, chomp on soaked alfalfa and pose for selfies.",
      "\u201cIf you try to take a picture of him from the side, he\u2019s not into it,\" Davis said. \"He will, like scoot in there and try to get his face from a side profile so that it\u2019s like he\u2019s cheesing.\u201d",
      "Davis attributes Whitetop's long life to great veterinary care and exercise, as well as it simply loving his job.",
      "The average life span for a llama is 15 years, according to the Denver Zoo Conservation Alliance.",
      "Whitetop has developed arthritis in his twilight years but otherwise is very healthy, said Davis. And the only times the llama becomes upset is when Gus-Gus, along with two miniature donkeys named Jed and Jethro, leave him alone.",
      "Stephanie Wilkerson, 33, first went to the camp\u2019s family weekend in 2006 after she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. She said she was initially a little nervous around Whitetop but soon realized petting him and giving him hugs made her feel better.",
      "\u201cWhen I started stroking him more and more and more, I got more relaxed,\" said Wilkerson, who lives in Thomasville, North Carolina.",
      "With Whitetop\u2019s newfound fame in longevity, the camp has started selling limited edition T-shirts displaying Whitetop with sunglasses and the words, \u201cStill Spit\u2019n.\u201d The proceeds go to the camp.",
      "Although Davis said Whitetop would like people to know not all llamas spit on you.",
      "\u201cTypically llamas only spit when they are scared, uncomfortable or territorial over something,\" she said. \"And he just loves his job so much that he doesn\u2019t do it.\u201d",

      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- Women planning pill abortions in Wyoming will need to get an ultrasound after lawmakers overrode the governor's veto of the law.",
      "Wednesday's 22-9 vote by the state Senate followed a 45-16 vote by the House on Tuesday to override. In vetoing the bill Monday, Republican Gov. Mark Gordon questioned whether it was reasonable and necessary, especially for victims of rape and incest.",
      "Lawmakers cited concerns about women's well-being Wednesday in voting to override, and they cleared the two-thirds majority requirement.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very concerned about the psychological effects of this procedure,\u201d Republican Sen. Darin Smith of Cheyenne said of the governor, \u201cbut what about the psychological effects of having an abortion, for the rest of your life?\u201d",
      "The new requirement, which takes effect right away, was criticized by abortion rights advocates.",
      "\u201cWe are saddened so many legislators lack empathy and respect for women\u2019s decision-making authority, but we stand ready to fight this unconstitutional, unnecessary and unreasonable bill in court,\u201d Christine Lichtenfels, executive director of the Wyoming abortion access advocacy group Chelsea\u2019s Fund, said in a statement.",
      "Wyoming is the first state to explicitly outlaw pill abortions, though that and other abortion bans over the past three years are on hold pending a case before the Wyoming Supreme Court.",
      "Ten other states require abortion providers to perform ultrasounds on women seeking abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "Under Wyoming's new law, pregnant women planning pill abortions will have to drive potentially long distances to get an ultrasound and have it documented. They would have the opportunity but not be required to view the image of the fetus at least 48 hours before a pill abortion.",
      "Existing state law already requires abortion providers to offer an ultrasound to women getting abortions.",
      "Pregnant woman who do not get an ultrasound will not be penalized under the new law, however. Instead it is medical providers who face up to $9,000 in fines and six months in jail for not arranging it.",
      "But there are few if any active abortion providers left. Last week the state's only full-service abortion clinic stopped providing any abortion care, surgical or medicinal, after Gordon signed a bill requiring such facilities to be licensed as surgical centers.",
      "Wellspring Health Access in Casper is wary of running afoul of the law while it challenges it and others in court, President Julie Burkhart said.",
      "It was not clear whether Wyoming's only other clinic providing medication abortions, a family medicine practice in Jackson, continues to do so. There was no response to phone messages left with the clinic seeking comment Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Pill abortions remain possible in the state through remote services: Women have access through the Just the Pill telehealth service and online providers such as Abuzz, The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, and Aid Access, according to Chelsea\u2019s Fund.",
      "The Guttmacher Institute found that more than 3 in 5 abortions carried out in the U.S. through the formal health care system in 2023 were medicinal. Wyoming had the biggest portion of abortions via pill that year: 19 in 20.",

      "A yearslong legal battle over the right to an emergency abortion in Idaho has been abruptly upended now that President Donald Trump has moved to drop the high-profile case.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if it was needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences.",
      "Yet a little more than a month after taking over the White House, Trump's decision to abandon the legal fight signals how the Republican administration plans on interpreting federal law designed to protect urgent care when up against states' abortion bans.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. The ruling came down while President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was in office, but many of the justices who helped reverse Roe v. Wade were appointed under Trump.",
      "So in response, Biden warned that his administration considered abortion part of the stabilizing care that federal law requires facilities to provide to patients who show up at an emergency room. A month later, Biden sued Idaho, which had enacted an abortion ban that makes it a crime with a prison term of up to five years for anyone who performs or assists in an abortion.",
      "The Biden administration argued that Idaho\u2019s abortion ban prevented ER doctors from offering an abortion if a woman needs one in a medical emergency. But Idaho\u2019s attorney general has pointed out that federal law also requires hospitals to consider the health of the \u201cunborn child\u201d in its treatment, too.",
      "The lawsuit has twisted and turned in the legal system ever since. Last year, the Supreme Court agreed to step into the Idaho case, but it handed down a narrow ruling: Hospitals were allowed to make determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations, but the key legal question about what care hospitals should legally provide remains unresolved.",
      "Known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, the 1986 law requires emergency rooms to offer a medical exam if you turn up at their facility. The law applies to any ERs that accept Medicare funding \u2014 so nearly all of them.",
      "Those ERs are also required to stabilize patients experiencing a medical emergency before discharging or transferring them. Notably, if the ER doesn't have the resources or staff to treat a patient, medical staffers must arrange a medical transfer to another hospital \u2014 they can't simply direct a patient to go elsewhere.",
      "EMTALA is more scrutinized than ever since Roe was overturned. Multiple doctors and families have told The Associated Press about pregnant women with dangerous medical conditions showing up in hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices only to be denied the abortions that could help treat them. Some women described facing harmful delays.",
      "Not yet. And the DOJ's three-page motion didn't explain why they wanted to abandon the lawsuit either. However, since having a hand in revoking the constitutional right to abortion, Trump has repeatedly touted his support of leaving abortion regulations up to the states.",
      "Meanwhile, ending the effort to use federal law to protect emergency abortions was a goal of Project 2025, the blueprint created by the Heritage Foundation for a second Trump term, which calls for reversing what it describes as \u201cdistorted pro-abortion\u201d interpretations of federal law. Trump insisted during his 2024 presidential campaign that Project 2025 was not part of his agenda.",
      "\u201cTheir move to drop this case against Idaho I think really shows what their true priorities are \u2014 and it is to push an anti-abortion political agenda rather than support the lives, health and well being of pregnant women and people, not just in Idaho but across the country because this case does have far-reaching impact,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers.",
      "Trump's decision to drop the Idaho case comes several months after the Supreme Court said the federal government couldn't require hospitals to provide pregnancy terminations when it would violate Texas' abortion ban.",
      "Texas had sued over the Biden administration's enforcement of EMTALA, and a lower federal court eventually sided with the state. But similar to the case in Idaho, the Supreme Court stopped short of deciding whether the federal law can supersede a state's abortion ban.",
      "Meanwhile, concern has grown over whether Trump's decision in the Idaho case is a sign that his administration may also reverse course in a longstanding legal battle over telehealth access to mifepristone, the medication used in the nation's most common abortion method.",
      "The Department of Justice under Biden had sought to dismiss a complaint brought by a handful states seeking to roll back access to mifepristone. It's currently unclear how Trump plans on proceeding."

      "A third of patients travel more than 150 miles for care at the Salt Lake City cancer center. But for patients even further away \u2014 in Idaho, Montana, Nevada and Wyoming \u2014 because it\u2019s also the regional hub for NIH-funded studies of new treatments.",
      "So Ulrich\u2019s center helps train local doctors to do at least some of the blood tests and other steps of clinical trials that let faraway patients participate without traveling \u2014 a program threatened if her university loses tens of millions in NIH cuts.",
      "The issue: Most of the NIH\u2019s budget \u2014 more than $35 billion a year \u2014 goes to universities, hospitals and other research groups. The grants are divided into \u201cdirect costs\u201d \u2014 covering researchers\u2019 salaries and a project\u2019s supplies \u2014 and \u201cindirect costs,\u201d to reimburse other expenses supporting the work such as electricity, maintenance and janitorial staff, and safety and ethics oversight.",
      "NIH directly negotiates with research groups, a process that grants managers say requires receipts and audits, to set rates for those indirect expenses that can reach 50% or more. But the Trump administration now plans to cap those rates at 15%. The administration estimates it would save the government $4 billion a year but scientists say it really means they'll have to stop some lifesaving work.",
      "They are \u201creal expenses, that\u2019s the critical point \u2013 they are not fluff,\u201d said Ulrich. Using separate cancer center funds to cover those costs would threaten other \u201cactivities that are really important to us in serving our communities across the mountain West.\u201d",
      "A federal judge has blocked the move but until the court fight is done researchers aren\u2019t sure what they can continue to afford.",
      "NIH grants divided between researchers in every state in 2023 supported more than 412,000 jobs and $92 billion in new economic activity, according to a yearly report from United for Medical Research that often is cited as Congress sets the agency's budget.",
      "The AP tallied how much money would have been lost in each state under a 15% cap on those grants\u2019 indirect costs. Those lost dollars alone would have cost at least 58,000 jobs, concluded an analysis assisted by Inforum, a nonpartisan economic consulting firm that conducts UMR's economic impact reports.",
      "Consider Hopkins, which runs about 600 NIH-funded clinical trials plus other laboratory research and is Baltimore\u2019s largest private employer. \u201cIf we can\u2019t do science and we can\u2019t support the science, we can\u2019t support the surrounding community either,\u201d Huganir said.",
      "Huganir studies how the brain stores memory as people learn when he discovered a gene that, when mutated, causes certain intellectual disabilities.",
      "After years studying the SynGap1 gene, \u201cwe have what we think is a really great therapeutic\u201d almost ready to be tested in severely affected children. Huganir has applied for two new NIH grants key for moving toward those trials.",
      "\u201cThe problem is for the kids, there\u2019s a window of time to treat them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re running out of time.\u201d",
      "NIH reviews of new grant applications have been delayed despite court rulings to end a government spending freeze, and it\u2019s unclear how quickly they can get back on track.",
      "\u201cEveryone I know is basically freaking out because we suddenly don\u2019t know how much longer we\u2019ll be able to keep our labs open,\u201d said neuroscientist Rebecca Shansky at Boston\u2019s Northeastern University, who\u2019s awaiting word on grants for her study of how the brain processes pain and trauma.",
      "Even scientists with existing funding are left wondering if their projects \u2014 from transgender health to learning why white breast cancer patients in Oklahoma fare worse than Black patients in Massachusetts \u2014 will be caught in Trump\u2019s anti-diversity crackdown. Some already have, even though studying different populations is fundamental to medicine.",
      "\u201cThose studies are very much threatened right now. People don\u2019t know what the rules are,\u201d said well-known Hopkins specialist Dr. Otis Brawley. \u201cWe\u2019re actually going to kill people is what it amounts to, because we\u2019re not studying how to get appropriate care to all people.\u201d",

      "Taken together, experts have raised concerns about a possible misinterpretation of Kennedy's message: that because vitamin A is available, they don't need to be vaccinated.",
      "",
      "\"Vitamin A is absolutely not a substitute nor an equivalent for MMR vaccination, which is the best way to prevent a child from getting measles,\" Ericka Hayes, MD, of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told MedPage Today.",
      "",

      "",
      "\"I think some people are thinking, 'Oh, well, then, if I, for example, take vitamin A, I won't get measles, or I'm less likely to get measles,'\" Hayes said. \"And that is absolutely not the case.\"",

      "Much of the literature about vitamin A and measles comes from lower- and middle-income countries, where deficiency may pose more of a problem. However, given that vitamin A deficiency can put kids at risk of worse outcomes with measles  --  and most kids aren't assessed for vitamin A levels  --  U.S. expert consensus has settled on administering the vitamin in all cases.",
      "",
      "Tina Tan, MD, of Northwestern University, who is president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said vitamin A \"really plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system and supports the function of immune cells so the body can fight off infections like measles.\"",
      "",
      "However, taking vitamin A won't prevent a child from getting measles in the first place, Hayes said, and it can have \"significant toxicities,\" especially when taken in high doses. \"And just because you're taking vitamin A or have a good vitamin A level doesn't guarantee that you will not have a ... severe case of measles,\" she added.",

      "The AAP Red Book  --  an encyclopedia of pediatric infectious diseases  --  noted that U.S. experts concur with WHO recommendations on giving vitamin A to all children with measles, and recommends giving it once a day for 2 days at the following doses:",

      "",
      "Tan said that the \"number of unvaccinated individuals is growing, and that basically increases the risk for spread of measles, because measles is one of the most contagious viruses.\"",

      "Senate Republicans in Georgia have advanced two bills restricting gender-affirming care for transgender people",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's Senate passed two bills Monday that would ban most gender-affirming care for minors and people incarcerated in state prisons, mirroring moves by Republicans across states and a handful of executive orders by President Donald Trump targeting transgender people.",
      "The chamber voted 34-19 for a bill that would ban puberty blockers and most gender-affirming care for people under 18, including those already undergoing treatment. Georgia lawmakers in 2023 banned most gender-affirming surgeries and hormone replacement therapies for transgender minors unless they were already receiving treatment. The law lets doctors prescribe puberty blockers.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re asking (minors) to make changes that will have changes to the rest of their lives,\u201d bill sponsor Republican Sen. Ben Watson, of Savannah, said Monday. \u201cIt is not a fair decision to them. It is not a fair decision to the parents.\u201d",
      "A second bill sponsored by Senate Majority Whip Randy Robertson passed 37-15 and would ban most gender-affirming care for people incarcerated in state prisons.",
      "Last month, the chamber passed bills to ban transgender people from playing in school sports and cut off public funding for gender-affirming care for adults. The four bills will now head to the House for debate.",
      "Opponents said Republicans are playing politics by targeting transgender people and that lawmakers should focus on helping Georgians with more pressing issues such as housing and healthcare. They say both bills infringe on the rights of transgender people and their families to make decisions about gender-affirming care.",
      "\u201cThis body has promulgated bill after bill attacking trans people with the ultimate goal of making trans fols disappear. We\u2019ve been here before,\" said Senate Minority Whip Kim Jackson, a Stone Mountain Democrat who is openly lesbian.",
      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting gender-affirming care for minors, and most are facing lawsuits. A study released in January found that fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents with commercial insurance during a five-year period received gender-affirming medications such as puberty blockers or hormones.",

      "Sens. Elena Parent and Sonya Halpern, both Atlanta Democrats, reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the rights of transgender people but broke with their party to vote for Robertson\u2019s bill because they said they do not think taxpayers should pay for gender-affirming care for people in prison. Parent proposed an amendment to make an exception for incarcerated people already undergoing hormone replacement therapy that failed.",

      "Food and Drug Administration nominee Dr. Marty Makary is known for his contrarian views and fiery criticism of traditional medical institutions",
      "WASHINGTON -- Dr. Marty Makary rose to national attention by skewering the medical establishment in books and papers and bashing the federal response to COVID-19 on TV.",
      "Now the Johns Hopkins University surgeon and researcher has been nominated to lead the Food and Drug Administration. The agency \u2014 responsible for regulating products ranging from toothpaste to vaccines \u2014 is famously understated, issuing carefully worded statements devoid of opinion or scientific speculation.",
      "That's the opposite approach of Makary, whose sweeping rhetoric and biting criticism often veer into hyperbole, according to a review of recent speeches, interviews and podcast appearances by The Associated Press.",
      "Makary has called the U.S. food supply \u201cpoison,\u201d says the federal government is the \u201cgreatest perpetrator of misinformation\u201d about COVID-19 and regularly suggests that pesticides, fluoride and overuse of antibiotics may be to blame for rising rates of infertility, attention deficit disorder and other health conditions. He\u2019ll appear Thursday before a Senate panel considering his nomination.",
      "Makary\u2019s views align with those of the man who would be his boss: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who built a following by sowing doubts about vaccines, ultraprocessed foods and fluoride. Notably, Makary has never embraced Kennedy\u2019s discredited idea that vaccines might cause autism.",
      "Experts who have worked with Makary say his contrarian approach could be useful at FDA \u2014 but only if he\u2019s able to resist political pressure from Kennedy and others on hot-button issues like vaccines.",
      "\u201cHe has this reputation of being someone who cares about evidence and transparency,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran of Yale University, who was part of an informal research group with Makary. \u201cThe question is whether he\u2019s going to preserve and defend the integrity of the agency or is he going to fall in line with the administration.\u201d",
      "Makary did not respond to an AP interview request.",
      "Trained as a pancreatic surgeon, Makary\u2019s initial work focused on uncontroversial topics like hospital costs and surgical checklists.",
      "In 2016, he made headlines with a paper stating that medical errors were \u201cthe third leading cause of death in the U.S.\u201d That conclusion was quickly disputed by other experts, who said the paper\u2019s death estimate was ten times higher than more rigorous reviews.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Makary reached a much broader audience as a regular on Fox News, where he opposed vaccine mandates and called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Makary often directs his harshest criticism toward the \u201cmedical hubris\u201d of fellow doctors, as in his latest book \u201cBlind Spots,\u201d which catalogues a number of cases where experts \u201cgot the science perfectly backwards.\u201d",
      "For example, he examines early recommendations that parents delay giving babies peanut-based foods due to allergy risks. Today, pediatricians generally recommend earlier introduction to prevent food allergies.",
      "Many researchers view such examples differently.",
      "\u201cThese are cases of people doing the best they can with evolving information and needing to make decisions along the way,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Harvard Medical School. \u201cAs commissioner, he\u2019s going to have to be OK with making decisions based on evolving evidence \u2014 and some of those decisions might be wrong.\u201d",
      "Like others in Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, Makary says many of the chronic health problems afflicting Americans may be related to food additives, pesticides and other chemicals.",
      "\u201cHow about research on the pesticides that have hormone effects in children that may explain the declining fertility and lowering age of puberty?\u201d Makary asked, in a September podcast with Dr. Drew Pinsky.",
      "New York University food researcher Marion Nestle says Makary\u2019s questions \u201care extremely difficult to settle,\u201d because there\u2019s no way to ethically do the type of research needed to reach a firm conclusion: give one group of children food with pesticides and compare them with a control group getting food not grown with pesticides.",
      "\u201cI sympathize with his frustration and think we would be much better off with a lot fewer pesticides in our food supply, but I tend to view these issues more cautiously,\u201d Nestle said.",
      "Nutrition experts also say it\u2019s overly simplistic to declare all ultraprocessed foods harmful, since the category includes an estimated 60% of U.S. foods, including granola, peanut butter and ice cream.",
      "\u201cThey are not all created equal,\u201d said Gabby Headrick of George Washington University. \u201cIt is much more complicated than just pointing the finger at ultraprocessed foods as the driver of chronic disease in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe greatest perpetrator of misinformation during the pandemic has been the United States government,\u201d Makary told House lawmakers during a 2023 roundtable hosted by Republicans.",
      "Among the many COVID-19 policies Makary attacked was the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. That group received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild. Complicating the issue was the fact that COVID-19 itself also caused cases of myocarditis that were usually more severe.",
      "A 2022 paper coauthored by Makary concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit. None of the authors specialized in studying infectious diseases or vaccine reactions.",
      "\u201cThey made mistake after mistake and every time it either minimized the vaccine\u2019s benefits or exaggerated the risks,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris of the University of Washington, who published a critique of the work. \u201cThis paper really fed the whole notion that the vaccine is worse than the disease.\u201d",
      "Makary's conclusion contradicted that of U.K. experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which estimated the booster prevented 114 hospitalizations for every seven it caused in young people.",
      "Despite such pushback, Makary told Congress that CDC and FDA \u201clied to the American people\u201d about the need for boosters and other COVID measures.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, an FDA vaccine adviser, says the Biden administration made missteps in rolling out boosters, including announcing plans to make them available for all age groups before outside experts had weighed in. But, Offit said, Makary\u2019s language has damaged public trust in health institutions, including the one he\u2019s been picked to lead.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s rhetoric that\u2019s purposefully inflammatory to win over a certain crowd, which is part of today\u2019s zeitgeist of disdaining public health agencies,\u201d Offit said. \u201cSo he\u2019s offered the position at FDA because he has disdain for the agency.\u201d",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- An Australian man credited with saving 2.4 million babies through his record-breaking blood plasma donations over six decades, has died, his family said Tuesday. He was 88.",
      "James Harrison, a retired state railway department clerk, died in a nursing home on the central coast of New South Wales state on Feb. 17, according to his grandson, Jarrod Mellowship.",
      "Harrison\u2019s plasma contained a rare antibody, known as anti-D, which is used to make injections that protect unborn babies from hemolytic disease of the newborn, in which a pregnant woman\u2019s immune system attacks her fetus\u2019 red blood cells. The disease is most common when a woman has an Rh negative blood type and her baby\u2019s is Rh positive.",
      "Australia has only 200 anti-D donors who help 45,000 mothers and their babies annually.",
      "Despite an aversion to needles, Harrison made 1,173 donations after he turned 18 in 1954 until he was forced to retire in 2018, aged 81.",
      "\u201cHe did it for the right reasons. As humble as he was, he did like the attention. But he would never do it for the attention,\u201d Mellowship said, adding his grandfather had been surprised to be recognized by Guinness World Records in 2005 as the person who had donated the most blood plasma in the world.",
      "The record was beaten in 2022 by American Brett Cooper from Walker, Michigan.",
      "The Australian Red Cross Blood Service said Harrison was renowned as the \u201cMan with the Golden Arm.\u201d",
      "He was credited with saving the lives of 2.4 million babies through his plasma donations, the national agency responsible for collecting and distributing blood products, also known as Lifeblood, said in a statement.",
      "Lifeblood chief executive Stephen Cornelissen said Harrison had hoped that someone in Australia would one day beat his donation record.",
      "\u201cJames was a remarkable, stoically kind and generous person who was committed to a lifetime of giving and he captured the hearts of many people around the world,\u201d Cornelissen said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIt was James\u2019 belief that his donations were no more important than any other donors' and that everyone can be special in the same way that he was,\u201d Cornelissen added.",
      "Mellowship said his mother, Tracey Mellowship, Harrison\u2019s daughter, needed the treatment when he and his brother, Scott, were born.",
      "Jarrod Mellowship said his own wife, Rebecca, also needed the treatment when three of their four children were born.",
      "There is speculation that Harrison developed a high concentrations of anti-D as a result of his own blood transfusions during major lung surgery when he was 14.",
      "\u201cAfter the surgery, his dad, Reg, told grandad you\u2019re only really alive because people donated blood,\u201d Jarrod Mellowship said. \u201cThe day he turned 18, he started donating.\u201d",
      "The application of anti-D in fighting hemolytic disease of the newborn was not discovered until the 1960s.",
      "Harrison, who was born in New South Wales, is survived by his sister, Margaret Thrift, his daughter, two grandsons and four great-grandchildren."

      "Each of these Republicans \u2014 and some of their conservative colleagues \u2014 lined up last week to defend Medicaid, in a departure from long-held GOP policies. Republicans, who already have ruled out massive cuts to Social Security and Medicare, are turning their attention to siphoning as much as $880 billion from Medicaid over the next decade to help finance $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.",
      "But as a deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown nears, hesitation is surfacing among Washington's Republican lawmakers \u2014 once reliable critics of lofty government social welfare programs such as Medicaid \u2014 who say that deep cuts to the health care program could prove too untenable for people back home.",
      "\u201cI've heard from countless constituents who tell me the only way they can afford health care is through programs like Medicaid,\u201d Valadao said on the House floor. \u201cAnd I will not support a final reconciliation bill that risks leaving them behind.\u201d",
      "And on Wednesday, President Donald Trump, too, made his position on Medicaid clear: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to touch it.\u201d",
      "States and the federal government jointly pay for Medicaid, which offers nearly-free health care coverage for roughly 80 million poor and disabled Americans, including millions of children. It cost $880 billion to operate in 2023.",
      "Johnson has ruled out two of the biggest potential cuts: paying fixed, shrunken rates to states for care and changing the calculation for the share of federal dollars that each state receives for Medicaid. Just a few years ago, Johnson spearheaded a report that lobbied for some of those changes during the first Trump administration.",
      "Johnson insisted in a CNN interview that the focus will instead be ferreting out \u201cfraud, waste and abuse, in Medicaid, although it's unlikely to deliver the savings Republicans seek.",
      "GOP pressure over Medicaid is mounting, with some state party leaders joining the calls to preserve the program. States are already struggling with the growing cost of sicker patients and could be left to cover more if the federal government pulls back. In some states, the federal government picks up over 80%.",
      "More than a dozen Minnesota GOP lawmakers wrote the president recently warning that \u201ctoo deep of a cut is unmanageable in any instance.\u201d Gov. Joe Lombardo, R-Nev., told Congress in a letter that \u201cproposed reductions would put lives at risk.\" In Alaska, state Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, a Republican and nurse, cited \u201chuge concerns\u201d during a floor speech.",
      "Nationally, 55% of Americans said the government spends too little on Medicaid, according to a January poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now a very popular program that touches a very broad cross-section of American society,\u201d said Drew Altman, president of the health care research firm KFF. \u201cRoughly half of the American people say that they or a family member have at one time been served by the program.\u201d",
      "Significant changes to Medicaid are still on the table. They have to be for Republicans get the savings they need to pay for tax cuts.",
      "Work requirements, which could save as much as $109 billion over the next decade, seem to have solid support among GOP members, with some individual Republican-led states already moving to implement them.",
      "Republicans also could consider cuts in benefits or coverage, as well as eliminating a provider tax that states use to finance Medicaid, Altman added.",
      "Democrats warn that reductions are inevitable and could be dire.",
      "Starting Monday, TV ads will caution people across 20 congressional districts that hospitals are at risk of closing and millions of people could lose coverage if Republicans cut Medicaid \"to fund massive tax cuts for Elon Musk and billionaires.\u201d The Democratic super political action committee House Majority Forward has launched the seven-figure campaign.",
      "Trump and Republicans have for years called to lower government spending on health care, but they have struggled to formulate a serious plan that gains traction. Trump, for example, has spent nearly a decade arguing for an overhaul of the Affordable Care Act. His efforts to repeal the Obama-era national health care law failed during his first term and in his most recent presidential campaign he offered only \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d to adapt the program.",
      "Michael Cannon, a director of health studies at libertarian Cato Institute, believes Medicaid needs an overhaul because it is a significant part of the federal budget and a contributor to the nation's growing debt.",
      "But Republicans, he said, are not looking at serious ways to drive down the cost of health care.",
      "\u201cThe only reason for the cuts right now is to pay for the tax cuts,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cNone of them are talking about the need to do better health reform.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Measles has sickened nearly 150 mostly unvaccinated people in rural West Texas, and a school-age child has died",
      "SEMINOLE, Texas -- Measles had struck this West Texas town, sickening dozens of children, but at the Community Church of Seminole, more than 350 worshippers gathered for a Sunday service. Sitting elbow-to-elbow, they filled the pews, siblings in matching button-down shirts and dresses, little girls\u2019 hair tied neatly into pink bows.",
      "Fathers shushed babbling toddlers as their wives snuck out to change infants' diapers.",
      "A little girl in this mostly Mennonite congregation was among those who\u2019d fallen ill with the highly contagious respiratory disease, senior pastor David Klassen said \u2014 but she\u2019s doing fine, and she happily played through her quarantine. He heard that at least two Mennonite schools shut down for a bit to disinfect.",
      "What he hasn\u2019t heard: Any direct outreach from public health officials on what to do as the number of those sickened with measles has grown to 146 and a school-age child has died. And though Klassen is a trusted church and community leader, his congregants haven\u2019t asked about whether they should vaccinate their kids \u2014 and he wouldn\u2019t want to weigh in.",
      "\u201cWith this measles situation, I can honestly just tell you we haven\u2019t taken any steps as a church,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did leave it up to the mothers.\u201d",
      "As measles \u2014 a preventable disease the U.S. considered eliminated in 2000 \u2014 spreads through West Texas\u2019 rural expanse, Klassen is sticking to an approach on vaccines that is a key tenet for Mennonites. Family leaders are the top decision-making authority \u2014 not outside recommendations, certainly not government mandates.",
      "Alongside measles in this region, where voters overwhelmingly supported President Donald Trump, there\u2019s another outbreak: one of misinformation about vaccines, distrust of local public health officials and fear of governmental authority overruling family autonomy. And on the national stage, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the country\u2019s top health official and an anti-vaccine activist, dismissed the Texas outbreak as \u201cnot unusual.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo I trust all the vaccines? No,\u201d Klassen said. \u201cAnd I get from (Kennedy) that he doesn\u2019t trust all the vaccines, either. And he is very well educated in that; I\u2019m not.\u201d",
      "In an opinion piece for Fox News Digital, Kennedy wrote about the value of the vaccine but stopped short of calling on families to get it, saying the decision is \u201ca personal one.\u201d He urged parents to speak to their health care providers about options.",
      "Vaccine skepticism has also been spurred by state lawmakers who this year filed more than a dozen bills that would strengthen or expand vaccine exemptions, which Texas already allows for \u201creasons of conscience, including a religious belief.\u201d",
      "At hospitals in Lubbock, 80 miles to the north and on the front lines of the outbreak, babies with measles are struggling to breathe.",
      "Dr. Summer Davies, a Texas Tech Physicians pediatrician, said she has treated about 10 of the outbreak\u2019s patients, most very young or teens. She said children have had to be intubated, including one younger than 6 months old. Others come in with such high fevers or severe sore throats that they refuse to eat or drink to the point of dehydration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard as a pediatrician, knowing that we have a way to prevent this and prevent kids from suffering and even death,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do agree that the herd immunity that we have established in the past isn\u2019t the same now. And I think kids are suffering because of that.\u201d",
      "In Lubbock County, 92% of kindergarteners are up to date on their measles, mumps and rubella shots, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. That\u2019s lower than the 95% threshold experts say is needed to prevent measles from spreading. Gaines County, which includes Seminole, has an 82% MMR vaccination rate, though rates for homeschooled or private school students may be much lower. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide. Many Mennonite families don\u2019t send children to public schools.",
      "All of the children admitted with measles to Covenant Children\u2019s Hospital in Lubbock were unvaccinated, officials said last week. Dr. Lara Johnson, the hospital\u2019s chief medical officer, told The Associated Press that Covenant has seen more than 20 patients, including children, teens and pregnant mothers, since the outbreak began in late January.",
      "News of a measles case in Seminole, population 7,200, put doctors on a \u201cshared high alert,\u201d said Dr. Martin Ortega, a family physician for Texas Tech Physicians in Odessa, about an hour away. The small towns of West Texas may look completely isolated on a map, with little between them beyond oil and gas facilities and sprawling desert. But the region is connected by its people, who regularly travel long distances to grocery stores, hospitals and houses of worship.",
      "Many doctors are seeing measles cases for the first time in their careers. In Lea County, New Mexico, 30 minutes west of Seminole, nine measles cases with no clear connection to the Texas outbreak, rattled doctors and parents. An unvaccinated infant in Austin also tested positive for measles after an overseas vacation.",
      "It\u2019s \u201ca little bit surreal,\u201d said Dr. Rumbidzai Mutikani, a pediatrician at Nor-Lea Hospital District\u2019s Hobbs Medical Clinic. Parents were so concerned \u201cour phones were just ringing,\u201d Mutikani said.",
      "Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock\u2019s public health department, said West Texas' rural landscape is a major challenge, not just in getting to patients and transporting test samples, but also in getting the word out.",
      "A lot of the messaging is word of mouth, she said, but they are working on public-service announcements featuring trusted Gaines County residents, putting up billboards about measles, handing out flyers and posting in WhatsApp groups.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic caused \u201ca lot of distrust in public health\u201d and government requirements, Wells said. On Facebook, people have accused her of making up the measles outbreak. They hope her department loses its funding.",
      "It\u2019s \u201creally hurtful stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really working to help encourage vaccines for our community and help those kids that are infected to make sure they get medical treatment so that we don\u2019t end up with another death.\u201d",
      "The reality on the ground can be nuanced, however.",
      "Brownfield Mayor Eric Horton is pro-Trump, he said, but also pro-MMR vaccine.",
      "His county was hard-hit by COVID-19, Horton said, with nearly 90 deaths. So when measles cases came to his town of 8,600, Horton feared for his community. He said the local hospital has been busy administering vaccines since the outbreak started.",
      "\u201cOut here on the south plains of Texas, we are conservative people, but we also are not anti-vaxxers,\u201d he said.",
      "Across the region, people echoed this sentiment about routine childhood vaccinations in interviews with the AP and The Texas Tribune. Often, though, they are less supportive of COVID-19 and flu shots.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that (Mennonites) don\u2019t vaccinate, and they put other people\u2019s families and children at exposure for it,\u201d said Stephen Spruill, a 36-year-old trucker from Seminole.",
      "But \"this is America. People have the right to choose.\u201d",
      "Macey Lane, 31, of Hobbs, said: \u201cI do support Donald Trump. I don\u2019t support not requiring vaccines.\u201d\u201c",
      "All of Lane\u2019s kids are vaccinated. Praising Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s vote against Kennedy\u2019s nomination, she said the fact that \u201cthe only Republican that went against RFK was a polio survivor says a lot.\u201d But she said she voted off other issues: her religious beliefs, stance on abortion and who would be best for the region\u2019s oil and gas industry.",
      "\u201cAs far as RFK being an anti-vaxxer, this is the most important thing: People have to make a decision for themselves and be as informed as they possibly can,\u201d Horton said.",
      "But in doctors' offices throughout the region, pediatricians see the consequences of that stance.",
      "Mutikani, the Hobbs pediatrician, said she\u2019s seen vaccine hesitancy increase in recent years as parents come to her with worries that line up with what\u2019s trending on social media. \u201cVirulent\u201d misinformation is especially worrisome in rural areas with few news sources or where many people who don\u2019t regularly see doctors live, she said.",
      "And having \u201cthese really big, respected public figures openly going against the grain, going against research and what we know, it makes it really, really difficult,\u201d she said.",
      "Most Texans are still vaccinating their kids, including Jennifer Sanchez, a 26-year-old Odessa resident. She took her 6-year-old and 1-year-old to the local public health department last week to get the measles vaccine.",
      "She is disinfecting her house out of an abundance of caution, wishing she had more information on how to stop the spread.",
      "\u201cThe government needs to give us more tools so we can protect ourselves,\u201d she said.",

One missile and 79 drones were shot down, while 54 more drones were lost without causing damage, the Ukrainian air force said.",
      "Among the targeted areas was Ukraine\u2019s northeastern region of Kharkiv, where three people died after a Russian drone hit a civilian workshop, emergency services said.",

      "Foreign ministers from Muslim nations rejected calls by U.S. President Donald Trump to empty the Gaza Strip of its Palestinian population and backed a plan for an administrative committee of Palestinians to govern the territory to allow reconstruction ...",
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Foreign ministers from Muslim nations on Saturday rejected calls by U.S. President Donald Trump to empty the Gaza Strip of its Palestinian population and backed a plan for an administrative committee of Palestinians to govern the territory to allow reconstruction to go ahead.",
      "The foreign ministers gathered in the Saudi city of Jeddah for a special session of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to address the situation in Gaza, at a time when the 7-week-old ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has been thrown into doubt.",
      "In a statement put out Saturday, the gathering threw its support behind a plan to rebuild Gaza put forward by Egypt and backed by Arab states, including Saudi Arabia and Jordan, aimed at countering Trump\u2019s call. The OIC groups 57 nations with largely Muslim populations.",
      "Without specifically mentioning Trump, the ministers said they rejected \u201cplans aimed at displacing the Palestinian people individually or collectively \u2026 as ethnic cleansing, a grave violation of international law and a crime against humanity.\u201d They also condemned \u201cpolicies of starvation\u201d that they said aim to push Palestinians to leave.",
      "The OIC also reinstated Syria as a member of the grouping.",
      "Syria was removed from the OIC in 2012 over then-President Bashar Assad\u2019s brutal crackdown on opposition protests. After some 14 years of civil war, Assad was ousted in December by Islamist-led insurgents who since have created a transitional government.",
      "The ceasefire that began in mid-January brought a pause in Israel\u2019s campaign of bombardment and ground offensives in Gaza aimed at destroying Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel. The ceasefire\u2019s first phase saw the release of 25 Israeli hostages held by militants in Gaza and the bodies of eight others in exchange for the freeing of nearly 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.",
      "But an intended second phase of the deal \u2014 meant to bring the release of remaining hostages and a lasting truce and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza \u2014 has been thrown into doubt. Israel has balked at entering negotiations over the terms of the second phase. Instead, it has called for Hamas to release half its remaining hostages in return for an extension of the ceasefire and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Since Sunday, Israel has barred all food, fuel, medicine and other supplies from entering Gaza for some 2 million people, demanding Hamas accept the revised deal.",
      "At the same time, Trump has called for Gaza\u2019s population to be resettled elsewhere permanently so that the United States can take over the territory and develop it for others. Palestinians have rejected calls to leave.",
      "The ministers at the OIC gathering supported an Egyptian-backed proposal that an administrative committee replace Hamas in governing Gaza. The committee would work \u201cunder the umbrella\u201d of the Palestinian Authority, based in the West Bank. Israel has rejected the PA having any role in the Gaza Strip, but has not put forward an alternative for post-war rule in the territory.",
      "Under the ceasefire, Israeli forces have pulled back to a zone along Gaza\u2019s edges. Early Saturday, an Israeli strike killed two Palestinians in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. The Israeli military said it struck several men who appeared to have been flying a drone that entered Israel from Gaza.",
      "Israel\u2019s military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants.",
      "The campaign was triggered by Hamas\u2019 October 2023 attack, in which militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and took a total of 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements. Hamas is believed to still have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 34 others."

      "ROME -- Italy\u2019s highest appeals court has ordered the government to compensate a group of migrants who were stranded at sea for days on a coast guard vessel in 2018 due to then-Interior minister Matteo Salvini\u2019s tough anti-migration policies.",
      "Premier Giorgia Meloni on Friday slammed the court decision as \u201cquestionable\u201d and \u201cfrustrating.\u201d",
      "The Cassation court ruling, which overturns a previous one, ordered the Italian government to pay for damages inflicted to the migrants at the time of the standoff. Judges late on Thursday sent the case back to an ordinary court, asking it to define the exact amount of compensation to be granted.",
      "A group of Eritrean migrants appealed to the Cassation court over the ordeal of 190 migrants by Italy\u2019s Diciotti coast guard ship in August 2018. Thirteen migrants with health problems were first disembarked on Lampedusa island off Italy\u2019s southern tip. The ship then headed to Catania in Sicily, but was blocked for about 10 days by Salvini\u2019s orders, before the remaining 177 migrants were allowed off.",
      "Meloni, who leads a conservative coalition including hardline League leader and vice-premier Salvini, said the decision won\u2019t help \u201ccitizens getting closer to institutions.\u201d",
      "\u201cDue to this decision, the government will need to pay compensation \u2014 using money from honest Italian citizens who pay taxes \u2013 to people who tried to enter Italy illegally, violating the Italian law,\u201d she wrote in a social media post.",
      "Salvini, in a separate post, called the ruling \u201cabsurd,\u201d urging the magistrates to use their own money if they really want to compensate their \u201cbeloved migrants.\u201d He has always said that his job was to defend Italy\u2019s borders.",
      "It was the latest chapter of a months-long clash between the Italian magistrates and the Meloni government, which is trying to push forward a radical reform of the judiciary system. Many critics say it puts the judiciary's independence at risk.",
      "Italian courts have also been challenging Meloni\u2019s flagship initiative to transfer migrants to costly reception centers built in Albania for fast-track processing."

      "The cutbacks threaten to halt the small gains aid workers have made combatting Gaza\u2019s humanitarian crisis during the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. They also could endanger the tenuous truce, which the Trump administration helped cement.",
      "USAID was supposed to fund much of the aid to Gaza as the ceasefire progressed, and the Trump administration approved over $383 million on Jan. 31 to that end, according to three USAID officials.",
      "But since then, there have been no confirmed payments to any partners in the Middle East, they said. The officials, who have survived multiple rounds of furloughs, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.",
      "Two senior officials at aid organizations confirmed they have not received any of the promised funds, after spending millions of dollars on supplies and services. They said they could not afford to continue aid operations indefinitely.",

      "That could imperil the ceasefire, under which Hamas is supposed to release hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners and ramping up the entry of humanitarian assistance.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. established very specific, concrete commitments for aid delivery under the ceasefire, and there is no way ... to fulfill those as long as the funding freeze is in place,\u201d said Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International and a former USAID official.",
      "USAID has been one of the biggest targets of a broad campaign by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to slash the size of the federal government.",
      "Before Trump took office, USAID had roughly $446 million to disperse to partner organizations in Gaza in 2025, the USAID officials said.",
      "But after Trump froze global foreign assistance, USAID\u2019s Gaza team had to submit a waiver to ensure the funds for Gaza aid could continue to flow. They received approval Jan. 31 to secure over $383 million in funding, less than two weeks after the U.S.-brokered ceasefire was reached.",
      "Some $40 million was subsequently cut under a measure that no money be provided for aid in the form of direct cash assistance.",
      "USAID then signed contracts with eight partner organizations, including prominent NGOs and U.N. agencies, awarding them money to flood supplies and services into Gaza. Then, the officials said, they began hearing that organizations were not receiving the promised payments \u2014 even as they had already spent millions, expecting USAID reimbursement.",
      "Some of those organizations are now spending less and scaling back programs.",
      "The International Medical Corps, a global nonprofit that provides medical and development assistance, was awarded $12 million to continue operations at two hospitals in Gaza. These include the largest field hospital in Gaza, whose construction was funded by USAID at the request of the Israeli government, according to internal USAID information.",

The former staffer, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the organization\u2019s details, said the current nutrition services were at a minimum level.",
      "Meanwhile, termination letters severing the contracts between USAID and Gaza partners were also sent out to organizations that were major providers of shelter, child protection and logistical support in the Gaza aid operation, a USAID official said.",
      "Some of the termination letters seen by the AP were signed by new USAID deputy chief Peter Marocco \u2014 a returning political appointee from Trump\u2019s first term. They instruct organizations to \u201cimmediately cease\u201d all activities and \u201cavoid additional spending chargeable to the award,\u201d citing a directive from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "In addition to the spending freeze, officials say USAID has been wracked by internal chaos and the introduction of arbitrary regulations since the new administration took office.",
      "During the first 42-day phase of the ceasefire, Israel had to allow at least 600 trucks of aid into Gaza a day, as well as 60,000 temporary homes and 200,000 tents.",
      "Two USAID officials said the agency was originally supposed to buy 400 temporary homes that would make it into Gaza by the end of Phase 1 of the deal, and over 5,200 more during the next phase. That figure has since been slashed to just over 1,000.",
      "USAID was never able to purchase the mobile homes because of newly-imposed policies requiring extra approvals for procurements.",
      "On Feb. 2, some 40% of the Gaza team was locked out of their email accounts and software necessary to track awards, move payments and communicate with the organizations. An email sent immediately following the lockout came from Gavin Kliger, a DOGE staffer.",

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is considering cutting off electricity to raise the pressure on Hamas.",

      "MADRID -- European Union leaders on Friday downplayed skepticism from U.S. President Donald Trump about solidarity among NATO members a day after they backed plans to spend more on defense amid wavering U.S. support.",
      "After European leaders committed Thursday to freeing up hundreds of billions of euros for security, Trump said he was \u201cnot so sure\u201d that the military alliance would come to the United States\u2019 defense if the country were attacked.",

      "M\u0101ris Riekstins, Latvia\u2019s ambassador to NATO, stressed the military alliance remained the most important platform for addressing transatlantic security issues. He emphasized the commitment from his country \u2014 which shares a nearly 300-kilometer (186-mile) border with Russia \u2014 to defense spending.",
      "The Baltic country last month said spending should be increased to 4% of GDP next year and move toward 5%.",
      "Trump\u2019s repeated warnings that he would make European allies face the threat of Russia alone has spurred countries that for decades faltered on defense spending to find ways to bolster their security and back Ukraine in its war against Russia.",
      "On Thursday, EU leaders signed off on a move to loosen budget restrictions so that willing EU countries could increase their military spending.",
      "Following the emergency talks in Brussels, Trump again suggested that the U.S. could abandon its NATO commitments if member countries didn\u2019t meet the alliance\u2019s defense spending targets. He expressed doubt that other allies will come to the defense of the U.S. \u2014 though they have done so after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, the only instance in which the Article 5 mutual defense guarantee was invoked.",
      "The U.S. president has criticized the alliance for years, arguing that European members have not contributed enough toward their own security.",
      "In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said his country would raise defense spending to reach NATO\u2019s target faster than previously committed. But he did not specify when the eurozone\u2019s fourth-largest economy \u2014 and NATO laggard \u2014 would hit the 2% of GDP military spending target.",
      "Spain spent an estimated 1.28% of GDP on defense last year. Italy and Belgium also spent less than the 2% target last year, according to NATO estimates.",
      "NATO members pledged in 2014 to spend at least 2% of GDP on defense, which 23 countries were expected to meet last year amid concerns about the war in Ukraine. Spain, which ranked last among NATO members for the share of GDP it contributed to the military, previously said it would reach that target by 2029.",
      "S\u00e1nchez emphasized Spain\u2019s commitment to European security and to backing Ukraine \u2014 though he stated that the security threats faced by the southern European nation were of a different nature than what European allies on the bloc\u2019s eastern front face from Russia.",
      "Still, he said, \u201cit\u2019s clear that we all have to make an effort and an accelerated effort.\u201d",
      "Though he did not name Trump, the Spanish leader on Thursday argued for a stronger, more unified Europe, saying that \u201cwhile some (leaders) raise walls and tariffs, we build bridges and close trade agreements.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni made comments that appeared to backtrack on previous support for Ukraine joining NATO. She argued that extending the alliance's mutual defense guarantees to Ukraine without granting it membership would ensure \"stable, lasting and effective security.\u201d",
      "Sweden on Friday marked its first anniversary as a member of NATO, with posts on social platform X from Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- Canada and the Philippines, both vocal critics of China\u2019s increasingly aggressive actions in the disputed South China Sea, have concluded talks for a key defense pact that would allow their forces to hold joint combat drills and boost defense engagements, the Department of National Defense in Manila said Friday.",
      "Canada and other Western nations have been reinforcing their military presence in the Indo-Pacific to help promote the rule of law and expand trade and investment in the region.",
      "That dovetails with Philippine efforts under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to broaden defense ties with friendly countries to bolster his country\u2019s defense as it faces an increasingly assertive China in the disputed South China Sea.",
      "The agreement with Canada \u201cwill establish a framework for increased cooperation, fostering closer collaboration between defense and military establishments, improving interoperability between forces and facilitating more effective joint exercises and capacity-building exercises,\u201d the Philippine defense department said.",
      "It is expected to allow larger joint exercises, including in the South China Sea off the western Philippines.",
      "No date was specified for signing the agreement but a Philippine official said that could happen in the next few months at the earliest.",
      "Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro told The Associated Press in an interview on Wednesday that the Philippines would continue to build security alliances with other friendly countries to deter China\u2019s aggression.",
      "Teodoro said China's hostile actions should be regarded as a global threat because they could eventually restrict movement in the South China Sea, a key global trade route crucial for global supply chains.",
      "The Philippines has visiting forces agreements with the United States and Australia that provide a legal framework for temporary visits by foreign troops and large-scale combat exercises.",
      "The Philippines signed a similar accord with Japan in July that's expected to be ratified by Japanese legislators by mid-year. Negotiations with New Zealand also recently concluded, and officials have been holding talks with France for a similar accord.",
      "Philippine authorities may seek visiting forces agreements with other countries including Germany, India and Singapore, Teodoro said.",
      "China claims virtually the entire South China Sea and has deployed coast guard and navy fleets and suspected militia ships to guard what it says is its territory and airspace. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan also lay claims that clash with China\u2019s, and territorial confrontations have flared between Beijing and Manila in the last two years.",
      "In August, Canada joined the United States, Australia and the Philippines in air and naval maneuvers to promote the rule of law and unhindered passage in the South China Sea.",
      "China said it conducted air and sea combat patrols on the same day. Although no confrontations were reported, the Philippine military said three Chinese navy ships tailed the four-nation maneuvers.",
      "Last month Canadian Ambassador to Manila David Hartman said his country has \u201cbeen vocal in confronting the provocative and unlawful actions of the People\u2019s Republic of China in the South China Sea and the West Philippine Sea\u201d and \u201dwill continue to do so.\u201d",
      "Canada signed an agreement on defense cooperation with the Philippines last year. Another agreement signed in Ottawa in 2023 gave the Philippines access to data from Canada\u2019s \u201cDark Vessel Detection System,\u201d which harnesses satellite technology to track illegal vessels even if they switch off their location-transmitting devices.",
      "The Philippine coast guard has used the high-tech Canadian technology to track Chinese coast guard ships and fishing vessels in the South China Sea."

      "Maasai girls are taking up martial arts to protect themselves from sexual abuse and violence stemming from early marriage",
      "KILGORIS, Kenya -- KILGORIS, Kenya (AP) \u2014 \u201cI am worth defending!\u201d a group of girls chant as they each take up a fighting stance.",
      "They are about to practice combat techniques. And no, they are not part of a martial arts club. They are Maasai girls living at a boarding school in Transmara in western Kenya, which doubles up as a rescue center for teens who have escaped early marriage and female genital mutilation.",
      "\u201cWe learn how to protect ourselves, how to protect our bodies,\u201d said Grace Musheni, 14, who has been living and studying at the Enkakenya Centre for Excellence since 2023.",
      "The center was set up in 2009 by Kakenya Ntaiya, a Maasai woman who was subjected to genital cutting herself. It doesn\u2019t just offer a safe haven for girls at risk of early marriage: it also provides a free high school education as an incentive for parents to allow their daughters to stay in school instead of undergoing the cutting ritual that is still common for Maasai girls between the ages of 8 and 17.",
      "Once a girl is circumcised, she is considered an adult and ripe for marriage, meaning an abrupt end to childhood and education for many.",
      "\u201cMost child marriages are caused by poverty in families,\u201d Musheni explains. \u201cBecause of this poverty, you can get that a parent can allow their daughter to be married by an old man \u2014 because the family can be paid.\u201d",
      "While Ntaiya was unable to escape genital mutilation herself, she convinced her father to allow her to continue her education, and she now holds a Ph.D. in education from the University of Pittsburgh and multiple awards for her work.",
      "\u201cI am a beneficiary of proper education and I really wanted to show my community how important it is to empower women and girls,\u201d she says.",
      "Although Kenyan law prohibits genital mutilation and marriage below age 18, both are still practiced, especially in rural areas where education levels remain low. The 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey by the government found that 56.3% of women with no education had undergone genital mutilation, compared to 5.9% of women who had studied past secondary school.",
      "Girls\u2019 education apparently has an impact on gender-based violence too, with 34% of Kenyan women surveyed saying they were victims of physical violence, a figure that drops to 23% for women with education.",
      "But that is still alarmingly high. So on top of providing education, the Enkakenya Centre partners with I\u2019m Worth Defending to teach combative self-defense skills. It\u2019s not so much so that they can physically fight potential abusers \u2014- although they could \u2014 but it teaches them to be assertive in all areas of their lives.",
      "\u201cWe train them with basic principles of assertiveness and boundary setting, which includes verbal and physical techniques,\u201d says Amelia Awuor from I\u2019m Worth Defending. \u201cThese skills instill confidence to speak up against violations or fight off physical threats.\u201d",
      "The training gave 14-year-old Rahab Lepishoi power to speak up for other girls. During a recent visit to her older sister, she learned that the girls in the village were about to be circumcised, including an old childhood friend. \u201cI told her about the dangers of FGM and to come with me to my home to avoid (it),\u201d Lepishoi says.",
      "She is following in the footsteps of her educators, who visit remote communities in Transmara every year to raise awareness about genital mutilation, early marriage and the importance of education. \u201cNow when I go to a place, I apply that skill of assertiveness and confidence. I educate my friends, so that when they meet with a boy, they will be confident and say what they mean,\u201d says Lepishoi.",
      "The self-defense classes also offer some protection against sexual abuse, which can end up trapping many in violent marriages. \u201cWhen a girl reports to her parents that she has been abused, it is common for the parents to force the girl to marry the man that abused her,\u201d said Musheni.",
      "Purity Risanoi, 15, has been at the school for five years. Her mother is a widow and raised her five children alone, but cultural pressures from her community remain. \u201cMy family is still very traditional,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen a girl grows up, she is expected to get married and she cannot choose who to marry.\u201d",
      "Her solution? Keep studying. One day, she wants to be a lawyer.",
      "Musheni meanwhile dreams of a career as a software engineer. She wants to come back here and use technology to uplift her community. \u201cGirls can achieve great things,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to inspire others to chase their dreams.\u201d",

      "All student-led protests in the past months have been peaceful, while incidents were recorded when opponents drove their cars into protest blockades or attacked the protesters.",

      "The clashes, which erupted Thursday, marked a major escalation in the challenge to the new government in Damascus, three months after insurgents took authority after removing Assad from power.",

      "The revenge killings that started Friday by Sunni Muslim gunmen loyal to the government against members of Assad\u2019s minority Alawite sect are a major blow to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the faction that led the overthrow of the former government. Alawites made up a large part of Assad\u2019s support base for decades.",
      "Residents of Alawite villages and towns spoke to The Associated Press about killings during which gunmen shot Alawites, the majority of them men, in the streets or at the gates of their homes. Many homes of Alawites were looted and then set on fire in different areas, two residents of Syria\u2019s coastal region told the AP from their hideouts.",
      "They asked that their names not be made public out of fear of being killed by gunmen, adding that thousands of people have fled to nearby mountains for safety.",
      "Residents of Baniyas, one of the towns worst hit by the violence, said bodies were strewn on the streets or left unburied in homes and on the roofs of buildings, and nobody was able to collect them. One resident said that the gunmen prevented residents for hours from removing the bodies of five of their neighbors killed Friday at close range.",
      "Ali Sheha, a 57-year-old resident of Baniyas who fled with his family and neighbors hours after the violence broke out Friday, said that at least 20 of his neighbors and colleagues in one neighborhood of Baniyas where Alawites lived, were killed, some of them in their shops, or in their homes.",

      "\u201cIt was very very bad. Bodies were on the streets,\u201d as he was fleeing, Sheha said, speaking by phone from nearly 20 kilometers (12 miles) away from the city. He said the gunmen were gathering less than 100 meters from his apartment building, firing randomly at homes and residents and in at least one incident he knows of, asked residents for their IDs to check their religion and their sect before killing them. He said the gunmen also burned some homes and stole cars and robbed homes.",
      "The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said that 428 Alawites have been killed in revenge attacks in addition to 120 pro-Assad fighters and 89 from security forces.

      "The three-year war in Ukraine was also top of the agenda, but no obvious short-term solutions were found to keep the country in the fight, after the U.S. halted military support and intelligence sharing. No new weapons were pledged, no ready cash identified.",
      "Hungary also vetoed a joint statement on support to Ukraine, notably the stance of the 26 other member countries that their war-ravaged partner can only achieve \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d",
      "All 27 leaders agreed that the EU\u2019s executive branch, the European Commission, should loosen budget restrictions so countries that are willing can increase their military spending. The commission monitors whether members are keeping their debt under control.",
      "It estimates that around 650 billion euros ($702 billion) could be freed up that way, and could allow each country to spend at least 3% of their gross domestic product on defense. NATO\u2019s current guideline is that allies should spend at least 2%.",
      "Seven EU countries fall short of that figure, including heavyweights Italy and Spain.",
      "It remains to be seen whether countries that pledged to hit 2% more than a decade ago and still haven\u2019t are now willing, or even able, to dig deeper into their pockets.",
      "The commission also tabled a proposal for an offer of loans worth 150 billion euros ($162 billion) to buy new military equipment, with material priorities to be based on lessons learned from the battlefield in Ukraine. Air and missile defenses are right up there.",
      "The European Commission said it would raise the money on financial markets, and that around 20 member countries would benefit from the more favorable rates that it could generate.",
      "But the leaders did not welcome the idea with open arms. Instead, they invited EU headquarters staff \u201cto examine this proposal as a matter of urgency.\u201d",
      "France believes the pot is too small. Heavily indebted Spain is demanding free grants rather than loans.",
      "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s closest ally in Europe, refused to endorse part of the summit statement in favor of Ukraine.",
      "It\u2019s not the first time that Orb\u00e1n has tried to block proceedings, nor the first time that Hungary\u2019s EU partners have moved forward without it.",
      "\u201cHungary is isolated among the 27, and we respect Hungary\u2019s position,\u201d European Council President Antonio Costa told reporters after the meeting. \u201cBut it\u2019s one out of 27, and 26 are more than one.\u201d",
      "Orb\u00e1n appears to relish his isolationist role and is intent on turning the tables.",
      "\u201cThe European Union has isolated itself from the United States now, isolated itself from China because of the trade war, and isolated itself from Russia because of the sanction policy. So if somebody is isolated here it is the European Union,\u201d he said.",
      "Hungary\u2019s population totals around 9.5 million, a fraction of the EU\u2019s 450 million people.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dined with the leaders. He welcomed their security plans and expressed hope that some new spending could strengthen Ukraine\u2019s defense industry.",
      "Ukraine can make weapons more cheaply than elsewhere in Europe, and closer to the battlefields where they are needed.",
      "\u201cWe are very thankful that we are not alone, and these are not just words. We feel it. It\u2019s very important,\u201d Zelenskyy said, looking more relaxed among Europe\u2019s leaders in Brussels than when he received a verbal lashing from Trump in Washington last week.",
      "But the EU offered no new weapons, a day after Zelenskyy\u2019s hometown was bombed again, even though the leaders might argue that this was not the main goal of their summit.",
      "No discussion was held on whether to unblock the estimated 183 billion euros ($196 billion) in frozen Russian assets held in a Belgian clearing house, a pot of ready cash that could be seized if Europe was willing.",
      "Some countries feel it is wiser to use the interest generated from the assets to help Ukraine, rather than use the funds themselves. Others worry that confiscating the money, with its tricky legal implications, could undermine confidence in the euro."

      "The Associated Press has found that the Trump administration has stalled at least $60 million in funding intended largely for affordable housing developments nationwide",
      "The Trump administration has stalled at least $60 million in funding intended largely for affordable housing developments nationwide, throwing hundreds of projects into a precarious limbo, according to information and documents obtained by The Associated Press",
      "The move is part of a flurry of funding freezes, staffing cuts and contract cancellations by the Trump administration at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, changes that have instilled widespread uncertainty in the affordable housing industry.",
      "The some $60 million is intended to go to small community development nonprofits in small grants. The money is often used as seed funding for affordable housing projects, turning a concept into a viable development and consequently drawing in more public and private investment.",
      "Congress chose three nonprofits to distribute the grants, but HUD said in letters that it was cancelling contracts with two of the organizations which together were to distribute the $60 million. That's pushed millions in funding already promised to small nonprofits, or yet to be awarded, into the twilight zone.",
      "\u201cMany of those organizations have already committed funds to pay workers, such as HVAC technicians, local contractors, homeownership counselors,\u201d said Shaun Donovan, CEO of Enterprise Community Partners, one of the two groups whose contract was cancelled.",
      "\u201cThey will have to stop that work immediately. That will cost local jobs, hobble the creation of affordable homes, and stall opportunity in hundreds of communities.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for HUD said the program, called Section 4, will continue and is not being cut, but that \u201cthe department is consolidating some grants, while others remain.\"",
      "It remains unclear how or when the funding will arrive to the small nonprofits, which has thrown their work into disarray.",
      "\u201cNot knowing for me means we assume that the money is not coming, and that means that I have to pivot,\" said Jonathan Green, executive director of a nonprofit in Mississippi that's building a 36-unit affordable housing development in Biloxi.",
      "Green said about $20,000 in grant dollars are now in limbo, money that was meant to pay for an environmental review that could cost upwards of $10,000, and licenses and permits. That threatens discussions Green is having with potential partners and investors who want to see all the up-front work done first.",
      "\u201cMy fear is that, if the project stops altogether, we may never get it started again,\u201d he said.",
      "The development is supposed to be in East Biloxi, where lots still remain empty after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Before an ounce of dirt has been moved on the project, Green's organization has received enough calls from people eager to become tenants that they\u2019ve started a waiting list.",
      "That's the position hundreds of other small nonprofits have found themselves in, with not just their grant funds in question but investments on the line. For every dollar in grants disbursed by Enterprise Community Partners, the local nonprofits leverage another $95 in other capital, CEO Donovan said.",
      "Congress gave the national nonprofits the job of administering the grants, fielding and assessing hundreds of applications, so that the government doesn\u2019t have to, Donovan said.",
      "In one of the contract termination letters obtained by the AP, HUD said the contracts were cancelled at the direction of the Department of Government Efficiency. It said the group's operations \u201cwere not in compliance\" with Trump's executive order targeting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The letter also allows the organizations to appeal the termination.",
      "The Local Initiatives Support Corporation is the other group whose contract was cancelled.",
      "\u201cWithout access to this seed capital, housing projects for hardworking, families will stall, worsening shortages and pushing distressed neighbors into overcrowded conditions or homelessness,\" it said in a statement.",
      "Habitat for Humanity International is the third nonprofit disbursing the grants, but the organization has not responded to repeated requests for comment or said if their contract was cancelled.",

      "A union representing Transportation Security Administration workers calls the Department of Homeland Security's decision to end the collective bargaining agreement with them an \u201cunprovoked attack.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security said Friday that it is ending the collective bargaining agreement with the tens of thousands of frontline employees at the Transportation Security Administration, marking a major effort to dismantle union protections under the Trump administration. The TSA union called it on \u201cunprovoked attack\u201d and vowed to fight it.",
      "The department, in a statement announcing the termination, criticized the union whose staffers are responsible for keeping weapons off airplanes and protecting air travel. The department said that poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \u201cto safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from a top Democrat in Congress and the union.",
      "\u201cThis action will ensure Americans will have a more effective and modernized workforces across the nation\u2019s transportation networks,\" the agency said in a statement. \u201cTSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.\u201d",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees is the union representing the TSA workers. The federation and the TSA's then-administrator, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement in May of last year. It came amid a push by Homeland Security to improve the pay for the frontline workers, whose pay has historically lagged behind that of other government employees. Pekoske has credited the pay increases, which went into effect in 2023, as helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",
      "The union said in a statement that the order would strip collective bargaining rights from roughly 47,000 transportation security officers, or TSOs. Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",
      "The union said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump's administration were violating the right of staffers to join a union. It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \u201ccompletely fabricated.\u201d",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers. AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\u201cOur union has been out in front challenging this administration\u2019s unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \u201cNow our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\u201d",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers\u2019 collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cvision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\u201d Stahl wrote. \u201cThis determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\u201d",
      "Stahl said the agency \u201cwill establish alternative procedures\u201d to address employee concerns and grievances \u201cin a fair and transparent manner.\u201d",
      "The end of the collective bargaining agreement was immediately slammed by the top Democrat on the Homeland Security committee in Congress, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson of Mississippi, who praised the work of TSA staffers in protecting air travel.",
      "\u201cAttempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cSince the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA\u2019s attrition rates have plummeted.\u201d",
      "Thompson also criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \u201cflat out wrong anti-union talking points.\u201d He said the real aim was \u201cdiminishing\u201d the workforce so \u201cthey can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\u201d",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

      "China has reported that its exports rose a less-than-expected 2.3% in January and February from a year earlier while imports fell more than 8% in a slow start to a year dogged by uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and other policies",
      "HONG KONG -- China\u2019s exports rose a less-than-expected 2.3% in January and February from a year earlier while imports fell more than 8% in a slow start to a year dogged by uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and other policies.",
      "Economists had forecast that exports would rise 5% year-on-year and that imports would edge higher. China\u2019s overall trade surplus grew to $170.52 billion in the first two months of the year.",
      "China\u2019s customs agency typically publishes combined trade data for January and February to avoid any distortion from slowdowns during the week-long Lunar New Year holidays.",
      "\u201cExport growth cooled over the first two months of 2025, with tariff front-running providing less of a boost to demand than we had anticipated,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics.",
      "\u201cThis slowdown comes before any substantial hit from tariffs, which will almost certainly lead to sharp falls in shipments to the U.S. before long,\u201d he said.",
      "Evans-Pritchard said that the slowdown in imports suggests that the pick up in demand driven by government stimulus spending late last year has \u201calready partially reversed.\u201d",
      "This week, U.S. President Donald Trump's second of two 10% hikes in tariffs on imports from China took effect and that is likely to hurt Chinese exports in coming months.",
      "To a certain extent, buyers and Chinese suppliers had rushed to beat those increases in import duties.",
      "Chinese officials have slammed the tariff increases but also expressed confidence that the economy is resilient and that trade with other countries can help compensate for any declines in exports to the U.S. after the tariffs took effect. They have also said they are open to talks on a mutually respectful basis.",
      "Last year, exports helped China attain its target economic growth rate of 5%. The government again has set the target for around 5%, despite uncertainties over the outlook for trade this year.",
      "Exports to the U.S. grew 2.3% in annual terms in January-February, while shipments to the European Union and Japan grew just 0.6% and 0.7% respectively. Exports to Russia fell 10.9%.",
      "The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) remained China's biggest trading partner, with shipments growing 5.7% year-on-year.",
      "\u201cWhile we don't read too much into a few months of data, the breakdown does pose questions about how export trends might look once tariffs start to drag on the U.S., too,\u201d Lynn Song of ING Economics said in a report.",
      "\u201cWith tariffs coming into effect in February and March, it's likely that the impact will be seen gradually in the coming months,\u201d she said."

      "Along with fulminating against the United States, China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi reasserted China\u2019s South China Sea claims, blasted Japan for its past aggression and covered a wide range of other issues during his annual meeting with journalists",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Along with fulminating against the United States, China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi reasserted China\u2019s South China Sea claims, blasted Japan for its past aggression and covered a wide range of other issues during his annual meeting with the press. Here are some of the key topics covered during his Friday press conference.",
      "China has clashed frequently with the Philippines over ownership of and access to islands in the South China Sea, whose rich fishing grounds China claims virtually in its entirety. However, Wang was quick to place blame elsewhere, saying Manila was being manipulated by forces \u201coutside the region,\u201d its standard term for the U.S.",
      "Wang called the entire conflict a \u201cshadow play,\u201d saying an unidentified regional official had used the term at a recent meeting, and said each incident was a \u201cline of script\u201d disseminated by the foreign media with the goal of \u201csmearing China.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina will continue to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in accordance with the law. When managing Second Thomas Shoal and Scarborough Shoal, we will also reflect our humanitarian spirit according to actual needs. But I want to make it clear here that infringement and provocation will inevitably bear its own fruit, and those who are willing to be chess pieces will eventually be discarded.\u201d",
      "Wang also said that Chinese cooperation with its neighbors had eliminated many of the compounds where Chinese nationals, many of them coerced or lured by false promises of legitimate jobs, are forced to contact people in China in a bid to extract money from them through false claims of debts owed or other illegal means.",
      "\u201cAll the cyber fraud parks in northern Myanmar near the border have been cleared. China, Thailand, Myanmar and Laos are working together to crack down on cyber fraud in the Thai-Myanmar border area. Our mission is to cut off the evil hands reaching out to the people and eradicate the cancer of online cyber fraud,\u201d Wang said.",
      "Such operations, usually linked to organized crime, are notoriously quick to resume operations elsewhere. China has been battling the issue for years as the gangs grown increasingly sophisticated in their access to victims' private information. Hundreds of citizens from other countries have also been caught up in such fraudulent schemes targeting victims as far away as the United States.",
      "Wang referred to the upcoming 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, saying \u201cthere are still some people in Japan who have not reflected on their mistakes.\u201d China's education and propaganda systems keep alive memories of Japan's brutal invasion and occupation of much of China before and during the war and anti-Japanese consumer boycotts and other protests pop-up over perceived slights.",
      "Wang also linked the issue to Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that was a Japanese colony until the end of the war and which maintains close ties to Japan to this day. China claims the island as its own territory and has threatened to take control by force if necessary. Wang said \u201cit is better to remember that if Taiwan causes trouble, it is to cause trouble for Japan.\u201d",
      "China also claims uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that are controlled by Japan, and regularly sends ships and planes into areas surrounding them, much as it does with Taiwan. That prompts Japan to scramble jets to defend what it says are islands legitimately absorbed before World War II because no other nation had a legal claim to them. That too has proved a source of tension in the region and a space where China can challenge the authority of the U.S. and its allies.",
      "Wand touted China as \u201cthe center of stability in Asia, an engine of economic development and a support for regional security,\u201d while blasting the U.S. for basing intermediate-range missiles around China and having \u201cdone nothing but stir up trouble and create divisions.\u201d China advocates \u201copen regionalism and share Asia\u2019s development opportunities on the basis of mutual respect, mutual benefit and win-win results.\u201d",
      "Wang said \u201cif every country stresses my country first and is obsessed with a position of strength, the law of the jungle would reign (across) the world again.\u201d While China has been the subject of suspicion and concern from the Indian Ocean to northern Japan, the South Pacific has lately emerged as a major area of competition between China on one side and the U.S., Australia and New Zealand on the other.",
      "China\u2019s secret security agreements and promises of infrastructure have prompted the three to tighten relations in recognition of the islands\u2019 strategic geographic location after years of what some have described as neglect. However, a U.S. cutoff in aid, along with generous Chinese incentives, could further push them into Beijing\u2019s arms. Three of these \u2014 Tuvalu, Palau and the Marshall Islands are also among Taiwan\u2019s handful of formal diplomatic allies.",

      "Every year, bills are introduced in state legislatures across the country seeking to end the changing of clocks twice a year",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Looking forward to more evening sunlight thanks to daylight saving time this weekend?",
      "Many in the golf industry like the time change, too, and they are pushing to make that annual switch permanent.",
      "The move is intended to encourage more evening golf and to stave off efforts to establish permanent standard time, which would leave less time for an evening on the links. And it is those late afternoon players who tend to buy food and drinks in the clubhouse.",
      "\u201cWe would lose 100 tee times a day if daylight saving time goes away,\u201d said Connor Farrell, general manager of Stone Creek Golf Course in Omaha, Nebraska. \u201cSwitching to permanent standard time would cost us $500,000 a year.\"",
      "Golf has deep roots in the history of daylight saving time, which begins for most states at 2 a.m. Sunday when clocks \u201cspring forward\u201d by one hour. Some credit goes to William Willett, a British builder and avid golfer who in 1905 published a pamphlet advocating for moving clocks ahead in April and returning them back to their regular settings in September. The U.S. adopted a version of that during World War I and again in World War II.",
      "Congress passed the Uniform Time Act in 1966 that set up the biannual time change, and lobbying efforts by the golf industry are largely credited for Congress expanding daylight saving time by a month in the mid-1980s.",
      "But for as long as it has been around, the constant clock adjusting has drawn the ire of Americans weary of losing an hour of sleep in the spring only to be faced with the early onset of darkness in the fall. That exhaustion has led to hundreds of bills introduced in nearly every state over the years to halt the practice.",
      "The National Conference of State Legislatures reports that in the last six years, 20 states have passed measures calling for a switch to year-round daylight saving time, many at the cajoling of golf industry lobbyists. But while states could switch to permanent standard time \u2014 as Arizona and Hawaii have done \u2014 Congress would need to change the law to allow permanent daylight saving time.",
      "That hindrance \u2014 along with arguments that permanent standard time would improve sleep quality and foster safer morning commutes \u2014 has seen more states consider opting out of daylight saving time. Lawmakers in more than a dozen states have introduced bills this year to make standard time permanent.",
      "Nebraska is among several states considering competing bills to make either standard time or daylight saving time permanent. That drew Joe Kohout, a lobbyist for the Nebraska Golf Alliance, to testify in favor of year-round daylight saving time.",
      "Late afternoon golf leagues account for up to 40% of the annual revenue of some Nebraska courses, Kohout said, while a majority of golf instructors reported that nearly 50% of their lessons are taught after 4 p.m.",
      "Under permanent standard time, \u201cNebraska\u2019s golf courses will lose revenue, be forced to raise prices, and in some cases could be driven out of business,\u201d he said.",
      "The Utah Golf Association is also fighting a bill to make standard time permanent.",
      "\u201cThe argument that changing clocks twice a year is an inconvenience does not outweigh the year-round benefits of having more usable daylight hours in the evenings,\u201d it posted on social media.",
      "In Indiana, golf course owner Linda Rogers succeeded in lobbying the Legislature to institute daylight saving time in 2006. Now a state senator, Rogers is fighting an effort to return to permanent standard time.",
      "\u201cDaylight savings time allows someone that, you know, worked until 5 o\u2019clock to come out and still play at least nine holes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just golf. There are so many outdoor activities that people want to be outside for and enjoy later in the summertime.\u201d",
      "The National Golf Course Owners Association, which has about 4,000 members, recently polled stakeholders on the matter. The vast majority favored either permanent daylight saving time or the status quo of changing the clocks, said CEO Jay Karen. Only about 6% backed a change to permanent standard time.",
      "\u201cIf standard time was to be made permanent, thousands of courses would be harmed by that,\u201d Karen said.",
      "Even so, Karen's group is not advocating for a change to permanent daylight saving because it could hurt hundreds of courses that cater to early morning golfers, he said. Those include courses in retirement communities, vacation resorts where late tee times interfere with dinner plans and Sun Belt courses where extreme late-day heat sees golfers favoring early tee times.",
      "\u201cWe feel like status quo is no harm, no foul,\u201d Karen said.",
      "Republican Iowa state Rep. John Wills introduced a bill this year to make the change to permanent daylight savings. But he has been under pressure to amend the bill to permanent standard time.",
      "Wills was considering it until he heard arguments on how that change could affect golf.",
      "\u2019\u201cI think I might push back in the future and say, you know, the golf industry needs this,\u201d he said."

      "Democrats are hopeful that their party's road to recovery lies in the price of eggs",
      "NEW YORK -- As their party struggles to navigate the early days of Donald Trump's second presidency, some Democrats are convinced that their road to recovery lies in the price of eggs.",
      "Instead of leaning into Trump's teardown of the federal government or his alliance with billionaire lieutenant Elon Musk, they're steering to what they perceive as the everyday concerns of Americans \u2014 none more important than grocery prices and eggs in particular.",
      "U.S. egg prices hit a record average of $4.95 per dozen in January, surpassing a previous record set in January 2023, according to federal data. In some parts of the country, they\u2019re much higher. A Safeway supermarket in San Francisco was selling a dozen eggs for $10.99 this week.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects egg prices to rise 41% this year. Already, some restaurants are adding temporary surcharges when customers order eggs. Denny\u2019s said its surcharge varies by region and even by restaurant, while Waffle House added a 50-cent surcharge per egg at all its restaurants.",
      "The Democratic establishment\u2019s focus on blaming Trump for those price spikes represents a stark break from its activists, who have launched a protest movement arguing that Trump is a budding dictator with no regard for the Constitution.",
      "Such concerns may be valid, some Democratic members of Congress say, but they don't resonate with working-class Americans trying to feed their families.",
      "\u201cWhen that is your day-to-day worry, the philosophical conversations about a constitutional crisis or the democracy is simply not a luxury you can afford,\u201d Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet, D-Mich. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we shouldn\u2019t worry about those things, because we should and they are important, but they are not primary in the minds of the people in Saginaw, Michigan.\u201d",
      "The message underscores the Democratic ecosystem's broad acknowledgment that the party must make changes to win back the hearts and minds of voters worried about the economy, who shifted toward Trump's GOP last fall and gave Republicans control of the White House and both chambers of Congress.",
      "It\u2019s unclear, however, whether the Democrats\u2019 newfound focus will do much in the short term to stop Trump\u2019s sweeping campaign to consolidate power in Washington or if it can harness the energy of the party\u2019s progressive base, which wants new and creative solutions to address what they view as an existential threat.",
      "Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin, whose organization helped coordinate a nationwide protest movement that put House Republicans on defense, called the Democrats\u2019 focus on eggs \u201ca communications strategy built for a 1990s policy fight.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re looking at polls that say inflation is unpopular, and they think Dems can win people with boring, tired talking points,\u201d Levin said. \u201cBut it\u2019s 2025 \u2014 this isn\u2019t how politics works anymore. And their failure to update their approach to creeping authoritarianism is a simple failure of leadership.\u201d",
      "The Democratic establishment's new approach echoed across Washington this week after Trump delivered a 99-minute speech to a joint session of Congress. Trump defended the tariffs he has threatened to impose on America\u2019s trading partners. A trade war could boost prices further on everything from fruits and vegetables to cellphones, lumber and cars.",
      "In the opening hours of Trump's presidency, the Democratic National Committee issued talking points encouraging allies to talk about \u201cTrump's plans to screw over America\u201d and highlight Trump's alliances with Musk and other tech billionaires.",
      "The DNC's talking points sounded different after Tuesday's speech.",
      "\u201cWe saw Trump ramble on about invading Greenland and planting the American flag on Mars, but what we didn\u2019t hear was a plan to lower costs and address Americans\u2019 anxiety about the looming economic disaster he\u2019s driving us toward,\u201d read the DNC talking points. \"Consumer confidence has fallen sharply, everyday costs are skyrocketing, and congressional Republicans are pushing deeply unpopular tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Democratic officials shared new internal data Thursday that they say indicates inflation and the cost of living are voters\u2019 top priority. Democracy, by contrast, ranked No. 12.",
      "Public polling goes further.",
      "A Washington Post/Ipsos poll found that one month into the new administration, U.S. adults remain almost universally unhappy about the cost of groceries. According to the survey, about 9 in 10 Americans say that food prices are \u201cnot so good\u201d or \u201cpoor,\u201d including about half who say they\u2019re \u201cpoor.\u201d And a CNN/SSRS poll conducted in mid-February found that about 6 in 10 Americans said Trump had \u201cnot gone far enough\u201d in trying to reduce the price of everyday goods.",
      "But the party is hardly united on the new approach.",
      "Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, was ejected from the House chamber during Trump's speech and eventually censured for refusing to stop shouting his concerns about potential Medicaid cuts. Other Democrats silently waved small signs that read \u201cMusk steals,\u201d \u201cSave Medicaid\u201d and \u201cLies.\u201d Still others skipped the speech altogether in protest.",
      "In this week's speech, Trump blamed the surge on his Democratic predecessor.",
      "\u201cJoe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control \u2014 the egg prices out of control. We're working hard to get it back down,\" Trump charged as Democrats in the chamber booed.",
      "The industry and most experts agree that the ongoing bird flu outbreak is the main reason egg prices are setting records, although some question whether egg producers are inflating prices to boost profits.",
      "As further evidence that Trump's team is aware that the situation is becoming a political liability, Musk used his social media platform on Thursday to cast more blame on Biden.",
      "\u201cThere was an insane slaughter of 150 million egg-laying chickens ordered by the Biden administration,\u201d Musk wrote on X, neglecting to mention the millions of egg-laying chickens killed since Trump took office.",
      "Indeed, as of Thursday afternoon, 27,116,857 birds have been killed since Trump returned to the White House to limit the spread of bird flu. That\u2019s because the federal government\u2019s longstanding policy requires farmers to kill their entire flocks anytime a bird gets sick to help limit the spread of the virus.",
      "Overall, more than 166 million birds \u2014 most of them egg-laying chickens \u2014 have been slaughtered since the outbreak began in 2022.",
      "The Trump administration did unveil a plan to combat bird flu to help ease egg prices. But the impact is hard to predict given that the $1 billion plan isn\u2019t a drastic departure from the previous policy.",
      "Specifically, Trump's plan doesn\u2019t change the USDA\u2019s longstanding policy of slaughtering flocks when a sick bird is found. Instead, the plan focuses on helping farmers adopt the most effective biosecurity measures to keep the virus out and explores the prospects for a bird flu vaccine, among other moves.",
      "Rep. Josh Riley, D-N.Y., who recently confronted a bird flu outbreak in his upstate district, said almost every conversation he has with constituents centers on rising prices, especially eggs. He made a direct link between concerns about the economy and democracy.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about our democracy ... that\u2019s more of a reason to be worried about the price of eggs,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThe reason our democracy is in the situation is in, the reason our country is in the situation it\u2019s in, is because for decades, politicians have neglected the needs of everyday working people.\u201d",
      "He continued: \u201cIs it any wonder, after 40 years of shipping jobs overseas just to make Wall Street rich, after three years of egg prices skyrocketing and nobody around this place doing a goddamn thing about it, that people are really, really frustrated and believe that our democracy does not work for them? Can you blame them?\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve is likely to keep its key interest rate unchanged in the coming months as it waits for widespread \u201cuncertainty\u201d stemming from President Donald Trump's policies to resolve, Chair Jerome Powell said in written remarks to be delivered Friday in New York.",
      "Powell said the Trump administration is making policy changes in several areas, including trade, taxes, government spending, immigration and regulation, and added that the \u201cnet effect\u201d of those changes are what will matter for the economy and the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\u201cWhile there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high,\u201d Powell said. \u201cAs we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\u201d",
      "Most economists say that Trump's plans to slap tariffs on a wide array of imports, including 25% duties on goods from Canada and Mexico that he partially delayed Thursday, will push up prices and slow growth. But many also expect that tax cuts and deregulation could boost the economy.",
      "Powell said the economy remains mostly healthy despite \u201celevated uncertainty.\u201d He characterized Friday's jobs report, which showed employers added 151,000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%, as in line with the \u201csolid\u201d gains of the past six months.",
      "He also noted that there were signs consumer spending has slowed compared with the healthy gains in the second half of last year, and said surveys of consumers and businesses \u201cpoint to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.\u201d",
      "The Fed's own beige book, a collection of anecdotes from hundreds of businesses, mentioned uncertainty 47 times in its latest edition released Wednesday, up from just 17 times in January. The Fed publishes the beige book eight times a year.",
      "Powell spoke at a conference organized by the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business.",
      "President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policy and rapid-fire layoffs of government workers has created a spike in uncertainty among businesses and caused a sharp drop in consumer confidence. Many economists have marked down their estimates for the economy's growth to as low as 1% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from 2.3% in last year's final quarter.",
      "Wall Street traders, as a result, have boosted their forecasts for rate cuts, with futures pricing indicating they now expect three rate cuts by the Fed this year, up from just one a month or so ago. Those rate reductions could help bring down borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, and business loans.",
      "Yet as Fed governor Christopher Waller noted Thursday, there are \u201cgood news\u201d cuts and \u201cbad news\u201d cuts. \u201cBad news\u201d cuts occur if the Fed reduces rates out of concern that the economy is slowing, while \u201cgood news\u201d reductions are those that reflect a sense by the Fed that inflation is returning to its target of 2%.",
      "Waller added that he still believes it will be possible for the Fed to engineer \u201cgood news\u201d rate cuts later this year, though he dismissed the potential for a cut at the Fed's next meeting this month.",
      "After cutting its key rate three times last year to about 4.3%, Powell indicated in January that the Fed would pause any further cuts amid signs that inflation has remained stuck above its target. The central bank's preferred inflation gauge shows that prices rose 2.5% in January compared with a year ago. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.6%, the smallest increase since June."

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is granting a one-month exemption on his stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers, amid fears that the trade war could harm U.S. manufacturers.",
      "The announcement comes after Trump spoke with leaders of the \u201cbig 3\u201d automakers, Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis on Wednesday. Trump also said he told the automaker chief executives that they should move production to the U.S from Canada and Mexico, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.",
      "\u201cWe spoke with the big three auto dealers,\u201d Trump said in a statement read by his spokesperson. \u201cWe are going to give a one month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,\u201d referencing the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated in his first term.\"",
      "Trump's press secretary said the president is open to hearing about additional exemptions but Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is not willing to lift Canada\u2019s retaliatory tariffs if Trump leaves any tariffs on Canada, a senior government official told The Associated Press. The official confirmed the stance on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.",
      "\"\u201cBoth countries will continue to be in contact today,\u201d Trudeau\u2019s office said.",

      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick earlier said there might be carveouts coming to the 25% tariffs placed on Canada and Mexico.",
      "But, Trump's tariffs have stirred up bad blood among allies who see his aggression on trade as misguided, with Canada suggesting it will reject any offer to water down the day-old tariffs. The trade war is not necessarily a brief skirmish as the White House maintains that even harsher taxes on imports are coming in April, even as businesses and consumers worry that rising costs will crush economic growth, worsen inflation and result in layoffs.",
      "Still, the administration is grappling with the fallout of tariff that could create serious blowback for his political mandate to lower prices. Trump has acknowledged that his tariffs could cause some financial pain, yet he has repeatedly said the tariffs will lead to more domestic investment and factory work.",
      "In a Wednesday interview with Bloomberg Television, Lutnick said that Trump would update his tariff plans with an afternoon announcement, possibly sparing sectors such as autos from the import taxes.",
      "On April 2, Trump plans to announce what he calls \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs to match the tariffs, taxes and subsidies provided by other countries. That could dramatically increase the tariff rates charged globally while maintaining the risk of a broader tariff.",
      "Lutnick said he would talk on Wednesday morning with Trump about the possible options regarding Canada and Mexico, saying that both countries are working to address the U.S. president's concerns about drug trafficking. Lutnick said to expect Trump to announce his decision Wednesday afternoon.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump put 25% taxes on imports from Mexico and Canada, taxing Canadian energy products such as oil and electricity at a lower 10% rate. The president also doubled the 10% tariff he placed on China to 20%. The administration has said the tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of drugs such as fentanyl, but Trump also suggested that the tariffs are about getting rid of persistent U.S. trade deficits.",
      "The taxes almost immediately triggered retaliatory measures by Canada and China, with Mexico planning to announce its response on Sunday. The U.S. stock market has given up all of the gains since Trump's victory in last year's presidential election and consumers are already exhausted by inflation and worried the costs of the tax hike would lead to higher prices. Those concerns may have prompted Lutnick to signal a possible retreat in a Tuesday afternoon interview with the Fox Business Network.",
      "The U.S. president tried to play down the possible economic harm as \u201ca little disturbance,\u201d as the administration has suggested that the estimates of higher inflation and slower growth in most outside economic forecasts are overblown.",
      "\u201cIt may be a little bit of an adjustment period,\u201d he said after claiming that farmers would benefit from reciprocal tariffs on countries that have tariffs on U.S. exports. \u201cYou have to bear with me again and this will be even better.\u201d",
      "Trump also said in his speech that he spoke on Tuesday with \u201call three, the top people\u201d at the major U.S. automakers and \u201cthey're so excited.\u201d The big three automakers are General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler and Jeep. The domestic auto sector would be especially vulnerable to tariffs as it depends on Mexico and Canada as part of its supply chains.",
      "Trudeau said on Tuesday that his country would plaster tariffs on over $100 billion (U.S. dollars) of American goods over the course of 21 days, stressing that the United States had abandoned a long-standing friendship.",
      "\u201cToday, the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they are talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\u201d Trudeau said on Tuesday.",
      "Mexico indicated it would announce its own countermeasures on Sunday.",
      "Beijing responded with tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports. It also expanded the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen.",
      "\u201cIf war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we\u2019re ready to fight till the end,\u201d China\u2019s embassy to the United States posted on X on Tuesday night.",
      "In response to China, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that the United States is \u201cprepared\u201d for war against the world's second largest economy.",

      "Mortgage rates have been mostly declining in recent weeks, helping encourage prospective home shoppers just as the spring homebuying season gets going",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Mortgage rates have been mostly declining in recent weeks, helping encourage prospective home shoppers just as the spring homebuying season gets going.",
      "But the same factors that have pulled mortgage rates to their lowest level since December \u2014 signs that the U.S. economy is slowing and uncertainty over the potential fallout from the Trump administration's tariffs on imports \u2014 are clouding the outlook for where mortgage rates will go from here.",
      "\u201cWe do not anticipate significant relief from high mortgage rates in the near future because of inflation remaining stubbornly high, which will not be helped by the tariffs that the Trump administration appears committed to rolling out,\u201d said Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. has declined six weeks in a row from 7.04% in mid-January to 6.76% last week, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. A year earlier, it averaged 6.94%.",
      "The average rate is now at its lowest level since Dec. 19, when it was 6.72%. It briefly fell to a 2-year low last September, but remains more than double the 2.65% record low the average rate hit a little over four years ago.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including bond market investors\u2019 expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy decisions.",
      "The recent decline in mortgage rates echoes moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide for pricing home loans.",
      "The yield, which was at 4.79% in mid-January, has been mostly easing since then, reflecting worries about the economy\u2019s growth and the potential impact from the Trump administration's decision to impose tariffs on several of the country's biggest trading partners.",
      "While one could say the bond market jitters have ultimately benefited home shoppers by leading to lower mortgage rates, the trajectory for rates from here is far from certain.",
      "Tariffs can drive inflation higher, which could translate into higher yields on the 10-year Treasury note, pushing up mortgage rates. That\u2019s because bond investors demand higher returns as long as inflation remains elevated.",
      "And then there\u2019s the Fed, which has signaled a more cautious approach as it gauges where inflation is headed and what policies the Trump administration will pursue.",
      "So far, the steady decline in mortgage rates this year hasn\u2019t been enough to drive home sales higher. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in January as rising mortgage rates and prices froze out many would-be homebuyers despite a wider selection of properties on the market.",
      "Pending home sales, a bellwether for future completed sales, point to potentially further sales declines in coming months. They slid to an all-time low in January.",
      "Still, last week, mortgage applications jumped 20.4% from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. And a measure of home loan refinancing applications surged 37%, the MBA said.",
      "While a pickup in mortgage applications is typical for this time of year, the sharp increase is a signal that mortgage rates have fallen enough to spur some buyers off the fence.",
      "The pullback in rates comes at a good time for home shoppers. The inventory of homes on the market has risen sharply from a year ago and prices are rising more slowly nationally and declining in many metropolitan areas, such as Austin, Dallas and Tampa, Florida.",
      "Still, more attractive mortgage rates may not be enough to motivate home shoppers if the economy and labor market worsen.",
      "\u201cInflation is still a problem, but now the economy is starting to show signs of weakness,\u201d said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. \u201cWhat that means to the housing market is that those two factors make buyers more reluctant to jump into the market.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s ever-changing, on-again, off-again tariff war with America\u2019s three biggest trading partners \u2013 Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 is baffling businesses and causing them to delay or cancel the investments that help drive economic growth",
      "WASHINGTON -- Marc Rosenberg, founder and CEO of The Edge Desk in Deerfield, Illinois is getting ready to introduce a fancy ergonomic chair designed to reduce customers\u2019 back pain and boost their productivity. He figures the most expensive one will sell for more than $1,000. But he can\u2019t settle on a price, and he is reluctantly reducing the shipment he\u2019s bringing to the United States from China.",
      "There\u2019s a reason for his caution: President Donald Trump\u2019s ever-changing, on-again, off-again tariff war with America\u2019s three biggest trading partners \u2013 Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "The latest reversal came Thursday. Two days after imposing 25% taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on all imports from Canada and Mexico and threatening to detonate more than $1.3 billion in annual U.S. trade in North America, Trump announced that he was suspending many of the levies on Mexico and some of them on Canada for a month. This was an expansion of his Wednesday announcement when he exempted auto imports from both countries for 30 days, and it also comes after a previous monthlong tariff reprieve for Canada and Mexico right before they were to take effect Feb. 4.",
      "\u201cTrump is jerking around the entire continent of North America right now, it\u2019s stupid and it has to stop,\" Democratic Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia said. \"Today there are businesses that don\u2019t even know if the goods they trade in are subject to Trump\u2019s tariffs. Everything Trump does on trade seems designed to maximize chaos and uncertainty.",
      "Rosenberg and his ergonomic furniture, meanwhile, are contending with a 20% tariff on imports from China \u2013 which Trump on Tuesday raised from 10% -- but he\u2019s not sure where the tariff will actually land.",
      "\u201cThe misdirection is making it very tough to plan for the year,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "Tariffs cause economic pain in part because they\u2019re a tax paid by importers that often gets passed along to consumers, adding to inflationary pressure. They also draw retaliation from trading partners, which can hurt all economies involved.",
      "But import taxes can cause economic damage in another way: by complicating the decisions businesses have to make, including which suppliers to use, where to locate factories, what prices to charge. And that uncertainty can cause them to delay or cancel investments that help drive economic growth.",
      "\u201cIt creates an enormous amount of uncertainty for multinational companies that sell products worldwide, that import from the rest of the world, that run these complex supply chains through multiple countries,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University. \u201cThe uncertainty is going to be very unsettling for businesses and ... it will hurt business investment.''",
      "During Trump\u2019s first-term trade battles, U.S. business investment weakened late in 2019, convincing the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate three times in second half of the year to provide some offsetting economic stimulus.",
      "Trump 2.0 is even more unnerving to business. The first Trump administration imposed tariffs on specific targets \u2014 steel and aluminum and most goods from China \u2014 after lengthy investigations.",
      "This time, Trump has invoked his power to declare a national emergency \u2014 ostensibly over the flow of illegal drugs and immigrants across U.S. borders \u2014 to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China with the stroke of a pen. And he\u2019s expanded his targets. Next month, for example, he intends to impose \u201creciprocal tariffs\u2019\u2019 on countries that charge higher import taxes than America does.",
      "\u201cJust the threat of those tariff increases and potential retaliations are putting a brake on \u2014 on investment, on consumption decisions, on employment, hiring, all the rest of it,\u2019\u2019 European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde said after the ECB cut interest rates Thursday to support Europe\u2019s struggling economy.",
      "His tariffs on Canada and Mexico effectively blow up a 2020 North American trade deal he negotiated himself five years ago. \u201cPast trade agreements simply don\u2019t mean much if the president can unilaterally violate them and impose tariffs with no checks at all,\u201d said Douglas Irwin, an economist at Dartmouth College.",
      "Adding to the uncertainty: It\u2019s unclear what Trump is trying to achieve by plastering tariffs on American trading partners. Sometimes he cites border security. Sometimes he emphasizes the revenue that tariffs can generate for the Treasury \u2014 money that can help finance his proposed tax cuts. Sometimes he points to America\u2019s big trade deficits with most other countries.",
      "Since the goals are cloudy, it\u2019s hard to see what it will take to make Trump\u2019s tariffs go away.",
      "Not only that, but he\u2019s imposed the tariffs erratically, creating even more confusion. For instance, his administration had to reverse itself last month after ending a customs loophole \u2013 the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption -- allowing duty-free entry into the United States of packages from China and Hong Kong worth less than $800. Turned out, the U.S. postal service needed more time to figure out how to collect the duties.",
      "Businesses are baffled. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to multiple companies that are saying, \u2018We\u2019re not moving forward with any investment. We need this to be settled,\u2019\u201d said trade lawyer Gregory Husisian at the law firm Foley & Lardner. At least in Trump\u2019s first term \u201cthey knew what the ground rules were. Now they don\u2019t know if we\u2019re playing Monopoly or tic-tac-toe.\u2019\u2019",
      "Respondents to the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing survey, out Monday, voiced complaints about the tariff uncertainty. \u201cThere is no clear direction from the administration on how they will be implemented, so it\u2019s harder to project how they will affect business,\u201d a transportation equipment company said. A chemicals firm griped: \u201cThe tariff environment regarding products from Mexico and Canada has created uncertainty and volatility among our customers.\u2019\u2019",
      "\u201cRight now, the tariffs are putting everybody off balance because of their unpredictability and uncertainty,\u201d said John Gulliver, president of the New England-Canada Business Council.",
      "Taylor Samuels, the owner of Las Almas Rotas, a bar and restaurant in Dallas, depends on Mexico for much of the alcohol he offers.",
      "The uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, including the potential impact on the price of raw materials like steel and lumber, are forcing him to review his plans to build a new restaurant.",
      "\u201cThat construction budget is now under review and may likely be delayed ... as I recalculate costs that have already been budgeted,\u201d he said.",
      "Similarly, Sandya Dandamudi of GI Stone, a stone supplier in Chicago, said builders are having to rethink their plans.",
      "\u201cDevelopers of commercial projects like high-rises and hotels budget two years in advance, so they don\u2019t account for new tariffs,\u201d she said. \u201cThose budgets will be blown.\u2019\u2019",
      "Dandamudi said that companies will either succeed in passing the tariffs along to their customers or they will be forced to cancel projects.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs will be devastating for small businesses like ours,\u201d she said. \u201cGoing forward, we won\u2019t be able to sign any new contracts unless clients address the tariffs.\u201d",
      "Holly Seidewand, owner of First Fill Spirits, a shop in Saratoga Springs, New York, that sells Canadian whisky and other specialty spirits, said her plans for the future have been put on hold due to the tariffs. Her original plan for 2025 was to almost double her inventory and the selection she offered.",
      "\u201cFor now, we have no plans of adding more shelving or space for new items, we will stick to the footprint we have,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will delay the growth of our business, making us a bit stagnant.\u2019\u2019",

      "China is keeping its economic growth target at \u201caround 5%\u201d for 2025 despite a looming trade war with the United States and other headwinds",
      "BEIJING -- The Chinese government unveiled an annual economic growth target of \u201caround 5%\u201d on Wednesday, despite the possible negative impact of a looming trade war with the United States, and pledged to address what it called \u201csluggish\u201d consumer spending at home.",
      "The target was announced at the opening session of the annual meeting of China's legislature. It's the same as for the last two years but will likely be more difficult to achieve because of the new, higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese products and other economic headwinds. The use of \u201caround\u201d gives the government some room if growth falls short.",
      "The target signals the government's intention to try to stabilize growth in challenging economic times but hold back on more dramatic action that some economists say is needed to supercharge it.",
      "The government also said in a draft budget released Wednesday that defense spending would rise 7.2% this year to 1.78 trillion yuan ($245 billion), second only to the United States.",
      "It released the growth target in a separate report, parts of which were presented to the nearly 3,000 members of the National People's Congress by Premier Li Qiang. It acknowledged both international and domestic challenges.",
      "\u201cAn increasingly complex and severe external environment may exert a greater impact on China in areas such as trade, science, and technology,\u201d the report said, without specifics. \u201cUnilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.\u201d",
      "It added: \u201cDomestically, the foundation for China\u2019s sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough. Effective demand is weak, and consumption, in particular, is sluggish.\u201d",
      "The International Monetary Fund has projected that China's economy will grow 4.6% this year, down from 5% in 2024, according to Chinese government statistics.",
      "The new report placed more emphasis on reviving domestic demand and consumption than last year's, echoing a shift by the ruling Communist Party at meetings in December. It said the government should \u201cmake domestic demand the main engine and anchor of economic growth.\u201d",
      "The report added that \u201cachieving this year's targets will not be easy, and we must make arduous efforts to meet them.\u201d",
      "Across-the-board 20% tariffs imposed this week on Chinese products by U.S. President Donald Trump pose the latest threat to an economy already weighed down by a prolonged real estate slump and sluggish consumer spending and private business investment. The tariffs could crimp sales to one of China\u2019s major export markets, making the need to boost domestic demand more urgent.",
      "The new report offered some details on the party's plans for a \u201cmore proactive fiscal policy,\u201d including a rise in the government budget deficit from 3% to 4% of GDP, or the size of the overall economy. It also reiterated the party\u2019s announcement in December that the central bank would shift its monetary policy from \u201cprudent\u201d to \u201cmoderately loose\u201d for the first time in more than a decade.",
      "The government will issue 1.3 trillion yuan ($180 billion) in ultra-long term bonds, up from 1 trillion yuan last year, the report said. Of that, 300 billion yuan would go toward a program launched last year that offers rebates to consumers who trade in automobiles or appliances for new ones, doubling central government support for the program.",
      "Economists expressed doubts over whether the policies will do enough, noting that the government reduced its inflation target to 2% from 3% last year, and suggesting leaders have accepted that the economy is still mired in deflation, or a cycle of weakening prices.",
      "The degree of support is \u201cmore modest than it may appear,\u201d Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report. \u201cWe remain skeptical that it will be sufficient to prevent growth from slowing this year, especially given the headwinds on the external front and the lack of a more pronounced shift in government spending toward support for consumption.\u201d",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping also wants to wean the economy off its long-running dependence on the highly indebted real estate market.",
      "He is directing economic resources into developing a more innovative, high-tech economy \u2014 and with growing restrictions on U.S. technology exports to China, one that isn't beholden to other countries for the most powerful semiconductors and other electronic components.",
      "Xi told delegates from Jiangsu province, one of China's wealthier coastal provinces known for exports, on Wednesday that \u201ctechnological innovation and industrial innovation are the basic paths to developing new quality productivity.\u201d",
      "He also referred to a meeting in February with the heads of China's top private companies, and said the province should \u201ctreat all types of enterprises equally, and continuously optimize the business environment.\u201d",
      "The push towards developing a high-tech economy has been a long-term economic goal of the Communist Party, though it has enacted measures since September that suggest a shift in emphasis toward shoring up growth in the short term.",
      "The new report highlighted artificial intelligence in a section on fostering \u201cindustries of the future,\u201d saying the government would support the application of large-scale AI models, smart manufacturing equipment, connected vehicles and intelligent robots."

      "Odermatt's second-place finish all but seals another overall title for the 27-year-old Swiss star. The three-time defending champion's 80 race points put him 440 ahead of Henrik Kristoffersen, who does not race downhill or super-G, and 655 clear of Swiss teammate Lo\u00efc Meillard.",
      "Swiss skiers Franjo von Allmen and Alexis Monney were fourth and fifth, respectively.",
      "The 35-year-old Paris also won World Cup downhill races in Kvitfjell in 2016, 2019 and 2022, and Friday\u2019s win took his tally altogether to 19, joint-second on the all-time downhill winners list with Peter M\u00fcller of Switzerland. Only Austrian skier Franz Klammer won more (25).",
      "Friday\u2019s race was initially scheduled to take place in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany on Feb. 2, but that was called off when fog prevented both training runs.",
      "Another downhill race is scheduled for Saturday, with a super-G on Sunday.",

      "Picture this: A sliding athlete wins an Olympic medal in Lake Placid next winter, then is chauffeured down to New York for an award ceremony at Rockefeller Center a few days later with thousands of people there to cheer on both moments",
      "LAKE PLACID, N.Y. -- Picture this: A sliding athlete wins an Olympic medal in Lake Placid next winter, then is chauffeured down to New York for an award ceremony at Rockefeller Center a few days later with thousands of people there to cheer on both moments.",
      "It could happen.",
      "The element of incorporating New York into the Olympics is just one of the unique details inside Lake Placid\u2019s plan if the two-time Olympic host gets asked to be the site of the sliding events for next winter\u2019s Milan-Cortina Games, according to documents reviewed this week by The Associated Press. Lake Placid was picked as the just-in-case backup track last year, and with the Olympics less than a year away a decision could be looming on whether the Adirondack village will be called to serve once again.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing is to give the athletes what they deserve, and that is a true celebration,\u201d said Ashley Walden, the CEO of the Olympic Regional Development Authority, which manages the Olympic venues in Lake Placid. \u201cThey've been working for it for four years. It needs to be bigger than the everyday race. That's the key to all of this. That's where New York City and the fanfare that we can offer, in addition to the race-night competition here, is crucial.\u201d",
      "How and when the decision comes on where the sliding races will be is unclear. Every indication put forth by Italian organizers is that the rebuilding of the historic Eugenio Monti track in Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, Italy, will be done in time. But there is also a push for a definitive answer, especially with homologation \u2014 a fancy way of saying getting the necessary testing of the track done as part of the certifying process \u2014 set to begin in less than three weeks.",
      "Simico, the Italian government agency in charge of building the Cortina track, said Friday that \u201ceverything is going according to plan\u201d and that ice is already being laid down on parts of the track, with pre-homologation slated for March 24-31. But International Bobsled and Skeleton Federation president Ivo Ferriani reminded sliders at Wednesday night\u2019s opening of their sports\u2019 world championships in Lake Placid that they may be back at Mount Van Hoevenberg next year for the Olympics, which caused the Italian contingent in the stands to audibly groan when he said that during his brief opening speech.",
      "Ferriani didn't offer a timetable. And that's the part Lake Placid \u2014 and really, the rest of the sliding world \u2014 is waiting to hear. Lake Placid's plan will take months to execute, and the sooner a decision comes the better, officials there say.",
      "\u201cWe are coming to a crucial point where we have to make a decision,\" Walden said Friday. \"We have a vision for what it should be, and we want to be successful in achieving that. And the longer and the less lead time that we have, the less likely that is.\u201d",
      "Lake Placid's bid plan includes the possibility of charter flights to bring athletes to and from upstate New York from Italy if those Olympians choose to attend the opening or closing ceremony there. It even details how sled transport from Europe will work and how other airports in the area \u2014 such as Montreal, Albany and Plattsburgh, New York, in addition to New York's John F. Kennedy \u2014 could be involved.",
      "The Lake Placid plan calls for Paul Smith's College, a small private school about 28 miles from Mount Van Hoevenberg, to serve as an athlete's village; the school would essentially close for January and February to accommodate that plan, and students there \u2014 many of whom are studying either sports management or hospitality \u2014 could work the games.",
      "\u201cWe want the athletes to have their village feel and Paul Smith's lets us accomplish that,\u201d Walden said. \u201cIt's the perfect size.\u201d",
      "Hotel rooms in the area have been secured for potential visitors and, either way, ORDA will spend about $80 million in the coming months primarily to build more spectator seating and modernize the refrigeration systems at the track. The construction involved in those projects is already underway and will pick up rapidly once the track is closed for the season around the end of this month.",
      "There are parallels within the plans for Lake Placid and Italy that organizers in the Adirondacks point to as well. Part of the marketing plan is touting that there's basically one degree of separation in terms of latitude between Lake Placid and Milan, and how it's essentially five hours between Lake Placid and New York \u2014 almost the same distance between Milan and Cortina.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t wrap my head around an Olympics being here,\u201d U.S. men\u2019s skeleton athlete Dan Barefoot said. \u201cI actually don\u2019t even know how Lake Placid will handle it. It\u2019d be insane.\u201d",
      "New York also cites statistics saying the state is home to about 3.1 million people with Italian heritage, second only to Argentina in terms of non-Italian locales in the world. And while Lake Placid played host to the Olympics in 1932 and 1980, New York City has never been an Olympic site.",
      "The Rockefeller Center plan \u2014 which would include some collaboration with Olympic broadcaster NBC, which has a studio right there \u2014 calls for a medals podium, a mini sliding track, athlete interviews on NBC's \u201cToday\u201d with their medals, viewing parties, athlete meet-and-greets and cultural integration with celebrities, businesspeople and restaurateurs of Italian-American descent.",
      "\u201cYou have this incredible city that loves to celebrate, and these athletes that are displaced from one country now in a place and competing here and have these special elements of celebration,\" ORDA spokeswoman Darcy Norfolk said. \u201cIt\u2019s the piece that I think also showcases New York state, Lake Placid to New York City, and kind of what we can do together.\"",

    "story": [
      "This week in Aspen marks the debut of Shaun White's Snow League",
      "ASPEN, Colo. -- Shaun White's next trick might carry more risk than the flips and twists he pulled off for decades inside all those halfpipes he used to dominate. This time, it's about making magic \u2014 and money \u2014 for the generation of snowboarders who looked up to him for all those years.",
      "This week in Aspen marks the debut of The Snow League \u2014 a $1.6 million, four-stop halfpipe tour dreamed up by White and backed by deep-pocketed sports investors.",
      "If successful, it will bring order to snowboarding's otherwise confusing competition schedule and usher in a new age for a sport that, for generations, held a wary view of riding for medals and money.",
      "\u201cI want to make it so you can have a decent season on the tour and make a great living, that\u2019s the goal,\u201d said White, expressing what seems obvious for almost any pro sport but hasn't always been so clear-cut in the world of halfpipe.",
      "\u201cI'd like to see a pathway,\" he said. \"In traditional sports, it\u2019s like, you start as an amateur, then you play high school, and then go to college and get into the pros. For this, I want the same.\u201d",
      "White kicked off action Friday with an exhibition run through the halfpipe. His last official trip is now more than three years in the rearview mirror, when he capped off his fifth Olympics with an emotional farewell at the 2022 Beijing Games.",
      "With the next Winter Olympics less than a year away \u2014 the first time since 2002 they won't include the sport's biggest star \u2014 it's clear the 38-year-old's three gold medals don't fully speak to the impact he's had on snowboarding, both on and off the mountain.",
      "His appearance on the cover of Rolling Stone in 2006 was the opening salvo on a mission to portray snowboarders as more than stoner kids in baggy pants taking over resorts.",
      "\u201cIt was giving attention to the sport and making it feel more professional,\u201d White said. \u201cLike, every time I showed up on a talk show, I'm in a suit. I'm trying to carry a professionalism that would hopefully resonate within the sport.\u201d",
      "Not everyone went along for that ride.",
      "A moment that stuck with White \u2014 and in a way led to what went down Friday on a sun-splashed halfpipe dug into the same mountain as the Winter X Games he once dominated \u2014 came when he was 16.",
      "\u201cI had an undefeated season \u2014 halfpipe, slopestyle, rail jam, big air, everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI got to the end of the season and an interviewer said \u2018Great season, but how does it feel to not be the world champion?\u2019 I wasn't upset, but it was a clear picture of how disconnected all the events are.\"",
      "Aside from the Olympics turning into the sport's centerpiece, not much else changed in the ensuing 22 years.",
      "Great riders span the globe, but rarely convene at the same time. There are crystal globes awarded for the best snowboarders over a World Cup season, but that circuit has never been considered the most prestigious in an ecosphere filled with the Dew Tour, X Games, Burton U.S. Open and other stops.",
      "White's league is trying to solve one problem, by linking with other circuits to offer qualifying points for the Olympics \u2014 a move that gives riders incentive to participate.",
      "The other is the $1.6 million prize pool for Season One \u2014 \u201ca starting point,\u201d White calls it. The Snow League will pay out $50,000 first prizes for both men and women, along with a $50,000 prize for the champion of the four-event series that, in its inaugural run, will spread over 13 months, ending in March 2026.",
      "More notable might be the $5,000 appearance fees for every athlete, along with a guaranteed $2,500 minimum win for the eight riders who make the final. By comparison, eighth place at a World Cup event in Switzerland last month was worth about $800.",
      "\u201cWe put a lot of time and effort and obviously, we\u2019re all professional athletes,\u201d said Maddie Mastro, the best American rider this side of Chloe Kim and among the favorites in Saturday's final. \u201cIt\u2019s not as casual as some might think. We\u2019re working our butts off to make this our career, make this our life, and it\u2019s nice to have more support and feel valued.\"",
      "The word \u201cprogression\u201d infiltrates snowboarding's world of flips and spins on a daily basis.",
      "The ethos of pushing the envelope might be best encapsulated by Ayumu Hirano, the 26-year-old Japanese superstar whose \u201ctriple cork\u201d \u2014 three head-over-heels flips \u2014 won the Beijing Olympics and redefined what was possible on a halfpipe.",
      "Among White's biggest coups as he put together his league was to get Hirano to sign on. The Snow League will add halfpipe skiing at its next event, in China in December, and if White can close a deal to bring Olympic champion Eileen Gu onto that circuit, he'll have arguably the biggest star in action sports.",
      "\u201cThe fact it\u2019s run by Shaun would generate huge interest in his events,\u201d Hirano said. \u201cAnd because of this, many snowboarders will improve their performances and encourage more young athletes in the future.\u201d",
      "Hirano also gave a nod to a new competition template White is introducing with the goal of rethinking a judged sport that is difficult for non-experts to understand.",
      "In the finals, riders will be placed into brackets for four rounds of one-on-one showdowns. Each round will be best of three, and riders must enter the halfpipe from opposite sides for the first two rounds. (It's harder to recognize on a snowboard, but it's the equivalent of skiing in forward for one run and backward on the next.)",
      "The format lends a new element of strategy to the proceedings \u2014 what do you do if your opponent goes first and lands a killer run? \u2014 and forces riders, who often spend a season perfecting their two or three most comfortable routines, to imagine new ways of heading down the halfpipe.",
      "\u201cI wouldn't view it as a stresser, but it's definitely something different,\u201d Mastro said. \u201cIt probably will be a challenge tomorrow.\u201d",
      "White has spent a career trying to lift both himself and his sport out of their comfort zones.",
      "Though he is no stranger to business \u2014 he's had apparel lines and even another snowboarding/music tour, Air & Style \u2014 this one holds extra weight. White is putting his name behind a concept that could change the sport or, if things don't go well, fade into obscurity and leave snowboarding fractured.",
      "As with every risk he's taken on the halfpipe, White knows there's no going in halfway when making a move that feels like all-or-nothing.",
      "\u201cHaving that clear path for the next generation is great,\u201d he said. \u201cIt'll give people the confidence to lean into this sport, and give them a place to perform, and to me, that's what's so exciting.\u201d",

      "In the fast-changing world of college basketball, some things remain constant",
      "MORAGA, Calif. -- In the fast-changing world of college basketball, some things remain constant.",
      "Saint Mary's, the small school in San Francisco's East Bay region, keeps piling up wins at the rate that only the blue bloods of the sport can match.",
      "The Gaes (27-4) are ranked 21st in the country after winning back-to-back outright regular-season titles in the West Coast Conference and head into the conference tournament with a chance to become the first team to repeat as champions other than Gonzaga since Pepperdine in 1991-92.",
      "The success has come without changing the tenets of the program that coach Randy Bennett has instilled since taking a 2-27 team in 2001 and turning it into a consistent West Coast power.",
      "\u201cTeach what you know and know what you teach. That\u2019s for all of us,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe have a lot of reps building a team. It\u2019s what I\u2019m comfortable with. You have to adapt but I don\u2019t think you have to full scale just switch what you\u2019re doing. We haven\u2019t and we won\u2019t. It\u2019s the more enjoyable way to do it. I assure you of that. We have guys that\u2019ll let us coach them up and we get to coach them.\"",
      "Only three teams in the nation have won at a higher rate that Saint Mary's since the start of 2007-08 with the Gaels' .768 win percentage in that span ranking behind only conference rival Gonzaga (.842) and perennial powerhouses Kansas (.807) and Duke (.799).",
      "They've done it without the resources of the other top programs, playing in a small gym that holds about 3,500 fans and an NIL budget that is smaller than several other teams in the WCC and pales in comparison to the top programs in the nation.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re selling here is the team and winning and something bigger than yourself,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe get those guys and they want to be like the Spurs back in the day. The guys aren\u2019t chasing every cent, every penny. They\u2019re chasing being part of something special.\u201d",
      "The Gaels have done that this year.",
      "Saint Mary's swept Gonzaga, clinching a second straight outright conference title with a win at The Kennel in Spokane, Washington, on Feb. 22, that marked the first time the Bulldogs didn't win at least a share of the regular season title in back-to-back seasons for the first time since the 1992 and '93 conference seasons.",
      "\u201cTo me they\u2019re still Gonzaga,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cPeople come up to me and say, \u2018Does that mean you passed them?\u2019 No. We got them this year so far. Let\u2019s leave it at that.\u201d",
      "Outsiders wondered whether the Gaels would be able to maintain their level of play this season after being hit hard by the transfer portal bug that has severely altered the world of college basketball in recent years.",
      "Last season\u2019s leading scorer Aidan Mahaney transferred to UConn, key starter Joshua Jefferson moved to Iowa State and reserve Chris Howell going to UC San Diego.",
      "Jefferson's departure was expected and Bennett endorsed Howell's decision to go to a team where he could be a starter. But Mahaney's departure was a bit of a surprise since he grew up just minutes from the campus.",
      "\u201cOur guys didn't flinch at all,\" Bennett said. \u201cGo do what you gotta do but we're locking down here. That was one of our deals, \u2018Why can\u2019t we do this again?\u2019 We were pretty motivated.\u201d",
      "While the addition of Arizona transfer Paulius Murauskas and talented freshman Mikey Lewis helped stem those losses, the Gaels thrived the way they usually have for much of the past two decades under Bennett by developing their own players.",
      "Augustas Marciulionis, the son of former NBA star Sarunas Marciulionis, has gone from being mostly a reserve his first two seasons to becoming a back-to-back conference player of the year.",
      "Mitchell Saxen decided to come back for a fifth season and was an all-conference pick after winning his second straight defensive player of the year award.",
      "Luke Barrett has gone from a little-used walk-on to a a solid contributor.",
      "\u201cWe just plugged a spot here, plugged a spot there,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThat\u2019s just kind of what we know. Building, developing. That\u2019s our deal. Why go away from our deal. We didn\u2019t panic.\u201d",
      "They just did what Bennett has done since arriving more than two decades ago. He is the fourth longest tenured coach in men's Division I and has no plans to step away soon, saying he doesn't know what he would do if he left coaching.",
      "He still has more to accomplish despite his 560 wins and an 11th trip to the NCAA Tournament coming later this month.",
      "The Gaels have made it to the second weekend only once in those previous 10 appearances, going to the Sweet 16 in 2010. He told his players before leaving for the WCC Tournament in Las Vegas that they have a chance to do something special this March but he isn't looking ahead.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve checked a lot of boxes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next is conference tournament. That\u2019s next and then we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- Britain's competition watchdog said Wednesday it has dropped its review of Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI, saying it's satisfied that the deal doesn't need a closer investigation under the country's merger rules.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority said that based on \u201cavailable evidence,\" the partnership between the U.S. tech giant and the ChatGPT maker doesn't qualify for a merger investigation.",
      "\u201cIn particular the CMA does not consider there has been a change of control by Microsoft from material influence to de facto control over OpenAI,\u201d the watchdog said in a statement.",
      "Microsoft was a big initial backer of OpenAI, plowing billions of dollars into the San Francisco-based startup in its early days. But since then OpenAI has attracted other big investors including Japan's Softbank and chipmaker Nvidia after its success with ChatGPT.",
      "The CMA has stepped up scrutiny of AI deals amid a wave of investment from Big Tech companies into startups working on generative artificial intelligence. Last year it approved another Microsoft deal involving Inflection AI as well as partnerships with chatbot maker Anthropic by Google and Amazon."

      "A new study finds the number of butterflies has dropped 22% since 2000, a new study finds",
      "WASHINGTON -- America's butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds.",
      "The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday's journal Science.",
      "\u201cButterflies have been declining the last 20 years,\u201d said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. \u201cAnd we don't see any sign that that's going to end.\"",
      "A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.",
      "Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.",
      "David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is \u201ccatastrophic and saddening\u201d when compounded over time.",
      "\u201cIn just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!\u201d Wagner said in an email. \"The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.\u201d",
      "The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn't show up in the data and another 212 species weren't found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cI'm probably most worried about the species that couldn't even be included in the analyses\u201d because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies \u2014 which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina \u2014 \u201cso it could be extinct.\u201d",
      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cYou can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cThat could really improve the situation for a lot of species.\u201d",

      "OAKLAND, Calif. -- A federal judge has denied Elon Musk's request for a court order blocking OpenAI from converting itself to a for-profit company but said she could expedite a trial to consider Musk's claims against the ChatGPT maker and its CEO.",
      "U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled late Tuesday that \u201cMusk has not demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits\u201d in his request for a preliminary injunction. She offered to hold a trial in her California courtroom as soon as this fall, \u201cgiven the public interest at stake and potential for harm if a conversion contrary to law occurred.\u201d",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor, began a legal offensive against the ChatGPT maker and CEO Sam Altman a year ago, suing for breach of contract over what he said was the betrayal of its founding aims as a nonprofit.",
      "He escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants, including Microsoft, and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business. Musk also added his own AI company, xAI, as a plaintiff, claiming that OpenAI was unfairly stifling business competition.",
      "He and a group of investors more recently made an unsolicited $97.4 billion bid to buy a controlling stake in the nonprofit \u2014 a move that undermined Musk\u2019s \u201cclaim of irreparable harm,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "OpenAI said it welcomed the court\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cThis has always been about competition,\u201d a statement from the company said. \u201cElon\u2019s own emails show that he wanted to merge a for-profit OpenAI into Tesla. That would have been great for his personal benefit, but not for our mission or U.S. interests.\u201d",
      "Musk alleges in the lawsuit that the companies are violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity. He had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer has said.",
      "Musk attorney Marc Toberoff said in a statement late Tuesday that he is pleased that the court offered an expedited trial on the core claims.",
      "\"We look forward to a jury confirming that Altman accepted Musk\u2019s charitable contributions knowing full well they had to be used for the public\u2019s benefit rather than his own enrichment,\u201d Toberoff said.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers in a hearing last month called it a \u201cstretch\u201d to claim \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to Musk, and she called the case \u201cbillionaires vs. billionaires.\u201d She questioned why Musk invested tens of millions in OpenAI without a written contract. Toberoff responded that it was because the relationship between Altman and Musk at the time was \u201cbuilt on trust\u201d and the two were very close.",
      "\u201cThat is just a lot of money\u201d to invest \u201con a handshake,\u201d the judge said.",
      "The dispute has roots in a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI\u2019s CEO.",
      "Emails disclosed by OpenAI show Musk had also sought to be CEO and grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO and has remained so except for a period in 2023 when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers, appointed by then-President Barack Obama in 2011, has handled a number of tech industry cases including Apple\u2019s fight with Epic Games, though she said last month that Musk\u2019s case is \u201cnothing like\u201d that one. That case was also the last time she granted a preliminary injunction, eight months before the case went to trial.",

      "Two pioneers in the field of reinforcement learning, Andrew Barto and Richard Sutton, are the winners of this year's A.M. Turing Award, the tech world's equivalent of the Nobel Prize.",
      "Research that Barto, 76, and Sutton, 67, began in the late 1970s paved the way for some of the past decade's AI breakthroughs. At the heart of their work was channeling so-called \u201chedonistic\u201d machines that could continuously adapt their behavior in response to positive signals.",
      "Reinforcement learning is what led a Google computer program to beat the world's best human players of the ancient Chinese board game Go in 2016 and 2017. It's also been a key technique in improving popular AI tools like ChatGPT, optimizing financial trading and helping a robotic hand solve a Rubik's Cube.",
      "But Barto said the field was \"not fashionable\u201d when he and his doctoral student, Sutton, began crafting their theories and algorithms at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.",
      "\u201cWe were kind of in the wilderness,\u201d Barto said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWhich is why it\u2019s so gratifying to receive this award, to see this becoming more recognized as something relevant and interesting. In the early days, it was not.\u201d",
      "Google sponsors the annual $1 million prize, which was announced Wednesday by the Association for Computing Machinery.",
      "Barto, now retired from the University of Massachusetts, and Sutton, a longtime professor at Canada's University of Alberta, aren't the first AI pioneers to win the award named after British mathematician, codebreaker and early AI thinker Alan Turing. But their research has directly sought to answer Turing's 1947 call for a machine that \u201ccan learn from experience\u201d \u2014 which Sutton describes as \u201carguably the essential idea of reinforcement learning.\u201d",
      "In particular, they borrowed from ideas in psychology and neuroscience about the way that pleasure-seeking neurons respond to rewards or punishment. In one landmark paper published in the early 1980s, Barto and Sutton set their new approach on a specific task in a simulated world: balance a pole on a moving cart to keep it from falling. The two computer scientists later co-authored a widely used textbook on reinforcement learning.",
      "\u201cThe tools they developed remain a central pillar of the AI boom and have rendered major advances, attracted legions of young researchers, and driven billions of dollars in investments,\u201d said Google\u2019s chief scientist Jeff Dean in a written statement.",
      "In a joint interview with the AP, Barto and Sutton didn't always agree on how to evaluate the risks of AI agents that are constantly seeking to improve themselves. They also distinguished their work from the branch of generative AI technology that is currently in fashion \u2014 the large language models behind chatbots made by OpenAI, Google and other tech giants that mimic human writing and other media.",
      "\u201cThe big choice is, do you try to learn from people\u2019s data, or do you try to learn from an (AI) agent\u2019s own life and its own experience?\u201d Sutton said.",
      "Sutton has dismissed what he describes as overblown concerns about AI's threat to humanity, while Barto disagreed and said \u201cYou have to be cognizant of potential unexpected consequences.\u201d",
      "Barto, retired for 14 years, describes himself as a Luddite, while Sutton is embracing a future he expects to have beings of greater intelligence than current humans \u2014 an idea sometimes known as posthumanism.",
      "\u201cPeople are machines. They\u2019re amazing, wonderful machines,\u201d but they are also not the \u201cend product\u201d and could work better, Sutton said.",

      "The annual butterfly count doesn\u2019t calculate the individual number of butterflies, but rather the number of acres they cover as they gather on tree branches in the mountain pine and fir forests. Monarchs from east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada overwinter there.",
      "Mexico\u2019s Commission for National Protected Areas (CONANP) said that this year, butterflies covered 4.4 acres (1.79 hectares) compared to only 2.2 acres (0.9 hectares) the year before. Last year\u2019s figure represented a 59% drop from 2023, the second lowest level since record keeping began.",
      "After wintering in Mexico, the iconic butterflies with black and orange wings fly north, breeding multiple generations along the way for thousands of miles. The offspring that reach southern Canada begin the trip back to Mexico at the end of summer.",
      "Gloria Tavera Alonso, the Mexican agency\u2019s director general of conservation, said the improved numbers owed to better climatic factors and humidity. Drought along the butterflies\u2019 migratory route had been listed as a factor in last year\u2019s decline.",
      "The impact of changes in weather year after year mean fluctuations are expected. For that, Jorge Rickards, Mexico director general for the World Wildlife Fund, said \u201cyou can't let down your guard\u201d and must continue to expand conservation efforts.",
      "Tavera Alonso credited ongoing efforts to increase the number of plants the butterflies rely on for sustenance and reproduction along their flyway.",
      "Butterflies have not been faring well north of the border.",
      "The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting western overwinter populations of monarch butterflies \u2014 a separate population from those that winter in central Mexico \u2014 along the California coast, northern Baja California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28 years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The organization announced in February that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in 2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second-lowest since the survey began in 1997.",

      "Experts say that monarchs face risks across North America in large part due to the reduction in milkweed where the monarchs lay their eggs. The plant has been disappearing due to drought, wildfires, herbicides and urbanization.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Early humans were regularly using animal bones to make cutting tools 1.5 million years ago.",
      "A newly discovered cache of 27 carved and sharpened bones from elephants and hippos found in Tanzania's Olduvai Gorge site pushes back the date for ancient bone tool use by around 1 million years. Researchers know that early people made simple tools from stones as early as 3.3 million years ago.",
      "The new discovery, published Wednesday in Nature, reveals that ancient humans \u201chad rather more complex tool kits than previously we thought,\u201d incorporating a variety of materials, said William Harcourt-Smith, a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the research.",
      "The well-preserved bone tools, measuring up to around 16 inches (40 centimeters), were likely made by breaking off the thick ends of leg bones and using a stone to knock off flakes from the remaining bone shaft. This technique was used to create one sharpened edge and one pointed tip, said study co-author Ignacio de la Torre, a researcher at the Spanish National Research Council.",
      "The bone tools were \u201cprobably used as a hand axe\u201d \u2013 a handheld blade that\u2019s not mounted on a stick \u2013 for butchering dead animals, he said.",
      "Such a blade would be handy for removing meat from elephant and hippo carcasses, but not used as a spear or projectile point. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe they were hunting these animals. They were probably scavenging,\u201d he said.",
      "Some of the artifacts show signs of having been struck to remove flakes more than a dozen times, revealing persistent craftsmanship.",
      "The uniform selection of the bones \u2013 large and heavy leg bones from specific animals \u2013 and the consistent pattern of alteration makes it clear that early humans deliberately chose and carved these bones, said M\u00edrian Pacheco, a paleobiologist at the Federal University of Sao Carlos in Brazil, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The bone show minimal signs of erosion, trampling or gnawing by other animals \u2014 ruling out the possibility that natural causes resulted in the tool shapes, she added.",
      "The bone tools date from more than a million years before our species, Homo sapiens, arose around 300,000 years ago.",
      "At the time the tools were made, three different species of human ancestors lived in the same region of East Africa, said Briana Pobiner, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The tools may have been made and used by Homo erectus, Homo habilis or Paranthropus boisei. \u201cIt could have been any of these three, but it\u2019s almost impossible to know which one,\u201d said Pobiner.",

      "A set of criminal cases filed in New York and Washington add new detail to what U.S. officials said Wednesday is a booming hacking-for-hire ecosystem in China, in which private companies and contractors are paid by the Chinese government to target victims of particular interest to Beijing in an arrangement meant to provide Chinese state security forces cover and deniability.",
      "The indictments come as the U.S. government has warned of an increasingly sophisticated cyber threat from China, such as a hack last year of telecom firms called Salt Typhoon that gave Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, including U.S. government officials and prominent public figures.",
      "One indictment charges eight leaders and employees of a private hacking company known as I-Soon with conducting a sweeping array of computer breaches around the world meant to suppress speech, locate dissidents and steal data from victims. Among those charged is Wu Haibo, who founded I-Soon in Shanghai in 2010 and was a member of China's first hacktivist group, Green Army, and who is accused in the indictment of overseeing and directing hacking operations.",
      "Earlier reporting by The Associated Press on leaked documents from I-Soon mainly showed I-Soon was targeting a wide range of governments such as India, Taiwan or Mongolia, but little on the United States.",
      "But the indictment contains new revelations about I-Soon\u2019s activities targeting a wide range of Chinese dissidents, religious organizations and media outlets based in the U.S., including a newspaper identified as publishing news related to China and opposed to the Chinese Communist Party. Other targets included individual critics of China living in the U.S., the Defense Intelligence Agency and a research university.",
      "The targets were in some cases directed by China's Ministry of Public Security \u2014 two law enforcement officers were charged with tasking certain assignments \u2014 but in other instances the hackers acted at their own initiative and tried to sell the stolen information to the government afterward, the indictment says.",
      "The company charged the Chinese government the equivalent of between approximately $10,000 and $75,000 for each email inbox it successfully hacked, officials said.",
      "Phone numbers listed for I-Soon on a Chinese corporate registry rang unanswered, and I-Soon representatives did not immediately respond to an AP email requesting comment Wednesday.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry on Thursday denied the charges, calling the U.S. \u201chypocritical\" and pointing to U.S. cyberattacks on China.",
      "\u201cChina firmly opposes the groundless accusation made by the US and urges the US to immediately stop abusing sanctions,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a press conference in Beijing.",
      "A separate indictment charges two other Chinese hackers, identified as Yin Kecheng and Zhou Shuai, in a for-profit hacking campaign that targeted victims including U.S. technology companies, think tanks, defense contractors and health care systems. Among the targets was the U.S. Treasury Department, which disclosed a breach by Chinese actors late last year in what it called a \u201cmajor cybersecurity incident.\u201d",
      "The Treasury Department announced sanctions Wednesday in connection with the hacking, and the State Department announced multimillion-dollar rewards for information about the defendants.",
      "I-Soon is part of a sprawling industry in China, documented in an AP investigation last year, of private hacking contractors that steal data from other countries to sell to the Chinese authorities.",
      "Over the past two decades, Chinese state security\u2019s demand for overseas intelligence has soared, giving rise to a vast network of these private hackers-for-hire companies that have infiltrated hundreds of systems outside China.",
      "China\u2019s hacking industry rose in the early days of the internet, when Wu and other Chinese hackers declared themselves \u201cred hackers\u201d \u2014 patriots who offered their services to the Chinese Communist Party, in contrast to the anti-establishment ethos popular among many coders.",
      "The indictment \u201cproved the close ties and interaction among China\u2019s first generation patriotic hackers,\u201d said Mei Danowski, a cybersecurity analyst who wrote about I-Soon on her blog, Natto Thoughts. They \u201call turned to entrepreneurs now \u2014 doing businesses with the governments and making profits through other means.\u201d",
      "Since I-Soon documents were leaked online last year, the company has been suffering but is still in operation, according to Chinese corporate records. They've downsized and moved offices.",
      "\"Apparently i-SOON companies have been struggling to survive,\" Danowski wrote on her blog. \u201cTo Chinese state agencies, a company like i-SOON is disposable.\u201d",

      "A private lunar lander has touched down on the moon, delivering a drill and other experiments for NASA",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A private lunar lander carrying a drill, vacuum and other experiments for NASA touched down on the moon Sunday, the latest in a string of companies looking to kickstart business on Earth's celestial neighbor ahead of astronaut missions.",
      "Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost lander descended from lunar orbit on autopilot, aiming for the slopes of an ancient volcanic dome in an impact basin on the moon\u2019s northeastern edge of the near side.",
      "Confirmation of successful touchdown came from the company's Mission Control outside Austin, Texas, following the action some 225,000 miles (360,000 kilometers) away.",
      "\u201cYou all stuck the landing. We\u2019re on the moon,\u201d Firefly\u2019s Will Coogan, chief engineer for the lander, reported.",
      "An upright and stable landing makes Firefly \u2014 a startup founded a decade ago \u2014 the first private outfit to put a spacecraft on the moon without crashing or falling over. Even countries have faltered, with only five claiming success: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan.",
      "A half hour after landing, Blue Ghost started to send back pictures from the surface, the first one a selfie somewhat obscured by the sun's glare. The second shot included the home planet, a blue dot glimmering in the blackness of space.",
      "Two other companies\u2019 landers are hot on Blue Ghost\u2019s heels, with the next one expected to join it on the moon later this week.",
      "Blue Ghost \u2014 named after a rare U.S. species of fireflies \u2014 had its size and shape going for it. The squat four-legged lander stands 6-foot-6 (2 meters) tall and 11 feet (3.5 meters) wide, providing extra stability, according to the company.",
      "Launched in mid-January from Florida, the lander carried 10 experiments to the moon for NASA. The space agency paid $101 million for the delivery, plus $44 million for the science and tech on board. It\u2019s the third mission under NASA\u2019s commercial lunar delivery program, intended to ignite a lunar economy of competing private businesses while scouting around before astronauts show up later this decade.",
      "Firefly\u2019s Ray Allensworth said the lander skipped over hazards including boulders to land safely. Allensworth said the team continued to analyze the data to figure out the lander's exact position, but all indications suggest it landed within the 328-foot (100-meter) target zone in Mare Crisium.",
      "The demos should get two weeks of run time, before lunar daytime ends and the lander shuts down.",
      "It carried a vacuum to suck up moon dirt for analysis and a drill to measure temperature as deep as 10 feet (3 meters) below the surface. Also on board: a device for eliminating abrasive lunar dust \u2014 a scourge for NASA\u2019s long-ago Apollo moonwalkers, who got it caked all over their spacesuits and equipment.",
      "On its way to the moon, Blue Ghost beamed back exquisite pictures of the home planet. The lander continued to stun once in orbit around the moon, with detailed shots of the moon's gray pockmarked surface. At the same time, an on-board receiver tracked and acquired signals from the U.S. GPS and European Galileo constellations, an encouraging step forward in navigation for future explorers.",
      "The landing set the stage for a fresh crush of visitors angling for a piece of lunar business.",
      "Another lander \u2014 a tall and skinny 15-footer (4 meters tall) built and operated by Houston-based Intuitive Machines \u2014 is due to land on the moon Thursday. It\u2019s aiming for the bottom of the moon, just 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the south pole. That\u2019s closer to the pole than the company got last year with its first lander, which broke a leg and tipped over.",
      "Despite the tumble, Intuitive Machines' lander put the U.S. back on the moon for the first time since NASA astronauts closed out the Apollo program in 1972.",
      "A third lander from the Japanese company ispace is still three months from landing. It shared a rocket ride with Blue Ghost from Cape Canaveral on Jan. 15, taking a longer, windier route. Like Intuitive Machines, ispace is also attempting to land on the moon for the second time. Its first lander crashed in 2023.",
      "The moon is littered with wreckage not only from ispace, but dozens of other failed attempts over the decades.",
      "NASA wants to keep up a pace of two private lunar landers a year, realizing some missions will fail, said the space agency's top science officer Nicky Fox.",
      "\u201cIt really does open up a whole new way for us to get more science to space and to the moon,\" Fox said.",
      "Unlike NASA\u2019s successful Apollo moon landings that had billions of dollars behind them and ace astronauts at the helm, private companies operate on a limited budget with robotic craft that must land on their own, said Firefly CEO Jason Kim.",

      "Extinction is still forever",
      "WASHINGTON -- Extinction is still forever, but scientists at the biotech company Colossal Biosciences are trying what they say is the next best thing to restoring ancient beasts \u2014 genetically engineering living animals with qualities to resemble extinct species like the woolly mammoth.",
      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Since then, the company has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \u201cengineer them into living animals,\u201d said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you\u2019re not bringing back the ancient past,\u201d said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \u201cColossal woolly mouse.\u201d",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\u201d said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \u201cmake it a lot more efficient and easier,\u201d said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \u201cpresent already in some living mice,\u201d said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \u201cwe put them all together in a single mouse.\u201d",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \u201ca lot of processes and red tape\u201d before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of \u201cde-extinction.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it\u2019s not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It\u2019s changing an Asian elephant,\u201d said University of Montana's Preston.",
      "Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.",
      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal\u2019s technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",
      "The same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of how we monetize our business,\u201d said Lamm.",

President Donald Trump and SpaceX's Elon Musk said at the end of January that they wanted to accelerate the astronauts' return, blaming the previous administration.",
      "But Williams, in response to a question, did take issue with Musk's recent call to dump the space station in two years, rather than waiting until NASA's projected deorbit in 2031. She noted all the scientific research being performed at the orbiting lab.",
      "\u201cThis place is ticking. It's just really amazing, so I would say we're actually in our prime right now,\u201d said Williams, a three-time space station resident. \u201cI would think that right now is probably not the right time to say quit, call it quits.\u201d",
      "Williams said she can't wait to be reunited with her Labrador retrievers. The hardest part about the unexpected extended stay, she added, was the wait by their families back home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us,\" she said. \u201cWe're here. We have a mission. We're just just doing what we do every day, and every day is interesting because we're up in space and it's a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "Wilmore and Williams expected to be gone just a week or so when they launched last June aboard Boeing\u2019s new Starliner capsule, making its crew debut after years of delay. The Starliner had so many problems getting to the space station that NASA ruled it too dangerous to carry anyone and it flew back empty.",
      "Their homecoming was further delayed by extra completion time needed for the brand new SpaceX capsule that was supposed to deliver their replacements.",
      "Last month, NASA announced the next crew would launch in a used capsule instead, pushing up liftoff to March 12. The two crews will spend about a week together aboard the space station before Wilmore and Williams depart with NASA\u2019s Nick Hague and the Russian Space Agency\u2019s Alexander Gorbunov.",
      "Wilmore and Williams \u2014 retired Navy captains and repeat space fliers \u2014 have insisted over the months that they are healthy and committed to the mission as long as it takes. They took a spacewalk together in January.",
      "They will wear generic SpaceX flight suits for the ride back, not the usual custom-made outfits bearing their names because their trip home in a Dragon capsule was unplanned. That's fine with them, although Wilmore hinted he might use a pen to write his name on his suit.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just Butch and Suni,\" Williams said. \u201cEverybody knows who we are by now.\"",

      "NASA clinches the space race with the Soviets in 1969 with a moon landing by Apollo 11\u2019s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Twelve astronauts explore the surface over six missions, before the program ends with Apollo 17 in 1972. Still the only country to send humans to the moon, the U.S. hopes to return crews to the surface by the end of 2026 or so, a year after a lunar fly-around by astronauts.",

A sample return mission on the moon\u2019s near side in 2020 yields nearly 4 pounds (1.7 kilograms) of lunar rocks and dirt. Another sample return mission from the far side in 2024 delivers rocks and soil from the less explored part of the moon .

      "Some Georgia lawmakers are trying to get rid of automated cameras that enforce school zone speed limits, saying the cameras are more about making money than the safety of children",
      "DECATUR, Ga. -- Outside Beacon Hill Middle School in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur, like along hundreds of roadsides across Georgia, the unblinking eye of a camera tickets drivers who speed through a school zone.",
      "Supporters say cameras slow down drivers and provide constant enforcement that understaffed police departments can't equal. But some state lawmakers want to ban them, saying the cameras are more about generating money for local governments and camera companies, and that some use them deceptively.",
      "More than 20 states and the District of Columbia allow automated traffic cameras to issue speeding tickets, but more than 10 other states have outlawed them. However, it would be unusual for a state to reverse its position. New Jersey had a pilot program testing cameras to enforce red lights, but pulled the plug in 2014.",
      "Georgia's fight will come to a head soon in its General Assembly, with three separate bills advancing out of committees. The state first authorized speed cameras, but only in school zones, in 2018.",
      "More than 100 representatives in Georgia's 180-member House signed on to House Bill 225, which would ban the cameras. Dale Washburn, the Macon Republican sponsoring that measure, provided a stack of emails from outraged people ticketed statewide who said lights weren't flashing, they didn't even know they were in a school zone, or the cameras were otherwise unfair.",
      "While the tickets in Georgia are civil citations and don't go on a driver\u2019s criminal record, the state does block people who don\u2019t pay from renewing their vehicle registration. Almost 125,000 unpaid violations were reported in 2024, the Georgia Department of Revenue said. The cameras generated more than $112 million in revenue in 54 Georgia cities and counties since 2019, WANF-TV found last year. Camera companies typically take a share of the revenue.",
      "\u201cThese camera companies are engaged in deceit and trickery,\u201d Washburn said. \u201cTheir goal is to write tickets, not to enhance children\u2019s safety.\"",
      "One issue with abolishing cameras is that companies have become big political donors. Two big vendors, United Kingdom-based RedSpeed and Tennessee-based Blue Line Solutions, contributed around $500,000 to Georgia campaigns in recent years, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan watchdog that tracks money in politics.",
      "Legislative leaders seem more likely to support two other bills that would keep cameras, but more closely regulate them by providing better warning signs and limiting the hours of usage.",
      "\u201cSo the objective is to alert drivers that they're entering a school zone and get them to slow down and then for them not to be cited unless they are speeding in a school zone during designated hours,\u201d said Republican Sen. Max Burns of Sylvania, who is sponsoring Senate Bill 75.",
      "An alternate House bill that is similar to Burns' would require half the money raised go to school safety.",
      "In Decatur, students surge out of Beacon Hill Middle at dismissal and walk along College Avenue, a two-lane street that's also a state highway. Unlike most places in Georgia, where most students travel home in buses or their parents' cars, a majority of Decatur's 5,300 students either walk or ride bikes home.",
      "Decatur Mayor Patti Garrett said a student at Beacon Hill was struck in a hit-and-run accident and a crossing guard elsewhere was also hit before Decatur activated its cameras last fall.",
      "\u201cWe really want to protect our most vulnerable residents, our students, and particularly when they are on foot or on a bicycle,\" Garrett said.",
      "Police Chief Scott Richards said according to a speed study conducted by the company, speeding has fallen 92%. But there are still plenty of drivers flying through the five zones where Decatur is using cameras. They issued 4,500 valid citations in January alone, he said.",
      "\u201cWe would not be able to get those reductions if it were not for the photo enforcement in school zones,\u201d Richards said.",
      "Decatur officials tout their efforts as a model, saying the city has abundant signage and only operates the cameras for a 30 minutes before and after schools begin in the morning and dismiss in the afternoon. A vehicle must be traveling 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) per hour over the speed limit to be cited.",
      "Still, Washburn and others say the amount of money involved encourages overuse and bad behavior.",
      "\u201cProfit-based law enforcement cannot be trusted,\u201d John Moore of Milledgeville wrote to Washburn in February. \u201cI hope you can convince your colleagues to vote this menace out of our state for good.\u201d"

      "\u201cMy initial shock turned to horror when I learned that the same person targeted about 80, 85 other women, most of whom live in Minnesota, some of whom I know personally, and all of them had connections in some way to the offender,\u201d Kelly said.",
      "Backed by her testimony, Minnesota is considering a new strategy for cracking down on deepfake pornography. A bill that has bipartisan support would target companies that run websites and apps allowing people to upload a photo that then would be transformed into explicit images or videos.",
      "States across the country and Congress are considering strategies for regulating artificial intelligence. Most have banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn whether they were produced with AI or not. The idea behind the Minnesota legislation is to prevent the material from ever being created \u2014 before it spreads online.",
      "Experts on AI law caution the proposal might be unconstitutional on free speech grounds.",
      "The lead author, Democratic Sen. Erin Maye Quade, said additional restrictions are necessary because AI technology has advanced so rapidly. Her bill would require the operators of \u201cnudification\u201d sites and apps to turn them off to people in Minnesota or face civil penalties up to $500,000 \u201cfor each unlawful access, download, or use.\u201d Developers would need to figure out how to exclude Minnesota users.",
      "It\u2019s not just the dissemination that\u2019s harmful to victims, she said. It\u2019s the fact that these images exist at all.",
      "Kelly told reporters last month that anyone can quickly create \u201chyper-realistic nude images or pornographic video\u201d in minutes.",
      "Most law enforcement attention so far has been focused on distribution and possession.",
      "San Francisco in August filed a first-of-its-kind lawsuit against several widely visited \u201cnudification\u201d websites, alleging they broke state laws against fraudulent business practices, nonconsensual pornography and the sexual abuse of children. That case remains pending.",
      "The U.S. Senate last month unanimously approved a bill by Democrat Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, and Republican Ted Cruz, of Texas, to make it a federal crime to publish nonconsensual sexual imagery, including AI-generated deepfakes. Social media platforms would be required to remove them within 48 hours of notice from a victim. Melania Trump on Monday used her first solo appearance since becoming first lady again to urge passage by the Republican-controlled House, where it's pending.",
      "The Kansas House last month approved a bill that expands the definition of illegal sexual exploitation of a child to include possession of images generated with AI if they're \u201cindistinguishable from a real child, morphed from a real child\u2019s image or generated without any actual child involvement.\u201d",
      "A bill introduced in the Florida Legislature creates a new felony for people who use technology such as AI to generate nude images and criminalizes possession of child sexual abuse images generated with it. Broadly similar bills have also been introduced in Illinois, Montana, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Texas, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural.",
      "Maye Quade said she'll be sharing her proposal with legislators in other states because few are aware the technology is so readily accessible.",
      "\u201cIf we can\u2019t get Congress to act, then we can maybe get as many states as possible to take action,\u201d Maye Quade said.",
      "Sandi Johnson, senior legislative policy counsel for the victim\u2019s rights group RAINN \u2014 the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network \u2014 said the Minnesota bill would hold websites accountable.",
      "\u201cOnce the images are created, they can be posted anonymously, or rapidly widely disseminated, and become nearly impossible to remove,\u201d she testified recently.",
      "Megan Hurley also was horrified to learn someone had generated explicit images and video of her using a \u201cnudification\u201d site. She said she feels especially humiliated because she's a massage therapist, a profession that's already sexualized in some minds.",
      "\u201cIt is far too easy for one person to use their phone or computer and create convincing, synthetic, intimate imagery of you, your family, and friends, your children, your grandchildren,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cI do not understand why this technology exists and I find it abhorrent there are companies out there making money in this manner.\u201d",
      "However, two AI law experts \u2014 Wayne Unger of the Quinnipiac University School of Law and Riana Pfefferkorn of Stanford University's Institute of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence \u2014 said the Minnesota bill is too broadly constructed to survive a court challenge.",

    "summary": "As egg prices continue to skyrocket, small businesses grapple with how to avoid passing on the increase to their customers.",
    "story": [
      "Egg prices have doubled since January 2024 due to the avian flu.",
      "For the last 130 years, four generations of Ernest Lepore's family have baked the pastries \u2013 cream puffs, cannoli, sfogliatelle \u2013 that have come to define Manhattan's Little Italy neighborhood, withstanding wars, economic downturns and drastic changes to the neighborhood that his family calls home.",
      "But with the soaring cost of eggs \u2013 a staple ingredient in nearly half their products \u2013 it's becoming increasingly difficult for Ferrara Bakery to avoid raising their prices.",
      "\"We can't keep passing on costs to our guests,\" Ferrara's president, Ernest Lepore, told ABC News. \"As you move closer to Easter, eggs are just growing exponentially in price. I can't do anything about it.\"",
      "Egg prices have skyrocketed over the last year, reaching historic highs, and wholesale shoppers like small businesses were paying over $8 for a dozen eggs last week. According to the latest USDA report, released Friday, the national average wholesale price has dropped slightly to $6.85 per dozen.",
      "However, many grocery stores sell their eggs at a loss to get customers in the door, bringing the average retail price of a dozen eggs to just under $5. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average price of a dozen eggs at the grocery store reached a record high of $4.95 in January 2025. More, the USDA predicted that prices might increase 40 percent this year, and experts are warning that those prices might stay high even if the supply of eggs in the U.S. rebounds.",
      "But small businesses, unlike grocery shoppers, are tied to the market wholesale price, making these surging costs particularly devastating.",
      "Theodore Karounos, owner of Square Diner in New York's downtown neighborhood of Tribeca, said that translates into tens of thousands of dollars in additional yearly costs for him.",
      "\"If things hold up at this price, and we stay as busy as we were last year, I'll pay $70,000 more for eggs than I did last year,\" he told ABC News. \"I can't just absorb that hit for the next nine months.\"",
      "The exorbitant costs are a result of a nationwide shock to supply, brought about by a ravaging outbreak of the avian flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that over 166 million commercial poultry birds have been affected since 2022, when the outbreak began. But the last few months have been especially devastating.",
      "\"In just four months, we've lost 52 million layers and pullets within our nation's egg supply, which is vastly different than any other outbreak that we've seen in the past.\" Karyn Rispoli, managing editor of Expana, a firm that surveys and tracks the price of eggs, told ABC News. \"The biggest difference of late is just that it has been more lethal and really devastated our nation's egg supply.\"",
      "The avian flu has wreaked havoc on poultry flocks across the country. As a result, Rispoli says that the nation's supply of egg-laying hens is at nearly a ten-year low. Once one chicken is infected, farmers are forced to cull the remainder, after which comes the challenge of repopulating their flocks.",
      "But even as the U.S. faces an egg shortage, demand for the commodity remains relatively constant, creating a perfect storm for egg prices to soar. Consequently, those small businesses that rely on eggs, like Ferrara Bakery and Square Diner, are forced to make difficult decisions.",
      "Unlike larger restaurant chains like Denny's and Waffle House, which have adjusted to the surging costs by adding an egg surcharge to their menu item prices, smaller businesses are less inclined to follow suit, according to Dartmouth College economics professor Bruce Sacerdote.",
      "\"In the case of a restaurant, they aren't necessarily able to pass on the full price increase. We're not talking about a simple commodity where the markets clear immediately and you just have to pass on the full price increase,\" he told ABC News. \"Restaurants may be taking a hit to their margins in order to not pass on the full price increase.\"",
      "At Tom's Restaurant on New York City's Upper West Side \u2013 famous as the setting for the fictional Monk's Caf\u00e9 in the TV series \"Seinfeld\" \u2013 the soaring cost of eggs means that co-owner John Ieromonahos is spending an additional $2,000 a week to pay for eggs to continue supplying the restaurant, where approximately 70 percent of their business is breakfast.",
      "\"Of course, we don't want to charge extra to customers,\" Ieromonahos said. \"This is not our customer's fault, but I don't know how long we're going to last without charging extra.\"",
      "At The Hungarian Pastry Shop in Manhattan, owner Philip Binioris told ABC News that he's trying his best not to pass the higher cost of eggs on to consumers, though he, too, isn't sure how long he can absorb the increasingly prohibitive cost.",
      "\"It's frustrating. I would like to not raise our prices. I think that we have fair prices, and I like to be able to keep them stable,\" he said. \"I'm just kind of waiting to see how bad this gets before I make a decision on how I'm going to change prices. It's tight.\"",
      "While consumers, small businesses and their customers continue to shell out more for eggs amid the avian flu outbreak, the nation's largest producer and distributor of eggs has reported soaring profits.",
      "Cal-Maine Foods, according to SEC filings, saw an over three-fold increase in their gross profits in their fiscal year 2023, at the dawn of the bird flu outbreak. And according to their most recent filing, their gross profits are up 342% through the second quarter of their fiscal year 2025 versus the previous fiscal year.",
      "Rispoli also told ABC News that grocery shoppers could see increased prices even when the egg supply does begin to recover, as grocery stores may seek to recoup lost earnings. She said that happened when egg prices soared at the beginning of the current avian flu outbreak.",
      "\"In the aftermath of that, as the market corrected and came down substantially, retailers were then holding shelf prices higher to try and recapture some of the margin that they had previously forfeited,\" she said.",
      "Back at Ferrara in Little Italy, Lepore is searching everywhere to find other ways to save money so he doesn't have to increase their prices. He recently upgraded his building's cooling system and improved his refrigerators, saving money on electricity in the long term. He also is taking a lesson from his grandparents, who kept the business going through the Great Depression, by baking smaller batches of goods in order to more easily keep product fresh and avoid waste.",
      "\"Eggs are determining production,\" he said. \"As we are going into Easter, I am going to be baking at the last minute not to waste an egg, because there can't be any left over.\"",

      "The state's chief medical investigator said Friday that Hackman, an Academy Award-winning actor, died of hypertensive cardiovascular disease, with \"Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributory factor.\"",
      "Officials said that Hackman died around Feb. 18, and Arakawa died around Feb. 11. Hackman, who was known to share three pet dogs with Arakawa, was likely home with his deceased wife for one week before he died, authorities said.",
      "While Hackman's cause of death -- a condition in which high blood pressure damages the blood vessels, leading to heart problems -- is more common, the syndrome that caused Arakawa's death is rare.",

      "How is hantavirus spread?",
      "Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is spread by infected rodents through their urine, feces and saliva, according to the CDC.",
      "In the U.S., the most common hantavirus that causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is spread by the deer mouse.",
      "People can become infected if they breathe in hantavirus-contaminated air when cleaning up after rodents; touch contaminated objects and then touch their face; are bitten or scratched by an infected rodent; or eat food that has been contaminated with hantavirus, according to the CDC.",
      "Dogs and cats are not known to be infected by hantavirus, according to the CDC, but they can spread it to humans if they bring infected rodents to people or inside homes.",

    "story": [
      "The Human Rights Campaign accused Newsom of trying to \"score political points.\"",
      "In this first episode of a new podcast published Thursday, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, an LGBTQ ally, broke with his party, saying that transgender athletes playing in female sports is \"deeply unfair.\"",
      "\"I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness. It's deeply unfair,\" Newsom said on his podcast, \"This is Gavin Newsom.\"",
      "Newsom's comments came during a conversation with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who leads conservative group Turning Point USA and played a critical role in garnering youth support for President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.",
      "Newsom, sometimes viewed as a 2028 presidential hopeful, also agreed that the political ad that hurt former Vice President Kamala Harris the most in her presidential campaign was her previous support for providing taxpayer-funded gender transition-related medical care for detained immigrants and federal prisoners. Trump's campaign had played back her remarks in a widely-circulated ad.",
      "\"She didn't even react to it, which was even more devastating,\" Newsom said.",
      "Newsom also pointed to his own work in expanding LGBTQ rights, while referencing current law in the state of California that allows transgender athletes to participate in school sports that reflect the gender they identify with.",
      "Newsom himself was a trailblazer in expanding LGBTQ rights: in 2004, as mayor of San Francisco, he allowed same-sex marriages to proceed even though they were not yet allowed nationwide.",
      "He referenced that moment while discussing his alignment with Kirk's views on transgender athletes in women's sports.",
      "\"I've been a leader in the LGBTQ places, as, you know, back in 2004 [I] was marrying same sex couples. And I know we have [a] difference [of] opinion on marriage equality, and so I've been at this for years and years, I take a backseat to no one,\" Newsom said, before discussing how he heard people talking about transgender athletes.",
      "On the podcast, Newsom also called for compassion toward transgender individuals, even while discussing the sports issue: \"There's also humility and grace. You know, that, these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well.\"",
      "LGBTQ rights groups criticized Newsom's remarks, saying that they came amid national backlash to transgender individuals and their rights.",
      "The Human Rights Campaign, a major national LGBTQ rights advocacy and lobbying group, said in a statement shared on social media that with discussions nationwide in legislatures about restricting same-sex marriage or transgender rights, \"this is not a moment to sit politely in the face of authoritarian bullies or throw people under the bus for political posturing.\"",
      "\"Singling out trans kids to score political points is never going to help someone pay their rent, keep Medicaid or get a job, but it will make it seem like Gov. Newsom believes our civil rights are up for grabs,\" the organization wrote. \"Californians - and ALL Americans - need leaders who have courage in their convictions, and who will show up for them, in the faces of people who want to see us all back in the closet.\"",
      "The organization also pointed to a 2013 law in California that allowed students to be part of sport teams matching their own gender identity. The American Civil Liberties Union praised the law in 2013 as \"ensuring transgender youth have the opportunity to fully participate and succeed in schools across the state.\"",
      "Newsom briefly referenced the law in his discussion with Kirk, highlighting that it was passed before he became governor.",
      "Two members of the California state legislature, Assemblymember Chris Ward and state Sen. Caroline Menjivar, released a statement through the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus criticizing Newsom's remarks as well, saying they were \"profoundly sickened and frustrated\" by what he said.",
      "\"Sometimes Gavin Newsom goes for the Profile in Courage, sometimes not,\" they wrote. \"We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks. All students deserve the academic and health benefits of sports activity, and until Donald Trump began obsessing about it, playing on a team consistent with one's gender has not been a problem since the standard was passed in 2013.\"",
      "Newsom's remarks came just a month after Trump signed an executive order intending on banning transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. The White House has said the action is meant to protect women in sports from harm and from facing opponents who they say have an unfair advantage.",
      "LGBTQ advocacy groups have criticized the administration's action and general rhetoric as discriminatory and as having razor-sharp focus on issues of transgender rights to the exclusion of economic and other issues.",

    "story": [
      "Plaintiffs want to know how DOGE staffers entrenched themselves within agencies.",
      "As the Department of Government Efficiency rapidly moves to reshape the federal government, several groups challenging DOGE in court are attempting to determine how Elon Musk's budget-slashers were able to rapidly entrench themselves in at least 15 agencies.",
      "Over the coming week, federal judges have ordered key Trump administration officials to testify about mass firings and the dismantling of key agencies, while DOGE representatives will likely have to turn over evidence in dozens of cases and participate in a sworn deposition for at least one case.",
      "The legal challenges materializing against DOGE could present an existential challenge for the group, whose effectiveness has in part stemmed from its ability to move quickly and make massive changes without the normal oversight.",
      "While Musk and Trump have touted DOGE's transparency -- including on DOGE's website, where it lists recently canceled contracts -- the plaintiffs challenging the group have argued that the group has relied on secrecy to hide tactics that violate federal law.",
      "\"[T]he entity has worked in the shadows -- a cadre of largely unidentified actors, whose status as government employees is unclear, controlling major government functions with no oversight,\" one lawsuit alleged.",
      "That secrecy has also made it harder for nonprofits or federal unions to successfully block DOGE in court, with many plaintiffs relying on media reporting -- rather than documentary evidence -- to prove the harms DOGE has allegedly caused.",
      "\"The court can't act based on the media reports. We can't do that,\" one federal judge said in a case about the constitutionality of Musk's power. \"The things that I'm hearing are concerning indeed and troubling indeed, but I have to have a record, and I have to make a finding the facts before I issue something.\"",
      "But that might begin to change as the cases against DOGE progress and plaintiffs are entitled to receive discovery -- i.e., the exchange of evidence -- relevant to key allegations. At least one federal judge has ordered a DOGE representative to sit for a sworn deposition about the group's access to the federal government's sensitive data.",
      "A federal judge in Washington, D.C, was scheduled Friday afternoon to consider what kind of regulations will govern the transparency behind DOGE after the group argued it shouldn't be subject to the Freedom of Information Act, and next week might provide some of the first sworn testimony about Trump's effort to rapidly reduce the size of government since retaking office.",
      "On Monday, a federal judge in Washington is holding a hearing at which the acting chief operating officer of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau has been ordered to testify about the ongoing dismantling of the agency, and a separate judge in California on Thursday is requiring the acting director of the Office of Personnel Management to testify under oath about how the Trump administration allegedly ordered the mass firing of probationary employees.",
      "\"We will prove in this case that remarkably, and I do not say this lightly, your honor, Acting Director [Charles] Ezell is not telling the truth to this court,\" a lawyer challenging the mass firings alleged, prompting the judge overseeing the case to order Ezell to testify in person.",
      "\"We're going to have Ezell come out here and he's going to be under oath right up there and these lawyers are going to quiz him,\" U.S. District Judge William Alsup said.",
      "During a court hearing on Thursday about Ezell's testimony, lawyers with the Department of Justice said the administration is considering making Ezell unavailable for testimony despite the court's order, citing logistical concerns and their potential appeal of the decision. Lawyers for the plaintiffs called the move a clear defiance of a court order and a delay tactic.",
      "\"No final decision had been made,\" a DOJ lawyer told Judge Alsup, suggesting the final decision would be made in Washington.",
      "The Trump administration has already begun its appeal in more than a dozen cases challenging Trump's executive actions, and two adverse rulings have already reached the Supreme Court.",

      "\"This award no longer effectuates agency priorities,\" all of the letters read. \"Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans. Many such studies ignore, rather than seriously examine, biological realities. It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize these research programs.\"",
      "\"The premise\u2026is incompatible with agency priorities, and no modification of the project could align the project with agency priorities,\" the letters continue.",
      "The letters state that typically NIH allows grant recipients to \"take appropriate corrective action\" before a termination decision is allowed. However, the letters declare \"No corrective action is possible here.\"",
      "It comes as President Donald Trump has made sweeping changes to the federal government in his first few weeks in office, including issuing new guidance that only recognizes two sexes, vowing to \"defend women from gender ideology extremism\" and issuing several executive orders aiming to dismantle DEI initiatives.",
      "Neither the NIH nor the White House immediately replied to ABC News' request for comment.",
      "Additionally, NIH institutes and centers are being asked to review awards for new and ongoing projects to ensure they do not \"contain any DEI research activities or DEI language that give the perception that NIH funds can be used to support these activities.\"",
      "According to a guidance document, obtained by ABC News, NIH employees are being asked to place these projects in one of four categories. Category one is if the project's purpose is solely related to DEI, in which case the award cannot be issued.",
      "Category two involves projects \"partially\" supporting DEI activities. The award can only be granted if the \"non-compliant\" activities are negotiated out of the project.",
      "Category three involves projects that do not support DEI activities but may contain DEI-related language, which must be removed before an award can be issued, and category four involves projects that do not support any DEI activities.",
      "It's unclear what it exactly means for a project to support DEI activities or contain DEI language, but the guidance document includes examples such as the purpose of a meeting being diversity or \"a statement regarding institutional commitment to diversity.\"",
      "On Wednesday, a federal judge issued a nationwide order blocking the NIH from making cuts to research funding that researchers warned could catastrophically harm medical and scientific research and potentially affect treatments in the U.S.",
      "\"As made clear by the declarations in support of a preliminary injunction against the implementation of the Rate Change Notice, the risk of harm to research institutions and beyond is immediate, devastating, and irreparable,\" U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley wrote about the attempt to cap indirect costs at 15%, adding the attempt to cut funding violated federal law.",
      "It remains to be seen if the injunction will have an effect on the projects from universities that received termination letters.",

    "story": [
      "Jerome Powell issued remarks as Trump threatened new tariffs on Canada.",
      "As President Donald Trump on Friday threatened new tariffs on Canadian products, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the  administration's tariff plan would likely raise prices for U.S. shoppers and retailers.",
      "The scale and duration of the tariffs remain unclear but a portion of the taxes on imports will probably reach consumers, Powell told an economic forum in New York City on Friday.",
      "\"We're at a stage where we're still very uncertain about what will be tariffed, for how long, at what level,\" Powell said. \"But the likelihood is some of that will find its way. It will hit the exporters, the importers, the retailers and to some extent consumers.\"",
      "The Trump administration slapped 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% tariffs on imports from China. The fresh round of duties on Chinese goods doubled an initial set of tariffs placed on China last month.",
      "Tariffs of this magnitude are widely expected to increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers.",
      "\"Everybody is forecasting some inflation effect from tariffs,\" Powell said on Friday.",
      "The remarks from Powell at the annual U.S. Monetary Policy Forum marked a notable prediction from the nation's top central banker charged with keeping inflation under control.",
      "While acknowledging the likelihood of price hikes, however, Powell said the Fed's response would depend on what exactly transpires.",
      "A potentially temporary bump in prices may not warrant intervention, while a more sustained increase could require action, Powell said, noting that the strength of the economy affords the Fed time to assess the impact.",
      "\"In some cases, where we think it's a one-time thing, the textbook would be to look through it,\" Powell said. \"If it turns into a series of things and it's more than that -- [and] if the increases are larger -- that would matter.\"",
      "Powell spoke hours after Trump on Truth Social threatened to slap tariffs, sanctions and other measures on Russia in response to conduct in the war with Ukraine.",
      "The tariffs may become necessary \"based on the fact that Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now,\" Trump said.",
      "Later on Friday, Trump told reporters at the White House that he may also impose new tariffs on Canada, including a tariff on lumber and a 250% duty on dairy products.",
      "Trump indicated the U.S. could take reciprocal action against Canada's roughly 250% tariff on dairy as soon as Friday.",
      "\"Canada has been ripping us off for years on tariffs for lumber and for dairy products, 250% nobody ever talks about that 250% tariff, which is taking advantage of our farmers. So that's not going to happen anymore,\" Trump said.",
      "The potential moves could expand Trump's confrontational trade policy beyond a set of tariffs put forward this week.",
      "The tariff policy could cause \"some disturbance\" for the U.S., Trump noted in his remarks at the White House.",
      "The Trump administration has eased some of the tariffs against Canada and Mexico in recent days.",
      "Trump issued a one-month delay for tariffs on auto-related goods from Mexico and Canada. The carve-out expanded soon afterward with an additional one-month pause for goods from Mexico and Canada compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, a free trade agreement.",
      "In addition to tariffs, Powell mentioned other economic proposals pursued by the Trump administration, including measures affecting fiscal policy and regulation.",
      "\"The new administration is in the process of implementing significant policy changes,\" Powell said. \"Uncertainty around these changes and their likely effects remains high. We are focused on parsing the signal from the noise as the situation evolves. We are not in a hurry.\"",

      "Congress has one week to pass a spending bill that would avert a government shutdown, but lawmakers from both parties are not on the same page about how they'll move forward.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he aims to hold a vote on Tuesday in the House on a clean short-term bill that would fund the government at current levels through the end of September 2025, but the details of the proposal remain unclear.",
      "Leaders said they are hoping to release the legislative text as soon as Friday, but that will likely slide into the weekend.",
      "\"I believe we'll pass it along party lines,\" Johnson told reporters on Thursday. \"But I think every Democrat should vote for this [continuing resolution]. It is a fundamental responsibility we have to fund the government, and a clean CR with a few minor anomalies is not something they should vote against, so we'll see what they do.\"",
      "President Donald Trump has lobbied House Republicans to support the measure, including hard-liners who typically vote against continuing resolutions.",
      "\"Conservatives will love this Bill, because it sets us up to cut Taxes and Spending in Reconciliation, all while effectively FREEZING Spending this year,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday.",
      "Johnson can only afford to lose one defection if all members are voting and present, meaning he'll almost certainly need the help of Democrats to pass the measure.",
      "Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, have said they will vote no on a continuing resolution -- presenting a challenge for Johnson, who is navigating a tight House majority.",
      "Top House Democratic leaders explicitly said Friday in a letter to colleagues that they will oppose Johnson's funding bill, arguing it could lead to cuts down the road to programs such as Medicaid.",
      "\"Republicans have decided to introduce a partisan continuing resolution that threatens to cut funding for healthcare, nutritional assistance and veterans benefits through the end of the current fiscal year. That is not acceptable,\" they wrote.",
      "\"We cannot back a measure that rips away life-sustaining healthcare and retirement benefits from everyday Americans as part of the Republican scheme to pay for massive tax cuts for their wealthy donors like Elon Musk,\" they added. \"Medicaid is our redline.\"",
      "Any funding bill will also need to clear the Senate, where Democratic support will be critical. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has already vowed to vote against the legislation, which means at least eight Democrats will be needed for any funding proposal to pass.",
      "Democrats have so far kept their cards close as to what they'll do if presented with such a bill. Many Senate Democrats say a six-month continuing resolution, like the one Johnson is proposing, would be a \"disaster,\" but they've also expressed little interest in shutting down the government.",
      "Some Democrats prefer a plan that would see the passage of a shorter stopgap measure to allow completion of work on full-year appropriations bills.",
      "But if Johnson passes his plan and the House flees Washington, there may be few alternative options remaining that don't trigger at least a brief government shutdown.",
      "Government funding is one of the few areas in which Democrats, who have been pushing for ways to challenge Elon Musk's cuts via the Department of Government Efficiency, can assert their leverage. Whether or not they'll ultimately use this bill to make that stand, and risk shutting the government down, remains to be seen."

    "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-crypto-czar-public-lost-17-billion/story?id=119568771",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 16:57:13 -0500",
    "summary": "Crypto czar David Sacks argued taxpayers have lost out on billions because earlier administrations never took advantage of bitcoin in the government's possession.",
    "story": [
      "Trump is holding a digital assets summit on cryptocurrency on Friday.",
      "David Sacks, the White House crypto czar, said Friday that taxpayers have lost out on \"over $17 billion of value\" because earlier administrations never took advantage of bitcoin already in the U.S. government's possession.",
      "\"Over the past decade or so, the federal government has come into the possession of roughly 400,000 bitcoin through civil or criminal asset forfeitures,\" Sacks said in an interview with ABC News\u2019 Senior White House Correspondent Selina Wang on Friday. \"We've had this very ad hoc strategy where we just would sell the bitcoin, sort of almost willy-nilly, and we sold about half of it. We only made about $400 million. Today, that bitcoin would have been worth over $17 billion, so the American taxpayer lost out on over $17 billion of value.\"",
      "Sacks' comments follow President Donald Trump signing an executive order on Thursday that creates a strategic bitcoin reserve and U.S. digital assets stockpile. Senior White House officials said bitcoin is being treated differently from other cryptocurrencies because it is the \"original\" cryptocurrency and there is a finite amount.",
      "Sacks brushed off repeated questions about whether this could pose a conflict of interest since President Donald Trump has a personal financial stake in the success of the industry after launching his own cryptocurrency company, World Liberty Financial, days before the inauguration.",
      "\"It's not an issue,\" Sacks told Wang.",
      "When asked about Bloomberg News' reporting that World Liberty Financial appears to have bought more than $20 million in cryptocurrency two days before the White House's Digital Assets Summit on Friday, Sacks said: \"You should talk to them about that. That's a private company. I'm not a regulator. I'm a policy adviser for innovation. I don't keep tabs on what individual companies are doing.\"",
      "Sacks stressed that the government is not buying any cryptocurrency, just using the cryptocurrency that has already been accumulated through criminal or civil asset forfeitures.",
      "\"Any further accumulation of bitcoin by the government has to be done in a completely budget-neutral way. It cannot add to the deficit, it cannot add to the debt, it cannot tax the American people,\" Sacks said. \"So this is about maximizing the value of assets that we already have on our balance sheet.\"",
      "When asked by ABC News how the government could \"accumulate\" more bitcoin in a budget-neutral way, Sacks said those programs don't exist, noting the administration is still in the planning phase and that the executive order calls on the secretaries of the Department of Commerce and the Department of Treasury to \"think about that.\"",
      "\"It won't cost the taxpayer dimes, but if the secretaries can figure out how to accumulate more bitcoin without costing taxpayers anything, then they are authorized to do that,\" the senior White House officials added.",
      "Sacks repeatedly compared bitcoin to U.S. holdings of gold, explaining that the U.S. won't be selling it, unless Trump changes his mind down the road.",
      "\"We've got about a trillion dollars of gold in Fort Knox and our other depositories,\" he said. \"We don't sell that gold, even though we could use it to pay off a trillion dollars of national debt. The reason why we don't sell it, liquidate it all today is because we believe it's strategic for the United States to have a stockpile or reserve of that asset.",
      "\"In a similar way, we believe it's in the long term interest the United States to hold on to this bitcoin,\" he added. \"Look, if the president changes his mind at some point in the future, he could issue a new executive order and say, the secretary of the treasury, get rid of it, sell it. But we don't want to do that.\"",
      "White House officials also noted that an official audit of the government's digital asset holdings has never been completed but will be following the president's executive order, allowing the administration to get a more concrete understanding of what the U.S. possesses.",

    "story": [
      "\"He certainly intends to sign the order,\" McMahon said of Trump.",
      "U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said Friday that President Donald Trump \"intends\" to sign an executive order to dissolve the Department of Education -- but it's still unclear when.",
      "\"I don't know. I don't want to get ahead of the president,\" she said on \"Fox & Friends\" Friday, adding \"I think you'd have to check with the White House.\"",
      "Her comments come after the White House on Thursday pulled the expected signing of an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education. The White House pulled to order's signing because of concerns of blowback the order would receive -- specifically if vital federal programs could no longer exist, multiple sources confirmed to ABC News.",
      "Without giving any details, McMahon said she had spoken to Trump about the executive order and that he is \"crystal clear\" on the move. As ABC News reported earlier this week, a draft of the order calls on McMahon to facilitate a department closure by taking all necessary steps \"permitted by law,\" sources said.",
      "In the interview, McMahon underscored that abolishing the agency is rooted in allowing families the right to a \"quality education\" through school choice.",
      "She mentioned that kids should not be \"stuck in failing schools,\" and that their parents deserve the right to send them to better schools through various programs and voucher systems.",
      "\"He certainly intends to sign the order,\" McMahon said. \"His intent is to provide quality education through school choice to all students, and he wants to make sure that education is back at the state level where it belongs, that our local school boards, that governors and teachers and parents are really the ones that are involved mostly in their children's education.\"",
      "Education is already a local-level issue. The department conducts federal investigations and research projects; it also oversees programs intended to protect students' civil rights and those with disabilities.",
      "McMahon stressed that the department does not create school curriculum and said the agency she has been tapped to lead is not needed.",
      "\"[The president] couldn't be any more clear when he said he wants me to put myself out of a job,\" she said. \"I think there is definitely a role for education to make sure that as we move education back to the states, that we are providing the tools for the governors, for the teachers, that we can provide them with research to show best practices.\"",
      "However, such moves would require congressional approval; any proposed legislation would likely fail without 60 Senate votes.",
      "Congress rarely came up in the interview with \"Fox & Friends\" anchor Ainsley Earhardt, who mentioned a department closure would take 60 Senate yes votes to shutter the agency Congress started in 1980. During McMahon's confirmation hearing last month, she said she would need Congress to carry out the president's campaign promise and vision.",
      "\"We'd like to do this right,\" she said, adding that the department's closure \"certainly does require congressional action.\"",
      "McMahon allies such as Glenn Jacobs -- the mayor of Knox County, Tennessee, who is best known as the World Wrestling Entertainment superstar Kane -- told ABC News that choosing McMahon is helping to bring \"transformational change\" to the federal government.",
      "\"If you put a Washington insider in there, you're getting the same thing,\" Jacobs said. \"We're in the situation where we have $36 trillion in debt and the government doesn't work because we've just been going with the status quo for so long, there has to be some radical transformation.\"",
      "But McMahon's critics are vowing to press forward to preserve the department. In a virtual address with education leaders on Thursday, \u200b\u200bNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul said that dismantling the agency will harm millions of students in New York and across the country.",
      "\"What [the Trump administration is] doing is saying our kids don't matter,\" Hochul said. \"What's more important is that we slash, for the sake of slashing, and also be able to fund tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires. So instead of supporting a math class, they're supporting tax breaks for the buddies at Mar-a-Lago.\"",
      "With scores of education department employees already on edge -- some on paid leave, taking retirement severance packages or scrambling to do their jobs as a department closure looms -- McMahon said she'd like to help any fired federal workers find new employment.",
      "\"Any time there's talk about shutting a department down, the employees that are there are concerned about their jobs, but there are good off ramps for them,\" McMahon said. \"In a country where we right now have over 8 million openings and jobs, I think there'll be a lot of places for them to go. We'd like to help them get there.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the business executive and former WWE president said she welcomed input from the Department of Government Efficiency tasked with scrubbing the federal government for fraud, waste and abuse. She said she frequently meets with DOGE as they conduct an \"audit\" of the agency.",
      "\"When I was in the private sector, I think a lot of stuff is always turned up when you do a good, solid audit,\" McMahon said. \"I welcome the DOGE folks that are in -- we meet with them almost daily. I've been very appreciative of the things that they have shown us, some of the waste, and we're right where we're reacting to that.\"",

      "\u201cIt really starts like the flu: body aches, feeling poorly overall,\u201d said Dr. Sonja Bartolome of UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. \u201cEarly in the illness, you really may not be able to tell the difference between hantavirus and having the flu.\u201d",
      "The virus can cause a severe and sometimes deadly lung infection called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency began tracking the virus after a 1993 outbreak in the Four Corners region \u2014 the area where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah meet.",
      "The majority of U.S. cases since then have been in western states, especially the southwest. Between 1993 and 2022, there were 864 reported U.S. cases. New Mexico had the highest number over that time, at 122, followed by Colorado at 119.",

    "summary": "Amy Gleason, the acting administrator of the U.S. DOGE Service, is not a household name",
    "story": [
      "Amy Gleason, the acting administrator of the U.S. DOGE Service, is not a household name",
      "When her daughter was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease in 2010, Amy Gleason attacked the challenge.",
      "She carried binders of medical records to doctors\u2019 appointments across six health systems seeking the best care for juvenile dermatomyositis. She volunteered at a nonprofit searching for a cure. She also started a health care company to create record-sharing software that would make life easier for chronically ill patients and families.",
      "Within five years, President Barack Obama\u2019s White House recognized Gleason as a \u201cChampion of Change\u201d in the industry. When the coronavirus struck in 2020, she was a health care technologist in the first Trump White House who worked grueling hours building data systems to guide the federal response. (And her daughter was a thriving college student.)",
      "Now, her journey has improbably led to President Donald Trump naming her the acting administrator of the U.S. DOGE Service, a position that seems to convey extraordinary power. Except almost no one has heard of her and everyone knows the man the president says is actually leading the unparalleled effort to gut the federal workforce and shutter agencies: Elon Musk.",
      "While Musk has claimed his Department of Government Efficiency is fully transparent, until last week the White House press secretary would not even say Gleason's name \u2014 which does not appear on the DOGE website.",
      "In his address to Congress Tuesday, Trump made clear that Musk is in charge, saluting him as the head of DOGE, with Musk smiling down on the president from the visitors' gallery. Yet government lawyers have argued in court that Gleason and not Musk is the agency\u2019s leader.",
      "The confusion has added to the mystery around the role of Gleason, who did not respond to a phone call or text message for comment.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really knows for sure what her role is and whether she actually has any oversight of any of the people doing the work, or is she just there as a punching bag and a distraction to keep their actual activities shielded from the public,\u201d said Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group that sued the DOGE Service and Gleason seeking access to records that would shed light on their operations.",
      "DOGE claims credit for saving more than $100 billion through mass firings, cancellations of contracts and grants, office closures and other cuts that have paralyzed entire agencies. Many of those claimed savings have turned out to be overstated or unproven.",
      "On one level, Gleason fits the mold of a Musk employee, one willing to work arduous hours to meet his goals. Former colleagues say she is an effective behind-the-scenes operator and say her rise is the story of a former nurse who got into health care technology to help patients and doctors and climbed through merit.",
      "\u201cFrom my perspective, I can\u2019t imagine somebody I\u2019d rather have there,\u201d said Jamie Grant, a former Republican lawmaker in Florida who worked with Gleason to start a health care company. \u201cSomebody saying yes to that job right now better believe in the mission and better have a spine and be talented and she\u2019s that in spades.\u201d",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Gleason had served as the acting administrator at DOGE for weeks. But that was not the widely held understanding of her position internally, according to three people with knowledge of the office\u2019s operation who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.",
      "While the exact nature of Gleason\u2019s portfolio was not well defined, what was clear is that she was working closely with DOGE leaders. She attempted to push civil service staffers in the office to hire at least two people who failed screening reviews for prospective hires; both were later hired by DOGE, according to two of the people who spoke to The Associated Press.",
      "The uncertainty over her role \u2014 and when she was appointed to it \u2014 could have far-reaching implications in a series of ongoing lawsuits filed to blunt the impact of Musk's radical paring of the government workforce.",
      "Under questioning from U.S. District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly recently, government attorneys struggled to explain who was in charge of DOGE or Musk's precise role. That led Kollar-Kotelly to wonder if the office was running afoul of the Constitution\u2019s appointments clause because Musk had not been nominated to lead the office, or received confirmation from the Senate.",
      "The Trump administration announced the following day that Gleason was DOGE's acting administrator, a question they had previously refused to answer.",
      "Unlike many DOGE workers, Gleason has no prior ties to Musk. She recently worked as chief products officer at Nashville-based health care firms founded by Brad Smith, who worked in the prior Trump administration on health care and is also a DOGE adviser.",
      "Smith and Gleason began working on Trump\u2019s transition after the November election, and her role in Trump's orbit has grown. In December, she rejoined the United States Digital Service, where she had previously worked from 2018 through 2021 on high-level government health care technology initiatives.",
      "On his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order rebranding USDS as the US DOGE Service and giving it a mandate to help Musk\u2019s cost-cutting initiative. Soon, dozens of Musk acolytes associated with DOGE began arriving at agencies across the government demanding access to sensitive data systems and pushing for drastic changes.",
      "While 21 others in the office resigned in protest rather than carry out Musk\u2019s initiatives, Gleason accepted a position that thrust her into an unfamiliar spotlight.",
      "Health care entrepreneur Travis Bond, Gleason\u2019s colleague over two decades at companies in Florida, said Gleason will hate the public attention but excel in her new role.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure they could have picked a better person. She just thinks, eats and breathes this stuff,\u201d he said.",
      "Bond, Gleason and Grant in 2011 launched CareSync Inc., which developed an app to allow patients suffering from chronic disease to keep their medical records in one place. After benefiting from a $7.25 million grant from one Florida county, CareSync found it hard to attract buyers for subscriptions that cost up to $199 annually.",
      "CareSync pivoted in 2015, taking advantage of a new federal rule that allowed Medicare providers to bill for chronic care management services delivered remotely. The company raised millions of dollars from investors and began rapidly adding staff and serving more than 20,000 patients nationwide. By summer 2018, CareSync ran out of cash and closed without notice, firing 300 workers and leaving creditors owed millions.",
      "Gleason recalled later that she was \u201ctrying to figure out what in the world to do in life\u201d after that experience and applied for the USDS with encouragement from Aneesh Chopra, U.S. chief technology officer under Obama. Chopra declined comment.",
      "She focused on improving technology systems at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. During the pandemic, she worked under White House response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx to develop laboratory and hospital data reporting systems. Birx praised Gleason last week in an interview with CNN as a \u201creally competent, hardworking, focused woman who understands the value of data.\u201d",
      "Near the end of her three-year stint in 2021, Gleason reflected on her work in a podcast interview, saying the digital service sought to \u201cempower the civil servants and to bring new approaches in technology to the government and to help modernize their efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur mission is really to do the greatest good, for the greatest number of people, in the greatest need,\u201d she said."

      "ATLANTA -- A judge on Friday declined a Georgia state senator's request for an arrest warrant against a state House staffer following a confrontation between the two earlier this year.",
      "State Sen. Colton Moore, a Republican from Trenton, had sought the arrest warrant against Keith Williams, a lawyer in the House speaker's office, after the two men were involved in a scuffle outside the House chamber in January. Fulton County Magistrate Judge Robert Wolf said at the end of a hearing that he hadn't seen sufficient evidence to support probable cause that criminal charges were warranted.",
      "A lawyer for Moore said they intend to appeal the judge\u2019s decision to Fulton County Superior Court.",
      "Moore, one of the state Senate's most conservative members, was arrested Jan. 16 after he tried to push his way past House staffers who were blocking him as he tried multiple times to enter the state House chamber for the governor's state of the state speech.

      "President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's campaign of disruption is engulfing the federal government",
      "WASHINGTON -- A series of decisions revealed Friday provided a glimpse of the turmoil engulfing federal agencies since President Donald Trump and Elon Musk launched their campaign of disruption, upending how government functions in ways big and small.",
      "Some changes appeared designed to increase political control over agencies that have historically operated with some degree of autonomy, such as requiring Environmental Protection Agency officials to seek approval from the Department of Government Efficiency for any contracts exceeding $50,000.",
      "Other directives increased burdens on federal workers, who have already endured insults, layoffs and threats from the president and other top officials. For example, government credit cards issued to civilian employees at the Pentagon were altered to have a $1 limit, choking off their ability to travel for work.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration became another target. The administration canceled a collective bargaining agreement with 47,000 workers who screen travelers and luggage at airports around the country, eliminating union protections in a possible prelude to layoffs or privatization.",
      "The cascading developments are only a fraction of the upheaval that's taken place since Trump took office, but they still reshaped how hundreds of thousands of public servants do their jobs, with potentially enduring consequences. The ongoing shakeup is much more intense than the typical whiplash that Washington endures when one administration gives way to another, raising fundamental questions about how government will function under a president who has viewed civil servants as an obstacle to his agenda.",
      "The White House has wrestled with political blowback over Musk\u2019s role and legal challenges that have tried to block or slow down his work. Republicans who are facing growing pressure in contentious town halls have started to speak up.",
      "\u201cI will fully admit, I think Elon Musk has tweeted first and thought second sometimes,\u201d said Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., during a virtual meeting with constituents on Friday. \u201cHe has plunged ahead without necessarily knowing and understanding what he legally has to do or what he is going to be doing.\u201d",
      "The overhaul of the federal government is happening at lightning speed, reflecting years of preparation by Trump's allies and the president's decision to grant Musk sweeping influence over his administration. Musk, a billionaire entrepreneur with no previous experience in public service, has shown no interest in slowing down despite admitting that he'll make mistakes in his crusade to slash spending and downsize the workforce.",
      "The government is facing even more dramatic changes in the coming weeks and months. Trump has directed agencies to prepare plans for widespread layoffs, known as reductions in force, that will likely require more limited operations at agencies that provide critical services.",
      "The Department of Veterans Affairs could shed 80,000 employees, while the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration are considering plans that would cut their workforces in half.",
      "Trump has vowed not to reduce Social Security benefits, but Democrats argue that layoffs would make it harder to deliver payments to 72.5 million people, including retirees and children.",
      "There are also concerns that politics could interfere with Social Security. Trump has feuded over transgender issues with Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, and his administration recently said children born in the state would no longer have a Social Security number assigned at birth. Instead, parents would have to apply for one at a local office.",
      "Leland Dudek, the acting commissioner of Social Security, rescinded the order on Friday.",
      "\u201cIn retrospect, I realize that ending these contracts created an undue burden on the people of Maine, which was not the intent,\u201d he said in a statement. Dudek added that \u201cas a leader, I will admit my mistakes and make them right.\u201d",
      "More than a month after Trump took office, there\u2019s still confusion about Musk\u2019s authority. In public statements and legal filings, administration officials have insisted that Musk does not actually run DOGE and has no direct authority over budgets.",
      "But Trump has contradicted both statements. He said Tuesday that DOGE is \u201cheaded by Elon Musk\u201d in a prime-time speech to a joint session of Congress, and he said Thursday that \u201cElon will do the cutting\u201d if agency leaders don\u2019t reduce their spending.",
      "Their approach has energized people like David Sacks, a venture capitalist serving as a Trump adviser on cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, who praised the administration as moving \u201cfaster than any startup that I\u2019ve been part of.\u201d",
      "Trump denied reports of friction between Musk and Cabinet officials, particularly Secretary of State Marco Rubio, during a meeting Thursday.",
      "\u201cElon gets along great with Marco,\u201d the president said. The State Department had no immediate comment.",
      "Norm Eisen, executive chair of State Democracy Defenders Fund, an organization that has been suing the Trump administration, said the president \u201cmade clear that Musk and DOGE have been calling the shots.\u201d",
      "Musk serves as a presidential adviser, not a Senate-confirmed official, which Eisen argued makes his role unconstitutional. He said Trump's comments are \"an admission that the vast chaos that Musk and DOGE have wrought without proper approval and documentation is illegal \u2014 and so must be completely unwound.\u201d",
      "Many of the changes sweeping through Washington were ignited by Trump's executive orders. One order issued last week said agencies must develop new systems for distributing and justifying payments so they can be monitored by DOGE representatives.",
      "The EPA distributed guidance intended to ensure compliance.",
      "\u201cAny assistance agreement, contract or interagency agreement transaction (valued at) $50,000 or greater must receive approval from an EPA DOGE team member,\" said the documents obtained by The Associated Press.",

      "The Justice Department is celebrating its decision to drop a federal lawsuit against a Louisiana petrochemical plant accused of worsening cancer risks for residents in a majority-Black community",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department on Friday celebrated its decision to drop a federal lawsuit against a Louisiana petrochemical plant accused of worsening cancer risks for residents in a majority-Black community, saying the dismissal showed that officials are \u201cdelivering on President (Donald) Trump\u2019s promise to dismantle radical DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) programs and restore integrity to federal enforcement efforts.\u201d",
      "The dismissal Wednesday of the two-year-old case underscored the Trump administration's commitment to \u201celiminate ideological overreach and restore impartial enforcement of federal laws,'' Justice said in a statement.",
      "At the same time, the Environmental Protection Agency withdrew its formal referral of the case to the Justice Department. The agency said the action aligns with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin\u2019s pledge to end the use of \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d as an enforcement tool that Zeldin was too often used to advance liberal ideological priorities.",
      "Dismissal of the case unraveled one of former President Joe Biden\u2019s highest-profile targets for an environmental justice effort aimed at improving conditions in places disproportionately harmed by decades of industrial pollution. Biden\u2019s EPA sued the Denka Performance Elastomer plant in early 2023, alleging it posed an unacceptable cancer risk and demanding cuts in toxic emissions of cancer-causing chloroprene.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Louisiana and was formally withdrawn Wednesday.",
      "The action is one of a series the Trump administration has taken as it moves quickly to reverse the environmental justice focus of Biden\u2019s administration, placing roughly 170 environmental justice-focused staffers on administrative leave. Dropping the Denka case relieves pressure on a company that has spent years fighting federal lawsuits and investigations over its impact on public health.",
      "Denka, based in Japan, bought the former DuPont plant in LaPlace, Louisiana, a decade ago. It\u2019s located near an elementary school in a community about 30 miles outside New Orleans.",
      "The site produces neoprene, a synthetic rubber that is found in products such as wetsuits and laptop sleeves. The Justice Department sued the company in early 2023, accusing it of emitting unacceptable levels of chloroprene, a chemical that may be especially harmful to children. A judge had scheduled a bench trial for April.",
      "Dismissal of the case reflects the Justice Department's \u201crenewed commitment to enforce environmental laws as Congress intended \u2014 consistently, fairly and without regard to race,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson, who oversees the department\u2019s Environment and Natural Resources Division.",
      "Zeldin, a former Republican congressman who took over the EPA in late January, said the dismissal was \u201ca step toward ensuring that environmental enforcement is consistent with the law. While EPA\u2019s core mission includes securing clean air for all Americans, we can fulfill that mission within well-established legal frameworks, without stretching the bounds of the law or improperly implementing so-called \u2018environmental justice.'\u201d",
      "Denka said the dismissal was \u201clong-overdue\u201d and ends litigation that it said lacked scientific and legal merit. The lawsuit was a \u201cdraining attack on our business,\" the company said.",
      "\u201cThe focus should be on the real-world data that shows no adverse health effects, even at substantially higher emission levels,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "The government\u2019s lawsuit said air monitoring showed that long-term concentrations near the Denka plant are as high as 15 times the amount recommended for long-term exposure to chloroprene.",
      "The EPA under Biden issued a related rule aimed at reducing industrial pollution that gave Denka a fast deadline to lower its emissions. The company said it was being singled out and other manufacturers were given far more time to comply. The company also said the plant has significantly reduced its emissions in recent years, since the sale was completed in 2015. The company won an extension of its deadline.",
      "The Denka plant is located in an industrial stretch of Louisiana from New Orleans to Baton Rouge that is officially called the Mississippi River Chemical Corridor. It\u2019s known informally as Cancer Alley for the high incidence of cancer among residents who live near the industrial corridor, which has about 200 fossil fuel and petrochemical operations. The area accounts for about 25% of the petrochemical production in the United States."

      "In 2015, then-President Barack Obama committed the United States to achieving newly adopted U.N. global goals by 2030",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- In 2015, then-President Barack Obama committed the United States to achieving newly adopted U.N. global goals by 2030, including ending poverty, achieving gender equality and urgently tackling climate change. The Trump administration now says it \u201crejects and denounces\u201d the goals.",
      "The U.S. renunciation was one of the first \u2014 if not the first \u2014 by any country of the 17 goals that were adopted unanimously by all 193 U.N. member nations, with the aim of eliminating global hunger, protecting the planet, ensuring prosperity for all people, and promoting peace.",
      "The Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, also include providing clean water and sanitation for all people and quality education for every child, while promoting good health and decent work and economic growth for everyone.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s announcement was buried in remarks on a General Assembly resolution on the International Day of Peaceful Coexistence this week by Edward Heartney, a minister-counselor at the U.S. mission to the United Nations.",
      "Heartney said that while framed in \u201cneutral language,\u201d the goals and the U.N. agenda for 2030 \u201cadvance a program of soft global governance that is inconsistent with U.S. sovereignty and adverse to the rights and interests of Americans.\u201d",
      "In last November\u2019s election that gave President Donald Trump a second term, he said, \u201cglobalist endeavors like Agenda 2030 and the SDGs lost at the ballot box\u201d to the U.S. government focusing first and foremost on Americans.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump also set a clear and overdue course correction on `gender\u2019 and climate ideology, which pervade the SDGs,\u201d Heartney said.",
      "Trump has said the U.S. government will only recognize two sexes, male and female, and spoken out against transgender people and rights. The SDGs stress that they apply to everyone, everywhere, and will \u201cleave no one behind,\u201d but they do not specifically mention LGBTQ people.",
      "As for climate, Trump has promoted more oil and gas drilling and he withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 landmark Paris climate agreement to combat global warming, and said he would take the U.S. out of other climate pacts. The SDGs call for urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, noting that planet Earth is \u201cstanding at the brink of climate calamity.\u201d",
      "U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric, responding to the U.S. announcement, said all 193 U.N. member states voted in 2015 for the SDGs and agreed to work together to deliver the 2030 Agenda, which is \u201cthe path to bridging divides, restoring trust and building solidarity.\u201d",
      "It continues to be the U.N.\u2019s guiding principles \u201cto advance a world of peace, prosperity and dignity for all\u201d and \u201ca better, healthier, safer and more prosperous and sustainable future,\u201d he said.",
      "After Trump\u2019s first election in November 2016 on an \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform, the U.S. also opposed multilateral solutions, but it didn\u2019t disavow the SDGs. It just ignored them.",
      "Following Joe Biden\u2019s election to the presidency in 2020, the U.S. renewed support for the SDGs, reporting to Congress on how the United States was contributing to achieving the 17 goals.",

    "story": [
      "Ever since a hawk hovered over a vigil for her murdered son and lifted her spirits, Georgia mother Michele Davis has found joy in unexpected ways",
      "ROSWELL, Ga. -- A hawk swooped in and landed on a tree, then watched as Michele and Jeremy Davis mourned their murdered son at a vigil outside his high school.",
      "It was one day after their teenager, Carter, was gunned down in a random attack that sent fear through the suburbs north of Atlanta in the summer of 2016.",
      "The hawk stayed as the father spoke. When he finished, it began soaring silently over the crowd, flying just over the heads of Carter's classmates at the tearful vigil, Michele Davis recalled in an interview this week.",
      "Hawks and butterflies would show up later for the Davis family in surprising and unexpected ways. They've been part of a series of events that helped her regain her joy, she said.",
      "Michele Davis is an English teacher at the Lovett School in Atlanta, and one of the latest signs that her son is OK came through a former student, Slater Nalley. He wrote a song about Carter and later made it onto the TV show \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d Nalley's performance of \"Traces of You\" will be aired on the season premiere Sunday night, ABC representatives said.",
      "Michele Davis spent one of the last days with her son in her home state of South Dakota, beneath the towering granite peaks in the Black Hills. She and Carter noticed two granite spires touching each other across a ravine, a rock formation known as the Praying Hands.",
      "Three days later, Carter and his friend Natalie Henderson, both 17, were gunned down. It was the night before he was supposed to start his senior year at River Ridge High School in Woodstock, Georgia.",
      "Hours after the killings, Carter's parents gathered with their daughter, 8-year-old Greta, to find a path forward. They'd just heard devastating details of the murders from police detectives. When the police left, they went to their porch and decided to look for messages that signaled Carter was OK, Michele Davis said. To help Greta better comprehend the loss of her big brother, Jeremy Davis explained to his daughter that Carter may send messages that he\u2019s fine in unique ways, such as with feathers or dragonflies.",
      "They talked it over a bit before Jeremy Davis told the family: \u201cI see him as a hawk or an eagle, soaring high above.\"",
      "The next evening at the vigil, the hawk appeared.",
      "As Michele Davis spoke with her parents a couple of days after the killings, a yellow and black butterfly landed near them. It reminded them of Carter's love for butterflies.",
      "Carter was also passionate about sports, and hoped to play lacrosse in college. Weeks after the killings, friends and family organized a pick-up lacrosse game in Georgia.",
      "Carter's best friend from South Dakota flew to Atlanta for the game and wore Carter's helmet and jersey. Midway through, players came to a halt. They began pointing at Carter's helmet, where a yellow butterfly had landed.",
      "Days after the killing, Roswell police arrested Jeffrey Hazelwood on two murder counts. Police said he stalked Carter and Henderson as they spent time in a parked car outside a Publix grocery store.",
      "Hazelwood, who was 20 at the time, had climbed onto the roof of the grocery store during the predawn hours on Aug. 1, 2016, to watch them, prosecutors said. He later confronted the teens in the parking lot, shooting both of them in the head, the medical examiner determined. There was no evidence that he even knew them.",
      "After the killings, Hazelwood wore a \u201cGuy Fawkes\u201d mask \u2014 which gained popularity after the 2006 film \u201cV for Vendetta\u201d \u2014 as he filled his car with gas at a nearby convenience store, surveillance video shows. There's no evidence he was wearing the mask during the killings, as there's no surveillance video that captured the teens being shot, police said. Detectives later found writings by Hazelwood that expressed his desire to become an assassin.",
      "Hazelwood pleaded guilty but mentally ill to two counts of murder, and is serving a life sentence in a Georgia prison, according to the state Department of Corrections. Hazelwood has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, his defense lawyers said in court.",
      "A priest who prayed with her and the Henderson family, and the Roswell police detectives who interviewed Michele and Jeremy Davis also gave them comfort in their darkest days, Michele Davis said.",
      "She's also grateful that detectives secured a confession from Hazelwood. He shook uncontrollably as he recounted the crime to a detective, as seen in the interrogation video. The police department's forensic science laboratory now has a plaque on the wall: \u201cIn Memory of Natalie Henderson & Carter Davis. When the innocent cannot cry out for justice, it is our duty to do so for them.\u201d",
      "Last year, Michele Davis shared a poem she had written with Nalley, her former student. Nalley then created a song about Carter and wanted to bring his guitar to school and play it for the class.",
      "\u201cIt was the most magical thing I had ever heard,\" Michele Davis said. Students in other classrooms heard the music. So \"we went on this classroom tour of him singing this song and me sitting there listening to it and crying,\u201d she said.",
      "The song's opening lyric is \u201cYour laugh was like a river running home.\u201d Later, the song evokes the hawks that bring comfort to her: \u201cSomewhere past the sky I can feel you dancing in the air. Every single time I see a bird fly by, I\u2019m reminded you\u2019re answering my prayers.\u201d",
      "Through a friend, Michele Davis was able to find a small group of women in the Atlanta area known as the Warrior Moms, all of whom have suffered tremendous loss.",
      "\u201cAs Americans we shy away from talking about it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's just underneath the surface \u2014 this sadness \u2014 that any one second, I can just sit still long enough and break down crying.\u201d",
      "The Warrior Moms plan to share their experiences in a book, \u201cGrieve Like a Mother, Survive Like a Warrior,\u201d set to be released later this year.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to be able to tell our stories that help people find joy again,\u201d Michele Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s very intentional with finding joy.\u201d",
      "Another thing she's learned is what she calls \u201cliving in the \u2018and,\u2019\" as in \u201cdark and light, sorrow and happiness, grief and joy,\" she said.",
      "She also plans to keep looking for those unexpected moments, when the memory of her son comes flooding back.",
      "\u201cYou look for the hawks and butterflies,\" she said."

      "HOLLAND, Mich. -- Protesters demanding an in-person town hall from their western Michigan GOP congressman chanted loudly Friday as honking drivers signaled support, disrupting the usual calm of a conservative family vacation town.",
      "Mere hours later, Rep. Bill Huizenga held a town hall \u2014 by phone. The vocal disruption seen outside his Holland office earlier in the day was absent, as the more controlled setting allowed for questions from people who wrote and called in.",
      "\u201cI know this may not be satisfactory to some who would like to just create a scene and be, you know, be disruptive,\u201d Huizenga said on the call. \u201cBut we know that this is extremely effective for reaching people.\u201d",
      "Some Republicans have opted to hold telephone town halls after GOP leaders in recent days have advised lawmakers to skip town halls that have been filled with protesters decrying President Donald Trump administration\u2019s slashing of federal government. GOP lawmakers have at times found themselves at a loss to explain the cuts, led by billionaire Elon Musk\u2019sDepartment of Government Efficiency, that are leaving federal workers suddenly out of jobs in communities across the country.",
      "Trump and other Republicans have accused paid activists of taking control of town halls. On Tuesday, Huizenga told News Channel 3 in west Michigan that the outreach overwhelming his office was \u201cfunded and organized by outside partisans.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, longtime Holland resident Linda Visscher and other protesters faced freezing temperatures and falling snow outside Huizenga\u2019s office on Friday. Holding a sign that read, \u201cOur House seat is not your entitlement, you are accountable to your constituents,\u201d she insisted she wasn\u2019t being paid to protest.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m trying to think of a nice way of saying B.S. They are not activists,\u201d said Visscher, who said her political affiliations \u201clean towards liberal.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople who go to town halls are concerned citizens. And just because some of the representatives are getting yelled at or uncomfortably questioned doesn\u2019t mean that you stop doing it,\" she added.",
      "Nearly 50 people gathered outside Huizenga\u2019s office as cars, ranging from semi-trucks to Ford pickups, honked as they drove by. His Holland office is in Ottawa County, a deeply religious area known as a bastion of conservative politics. Trump secured the area in the 2024 election with 59.5% of the vote.",
      "Nancy Berg, a volunteer at the local Christian Neighbors food bank, held a sign opposing cuts to Medicaid. She said the food bank serves people who are food insecure and \u201cdepend on the resources we provide,\u201d adding that she doesn\u2019t know how they will manage if the expected cuts materialize.",
      "Many of the questions Huizenga faced at his phone town hall related to Social Security. Among the potential changes to the Social Security Administration are layoffs for more than 10% of the agency\u2019s workforce and the closure of dozens of offices throughout the U.S. It is all part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "Huizenga insisted, \u201cSocial Security is not being touched,\u201d adding that DOGE has no authority over it.",
      "Despite facing critical questions, Huizenga concluded his hour-long town hall by saying, \u201cMy job as a representative is not to necessarily agree with everybody.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also, frankly, not to just go out there and stick my finger in the wind,\u201d Huizenga said. \u201cI get hired to use my experience, my judgment, and then to make tough decisions. And then I get a very public job review every two years.\u201d"

      "An Associated Press journalist has served as a media eyewitness to the execution of Brad Sigmon by firing squad Friday in South Carolina",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- I've now watched through glass and bars as 11 men were put to death at a South Carolina prison. None of the previous 10 prepared me for watching the firing squad death of Brad Sigmon on Friday night.",
      "I might now be unique among U.S. reporters: I've witnessed three different methods \u2014 nine lethal injections and an electric chair execution. I can still hear the thunk of the breaker falling 21 years later.",
      "As a journalist you want to ready yourself for an assignment. You research a case. You read about the subject.",
      "In the two weeks since I knew how Sigmon was going to die, I read up on firing squads and the damage that can be done by the bullets. I looked at the autopsy photos of the last man shot to death by the state, in Utah in 2010.",
      "I also pored over the transcript of his trial, including how prosecutors said it took less than two minutes for Sigmon to strike his ex-girlfriend's parents nine times each in the head with a baseball bat, going back and forth between them in different rooms of their Greenville County home in 2001 until they were dead.",
      "But you don't know everything when some of execution protocols are kept secret, and it's impossible to know what to expect when you've never seen someone shot at close range right in front of you.",
      "The firing squad is certainly faster \u2014 and more violent \u2014 than lethal injection. It's a lot more tense, too. My heart started pounding a little after Sigmon's lawyer read his final statement. The hood was put over Sigmon's head, and an employee opened the black pull shade that shielded where the three prison system volunteer shooters were.",
      "About two minutes later, they fired. There was no warning or countdown. The abrupt crack of the rifles startled me. And the white target with the red bullseye that had been on his chest, standing out against his black prison jumpsuit, disappeared instantly as Sigmon's whole body flinched.",
      "It reminded me of what happened to the prisoner 21 years ago when electricity jolted his body.",
      "I tried to keep track, all at once, of the digital clock on the wall to my right, Sigmon to my left, the small, rectangular window with the shooters and the witnesses in front of me.",
      "A jagged red spot about the size of a small fist appeared where Sigmon was shot. His chest moved two or three times. Outside of the rifle crack, there was no sound.",
      "A doctor came out in less than a minute, and his examination took about a minute more. Sigmon was declared dead at 6:08 p.m.",
      "Then we left through the same door we came in.",
      "The sun was setting. The sky was a pretty pink and purple, a stark contrast to the death chamber's florescent lights, gray firing squad chair and block walls that reminded me of a 1970s doctor's office.",
      "The death chamber is less than a five-minute drive from Correction Department headquarters along a busy suburban highway. I always look out the window on the drive back from each execution. There is a pasture with cows behind a fence on one side, and on the other, I can see in the distance the razor wire of the prison.",
      "Armed prison employees were everywhere. We sat in vans outside the death chamber for what I guess was around 15 minutes, but I can't say for certain because my watch, cellphone and everything else was taken away for security, save for a pad and a pen.",
      "Over to my right, I saw the skinny, barred windows of South Carolina's death row. There were 28 inmates there earlier Friday, and now there are 27.",

      "Facing the potential loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding, Duke University is preparing for the worst",
      "DURHAM, N.C. -- Facing the potential loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding, Duke University is preparing for the worst.",
      "Like research universities around the United States, the private school in North Carolina's Research Triangle would see a massive loss from Trump administration cuts to grants from the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Duke would be among the hardest hit. In its previous fiscal year, Duke took in $580 million in NIH grants and contracts, 11th most among the country's research institutions. The cuts are delayed temporarily by a court challenge, but universities nationwide have implemented hiring freezes, scaled back research and drawn up contingency plans in case the loss in funding takes effect.",
      "Historically, the federal government has negotiated with colleges and universities on its contribution toward their operating costs. If a scientist wins a federal grant to fund their research, the government pays the school an additional amount as a percentage of the grant money.",
      "At Duke, the current rate for these \u201cindirect costs\u201d \u2014 expenses such as utilities and laboratory maintenance \u2014 is about 61%. Last month, President Donald Trump's administration set the rate cap at 15%, significantly less than most universities receive.",
      "The cut in indirect costs is far from the only concern. Funding for new grants also slowed to a trickle after the NIH halted grant application review meetings in January. At Duke, NIH grant and contract award notices plummeted, dropping from 166 in January and February of 2024 to 64 so far in 2025, according to the university.",
      "Already, the uncertainty is causing reverberations at Duke's School of Medicine, which receives over three-quarters of the university's NIH funding. Expansion projects are being shelved. Fewer Ph.D. students are being admitted. And researchers are assessing whether their projects can continue.",
      "The Trump administration has described indirect costs as \u201cadministrative bloat\u201d and said the cuts would save more than $4 billion annually. The change would also free up more money for scientific research, officials said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is committed to slashing the cottage industry built off of the waste, fraud, and abuse within our mammoth government while prioritizing the needs of everyday Americans,\u201d White House spokesperson Kush Desai said.",
      "Through NIH funding, universities for decades have partnered with the federal government to support scientists\u2019 academic pursuits.",
      "Duke pharmacology and cancer biology professor Donald McDonnell estimates his laboratory has received up to $40 million in NIH funding over 30 years. His lab developed a drug approved in 2023 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat metastatic breast cancer.",
      "Upkeep for lab equipment, including machines to grow cancer cells and massive freezers for enzymes and chemicals, would be difficult to afford if indirect cost rates dropped to 15%, McDonnell said. His laboratory also likely will be in the red due to the uncertainty around NIH grants, which would lead to staff layoffs.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is, I can\u2019t live, I can\u2019t think in this chaos,\u201d McDonnell said.",
      "Duke's total research budget last fiscal year was $1.33 billion, with $863 million coming from the federal government. Without NIH funding, many scientists would have to turn to private organizations and philanthropies, which typically offer substantially less money, researchers said.",
      "\u201cWe have long-standing relationships with private funders and industry partners, and value the contributions they make, but federal funds by far provide the largest single source of research dollars,\" said Geeta Swamy, executive vice dean of the School of Medicine.",
      "The cap on indirect costs also would hinder research for incoming neurosurgery and biomedical engineering professor Nanthia Suthana, who is relocating from the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "To study brain activity and treat conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder and Parkinson\u2019s disease, Suthana requires a lab large enough for patients to walk around while headsets and monitors capture heart rate, eye tracking, perspiration and brainwaves. Along the walls, 40 to 50 cameras \u2014 each costing about $5,000 \u2014 record their movements.",
      "Her new lab is under construction, but Suthana said she is worried she will have to downsize within a year if funding uncertainties persist.",
      "Duke's medical school has scaled back the number of Ph.D. students it will admit for the upcoming fall semester. Last year, the school brought in about 130 students, said Beth Sullivan, who oversees the school\u2019s 17 biomedical Ph.D. programs. Now, the target is 100 students or less.",
      "That means smaller class sizes over time and, in turn, a shrinking pipeline into medical research careers, she said.",
      "\u201cOur next generation of researchers are now poised on the edge of this cliff, not knowing if there\u2019s going to be a bridge that's going to get them to the other side, or if this is it,\u201d Sullivan said.",
      "Of the more than 630 Ph.D. students in the medical school, nearly all the students in their second year and beyond receive federal support from either NIH or the National Science Foundation.",
      "Third-year doctoral student Caleb McIver was applying for an NIH diversity supplement \u2014 a funding opportunity to encourage professors to train minority students \u2014 when information about the initiative was removed from the agency\u2019s website. McIver, who is Black, is now looking into other NIH grants without ties to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which the Trump administration has been wiping out of the federal government.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty stressed,\u201d McIver said. \u201cI mean, I need funding, so we need to find it.\u201d",
      "The university had been planning to build a new research building on the site of an old, recently vacated building. Now those plans are on hold, School of Medicine Vice Dean Colin Duckett said.",
      "Even smaller projects like renovating a building floor can\u2019t start because of the budget uncertainty. Hundreds of people working in shuttered labs will consolidate in other buildings. If the indirect costs rate drops to 15%, there also would be widespread layoffs, Duckett said.",
      "Duckett\u2019s job previously focused on recruiting the brightest scientists and providing them with resources at Duke, he said. Now, he has taken on a much different role.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s damage control,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s how to survive as an institution.\u201d",

      "American Jews who fled their Syrian homeland decades ago went to the White House this week to appeal to the Trump administration to lift sanctions on the country",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 American Jews who fled their Syrian homeland decades ago went to the White House this week to appeal to the Trump administration to lift sanctions on Syria that they say are blocking them from restoring some of the world's oldest synagogues and rebuilding the country's decimated Jewish community.",
      "For Henry Hamra, who fled Damascus as a teenager with his family in the 1990s, the 30 years since have been shadowed by worry for what they left behind.",
      "\u201cI was just on the lookout the whole time. The old synagogues, the old cemetery, what's going on, who's taking care of it?' said Hamra, whose family has settled in New York.",
      "His family fled the Syrian capital to escape the repressive government of Hafez Assad. With the toppling of his son, Bashar Assad, in December and the end of Assad family rule, Hamra, his 77-year-old father, Rabbi Yusuf Hamra, and a small group of other Jews and non-Jews returned to Syria last month for the first time.",
      "They briefed State Department officials for the region last week and officials at the White House on Wednesday. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "They were accompanied by Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of a group called the Syrian American Task Force, who was influential in the past in moving U.S. officials to sanction the Assad government over its institutionalized torture and killings.",
      "With Assad gone and the country trying to move out of poverty, Moustafa has been urging U.S. policymakers to lift sweeping sanctions that block most investment and business dealings in Syria.",
      "\u201cIf you want a stable and safe Syria ... even if it's as simple as rebuilding the oldest synagogue in the world, the only person that's able to make that a reality today is, frankly, Donald Trump,\u201d Moustafa said.",
      "Syria's Jewish community is one of the world's oldest, dating its history back to the prophet Elijah's time in Damascus nearly 3,000 years ago. It once had been one of the world's largest, and was still estimated at 100,000 at the start of the 20th century.",
      "Increased restrictions, surveillance and tensions after the creation of Israel and under the authoritarian Assad family sent tens of thousands fleeing in the 1990s. Today, only seven Jews are known to remain in Damascus, most of them elderly.",
      "What began as a largely peaceful uprising against the Assad family in 2011 grew into a vicious civil war, with a half-million dying as Russia and Iranian-backed militias fought to keep the Assads in power, and the Islamic State group imposing its rule on a wide swath of the country.",
      "A U.S.-led military coalition routed the Islamic State by 2019. Successive U.S. administrations piled sanctions on Syria over the Assad government's torture, imprisonment and killing of perceived opponents.",
      "Bashar Assad was ousted in December by a coalition of rebel groups led by an Islamist insurgent, Ahmad al-Sharaa, who today leads what he says is a transition government. He and his supporters have taken pains to safeguard members of Syria's many minority religious groups and pledged peaceful coexistence as they ask a skeptical international community to lift the crippling sanctions.",
      "Although incidents of revenge and collective punishment have been far less widespread than expected, many in Syria\u2019s minority communities \u2014 including Kurds, Christians, Druze and members of Assad\u2019s Alawite sect \u2014 are concerned and not convinced by promises of inclusive government.",
      "After the decades away, Yusuf Hamra\u2019s former Christian neighbors in the old city of Damascus recognized him on his trip back last month and stopped to embrace him, and share gossip on old acquaintances. The Hamras prayed in the long-neglected al-Franj synagogue, where he used to serve as a rabbi.",
      "His son, Henry Hamra, said he was shocked to see tiny children begging in the streets \u2014 a result, he said, of the sanctions.",
      "Visiting the site of what had been Syria's oldest synagogue of all, in the Jobar area of Damascus, Hamra found it in ruins from the war, with an ordnance shell still among the rubble.",
      "Hamra had become acquainted with Moustafa, then a U.S.-based opposition activist, when he reached out to him during the war to see if he could do anything to rescue precious artifacts inside the Jobar synagogue as fighting raged around it.",
      "A member of Moustafa's group suffered a shrapnel wound trying, and a member of a Jobar neighborhood council was killed. Both men were Muslim. Despite their effort, fighting later destroyed most of the structure.",
      "Hamra said Jews abroad want to be allowed to help restore their synagogues, their family homes and their schools in the capital's old city. Someday, he says, Syria's Jewish community could be like Morocco's, thriving in a Muslim country again.",
      "\u201cMy main goal is not to see my Jewish quarter, and my school, and my synagogue and everything fall apart,\" Hamra said."

      "The acting head of the Social Security Administration says he rescinded and apologized for an order that would have required Maine parents to register their newborns for Social Security numbers at a federal office rather than the hospital",
      "SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- The acting head of the Social Security Administration on Friday rescinded and apologized for an order that would have required Maine parents to register their newborns for Social Security numbers at a federal office rather than the hospital.",
      "The order drew widespread condemnation from medical organizations and public officials who described it as unnecessary and punitive. The practice of allowing parents to register a newborn for a Social Security number at a hospital or other birthing site, called the Enumeration at Birth program, has been common for decades.",
      "Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek said he recently directed Social Security employees to end an Enumeration at Birth contract for Maine. He said he will \u201cadmit my mistakes and make them right\u201d by reinstating the contract.",
      "\u201cIn retrospect, I realize that ending these contracts created an undue burden on the people of Maine, which was not the intent,\u201d Dudek said in a statement.",
      "The confusion over Social Security in Maine is the latest example of a bumpy cutback rollout amid President Donald Trump's bid to shrink the size of government. The Trump administration halted its firings of hundreds of federal employees who worked on nuclear weapons programs last month. It also moved to rehire medical device, food safety and other workers lost to mass firings at the Food and Drug Administration. Planned tariffs on key trading partners have been similarly chaotic.",
      "Dudek did not immediately provide a reason for terminating the Enumeration at Birth contract. Nancy Altman, executive director of the Social Security Works advocacy group said despite the agency\u2019s reversal, \u201cthe damage has been done.\u201d",
      "\u201cWithout those contracts, SSA did not automatically know who was born in Maine \u2014 or who died,\u201d Altman said. \u201cThis will create huge headaches for families, as well as Social Security\u2019s rapidly shrinking workforce, to fix.\"",
      "The confusion came as Trump's Department of Government Efficiency is targeting federal agencies for layoffs and cutbacks. Some of those cutbacks have affected the Enumeration at Birth program.",
      "The DOGE website shows the cancellation of contracts related to Enumeration at Birth in five states and the Northern Mariana Islands. The five states listed are Arizona, Maryland, Michigan, New Mexico and Rhode Island. Maine is not listed.",
      "Limited information is provided about the canceled contracts, but they appear to concern the collection of race and ethnicity records. Dudek's statement said the Enumeration at Birth program was \u201cin place for every state\u201d as of Friday.",
      "The plan to scrap Enumeration at Birth in Maine also arrived at a time when state officials are sparring with the federal government. Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, and Trump exchanged words last month during a meeting of governors in which Trump vowed to pull federal funding from the state over the issue of the inclusion of transgender athletes in high school sports.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services later told Mills that the state was in violation of Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in education programs that receive federal assistance. The conflict remains unresolved."

      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease a full week after his wife died from hantavirus in their New Mexico home, likely unaware that she was dead because he was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, authorities revealed Friday.",
      "Hackman, 95, and Betsy Arakawa, 65, were found dead Feb. 26. In the days that followed, mystery swirled around the deaths as authorities ruled out foul play, and immediate tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative.",
      "Then authorities in New Mexico released the causes, proposing a simple but tragic theory for the deaths: Shortly after Arakawa's death from a rare infection, Hackman died of the nation\u2019s leading killer \u2014 heart disease \u2014 apparently unable to seek help after his wife died.",
      "\u201cI believe they really discovered what truly happened in this case,\" said forensic pathologist Dr. Victor Weedn, who was not involved in the investigation. \u201cIt seemed such a great mystery to the entire nation.\u201d",
      "Here's a timeline of events surrounding the couple's deaths:",
      "Arakawa's last known activities happened this day. She emailed with a massage therapist in the late morning, visited a grocery store in Santa Fe in the afternoon, then went to a pharmacy and a pet food store, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said.",
      "At 5:15 p.m., Arakawa entered the gated community to the home she shared with Hackman. Mendoza said investigators found no other communication or activity by Arakawa after Feb. 11, which they believe to be the day of her death. The medical examiner said she may have been experiencing symptoms of hantavirus before her death.",
      "Hackman\u2019s initial pacemaker data revealed cardiac activity Feb. 17. Subsequent pacemaker investigation showed an abnormal rhythm of atrial fibrillation Feb. 18, the last record of heart activity.",
      "Based on this information, chief medical examiner Dr. Heather Jarrell said it is reasonable to conclude that Hackman probably died around Feb. 18.",
      "A maintenance worker who showed up to do routine work at the house could not get inside and called a security worker, who spotted two people on the ground inside the home, Mendoza said. The worker called 911 and told an operator he did not know if they were breathing. He and another worker later told authorities that they rarely saw the homeowners and that their last contact with them had been about two weeks prior.",
      "Police found Hackman in an entryway and Arakawa in a bathroom, as well as a deceased dog in a closet.",
      "Arakawa had picked up the kelpie mix named Zinna from Gruda Veterinary Hospital on Feb. 9 after a procedure was done, according to the sheriff. He said the hospital visit might help explain why the dog was found dead. A necropsy is being done on Zinna to determine the cause of death, he said.",
      "Two healthy dogs were found on the property \u2014 one inside and one outside.",
      "Autopsies were done on Hackman and Arakawa. Detectives wrote in a search warrant that the couple and the dog had been dead for some time when the maintenance worker discovered their bodies.",
      "Preliminary autopsy results didn't reveal causes of death but showed Hackman and Arakawa were not killed by carbon monoxide poisoning, the sheriff said. The initial autopsies also found no external trauma to either body.",
      "Authorities reveal causes of death for Hackman and Arakawa. Jarrell said both deaths were from natural causes.",
      "Hackman\u2019s death was tied to heart disease with Alzheimer\u2019s disease contributing. Authorities linked Betsy Arakawa\u2019s death to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings."

Wes Moore, a Democrat, said Friday in support of the complaint.",
      "Brown followed up on Friday by moving for a temporary restraining order in federal court in Maryland seeking to stop any more firings of federal probationary employees and to reinstate those who have already been dismissed.",
      "The mass firings will cause irreparable burdens and expenses on the states, the lawsuit said, because states will have to support recently unemployed workers and review and adjudicate claims of unemployment assistance. More than 800 fired federal workers in Maryland already have applied for unemployment benefits, Brown's office said.",
      "The lawsuit also contended that the layoffs will hurt state finances due to lost tax revenue.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s unlawful mass firings of federal workers are a blatant attack on the civil service, throwing thousands of hardworking families into financial turmoil,\u201d Brown, a Democrat, said in a news release. \u201cInstead of following the law and notifying states, his administration blindsided Maryland, forcing us to deal with the devastating economic fallout and social consequences.\"",
      "Trump, a Republican, has said he\u2019s targeting fraud, waste and abuse in a bloated federal government. The president and his adviser Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency have fired both new and career workers, telling agency leaders to plan for \u201clarge-scale reductions in force.\u201d The purge has spawned a number of lawsuits as unions and attorneys general have challenged Doge's authority. Attempts to contact the White House and Justice Department for comment were unsuccessful.",
      "Probationary workers have been targeted for layoffs across the federal government because they\u2019re usually new to the job and lack full civil service protection.",
      "While federal agencies claimed the employees were fired for unsatisfactory performance or conduct, the lawsuit said the firings were part of the administration\u2019s attempt to restructure and downsize the entire government.",
      "That means the administration was required to follow federal laws and regulations that govern large-scale federal reductions in force, the lawsuit said. For example, regulations require that government agencies consider an employee\u2019s tenure, performance and veteran status when making termination decisions, the attorneys said. Regulations also typically require 60 days\u2019 advance notice of termination in a reduction in force.",
      "\u201cThis has inflicted and will continue to inflict serious and irreparable harms on the Plaintiff States, as they must now deal with a sudden surge in unemployment, without the advance notice required under the federal (reduction in force) statute and regulations,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "The attorneys general are asking for the court to reinstate the fired employees and stop further terminations of federal employees.",
      "The other states that have joined the lawsuit are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin. The District of Columbia also is a plaintiff."

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- A man accused of witness tampering in a courtroom hallway pleaded guilty Friday to wire fraud for his role in a scheme that prosecutors said stole $250 million from a federally funded program meant to feed children.",
      "The allegation of witness tampering against Abdinasir Abshir, 32, of Lakeville, surfaced last month in the trial of the alleged ringleader, Aimee Bock, the founder of the now-defunct nonprofit Feeding Our Future, and Salim Said, a former Minneapolis restaurant owner.",
      "Seventy defendants have been charged altogether. Abshir was the 37th to plead guilty. Five were convicted last year in the first trial. The ongoing trial of Bock and Said is the second in the case. Abshir was due to stand trial in August as part of a later group.",
      "That first trial was marred by an alleged attempt by some defendants and people linked with them to bribe a juror with a bag of $120,000 in cash. That juror went straight to police. That led to tighter security for Bock's trial, and additional precautions ordered by U.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel.",
      "Under Abshir's plea deal, both sides agreed that federal guidelines recommend 63 to 78 months in prison on the wire fraud count, a sentence made tougher because of Abshir's attempt to intimidate the witness. He also agreed to pay nearly $2.3 million in restitution and forfeit a 2021 Range Rover he bought with his proceeds.",
      "Brasel noted that she is not bound by the recommendations and did not set a sentencing date.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Abshir approached a government witness and asked to speak with him in a courthouse bathroom. That witness, Sharmake Jama, the former owner of a Rochester restaurant, pleaded guilty earlier and agreed to testify against Bock and Said. Jama declined to enter the bathroom and instead told his lawyer, who informed prosecutors.",
      "Earlier that day, court filings show, Abshir and another man had entered the courtroom loudly, apparently aware that a postal inspector was expected to testify about Abshir's role. Abshir and the other man sat in the front row, close to the jury box, and continued to be disruptive until security approached them and they left.",
      "Then Abshir approached Jama, who was sitting on a bench in the hallway, waiting to testify.",
      "Abshir was later taken back into custody. In a detention order Thursday, Magistrate Judge Tony Leung found probable cause that Abshir committed a felony by attempting to intimidate Jama.",
      "\u201cLike the jury tampering that has been alleged to have occurred in the only other Feeding Our Future case tried thus far, intimidation of a witness is also a direct attack on the integrity, efficacy, and reliability of this nation\u2019s judicial system,\" Leung wrote. \"The disregard for norms of laws and rules is all the more brazen in the context of the heightened scrutiny after the jury tampering charges stemming from the previously tried case.\u201d",
      "Abshir was accused of opening a fraudulent food distribution site called Stigma Free Mankato. Prosecutors allege he and his brother falsely claimed to have served more than 1.6 million meals to children in 2020 and 2021 in Mankato, a city of about 46,000 people. They allegedly collected $5.4 million. Abshir admitted to his role in that, and to paying $100,000 in bribes and kickbacks to a Feeding Our Future employee.",
      "Defense attorney Craig Cascarano acknowledged that it was \u201ca huge misstep on his part\u201d for Abshir to approach the witness.",
      "\u201cIt was a shocking incident,\u201d Cascarano told the judge.",
      "In ordering Abshir held without bail, Brasel cited the \u201cflagrant actions\u201d he took \u201cnot very far\u201d from her bench, after warning him that going forward, it would be \u201ca really bad idea\u201d to for him try to talk to other witnesses or defendants."

    "story": [
      "Giant trolley scales are being trialled at a Tesco store in Gateshead sparking a mixed reaction from shoppers.",
      "Trolleys are weighed before checkout to identify any items customers who have used Scan as you Shop might have missed or scanned twice.",
      "But some shoppers are unsure whether the new technology will take off with some likening it to airport security. \"Am I at border control or Tesco?\" one Reddit user posted, while another joked \"No clubcard? Deported!\"",
      "Others questioned whether the scales were aimed at cracking down on self-scan shoplifters or cutting back on checkout staff. Tesco declined to comment.",
      "Tesco Clubcard members already have the option to use Scan as you Shop handsets as they fill their trolleys then check out and pay at the end.",
      "Now in the Gateshead Trinity Square Extra store, shoppers can push their trolley on to the scales and if the weight matches the items they've scanned they pay as normal. If there is a discrepancy a staff member will do a manual rescan of the whole trolley.",
      "'Treated like a thief'",
      "Although some Reddit users who commented on the photo of the scales were positive with one saying \"they are 10x more convenient and faster\", many were more critical of their introduction.",
      "\"More and more the honest shopper is treated like a thief,\" one said, while another wrote \"the point of all this is to save on staff\".",
      "Business retail consultant Ged Futter told the BBC this was about loss prevention and staffing costs.",
      "\"There is no way this is about making it quicker for the shopper. It's supposed to be scan and go - this is scan and stop while your trolley is weighed.\"",
      "He said self-scan had increased the rate of shoplifting but instead of putting staff back on tills, supermarkets were trying to use even more technology to stop thefts.",
      "\"This is supermarkets saying, 'we know there are thefts so what we are going to do is treat every customer in exactly the same way to reduce theft'.",
      "\"They're forgetting that trust is the most important thing for all of the retailers and it works both ways. If customers don't feel trusted or think they're being treated like thieves they will go somewhere else.\"",
      "The British Retail Consortium has said shoplifting is \"out of control\" after its annual crime survey found incidents of customer theft reported by retailers in the UK rose by 3.7 million to 20.4 million, and cost retailers \u00a32bn.",
      "Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics revealed shoplifting offences reported by police in England and Wales rose by 23% to more than 492,000 over the same period.",
      "That is the highest figure since current recording practices began in 2003.",
      "Retail criminologist Prof Emmeline Taylor told the BBC she had seen similar trolley scales used in European supermarkets and there was \"definitely an element of trying to control loss\" but added \"let's not forget a lot of scan and go loss can be accidental\".",
      "A random audit of 20,000 scan and go baskets found 43% had at least one error, a 2022 global study on self-checkout found.",
      "Prof Taylor said Tesco's scales were \"quite foreboding and reminiscent of security scanners\".",
      "\"They don't want to give the impression that they are pointing the finger at their honest customer,\" she said.",
      "\"They will need to balance how they respond when there is a weight discrepancy because you can lose a customer for life if they feel they've been wrongly accused of something.\"",
      "She said she could see customers getting frustrated using the scales.",
      "\"You've left your handbag in the trolley, you've got to take your child out of the seat, you might be queueing behind someone who has been stopped and you can't get through so the trial needs to focus on minimising friction points in the customer experience.\"",
      "The scales are the latest example of supermarkets turning to technology to streamline time and costs. The ratio of self-scan to staffed tills continues to be fiercely debated. Some shoppers love the speed and convenience while others are fed up of hearing \"unexpected item in the bagging area\".",
      "In August upmarket north of England supermarket chain Booths got rid of self-scan altogether, while Asda and Morrisons said they would put more staff back on manned tills."

      "Mr Gunasekara's firm is currently building a larger version of its robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing claws.",
      "He adds that \"hundreds\" of such bots would need to harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to processing sites on land.",
      "Unlike some other methods, in which heavy subsea equipment is tethered to support ships, Impossible Metals' vessel would not have to remain in a precise spot for a long period, meaning its engines would not create as much noise. This would lessen the impact on wildlife, claims Mr Gunasekara.",
      "He also argues that deep-sea mining would reduce the need for mining on land: \"Anyone that doesn't want to do deep-sea mining is implicitly saying we need to do more land-based mining.\"",
      "Jovana Jovanova at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands is working on a different robot arm system that could gather metals from the seafloor. She stresses that those working in this field should seek to develop technology \"in sync\" with the environment.",
      "Some deep-sea materials might be removed using more invasive methods, however. Seabed Solutions, a Norwegian firm, is working on a saw-based device to extract mineral-containing crusts or layers. The company says it is trying to reduce the volume of sediment disturbed by this process.",
      "\"You shield the cutting area and you ensure that it is under pressure,\" says managing director B\u00e5rd Brekke J\u00f8rgensen. \"You have a suction head interface [on] your cutting tool.\"",
      "The Metals Company, a firm launched by former Nautilus Minerals investor Gerard Barron, is working on a different technique.",
      "Mr Barron, chief executive, is bullish about the company's prospects, despite the protests and lawsuits his firm has faced.  Among the problems is a class action lawsuit filed by investors over the company's reporting of proceeds from a partner company in 2023 -  Mr Barron says \"there's absolutely nothing in it\".",
      "Those calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining are \"virtue signalling\" he says, adding that the new Trump administration in the US may help his company.",
      "\"We have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration,\" says Mr Barron.",
      "The Metals Company intends to file an application for deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) later this year. The ISA is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities.",
      "Dutch company Allseas, which is working with Mr Barron's firm, has developed mining machinery for scooping polymetallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface.",
      "The Metals Company's own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of metres from the mining area, rather than many kilometres, and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time.",
      "Claims that sediment would be distributed many kilometres from the mining area were \"total nonsense\", says Mr Barron.",
      "Jeroen Hagelstein, a spokesman for Allseas, says his firm has adjusted the force of waterjets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimise sediment disturbance.",
      "Some sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean.  Mr Hagelstein says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometres rather than discarding it at the surface, though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact.",
      "Mr Barron acknowledges that his firm's machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules. \"If you're a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you, there will be an impact,\" he says. Though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind.",
      "Ann Vanreusel at Ghent University has studied deep-sea wildlife. She says the sought-after polymetallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures, which use them as a substrate. So even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance, pollution and noise, removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem.",
      "Dr Childs also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures. Mining could interfere with this, he suggests.",
      "And there's another issue. The market for metals metals sought by deep-sea mining firms is notoriously volatile, meaning the business case for deep-sea mining may not be as strong as some hope, says Lea Reitmeier at the London School of Economics.",

      "Despite submitting a claim for full financial redress more than a year ago, he died without receiving all the money he was owed.",
      "The government says it has doubled the amount of payments made to former sub-postmasters.",
      "Days after losing Terry, his widow Janet received a letter making an offer of compensation \u2013 far below the amount the couple had claimed.",
      "She describes the offer as a \"slap in the face\" and says it has prompted her to share their story publicly for the first time.",
      "\"Enough is enough,\" she said.",
      "Terry used his redundancy money to take over the Hockley Post Office in Stockport in 2005.",
      "But less than two years later, he was suspended for alleged shortfalls.",
      "He was never allowed back behind his counter again and his contract was terminated the following year for thousands of pounds of losses that didn't exist.",
      "He and Janet had to sell their home and have been living in rented accommodation ever since.",
      "\"To have a big institution such as the Post Office come along and accuse you of doing something \u2013 it was devastating,\" says Janet, \"and humiliating.\"",
      "Now, ahead of Terry's funeral, Janet has decided to share their story \u2013 and is urging the government to ensure quick payment to others who are still waiting for compensation.",

      "There are no official figures for how many victims have died before receiving full compensation but, according to The Times, the number had reached more than 250 by early 2024.",
      "Terry had received an interim payment, which Janet says helped them manage as his health declined. But she insists that Terry would have been \"over the moon\" had he lived to receive his full compensation. She believes that receiving the money in the years before Terry's health declined could have made a huge difference to their quality of life.",
      "\"We could have done the things we had wanted to do all these years, buy a proper home perhaps, treat ourselves to a nice holiday, go out and do things,\" she said.",
      "According to the most recent figures, in the scheme created to provide redress for those in the original Group Litigation Order (GLO), 227 of 492 eligible claimants are still waiting for full and final compensation.",
      "The government says 407 offers have been made of the 425 people who have so far made full claims.",
      "With so many others still waiting for their full compensation, Janet now says she is considering writing to King Charles.",

      "A Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said it had doubled redress payments under the current government and that it was making offers to 89% of GLO claimants within 40 days of receiving a full claim application.",
      "Over half of eligible claimants have now settled their claim, the spokesperson added.",

      "The funds will be stocked with coins forfeited to the federal government as part of criminal or civil proceedings.",
      "White House AI and crypto tsar David Sacks likened them to a \"a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency\", drawing comparison to the Kentucky military base that stores a significant portion of US gold assets.",
      "However, some crypto enthusiasts have criticised the government for not being bolder, while others have raised question marks about the lack of transparency over the process.",
      "Sacks has ordered a full accounting of the federal government's existing crypto reserves, which he estimated at 200,000 Bitcoin alone. That's worth $17.5bn (\u00a313.6bn) at today's prices.",

      "Jason Yanowitz, Co-Founder of crypto firm Blockworks, agrees with the idea of a Bitcoin reserve but says the inclusion of other coins sets a \"horrible precedent\" and \"makes no sense.\"",

      "Other analysts though have been more positive.",
      "\"This approach makes much more sense than buying the assets,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.",
      "\"It would surely be bizarre for the US to sell dollars to buy crypto, when the dollar is the globe's reserve currency and therefore a source of enormous influence.\"",
      "'Won't cost a dime'",
      "Further details are expected when the president speaks to the first crypto summit at the White House.",
      "It is unclear how a crypto reserve would benefit Americans, but Sacks told reporters it \"will not cost taxpayers a dime\".",
      "It is also unclear whether the planned reserve could face legal hurdles, or if it might require an act of Congress.",
      "The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited in the reserve, said Sacks, and will instead keep it as an asset. While the reserve will exclusively contain Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies will go into a separate stockpile.",
      "His implication that the US government would not buy Bitcoin led prices of the world's largest cryptocurrency to fall by more than 5%.",

      "But experts have warned that trade barriers could hurt the US, triggering higher prices and more inflation, as well as hitting economies around the world.",
      "Separately, Bailey also warned of risks should the US leave institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which lend to countries to try to avert financial crises.",
      "Some of Trump's allies, including key White House staff, have previously recommended withdrawing.",

    "story": [
      "The UK competition watchdog has ended its investigation into the partnership between Microsoft and the maker of ChatGPT, OpenAI.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) was looking into whether Microsoft's relationship with what is the world's best known artificial intelligence (AI) firm changed after the turmoil which saw its boss Sam Altman fired and then rehired.",
      "The CMA has concluded that, despite Microsoft investing billions of dollars into OpenAI and having exclusive uses of some of its AI products, the partnership remains the same, so is not subject to review under the UK's merger rules.",
      "Digital rights campaigners, Foxglove, said it showed the CMA had been \"defanged.\"",
      "The CMA opened the probe in December 2023, after Microsoft had put pressure on OpenAI to re-employ Mr Altman, days after he had been sacked.",
      "\"In view of Microsoft's potentially important role in securing Sam Altman's re-appointment, the CMA believed there was a reasonable chance that an investigation would reveal that Microsoft had increased its control over OpenAI's commercial policy,\" the watchdog said.",
      "But on Wednesday, it concluded Microsoft \"exerts a high level of material influence\" over OpenAI's commercial policy without fully controlling it.",
      "\"Because this change of control has not happened, the partnership in its current form does not qualify for review under the UK's merger control regime,\" CMA Executive Director for Mergers Joel Bamford posted in an article on LinkedIn.",
      "But he added: \"The CMA's findings on jurisdiction should not be read as the partnership being given a clean bill of health on potential competition concerns; but the UK merger control regime must of course operate within the remit set down by Parliament.\"",
      "'Nothing to see here'",
      "Critics though say the decision is linked to the changed political environment the CMA is now operating in.",
      "The government has instructed the country's regulators to suggest ways of stimulating economic growth.",
      "In January, the government removed the then chair of the CMA, Marcus Bokkerink, because it was unhappy with his response to that call.",
      "He was replaced on an interim basis by Doug Gurr, former boss of Amazon UK.",
      "\"The CMA has sat on this decision for over a year, yet within just a few weeks of a former Amazon boss being installed as chair, it has decided everything was absolutely fine all along, nothing to see here,\" said Foxglove co-executive director Rosa Curling.",
      "\"This is a bad sign that Big Tech has successfully convinced the prime minister to defang our competition regulator and let Big Tech gobble up the current generation of cutting-edge tech \u2013 just like they did the last one,\" she told the BBC.",
      "When BBC News contacted the CMA for a response to these comments, they pointed us to Mr Bamford's LinkedIn post, where he said: \"We are not blind to the length of time that this investigation has taken... We know pace matters to business confidence and investment.\"",
      "He added the reason this investigation took so long was because the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI had been changing over that time.",
      "In 2024, while Mr Bokkerink was chair, the CMA also issued similar \"found not to qualify\" decisions on other AI partnerships it reviewed involving firms including Microsoft, Amazon and Google.",
      "In April of same year, the CMA's chief executive Sarah Cardell said the body had \"real concerns\" about an \"interconnected web\" of AI partnerships between big tech firms.",
      "But in a set of instructions to the CMA issued in February, the government said it should prioritise \"pro-growth and pro-investment interventions\".",
      "The same month the UK sided with the US in not signing an agreement on AI at a summit in Paris.",
      "US Vice President JD Vance had told delegates that too much regulation of AI could \"kill a transformative industry just as it's taking off\".",
      "\"The CMA will be taking a less interventionist approach to protecting competition and to merger control reviews, [but] this does not mean the CMA will approve every deal presented to it without question,\" said Chloe Birkett, competition lawyer at  law firm Freeths.",
      "\"The CMA's purpose is to help preserve competition in markets to ensure that consumers get a fair deal,\" she said.",
      "In a statement Microsoft said: \"Our OpenAI partnership and its continued evolution promote competition, innovation, and responsible AI development, and we welcome the CMA's conclusion, after careful and prudent consideration of the commercial realities, to close its investigation.\"",

      "Not directly, of course. Rather, it was the two Nordic nations' response to the invasion that turned fear into hope.",
      "Both countries applied for membership of the Western defence alliance Nato in May 2022, some three months after the winter invasion.",
      "Less than three years later, they're both full members and already reaping the benefits, in terms of both national security and economics.",
      "\"We're no longer a country that cannot be trusted,\" observes Micael Johansson, chief executive of Swedish defence company Saab, in reference to the nation's previous historic neutrality.",
      "He points out that in the year since Sweden joined Nato in March 2024, Saab has already negotiated framework agreements with the Nato Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA). The NSPA is the body that organises Nato's ordering from defence firms.",
      "Mr Johansson adds it is now much easier to gain insights into what's going on inside the alliance. \"We couldn't access NSPAs before,\" he says.",
      "Jukka Siukosaari, Finland's Ambassador to the UK, agrees. \"Being part of Nato brings us on an equal footing with all the other allies. It enlarges the possibilities for Finnish companies in the defence sector and beyond.\"",
      "Private companies will benefit from pledges by Nato member states to increase defence spending.",
      "Presently, only 23 of the organisation's 32 member states currently meet a defence spending target of 2% of GDP, but ambitions have grown in recent months, only to surge in recent weeks and days amidst plenty of turbulence within the alliance.",
      "Amidst uncertainty about what Nato might look like in future, there is no doubt that these higher spending commitments will remain and perhaps even strengthen if Europe was to decide it could no longer rely on the USA.",
      "Nato's newest members' spending commitments are already ahead of those expressed by several existing members. Last year, Finland spent 2.4% and Sweden 2.2% of their respective GDP on defence, and both aim to raise this to between 2.6% and 3% in the next three years.",
      "Examples of new Nato initiatives on Europe's northern flank include the establishment of new Nato bases, and efforts to establish joint defence forces, in northern Finland.",
      "Plus the formation of The Joint Nordic Air Command, which brings together Finland's, Sweden's, Norway's and Denmark's 250 front-line combat aircraft under a joined up command structure, with flexible basing and backed by shared intelligence.",

      "Aerial surveillance programmes and underwater systems are also increasingly in demand as the returning tension between Russia and the West brings a new chill to the Arctic region.",
      "In these areas Saab's boss is eager to promote its own solutions, such as the GlobalEye airborne early warning and control platform, and its Sea Wasp, a remotely-controlled underwater vehicle that can neutralise explosive devices.",
      "Yet given Donald Trump's strong emphasis on \"America first\", it is unlikely that he will be happy with European Nato members choosing Saab, or indeed any other European defence firm over US rivals.",
      "Europe will need to balance its desire to reduce its reliance on the US with its obvious need to retain American support.",
      "European members will also need to consider Nato's defence systems' complexities and interdependencies. They often combine technologies and machines, weaponry and ammunition, vehicles, crafts and vessels, that are produced in several different Nato countries.",
      "In a sense, then, the alliance is held together by complex supply chains and contractual agreements that could not possibly be untangled overnight.",
      "\"Europe's Trans-Atlantic relationship will always remain important,\" says Mr Johansson, though he also points to a \"growing realisation in Europe that we have to do more on our own\".",

      "Finnish government agency Business Finland has published a guidebook that offers advice to companies on how to do business with Nato.",
      "Its authors predict that the armed forces on both sides of the Atlantic will have \"significant new needs for services and equipment, both hi-tech and low-tech\".",
      "Many of these needs will need to be met by start-ups and established small to medium-sized companies, says the guide, rather than exclusively by large, established defence companies.",
      "Johan Sj\u00f6berg, security and defence policy advisor at the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, says Nato membership has opened doors for Swedish companies, not least because \"the perspective of other countries and companies [towards them] has changed\".",
      "Mr Sj\u00f6berg adds that he favours a \"holistic view, that security is good for business, as increased security and stability provide long-term credibility\".",
      "In Finland too, Nato membership has created new opportunities, especially for the plethora of small and medium-sized companies that Ambassador Siukosaari refer to as \"Nokia-spin-offs\".",
      "These are expected to increasingly provide cutting edge tech, such as drones, sensors and digital surveillance systems for programmes such as the Norway-to-Poland \"drone wall\" that six Nato members are developing to defend their borders with Russia.",
      "Indeed, as the nature of warfare changes, Europe's security may increasingly rely on cyber-defence and the protection of civilian installations such as systems-critical seabed pipelines and cables.",
      "But perhaps the most revolutionary idea to emerge from Nato's Nordic expansion is the region's \"Total Defence\" concept.",
      "Also applied by Norway and Denmark, it considers national infrastructure such as the internet and telephony, energy generation and distribution, road networks, and secure supplies of food, medicine as parts of a total defence system.",
      "Much of this may not be registered as defence spending in the statistics, but at the same time, none of it is free.",
      "Beyond the civilian infrastructure spending, national military service, for instance, sometimes takes people away from the economically productive parts of the economy, Ambassador Siukosaari points out.",
      "But perhaps what they deliver does more for the nation than mere provision of products and services?",

    "summary": "From handheld to space-based, new methane detectors are making it easier to track the greenhouse gas.",
    "story": [
      "In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is.",
      "They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies.",
      "But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen.",
      "Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes.",
      "A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma.",
      "Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation.",
      "\"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says.",
      "Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas.",
      "While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation.",
      "Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture.",
      "But methane is not always easy to notice.",
      "It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light.",
      "Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful.",
      "\"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative.",
      "There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities.",
      "Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says.",
      "At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms.",
      "Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions.",
      "He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view.",
      "With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs.",
      "Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges.",
      "Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover.",
      "\"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible.",
      "Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November.",
      "It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding.",
      "Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\"",
      "It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring.",
      "Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well.",
      "For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes.",
      "In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts.",
      "Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS.",
      "In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses.",
      "However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback.",
      "And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. \"I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year.\"",
      "At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. \"Now that we know better, we can do better,\" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light.",

      "The world is a very insecure place right now - conflict, climate change, and fears of recession dominate the headlines. But for some people, things are going rather well - the wealthy.",
      "Despite the global turmoil, the number of billionaires in the world is growing and the personal wealth of each of them is increasing too.",
      "So what to do with all that money? The growing trend for the ultimate luxury experience is a clue as to what the very rich are doing with their cash. For the tourist industry in particular, it's an opportunity.",
      "In Switzerland, which has long cultivated a reputation for understated luxury, the number of five-star hotels is increasing faster than any other category. Many of them were built in the early 20th century - grand belle epoque palaces serving a then emerging class of privileged, primarily English tourists.",
      "Today, renovated to the highest standards, those hotels leave no guest's wish unmet. There are luxury spas, gourmet restaurants, and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps. Some offer \"ski butlers\" to ferry guests to and from the slopes, carry the skis, and even help put on their boots.",
      "Key markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night.",
      "Meanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend.",
      "But the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures.",
      "Stays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8% of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25% of Switzerland's total revenue from tourism.",
      "\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" says Mr Berger. \"The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests.\"",
      "What's more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong.",
      "\"Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices,\" Mr Berger explains. \"There is always somewhere cheaper.\"",
      "Instead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts.",
      "But it's not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerland's most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market.",
      "A common challenge is finding accommodation for the hundreds of hotel and restaurant staff needed to provide the five-star service.",
      "They sometimes find themselves commuting, late at night when the cocktail bars and restaurants have finally closed, long journeys to other villages where the accommodation is affordable on a waiter's salary.",
      "Monika Bandi, who leads the Tourism Research Unit at Bern University's Centre for Regional Development, sees Switzerland's pitch to high-end guests as a fine balancing act. It's about \"quantity versus quality\", she says.",
      "More tourists aren't necessarily better, she believes. Instead, higher spending by existing numbers can be positive.",
      "And, she adds, Switzerland needs to watch out for the \"tipping point, where the destinations really lose their character\".",
      "Questions about a tipping point are currently being asked in the resort of Wengen, world famous for its Lauberhorn ski race, and its decades long connection with British skiers \u2013 the much-loved \"Down Hill Only\" ski club celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.",
      "And also this year, Wengen is opening its first ever five-star hotel, and there are plans too for a five-star complex of serviced \"hotel apartments\". They will be sold to wealthy tourists who want a luxury holiday home in the Alps, and they can also be rented out when the owners are absent.",
      "By calling the project a hotel, it exploits a loophole in Switzerland's strict laws against the \"cold beds\" of holiday homes. In theory, the law limits them to no more than 20% of a resort's accommodation.",
      "The Swiss Heritage Society has formally objected to the Wengen plans, because, claims spokesman Simon Weiss, the project is not really a hotel. \"It looks like a typical holiday home complex\u2026 there is no integration into the community.\"",
      "The required public spaces that a hotel would have \u2013 a restaurant and a spa \u2013 are planned, but they will all be underground. The design priority, Mr Weiss fears, is for private luxury apartments that may be occupied for only a few weeks a year. \"The design is unacceptable,\" he adds.",
      "Some Wengen locals also have their doubts. \"It's not St Moritz here,\" one told Swiss media, adding \"Wengen is not posh\".",
      "Wengen's tourism director Rolf Wegm\u00fcller agrees with that assessment, but says the trend towards luxury accommodation won't change the resort's character. \"We're not going to have guests walking around in fur coats all of a sudden,\" he says.",
      "Wengen, he points out, is only accessible by train, so, unlike St Moritz, there will be no Bentleys or Rolls-Royces taking up parking spaces. Even if they could ostentatiously display their wealth, Mr Wegm\u00fcller believes \"our guests won't want to show off what they have\".",
      "The resort also has visitors who come back year after year, contributing to the integration Mr Weiss worries about losing. \"Some families have been coming for generations,' says Mr Wegm\u00fcller. 'The locals know them, and that's good.\"",
      "Among them are Brian Bollen, keen member of the Down Hill Only Club, who has been coming to Wengen for more than 50 years. He loves it, but does worry that some of \"the charm has gone from the place\u2026 it's over built\".",
      "But most in Wengen, like Switzerland Tourism, see the investment in the alpine resorts as positive. These villages were, not much more than a century ago, very poor. A 19th English guide to the Swiss alps wrote that \"most of the children are beggars\".",
      "In more recent years, the global trade rules limiting agricultural subsidies have forced many small alpine dairy farms to close. Tourism, winter and summer, is enormously important for the Swiss economy, especially for the mountain communities.",
      "And, as Mr Berger of Switzerland Tourism points out, while the five-star sector is growing, three-star hotels are still the biggest category. \"We have one to five-star [in Wengen],\" adds Mr Wegm\u00fcller. \"That's a good thing in a resort.\"",
      "And while the people with unlimited money to spend on luxury travel may still be in a tiny minority, their numbers, and their wealth, are growing. Switzerland's approach \u2013 not cheaper, but better, not more people, just richer \u2013 seems to be paying off.",

      "Ukraine has 7% of Europe's supplies of titanium, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations.",

      "For instance, the country's sizeable lithium deposits are still largely untapped. Likewise, rare earth deposits are known to exist, but none of them have yet been mined, because of a lack of investment.",

      "\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\"",

      "Critics of the programme said its success was limited, but some academics and MPs have described it as a \"tragedy\" for young people from less privileged backgrounds.",

      "At Keswick School in Cumbria, the subject is studied after hours as an extra option.",
      "For the last 10 years it has been taught to GCSE level by Marcella Jackson who said it is not just for the academic elite.",

      "She said that means many pupils studying in the shadow of Hadrian's Wall are missing out on the benefits of Latin.",
      "'Unlock literacy'",
      "During a seven-year research project, Prof Holmes-Henderson discovered Latin study made the most difference to children from disadvantaged backgrounds.",

      "\"All three groups, who face barriers to their learning, unlocked significant benefits in English literacy.\"",
      "Durham Johnston School's Latin teacher Cathy Bothwell said helping the disadvantaged is the reason the school has persevered with the subject.",
      "She said: \"Despite the cost of offering the subject, it is that social justice aspect.",
      "\"We have a very varied demographic and providing everyone with access to demanding academic subjects like Latin is a key part of that.\"",
      "There is another divide too.",
      "A British Society study in 2020 found that while only 3% of state schools offered Latin at Key Stage 3, that figure rose to 49% in the fee-paying sector.",
      "Only two of the region's schools - Polam Hall in Darlington, and Queen Elizabeth Grammar in Hexham - had taken advantage of the 2022 government Latin programme, but one of a group of MPs working to promote the study of the classics is determined the current government does not give up on Latin in state schools.",
      "York Central's Rachael Maskell, who is a Labour member of the All Party Parliamentary Classics Group, said it would be a tragedy if the subject does end up purely in the private sector.",
      "She said: \"Giving young people from less privileged backgrounds access is really important.",
      "\"We cannot have the whole classics agenda being in the hands of the few, so let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater and [instead] ensure there is something there for the benefit of classical education across the UK.\"",
      "'Latin is for everyone'",
      "A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"The \u00a322bn black hole we inherited means tough decisions are needed across the public sector.\"",
      "The department said it had \"worked with Classics for All and the Classical Association so teachers at the 39 schools on the Latin Excellence Programme can continue to benefit from high quality teacher training, and so that the small number of pupils in those schools who are due to sit their Latin GCSE this summer get the support they need\".",
      "Prof Holmes-Henderson's message was \"nil desperandum\" - do not despair.",
      "She said there were alternative sources of funding for a subject that is still part of the national curriculum and the region can still be at the heart of Latin's revival.",
      "\"Durham University has the only research centre in the world dedicated to classics education research, engaging multiple stakeholders on how we can widen access to the teaching of the subject in our schools and communities.",

      "Ms Arakawa, 65, died in the same house from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Her cause of death was listed as natural.",
      "Authorities believe she passed away about seven days before her husband, to whom she had been married for more than 30 years. During his career, Hackman won two Academy Awards for The French Connection and Unforgiven.",
      "It is likely that Ms Arakawa died first on 11 February, Dr Heather Jarrell of the New Mexico Medical Investigator's Office told a news conference on Friday.",
      "She said it was \"reasonable to conclude\" that Hackman had died on 18 February.",
      "Ms Arakawa's last known movements and correspondence were on 11 February, when she was seen going to a grocery store, a CVS pharmacy and a pet store, before returning home in the early evening.",
      "Given that Hackman was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", said Dr Jarrell.",
      "She told reporters she was \"not aware of his normal daily functioning capability\".",
      "Gene Hackman loved acting but 'hated everything that went with it'",
      "Gene Hackman loved acting but 'hated everything that went with it'",
      "Hackman had \"significant heart disease, and ultimately that's what resulted in his death\", Dr Jarrell said, adding that he had had chronic high blood pressure.",
      "He had not eaten anything recently, but had shown no indications of dehydration, she added.",
      "At the news conference, New Mexico Public Health Veterinarian Erin Phipps emphasised that hantavirus infections were extremely rare.",
      "HPS is transmitted through contact with rodent droppings, urine or saliva, often when contaminated dust is inhaled.",
      "She noted that 136 cases had been reported in the state over the past 50 years, with 42% resulting in fatalities.",
      "Dr Phipps said evidence of rodent activity had been found in some buildings on the property, though the risk inside the main house was considered \"low\".",
      "Investigators are trying to determine how Ms Arakawa contracted the illness. Hackman tested negative for hantavirus.",
      "The couple were found in their home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through the window.",
      "The remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition.",
      "Hackman's body was in a sideroom next to the kitchen, with a walking cane and a pair of sunglasses nearby, according to a search warrant affidavit.",
      "Ms Arakawa's body was in the bathroom, with scattered pills close to her.",
      "Sheriff's deputies found medication for thyroid and blood pressure treatment, along with pain reliever Tylenol, according to a court-filed inventory.",
      "Citing privacy laws, authorities did not disclose who had been prescribed the drugs.",
      "One of the couple's three dogs was also found dead inside a crate near Ms Arakawa, while the other two dogs were alive.",
      "The cause of death for the dog is yet to be determined, officials say. Dr Phipps told reporters that dogs did not get sick from hantavirus.",
      "Initial investigations found no signs of forced entry or foul play at the couple's $3.8m (\u00a33m) home. Tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative, and no significant gas leaks were detected.",
      "Hackman is survived by three adult children from his previous marriage.",
      "Hackman met Ms Arakawa when she was working part-time at a California gym in the mid-1980s, the New York Times has previously reported.",
      "He won best actor Oscar for his role as Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in William Friedkin's 1971 thriller The French Connection, and another for best supporting actor for playing Little Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood's Western film Unforgiven in 1992.",
      "A relative latecomer to Hollywood, Hackman saw his breakthrough come in his thirties, when he was nominated for an Oscar for portraying Buck Barrow in 1967's Bonnie and Clyde - opposite Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway - and again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970.",
      "Both films saw him recognised in the supporting actor category. He was also nominated for best leading actor in 1988 for playing an FBI agent in Mississippi Burning.",
      "He played more than 100 roles during his career, including supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s.",
      "Hackman featured opposite many other Hollywood heavyweights including Al Pacino in 1973's Scarecrow and Gene Wilder in 1974's Young Frankenstein.",
      "His last big-screen appearance came as Monroe Cole in Welcome to Mooseport in 2004, after which he stepped back from Hollywood for a quieter life in New Mexico."

      "And with all three members of the group having a background in musical theatre, they know more than most about how to put on a show.",

      "To break out of the rut needs a roll of the dice and Holly-Anne says \"we were a real risk\".",
      "Not least because they hadn't even written their entry when they found out they'd be representing the country.",
      "\"That was really scary - finding out we got it and we were like: 'But what do we sing?'\"",

      "Rather than a public vote, the entry was chosen by a team made up of UK record labels, publishers, songwriters, BBC Music and BBC Introducing.",
      "They worked closely with Sam Ryder's manager, David May, in the hope he could find another contender for the top spot.",
      "Since Remember Monday were unveiled as the UK entry, reaction has been largely positive on social media, but after a difficult few years in the competition there is some scepticism too.",

      "\"We started posting in lockdown and when we came out we put on a gig, our first one in a long time, and it sold out in like 24 hours.\"",
      "They thought it was their families who \"spent a lot of money on tickets\".",

    "story": [
      "No-one wants to be alone, and no job is more isolating than being a pop star.",
      "Just ask Lady Gaga.",
      "Her rise to fame in 2009-10 was unlike anything we'd seen before. One of the first pop stars to harness the power of the internet, she seemed to exist in a permanent onslaught of TMZ photos and gossip blogs.",
      "Their appetite was voracious. She wore through so many looks and sounds in the space of three years that one critic wrote she was \"speed-running Madonna's entire career\".",
      "And as her fame grew, the headlines became more unhinged. She staged a satanic ritual in a London hotel... She was secretly a hermaphrodite... She planned to saw her own leg off \"for fashion\".",
      "When she attended the 2010 MTV Awards in a dress made entirely of meat, nobody seemed to get the joke: Gaga was presenting herself as fodder for the tabloids, there to be consumed.",
      "On stage, she was an object of worship for her fans, the Little Monsters. But anyone who isn't a megalomaniac knows that that sort of adulation is a distant illusion.",
      "\"I'm alone, Brandon. Every night,\" Gaga told her stylist in the 2017 documentary, Five Foot Two.",
      "\"I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence.\"",
      "Now 38, and happily engaged to tech entrepreneur Michael Polansky, Gaga admits that those years of solitude scared her.",
      "\"I think my biggest fear was doing this by myself - doing life on my own,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"And I think that the greatest gift has been meeting my partner, Michael, and being in the mayhem with him.\"",
      "The couple have been together since 2020, and revealed their engagement at the Venice Film Festival last September - where Gaga wore her million-dollar engagement ring in public for the first time.",
      "In person, it's dazzling, with a huge, oval-cut diamond set on a 18-karat white and rose gold diamond pav\u00e9 band.",
      "But on her other hand, Gaga sports a smaller, more understated ring, featuring a few blades of grass set in resin. It turns out that this is the really special one.",
      "\"Michael actually proposed to me with these blades of grass,\" she reveals.",
      "\"A long time ago, we were in the back yard, and he asked me, 'If I ever proposed to you, like, how do I do that?'",
      "\"And I just said, 'Just get a blade of grass from the back yard and wrap it around my finger and that will make me so happy'.\"",
      "It was a deeply romantic gesture that came tinged with sadness. Gaga's back yard in Malibu had previously played host to the wedding of her close friend, Sonja Durham, shortly before she died of cancer in 2017.",
      "\"There was so much loss, but this happy thing was happening for me,\" she recalls of Polansky's proposal.",
      "\"To get engaged at 38... I was thinking about what it took to get to this moment.\"",
      "Those feelings ultimately informed a song on her new album, Mayhem.",
      "Called (naturally) Blade of Grass, it finds the star singing about a \"lovers' kiss in a garden made of thorns\", and the promise of love in a time of darkness.",
      "She calls it a \"thank you\" to her partner. And fans might have a reason to thank him, too.",
      "Mayhem marks Gaga's full throttle return to pop, after a period where she'd been preoccupied with her film career, and spin-off albums that dabbled in jazz and the classic American songbook.",
      "Speaking to Vogue last year, the singer revealed it was her fianc\u00e9 who'd nudged her in that direction.",
      "\"He was like, 'Babe. I love you. You need to make pop music',\" she said.",
      "\"On the Chromatica tour, I saw a fire in her,\" Polansky added. \"I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy.\"",
      "'Angriest song'",
      "With that approach, the album goes right back to the sucker-punch sound of Gaga's early hits like Poker Face, Just Dance and Born This Way.",
      "On the latest single, Abracadabra, she even revisits the \"roma-ma-ma\" gibberish of Bad Romance \u2013 although this time there's a reference to death, as she sings, \"morta-ooh-Gaga\".",
      "In the album's artwork, her face is reflected in a broken mirror. In the videos, she squares off against earlier versions of herself.",
      "There's an overwhelming sense that the artist Stefani Germanotta is reckoning with the stage persona she created.",
      "It all comes to a head on a track called Perfect Celebrity where she sings, \"I became a notorious being\" \u2013 a lyric that, like the meat dress before it, strips away her humanity.",
      "\"That's probably the most angry song about fame I've ever written,\" she says.",
      "\"I'd created this public persona that I was truly becoming in every way - and holding the duality of that, knowing where I begin and Lady Gaga ends, was really a challenge.",
      "\"It kind of took me down.\"",
      "How did she reconcile the public and private sides of her life?",
      "\"I think what I actually realised is that it's healthier to not have a dividing line and to integrate those two things into one whole human being,\" she says.",
      "\"The healthiest thing for me was owning that I'm a female artist and that living an artistic life was my choice.",
      "\"I am a lover of songwriting. I'm a lover of making music, of rehearsing, choreography, stage production, costumes, lighting, putting on a show.",
      "\"That is what it means to be Lady Gaga. It's the artist behind it all.\"",
      "In previous interviews, the musician has spoken of how she dissociated from Lady Gaga. For a time, she believed the character was responsible for all her success, and she had contributed nothing.",
      "Mayhem marks the moment where she reclaims ownership of her music, not just from \"Lady Gaga\" but from other producers and writers in her orbit.",
      "\"When I was younger, people tried take credit for my sound, or my image [but] all of my references, all of my imagination of what pop music could be, came from me.",
      "\"So I really wanted to revisit my earlier inspirations and my career and own it as my invention, for once and for all.\"",
      "From the outset, it was obvious that Gaga was excited about this new phase.",
      "Last summer, after performing at the Olympics opening ceremony, she took to the streets of Paris and played early demos of her new music to fans who'd gathered outside her hotel.",
      "It was a spur of the moment decision, yet it marked another effort to restore the spontaneity of her early career.",
      "\"This has been something I've done for almost 20 years, where I played my fans my music way before it came out,\" she says.",
      "\"I used to, after my shows, invite fans backstage, and we'd hang out and I'd play them demos and see what they thought of the music.",
      "\"I'm sure you can imagine that after 20 years, you don't expect that people are still going to show up to hear your music and be excited to see you. So, I just wanted to share it with them, because I was excited that they were there.\"",
      "As an interviewer, this is a full-circle moment for me, too. I last interviewed Lady Gaga in 2009, as Just Dance hit number one in the UK.",
      "Back then, she was giddy with excitement, chatting enthusiastically about her love of John Lennon, calling herself a \"heroin addict\" for English tea, and promising to email me an MP3 of Blueberry Kisses \u2013 an unreleased song that is, quite brilliantly, about performing a sex act while your breath smells of blueberry flavoured coffee.",
      "Over the years, I've seen her interviews become more guarded. She'd wear outrageous costumes or jet-black sunglasses, deliberately putting a barrier between her and the journalist.",
      "But the Gaga I meet in New York is the same one I spoke to 16 years ago: comfortable with herself, and brimming with enthusiasm.",
      "She puts that ease down to \"growing up and living a full life\".",
      "\"Being there for my friends, being there for my family, meeting my amazing fianc\u00e9 - all of these things made me a whole person, instead of the most important thing being my stage persona.\"",
      "With an air of finality, she adds: \"I wanted Mayhem to have an ending. I wanted the chaos to stop.",

      "The modern adaptation of Shakespeare's play was halted in a dispute over its references to the Israel-Gaza war and transgender rights, just before it was due to start a five-week run in September.",
      "An independent review criticised the theatre's leadership but concluded \"management's actions did not constitute censorship\".",

      "He added: \"I wish to make it clear that this is my decision, and mine alone.",
      "\"More needs to be done to support relationships between artists and institutions. This is where our collective power exists to make a real difference in the world, and I want to focus my attention on this area in the future.\"",

      "Previews cancelled",
      "The Manchester Evening News first reported how the row broke out following an internal preview when it emerged the production included a song which referred to transgender rights and the phrase \"free Palestine\".",
      "Further previews were cancelled and postponed, with theatre management citing injury to a cast member and technical difficulties, before the entire run was cancelled some days later, the paper reported.",
      "Director Stef O'Driscoll later told theatre publication The Stage that executive staff stated the production could not go on unless the phrases \"trans rights\" and \"Free Palestine\" were removed.",
      "She said there was \"a lack of proper and rigorous artistic support\", adding: \"As artists, we are losing the very spaces that are meant to challenge, provoke and speak to the issues of our time.\"",
      "Theatre apology",
      "The theatre then commissioned an independent review by cultural organisation People Make It Work, which concluded there was a \"failure to maintain robust support\".",
      "It said: \"The theatre has a history of producing bold, brave and ambitious work but its handling of A Midsummer Night's Dream revealed significant systemic organisational and leadership failures rather than the deliberate suppression of political content.\"",
      "\"A lack of senior artistic leadership and properly-documented producing processes created conditions where legitimate concerns about artistic developments in the production became entangled with allegations of censorship.\"",
      "Responding, the theatre's board said it \"takes full responsibility for these failings\" and \"apologises to all those involved in the production, whose work was not able to be seen, as well as to staff and audiences for these shortcomings\".",
      "The board's statement also said it wanted to thank Mr Freeman \"for his commitment and passion for the Royal Exchange Theatre, its programme and its people\".",

      "Bulgarians guilty of spying for Russia in the UK",
      "How spy ring did Russia's dirty work from the UK",
      "In December 2020, on the day that investigative group Bellingcat published its expos\u00e9 on the Navalny poisoning, the man who directed the Russian spy cell sent a message saying: \"We'd be interested in a Bulgarian guy working for Bellingcat Christo Grozev.\"",
      "Jan Marsalek, who instructed the spy ring on behalf of the Russian intelligence services, wrote that Grozev was the \"lead investigator in the Navalny case\".",
      "His friend and fellow target Dobrokhotov said this was the moment when they became a major focus, as Putin was so disturbed by what had been revealed.",
      "\"I think that it was Putin directly,\" he said.",
      "\"In this dictatorship, you would never take responsibility on your own to do such a political stuff. You will always have a direct order from the president.\"",
      "A message sent by Marsalek to fellow spy Orlin Roussev - who ran the UK-based group from a former guest house in Norfolk - demonstrated inside knowledge of Putin's thinking. He wrote: \"Personally I find Grozev not to be a very valuable target but apparently Putin seriously hates him.\"",
      "After 2020, the spy cell followed Grozev and Dobrokhotov throughout Europe, spying on them on aeroplanes, in hotels and in private properties.",
      "They discussed kidnapping and even killing the men. There was talk of smuggling Dobrokhotov out of the UK in a small boat from the Norfolk coast, after which he would be taken back to Russia.",
      "Dobrokhotov said it was clear this would have resulted in his death.",
      "It was in January 2023, the month before police arrested members of the cell in the UK, that Dobrokhotov said he was \"warned that I shouldn't leave the country because it can be dangerous\".",
      "He had not realised that he was being followed by the Bulgarian spies, who got so near to him on one flight that they saw the Pin code for his mobile phone.",
      "He thinks the police action sends a signal.",
      "\"Vladimir Putin doesn't understand messages in words, only in actions,\" Dobrokhotov said.",
      "\"So he understands messages like, for example, Ukraine got long-range missiles. That's a message that he can understand.",
      "\"And when his spies are arrested and imprisoned for a big sentence, that's also a message that he can understand.\"",
      "He thinks the use of Bulgarians working in normal jobs shows the limits of Russian espionage after so many professional spies were expelled from the West, but that spy cells like the Bulgarian one are no less dangerous.",
      "Speaking about what motivates him, Dobrokhotov said he wants \"to change Russia\" because he does not want to live in a country that \"kills people just because they're doing journalism or because they are criticising the government\".",
      "He said that \"while we are existing, it is very difficult for Vladimir Putin to feel strength inside the country\" and that \"we will be someone who he will try to eliminate for the rest of his life\".",
      "\"We're in a situation that only some of us will survive, either we or Vladimir Putin and his team.\"",
      "On Friday Vanya Gaberova, 30, Katrin Ivanova, 33, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, were found guilty of conspiracy to spy, while Roussev, 47, and Biser Dzhambazov, 43, had previously admitted the same charge. A sixth Bulgarian, Ivan Stoyanov, 34, pled guilty to spying. Ivanova was also convicted of possessing multiple false identity documents."

      "They described him as \"highly influential and sought after as a music collaborator.\"",

    "story": [
      "A police force \"acted reasonably\" during a hate crime investigation into a social media post by the Daily Telegraph journalist Allison Pearson, a report states.",
      "The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) looked into Essex Police's actions after Pearson claimed she felt \"bullied and threatened\" when officers visited the columnist's home on Remembrance Sunday in November 2024.",
      "The force has previously defended its since-dropped investigation over an allegation that a social media post, about the Hamas-Israel conflict, incited racial hatred.",
      "Responding on X, Ms Pearson accused Essex Police of \"marking their own homework in my case which was widely viewed as utterly outrageous\".",
      "In his findings, Mark Hobrough, the NPCC's hate crime lead and chief constable of Gwent, said footage from a body-worn camera showed the investigating officer's approach to Pearson was \"polite and carried out in an exemplary manner\".",
      "The original investigation was sparked by a complaint by a member of the public that a social media post in the early weeks of the Middle East conflict contained critical remarks about the police.",
      "\"The posted image was likely to mislead the reader into thinking this was from a pro-Palestine rally, whether intended to do so, or unintentionally so,\" the report said.",

      "It added: \"Invited to pose for a photo with lovely peaceful British Friends of Israel on Saturday police refused. Look at this lot smiling with the Jew haters.\"",
      "X added a notice to the post stating that the image was taken in Manchester, not London, and that it was \"not related to Palestine\".",
      "The report, which redacts Pearson's name, stated an officer went to her home and on his recording of the discussion \"clearly states he is there to try to arrange a voluntary attendance interview, to assist the investigation into a complaint of inciting racial hatred\".",
      "Pearson \"began to challenge the officer's actions\", the report adds.",
      "\"She implied that a complaint would be made to the Chief Constable by the Telegraph newspaper.\"",
      "The timing of the visit, early on a Sunday morning, could be judged inconsiderate, but the officer had already made a previous, unanswered visit and was \"diligently trying to conduct his workload\", the report added.",
      "\"Our view is that the officer's behaviour during this interaction was exemplary,\" the report adds.",
      "\"He did not become defensive or challenging and remained calm and polite throughout the interaction.\"",
      "The home visit was reported in the media, the report adds, with much of the reporting referring to as a \"non-crime hate incident\", \"despite a clear explanation [from the officer] that he was investigating an incident or offence of potentially inciting racial hatred online.\"",
      "The report praised Essex Police for the way it supported officers and its \"valiant attempt to maintain public confidence\" with its own media releases.",
      "'Totally outrageous'",
      "Pearson did not attend the voluntary police interview and the case was closed when the CPS concluded there was not a realistic prospect of conviction for the offence of stirring up racial hatred under the Public Order Act or the Communications Act.",
      "The report noted that the force, on reviewing the CPS decision, concluded that no crime had been committed.",
      "\"We do not take the view that a crime did not take place,\" the report states, \"rather that there was no realistic prospect of conviction based on the evidence available.\"",
      "The NPCC found Essex Police \"acted reasonably\" in its handling of the complaint but the force should have had a \"more active approach\" in categorising the crime, to avoid ambiguity.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme soon after the case was discontinued, Pearson said she did not think her tweet was wrong, and added: \"I won't censor myself but I will be more watchful in the future.\"",
      "The police visit to her home was not \"standard practice\" and was \"absolutely unacceptable\", she claimed.",
      "She added: \"Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader and many other people in the law, in politics, in normal walks of life, have said that is totally outrageous.\"",
      "Posting the BBC's story on X on Thursday, she said: \"Here are the police marking their own homework in my case which was widely viewed as utterly outrageous.",
      "\"And was rejected instantly by the CPS.",
      "\"A clear breach of my right to freedom of expression.\"",
      "'High bar'",

      "\"We acted appropriately and proportionately and investigated the matter which resulted in us taking no further action.",
      "\"We 're sometimes faced with allegations of crime where people have strong opposing views and that is why it is essential for us to remain impartial.\"",

      "In her lawsuit, Ms Pavlovich said she was befriended by Palmer when she was 22 and homeless in New Zealand. She was repeatedly assaulted by Gaiman after she started working for the couple, she claims.",
      "Ms Pavlovich alleges the former couple violated laws on federal human trafficking, with complaints of assault, battery and inflicting emotional distress against Gaiman and negligence against Palmer.",
      "Ms Pavlovich first made her allegations public in a Tortoise Media podcast in summer 2024, and was also one of eight women who made claims of assault, abuse and coercion to New York Magazine in January.",
      "In response to that article, Gaiman said: \"I'm far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever.\"",
      "A spokesman for Palmer has said: \"While Ms Palmer is profoundly disturbed by the allegations that Mr Gaiman has abused several women, at this time her primary concern is, and must remain, the wellbeing of her son and therefore, to guard his privacy, she has no comment on these allegations.\"",
      "Ms Pavlovich filed a lawsuit against Gaimain and Palmer in Wisconsin, and against Palmer in Massachusetts and New York.",
      "As well as insisting her allegations are untrue, Gaiman's lawyers say US courts do not have authority to adjudicate her lawsuit because the alleged assaults happened in New Zealand."

      "After some violent match day behaviour, Jack is arrested and given six weeks to turn his life around - or face prison. He also has to try to save his marriage.",
      "But the real Danny Dyer met his partner when they were 13. They've been together more than 30 years, married for eight of them, and he likes to think he's a bit of a romantic.",
      "So, what love lessons can we learn from the former EastEnders actor?",
      "Separate beds is the way forward",
      "\"I'm a snorer,\" Dyer admits.",
      "\"You know what, snoring is just bad luck. Me and my wife have been around a long time and we have separate beds and the reason for that is, I unfortunately roar in the night.\"",
      "The 47-year-old says it's rare to have been with your partner for over 30 years at his age. \"We're bringing up grandchildren \u2013 it's a beautiful thing. My clan's getting bigger and I've become more responsible now.",

      "Men need to open up",

      "He says if you look at the Marching Powder poster, it's easy to think he's playing a hard man - but his character, Jack, isn't. \"He's into football violence and he's got a lot of issues around addiction, but he's a good man.",
      "\"What is masculinity?\" Dyer wonders. \"When does it become toxic? It's about being a decent human being.",
      "\"There's nothing wrong with being masculine. But as men, we need to open up to each other and stand up to our mates and go, 'no, I'm not coming out tonight \u2013 I'm going to spend a nice evening with my wife'.",

      "\"Well, I'm Danny Dyer. I don't need one. Whatever that means. Well, you know, fame and stuff, I don't think I've ever needed to use a chat up line.",

      "Staying grounded",
      "Dyer says his wife has grown with him and kept him grounded. \"She's a very special human being and she's never really been fazed by my work.\"",
      "He says he comes from a working class family and the Marching Powder screening was \"full of the working class lot that love our movies. And it's always great to be around real people, as I like to call them\".",

      "\"What is love?,\" Dyer asks.",
      "\"It's falling in love with people's flaws, that's why we stay with people, we meet people, we have a mask on that we're so perfect and then we got to the next level where you take that mask off and it's the weird, quirky stuff that you either go \u2013 see you later, you're elbowed \u2013 or, ooh, I quite like that about you.\"",
      "Dyer says love is an interesting dynamic.",

      "We see her standing in a kitchen, albeit not in her own home in Montecito, gathering fruit and herbs in the garden and chatting with friends as she makes food such as focaccia, doughnuts and Korean fried chicken.",
      "It's also putting on show food products that are being launched by Meghan's new brand - so there's a lot of raspberry jam on display (on sale with \"keepsake packaging\").",

      "It's all presented in lush colours, with dramatic shots of the beautiful California coast and mountains.",
      "Whether you love or hate the TV series will almost certainly depend on what you think about Meghan. And there will be strong opinions on both sides.",
      "It's in an entirely different genre from the previous Netflix documentary from Meghan and Prince Harry, which raked over their angry departure from royal life.",
      "Instead we're into a zone of gleaming smiles in polished kitchens, with a soundtrack of positive music pulsing away. \"Love is in the detail, gang,\" she says. And \"it's time to pop a bottle\" for a glass of champagne.",
      "Meghan dominates every moment of the 33-minute episodes of this lifestyle TV series, whether it's cooking, gardening, chatting, dancing. Or, as the series begins, beekeeping, as we see Meghan out harvesting honey, dressed in a beekeepers' outfit.",
      "And of course there's jam. That was trailed as the first product of her lifestyle brand that has been renamed As Ever. In the show a guest says \"Oh my God\" as he tries the raspberry jam, with the jam appearing through the series.",
      "It's also appearing for sale as \"raspberry spread\" in the As Ever food range, which so far doesn't have prices published alongside.",
      "Meghan is shown picking blackberries from rows of bushes: \"This is sort of what inspired my jam and preserve making,\" with picking fruit a \"daily task\".",
      "The hard work of those bees also seems to be heading for the shops, with \"Wildflower honey with honeycomb\" going on sale.",
      "We see a range of teas in the show and As Ever is releasing hibiscus, peppermint and lemon ginger varieties. Shortbread cookies, a crepe mix and flower \"sprinkles\" are also part of the new range.",
      "Mindy Kaling jokes about way the jams were first promoted, where celebrities were sent numbered jars by Meghan.",
      "\"When I received that in the mail, a box of your preserves it was probably one of the most glamorous moments of my life,\" said Kaling.",
      "\"But then I looked at the label, and it said they were something like 50. And then I of course, as a very hierarchical person, was like 'who are these other 50? Does having a lower number make me more special...\"'",
      "Meghan reveals she saved the number one jar for her mother, Doria Ragland as \"it felt like the right thing to do\".",
      "We learn about Meghan's fashion style. She likes \"high low\" fashion, mixing up high street fashions with expensive designers.",
      "There's also clarification that her name is Sussex now and not Markle, when she challenges Mindy Kaling over using her maiden name.",
      "\"I didn't know how meaningful it would be to me, but it just means so much to go 'this is our family name, our little family name',\" says Meghan.",
      "There are occasional glimpses of another life. She mentions: \"I was a latchkey kid, so I grew up with a lot of fast food and TV tray meals.\" Even a domestic goddess had to grow up somewhere.",
      "She's shown wrapping a gift and says: \"I used to teach a gift-wrapping class when I was an auditioning actress.\"",
      "As a viewer, you want to pause and find out more about that. But the show rushes on. There's a toughness here.",
      "In the final episode we see Prince Harry briefly, congratulating her on launching her As Ever business. And she raises a toast to this \"new chapter\" which is \"part of that creativity that I've missed so much\".",
      "Does this series also mark a final departure from any prospect of a return to palace life? The whole breezy, commercial charm of the show is a world away from the royals. This feels like looking forwards to a new future, without any more haggling over the past.",
      "Everything that Meghan does gets intense attention. That's partly because of how she polarises opinion. People who think she's wonderful and people who can't stand her are all interested in watching more.",
      "This series will inevitably get attention because of Meghan's involvement. But will there be enough for either her fans or her detractors to get their teeth into? How strongly can you feel about a cake with a few raspberries on top? Opinions will be divided. As Ever.",

      "Most predictable winner: Charli XCX",
      "Listen, this was never going to be anything other than Charli's night.",
      "The pop star's seventh album, Brat, captured the cultural zeitgeist in a way that few artists ever manage.",
      "Released in June, the record combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork; as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she's accumulated along the way, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.",
      "In the star's own words, the album was \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".",
      "Just as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Lorde, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.",
      "Critics called it \"pop music for the future\" and praised the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's coming of age.",
      "Knowingly trashy, yet surprisingly deep, it was easily the best British album of the last 12 months - and one that proved Charli's detractors wrong.",
      "\"I feel like dance music, electronic music, gets a really bad rep because everyone is like, 'It's not that deep, is it? And I kind of feel it is,\" she said after collecting her second award.",

      "\"Previously I used to do the actual script in rehearsal, and then you'd have an hour of people from record labels and publishers coming and knocking on the dressing room door going, 'You can't say this, you can't say that',\" he told Heart radio.",
      "\"So now I just do this fake script, which if you heard it, you'd be like, 'This is the lamest script ever', because it's all me just complimenting everyone and going, 'Oh, our next award is the best musician I've ever heard. They're great.'\"",

      "But lots of the winners on Saturday used their speeches to criticise the way they are being treated.",

      "Asked about the moment he realised it had taken on a life of its own, he told us: \"I got new wi-fi the other day, and they put me on hold... and it was Stargazing.",

      "Most fabricated award: Sabrina Carpenter",
      "Sabrina Carpenter was the night's biggest star - opening the show with a cheeky wink, a phalanx of bearskin-wearing guards and a vaudevillian mash-up of Espresso, Bed Chem and... er, Rule, Britannia.",
      "But was the decision to hand her the \"global success\" award a thinly-veiled ploy to tempt her back on to the stage?",
      "The prize was originally created in 2013 to recognise British acts who had sold millions of records and concert tickets abroad. The previous recipients were One Direction (2013-14), Sam Smith (2015), Adele (2016-17) and Ed Sheeran (2018-19).",
      "Six years ago it was abandoned altogether... until they needed something to honour Sabrina.",
      "To be fair, the singer racked up an incredible 21 weeks at number one in the UK singles chart last year - more than anyone has ever achieved in a single calendar year - so her trophy wasn't entirely undeserved.",

    "published": "Sat, 08 Mar 2025 01:37:16 GMT",
    "summary": "The at-home light therapy treatment is increasingly being seen as a must-have skincare accessory.",
    "story": [
      "LED technology has been used to address a number of skin issues, such as eczema, mild to moderate acne, psoriasis and sun damage in a medical setting.",
      "But the at-home LED market is on the verge of becoming a massive industry - with masks and other devices retailing for anything from \u00a340 to \u00a31,500.",
      "The technology harnesses the power of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which then stimulate skin cells when they are exposed to the skin repeatedly.",
      "Mask developers make big claims that at-home LED masks can be used to treat acne scars, sun damage and fine lines - but does this stand up to scrutiny?",
      "The LED market is set to be worth \u00a3600m globally by 2032 - which is nearly double what airflow technology like the Dyson Airwrap will be worth at the same point.",
      "According to consultant dermatologist Dr Jonathan Kentley, LED technology works by causing the skin to absorb light energy, which then triggers cellular changes in a process known as photobiomodulation (PBM).",
      "\"This allows new blood vessels and skin cells to be formed, along with more collagen and elastin,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"PBM has also been used to treat acne as it has anti-inflammatory effects and reduces the amount of oil in the skin,\" he adds.",
      "A recent comprehensive study of PBM stated that more clinical trials on humans need to take place to fully understand how it actually works.",
      "US space agency Nasa first began studying the effect of LEDs in the 1990s to see if it could help in cell regeneration.",
      "Since then, medical-grade devices have been used by dermatologists \"for many years\", according to Dr Kentley.",
      "But at-home masks have only been on the retail market for about five years and cost a fraction of the medical devices.",
      "The main differences between medical devices and High Street masks are the strength of the LEDs, the number of bulbs on the device and how close they sit to the skin's surface when being used.",
      "LED therapy masks are 'visually interesting'",
      "Dr Justine Kluk, who runs her own dermatology clinic and specialises in treating acne, believes that while at-home masks \"sound promising\", mask wholesale manufacturers are \"speculating\" about their benefits.",
      "\"I don't believe anyone has run clinical trials of the LED mask at home to see if it is the same dose as a device you would use in a clinic or hospital,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"No-one is testing these devices in big enough sample sizes for long enough periods of time for us to feel really confident.",
      "\"So I believe the benefits from using one of these masks is probably very modest,\" she adds.",
      "Skincare makes up nearly half of all global sales in the beauty industry - and is set to continue to grow more than the likes of haircare, make-up and fragrance in the next year.",
      "This is being boosted by Generation Z (those born between 1995 and 2009) and even Generation Alpha (born 2010 to now) whose skincare fascination is said to be fuelled by social media trends.",
      "Dr Kluk says she has noticed \"that people's interest in at-home skin care and treatments has increased hugely since Covid\" and believes the \"visually interesting\" element of the at-home LED mask makes it such an eye-catching product to sell online.",
      "\"People sitting watching TV wearing a red LED mask increases people's curiosity.",
      "\"Every other consultation I've had for the last six months, has involved people asking me about LED masks,\" she adds.",
      "When you search LED masks on social media platforms such as TikTok, you will be met with hundreds of videos with users showing off their results after using one of these at-home devices.",
      "Natalie O'Neill, 29, tells the BBC she started to use a mask \"out of curiosity to see if I would notice any difference\" and did not use it to treat an existing skin condition like acne.",
      "The skincare content creator says:  \"I noticed a change in my skin after a couple of weeks and felt it prevented breakouts really well.\"",
      "She adds that the mask has helped to \"keep my skin tone looking more even\" and faded marks on her face more quickly.",
      "O'Neill was not paid to promote a particular mask and caveats all her content on this technology by saying she uses it alongside a consistent skincare routine.",
      "\"Getting red light or LED therapy in a clinic is not immediately transferable to a mask, which a lot of consumers don't realise - I'm OK with that because I have the right expectations,\" she adds.",
      "Part of the appeal of LED masks is that they are easy to use and therefore have a low barrier to entry for potential buyers.",
      "Laurence Newman is the chief executive of CurrentBody, whose at-home LED mask is one of the world's best sellers.",
      "He started selling professional equipment to clinics more than 25 years ago and began developing an at-home LED mask in 2009, bringing out the company's first device just under 10 years later.",
      "\"We see that people use it for 10 minutes and get an instant glow afterwards,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Newman says that women in particular \"are moving towards totally non-invasive skincare\" and looking for ways to improve their skin without botox and fillers.",
      "Newman says the masks his company sells have been developed using the same technology as medical devices, which have a minimum requirement light wavelengths.",
      "He emphasises that the at-home LED mask market and indeed at-home beauty technology market are in their infancy, with \"a real movement of education\" growing.",
      "'This is a lot of money to spend'",
      "Dr Kentley concludes that \"PBM is mostly considered safe, even at high levels\" so using any form of LED technology is unlikely to \"cause damage to cells\", however more research into how exactly PBM works is needed to understand what it can do.",
      "\"There have been many experimental and clinical studies into the use of PBM for various dermatologic conditions, however they have varied in the parameters of the device and treatment protocols,\" he adds.",
      "\"Many of these studies were small and unstandardised and often paid for by the manufacturers so it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions\".",
      "He says if someone is keen to buy a device they should make sure they choose one that has EU safety certifications and a high density of LED bulbs on the mask to ensure enough energy is being delivered to the skin.",
      "Dr Kluk also says that she does not \"want to discourage anyone\" who is intrigued by the technology but wants \"them to understand that this is a lot of money to spend on a device, which could potentially support a good skincare routine, or if it's severe like acne, a good prescription regimen and some lifestyle measures - but it's unlikely to do enough on its own.\"",

      "It is illegal to sell medicinal products containing Melanotan II in the UK but as the tanners are sold cosmetically they fall outside that remit.",
      "However, they are not covered by UK cosmetics regulations, meaning they are not subjected to the same scrutiny as other over-the-counter beauty products.",
      "Experts have said they have not been fully researched and could contain toxic ingredients.",

      "They had been recommended to her by someone she knew, but she said she did not realise they were unlicensed and unregulated.",
      "The 47-year-old, from King's Lynn in Norfolk, inhaled the spray twice a day, believing it would give her tan \"time to build up before we actually get into the sunshine\".",
      "But on the second day of the trip she was rushed to hospital after the apparent allergic reaction spiralled.",
      "\"I literally could not breathe,\" she said.",

      "\"I can't even explain it, but I was suffocating inside. It was as if I was drowning within my own body.\"",
      "Ms Eagle said she became suspicious after her stepdaughter, who also used a tanner, spotted a Facebook post from someone who said they had also suffered a bad reaction.",
      "She told her hospital consultant, who asked where she had bought the tanner and what was in it.",
      "He also became suspicious, she said.",
      "\"Of course, there was nothing on it apart from a pretty label on the front, no ingredients whatsoever. There was nothing, really, I could show him. And that was a frightening thing,\" she said.",

      "He said the samples that did not contain the active ingredient were not necessarily safer as they could include other chemicals that \"could be toxic\".",
      "\"Any unlicensed product really comes with a whole host of dangers. There's no safety data. There are no long-term studies as to the impact on people's health,\" Mr Childs added.",
      "Another concern is that nasal tanners are often promoted for use in conjunction with sessions on sunbeds to maximise their effectiveness as part of a tanning routine.",
      "Cancer charities believe this could significantly increase the risk of developing skin cancer.",
      "Kerry Rafferty, who started charity Melanoma-Me after her own diagnosis, described the products as \"skin cancer in a bottle\".",
      "\"It's absolutely terrifying, you've got these tanners that nobody really knows what's in them and then they [could be] accelerated by the sunbed use, which we know causes melanoma, so it is a big worry,\" she said.",
      "\"I think that this could be one of the reasons that there is an increase in melanoma at the moment.\"",
      "Data from North West Cancer Research showed people in the north-west of England were 13% more likely to develop skin cancer than those in the rest of the country.",
      "Chief executive Alastair Richards said the desire for \"that tanned look\" can often lead people to resort to the excessive use of sunbeds and products like nasal tanners.",

      "It is estimated that at least three-quarters of the 650,000 people who die every year in the UK require palliative care. But a recent report by end-of-life charity Marie Curie suggested more than a fifth of those who need it in England and Wales do not receive any.",
      "And overall, half of families said they were unhappy about the care their loved ones receive in their final months.",
      "But this hasn't always been the case - until recently the picture was very different.",

      "As recently as 2015, the UK was ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care by the Economist Intelligence Unit. However, Association for Palliative Medicine president Dr Sarah Cox says: \"That's not the case any longer. We're not getting the funding we need. But it is not just about money \u2013 it is the way services are organised.\"",
      "There are many reasons people end up dying in hospital when they would have preferred to have done so at home. Palliative care staff I have spoken say when people are in their final weeks some decide they need to go to hospital as they become frightened or do not want to be a burden on their loved ones, while in other cases families believe that being in hospital will help prolong their relative's life.",
      "But, ultimately, the lack of palliative care is thought to be the crucial factor in most cases, experts say. And so accident and emergency departments in hospitals become the safety net.",

      "'Palliative care is not good enough - there's no plan to fix it'",
      "'Focus on palliative care not assisted dying'",
      "'We felt on our own looking after mum in her last days'",
      "The Marie Curie report found around half of people in England and Wales end up going to A&E at least once in their final three months, and one in eight spend 30 days or more in hospital. And a hospital death is not always in the relative comfort of a bed on a ward.",
      "Hospital palliative care doctor Dr Rachel Clarke says she can spend whole days in A&E trying her best to care for patients dying in resuscitation areas and in corridors. \"It's a travesty people end their lives like that.\"",
      "Specialist palliative care is actually provided by a range of different organisations. \"People receive it from hospitals, from community NHS teams, from social care and from hospices,\" says Dr Cox.",
      "\"But families tell us that there is a lack of coordination between the different parts of the system. People struggle to get the help they need and end up in hospital.\"",
      "This is exactly what happened to Terry, who was rushed to hospital in an ambulance because of a fluid build-up related to his cancer two weeks before he died and never returned home. With better support at home, it is quite possible he would never have needed to be admitted.",
      "On top of the financial pressures felt by the rest of the NHS, experts say that a combination of demographic changes, different parts of the system acting in isolation and cash being spent in the wrong places have all brought the palliative care system to this point.",
      "And the problems are becoming more acute each year. For the 30 years up to 2011, the number of people dying in the UK was falling but that has changed as the people born during the boom in births following World War Two have grown old. Over the next decade, the number of deaths a year is expected to increase by 12%.",
      "The difficulties faced by hospices",
      "Where it works well, palliative care makes all the difference to those who use it. Hospices are a major provider of care, supporting 300,000 people a year - mainly in the community, not just inside their own buildings, contrary to popular belief.",
      "St Christopher's Hospice in south London is helping more than 1,700 people with terminal illnesses across five London boroughs. It receives referrals from GPs, district nursing teams and hospitals.",
      "Palliative care nurse Grace Larder says she provides many types of support to her patients, who have a range of conditions from motor neurone disease and Parkinson's to liver failure. This includes pain control and care for other physical problems, along with helping them with psychological and financial needs.",
      "\"We really develop relationships with people,\" she says. \"There's one patient I've been working with for nearly two years. You want to do your best.\"",
      "Most people she cares for tell her that they want to die at home, she says \u2013 but that's only possible if they get the right care.",
      "But many hospice services are in financial difficulties. Only around a third of St Christopher's funding comes from the NHS; the rest comes from fundraising and charitable donations.",
      "Any drugs the hospice provides has to come from their own funds too so they try to anticipate what their patients will need in advance and work with the patient's GP to have them prescribed on the NHS.",
      "A parliamentary report warned the current approach to funding is not sustainable.",
      "\"What other health service has to get by like that?\" says Helen King, who manages the team of nurses at St Christopher's. She points out that they are fortunate to have an affluent local community that donates generously.",
      "\"[But] the fact remains we get more money from our shops - from selling second-hand clothing - than we do from the government.\"",
      "Training is 'virtually non-existent'",
      "The government has recognised there is a problem and provided an extra \u00a3100m of funding this year to the sector \u2013 although hospice services have said this will mostly go on the rising costs they are facing.",
      "As for hospitals offering palliative care, audits show that four in 10 hospitals, for example, do not have specialist services available seven days a week - despite this having been set as a national standard in 2004.",
      "In practice, that means there is no specialist palliative care support from doctors or nurses available during evenings and weekends either in person or on-call, says Dr Clarke. \"You would never have that for other specialities like cardiology or renal so why should it happen for palliative care?\"",

      "This is compounded by the fact that palliative care training is \"virtually non-existent\" for the other staff who pick up the burden, who often lack the confidence to speak to patients and families about dying and prescribe the right drugs, she says.",
      "\"We will come into work and find patients really suffering \u2013 in pain, breathless, agitated or with nausea and vomiting. It is hard to over-state how lamentably badly-resourced palliative care services are.\"",
      "Meanwhile, in the community, GPs are left to pick up the pieces. But Dr Catherine Millington-Sanders from the Royal College of General Practicioners says that, given an \"unrelenting workload\" and staffing shortages, it is difficult to provide the care patients need, particularly home visits.",

      "So what is the solution? More money would help, but it wouldn't fix everything.",
      "Earlier this year the Health Economics Unit and Nuffield Trust think-tank found that plenty was being spent on people in the final year of their life. Nearly \u00a312bn was going on their healthcare, the report found \u2013 that works out at in excess of \u00a318,000 per person for everyone who dies.",
      "But the overwhelming majority of that \u00a312bn \u2013 85% - goes on hospitals and emergency care, rather than support in the community.",
      "It is, essentially, a false economy, as support in hospital tends to be more expensive.",
      "Dr Sam Royston, executive director of research at the charity, says these findings go a long way to explaining why \"too many people are dying in places where they don't want or need to be\".",
      "He adds: \"There must be a clear long-term ambition for all UK governments to shift health expenditure on people at the end of life from hospital to community.\"",
      "According to Dr Royston, just shifting 20% of the money spent caring for dying people in hospital would be transformative for community services as it would double current spending.",
      "Is better coordination the solution?",
      "What would a better system look like? First of all, more could be done to identify people's needs before they are admitted to hospital, Dr Royston believes.",
      "He points to a service in Bradford called React which works in emergency departments to identify and assess patients and diverting them towards teams in the community who can support them instead.",
      "A study found it reduced average unplanned bed days in patients' final year of life from 38 to 18.",
      "But to reduce the number of people going to hospital in the first place, there needs to be greater co-ordination of services too, given the complexity of support and variety of providers, says Dr Cox.",
      "She says there need to be electronic records that detail the wishes of people who are at the end of life that health and care staff can access: \"These electronic systems are available in some areas but not others,\" she says.",
      "She also argues providing a central hub or phone line to help people navigate and coordinate care would be transformational.",
      "She points to a system that has been set up in Cambridgeshire between a local hospice service, NHS 111 and the local ambulance service. It provides people at the end of their life with access to a specialist nurse 24 hours a day, simply by calling the NHS 111 advice line.",
      "\"A service like this can make a huge difference, providing equipment, responsive visits as well as telephone advice and signposting to other services,\" adds Dr Cox.",
      "And better training for non-specialist staff is also essential, Dr Cox and Dr Clarke agree.",
      "\"My utopia would be that you don't actually need lots of specialist palliative care services because everybody is so good at supporting patients at the end of life,\" adds Dr Clarke.",
      "\"If we were able to support people in the community properly, it would be better for them and would actually cost the NHS less.\"",
      "She adds: \"We need to prioritise this - you only die once.\"",

      "That NHS test, which is processed in a laboratory, measures the level of PSA released by the prostate, a small gland involved in the production of semen.",
      "A high PSA level does not mean you have cancer but is a warning sign which can then lead to further scans and tests to rule out the disease.",
      "PSA levels can be high for a number of other reasons - including an infection, recent vigorous exercise or sex - or in some rare cases remain normal despite cancer.",
      "Google search data suggests interest in testing has risen sharply since the Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy went public with his own diagnosis in October 2024.",
      "Dozens of companies now sell self-testing kits designed to measure PSA levels.",

      "The UK medicines regulator, the MHRA, says in its guidance that over-the-counter PSA kits are \"not a reliable indicator of prostate cancer\" and must not \"claim to detect cancer\".",
      "Instead, some at-home tests are marketed online as a way to \"screen\" for the disease, language the regulator says would be acceptable under the current rules.",

      "The British In Vitro Diagnostics Association, which represents the blood testing industry, says that while home tests are appropriate in many circumstances, \"this particular type of [PSA] test may not give an accurate indication of prostate health when taken outside the NHS\".",

    "story": [
      "An autistic woman with a learning disability was wrongly locked up in a mental health hospital for 45 years, starting when she was just seven years old, the BBC has learned.",
      "The woman, who is believed to be originally from Sierra Leone, and who was given the name Kasibba by the local authority to protect her identity, was also held on her own in long-term segregation for 25 years.",
      "Kasibba is non-verbal and had no family to speak up for her. A clinical psychologist told File on 4 Investigates how she had begun a nine-year battle to release her.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC it was unacceptable that so many disabled people were still being held in mental health hospitals and said it hoped reforms to the Mental Health Act would prevent inappropriate detention.",
      "More than 2,000 autistic people and people with learning disabilities are still detained in mental health hospitals in England - including about 200 children. For years, the government has pledged to move many of them into community care, because they do not have any mental illness.",
      "The government promised to take action after a BBC undercover investigation in 2011 exposed the criminal abuse of people with learning disabilities at Winterbourne View private hospital near Bristol.",
      "But all key targets in England have been missed. In the past few weeks, in its plan for 2025-26, NHS England said it aimed to reduce the reliance on mental health inpatient care for people with a learning disability and autistic people, delivering a minimum 10% reduction.",
      "However, Dan Scorer, head of policy and public affairs at the charity Mencap, is not impressed. \"Hundreds of people are still languishing, detained, who should have been freed and should be supported in the community, because we haven't seen the progress that was promised,\" he told us.",
      "Dr Patsie Staite learned of Kasibba's incarceration in 2013 when she was a rookie clinical psychologist carrying out a routine review of her care. But it would take nine years to free her.",
      "\"I hadn't ever seen anyone living in the situation that she was living in. And I think what was really shocking was it was all legitimised,\" Dr Staite told the BBC. She said the apparently legitimate hospital setting masked the reality that Kasibba \"was locked up for sometimes more than 23 hours a day\".",
      "Returning to the site of the hospital - which cannot be named to help protect Kasibba's identity - Dr Staite pointed out a hole in the fence. It had been cut out, she said, so Kasibba could watch people walking by from the outside space of the locked annex where she was held.",
      "It is thought Kasibba, who is now in her 50s, was trafficked from Sierra Leone before the age of five. She lived in a children's home for a while, but that placement broke down and, by the age of seven, she was moved into the long-stay hospital.",
      "Dr Staite said that staff had described Kasibba as \"dangerous\" and an \"eye-gouger\".",
      "She discovered a single incident in the records which appeared to have led to these accusations of violence. Decades earlier, when Kasibba was 19 and before she was placed in long-term segregation, a fire alarm had gone off and the locked ward was being evacuated.",
      "Kasibba was distressed and, in the confusion, she was approached by another patient. She scratched her, causing a cut to the other patient's eye.",
      "\"That was how the incident was talked about ever since, 'she's an eye gouger and she caused so much harm to this other person',\" said Dr Staite. But \"it just didn't ring true\", she said, that a middle-aged woman with a learning disability who had lived in the hospital for decades could be that dangerous.",
      "After months of work, Dr Staite submitted a 50-page report to Camden Council - the local authority in north London which had originally placed Kasibba in the hospital. Dr Staite said it had already been accepted that Kasibba did not have a mental illness and her report concluded she was not dangerous and was safe to live in the community.",
      "A team of health and social care professionals was then set up in 2016, calling themselves \"the escape committee\". Their mission was to free Kasibba.",
      "Lucy Dunstan, from disability rights organisation Changing Our Lives, was appointed to be Kasibba's independent advocate and to build a compelling case for why it was safe for her to leave the hospital.",
      "But Kasibba's release could only be signed off by the Court of Protection, which makes decisions for people who do not have the mental capacity to make their own.",
      "Ms Dunstan said when she first met Kasibba, hospital staff simply introduced her as \"the eye-gouger\".",
      "She said she recalls looking at Kasibba through a small window in the door that kept her locked in. \"She was just lying on the the settee. It was a very empty room. Her life was completely impoverished,\" she said.",
      "It would be six years from first having met Kasibba before Ms Dunstan got a call to tell her that the Court of Protection had ruled she could leave hospital. \"I cried. Joy. Relief. Admiration for her. Pride,\" she said. \"It's not about me and what we did, but that she did it and she showed them.\"",
      "Now Kasibba lives in the community with the help of support workers, who engage with her and communicate with gentle touches, gestures and clear language. Her care manager said she loved fashion, was proud of her home and enjoyed social interaction.",
      "\"She has the most amazing sense of humour. She's a beautiful human being,\" the manager said. \"After about two weeks of working here she actually came up and gave me a hug. This is not an eye-gouger, you know.\"",
      "The Mental Health Bill going through parliament will mean autistic people and those with learning disabilities in England and Wales, who do not have a mental health condition, will no longer be able to be detained for treatment.",
      "But the government has said it will not bring in any changes until it is satisfied there is sufficient alternative support in the community. And it will still allow people to be detained in hospital legally for up to 28 days for assessment.",
      "Jess McGregor, executive director of adults and health at Camden Council, said it was a \"tragedy\" that Kasibba had spent most of her life held in hospital. \"I'm personally sorry,\" she said. \"She shouldn't have experienced what she did.\"",
      "The NHS mental health trust, which cannot be named to protect Kasibba's identity, said at no point had the care it delivered been brought into question and the service was rated as outstanding by the Care Quality Commission.",
      "The trust told File on 4 Investigates that anyone assessed as needing long-term segregation had a self-contained property with their own bedroom, bathroom, living room and garden.",
      "The trust said from 2010 it had been working with local authorities to put plans in place to support the discharge of all long-term residents to more appropriate care, where possible within the community, but said they were prevented from doing so by a legal case brought by the families of other patients.",
      "It said its staff had then worked tirelessly for years supporting local authorities to put the necessary support in place in the community and they were able to successfully close the service in 2023."

      "Nigeria, in particular, stands out, with the predicted number projected to more than triple - from 36.6 million in 2021 to 141 million in 2050. That would make it the country with the fourth-largest population of adults who are overweight or obese.",
      "The authors acknowledge the study does not take into account the impact that new weight loss medications might have - and they could play a significant role in the future.",
      "Experts say if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what could be a disaster for vulnerable healthcare systems.",
      "The research was led by Prof Emmanuela Gakidou, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), at the University of Washington in the US.",
      "She said: \"[Governments] can use our country specific estimates on the stage, timing, and speed of current and forecasted transitions in weight to identify priority populations experiencing the greatest burdens of obesity who require immediate intervention and treatment, and those that remain predominantly overweight and should be primarily targeted with prevention strategies.",
      "\"The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental societal failure,\" she added.",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "A surge in rates of obesity is happening right now, particularly among young people.",
      "Rates of obesity in children and younger teenagers (from 8.8% to 18.1%) and younger adults (those under 25 - from 9.9% to 20.3%) more than doubled between 1990 and 2021.",
      "However, by 2050 one in three young people will be affected.",
      "The co-lead author of the report, Dr Jessica Kerr of the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia, says the figures present a real challenge to health care systems in the coming years.",
      "\"But if we act now, preventing a complete transition to global obesity for children and adolescents is still possible,\" she said.",
      "\"Our estimates identify children and adolescents in much of Europe and south Asia living with overweight who should be targeted with obesity prevention strategies.",
      "\"We have also identified large populations, particularly adolescent girls, in North America, Australasia, Oceania, North Africa and the Middle East, and Latin America that are expected to tip over to obesity predominance and require urgent, multifaceted intervention and treatment.",
      "\"This is essential to avoid intergenerational transmission of obesity and to prevent a wave of serious health conditions and dire financial and societal costs for future generations.\""

      "Netflix's new drama Toxic Town revisits one of the UK's biggest environmental scandals: the Corby toxic waste case.",
      "The series tells the story of families fighting for justice after children in the Northamptonshire town were born with birth defects, believed to be caused by industrial pollution.",
      "Corby's steel and iron industry expanded rapidly in the 1930s with the construction of Stewarts and Lloyds steelworks.",
      "By the 1970s, half the town worked in the mills, but when the steelworks closed in the 1980s, toxic waste from the demolition process was mishandled, leading to widespread contamination.",
      "In 2009, after a long legal battle, the High Court ruled Corby Borough Council was negligent in managing the waste.",
      "Families affected won an undisclosed financial settlement in 2010, held in trust until the children turned 18.",
      "Alongside the drama, a BBC Radio Northampton podcast series offers a deeper look into the real-life events, using original court transcripts and newly uncovered documents.",
      "Introducing... The Toxic Waste Scandal",
      "Hosted by George Taylor, 32, who was born with an upper limb defect linked to the case, the podcast features testimony and interviews with those directly impacted.",
      "Here are some of the key voices behind the story.",
      "'The first person you are going to blame is yourself'",
      "George Angus Taylor was born on 11 March 1992 to parents Fiona and Brian, in Corby.",
      "Brian had worked at Stewart and Lloyds, a job that left him covered in dust and debris at the end of each shift.",
      "Fiona, a former Boots No7 beauty consultant, vividly remembers George's birth, an event that would change their lives forever.",
      "Born \"navy blue\" as a result of pre-foetal circulation issues, he was immediately ventilated and placed in intensive care.",
      "It was then Fiona noticed something unusual.",
      "\"I remember just seeing his little hand; his pinkie ring finger and middle finger,\" she says.",
      "\"It was like a fist; you know how babies make a fist? Then his index finger; his thumb was sticking out.",
      "\"I just kept thinking, 'He's here because of me,' and you just look for blame. You look, and the first person you are going to blame is yourself.\"",
      "At 14, doctors discovered a tumour in George's hand so large that amputation became a real possibility.",
      "The surgery, experimental at the time, was gruelling. \"When I woke up, I was so full of morphine,\" he remembers.",
      "\"They said it was like climbing Everest with no practice \u2013 my body just shut down.\"",
      "The experience, particularly the smell, left lasting memories. \"They burn flesh as they [operate]: very quiet sizzling, like sausages in a pan. And that's the smell that still comes to you from time to time.\"",
      "Despite everything, George was determined to move forward. \"The first time I saw my hand, I wasn't shocked. I wasn't sad. It was better than before.\"",
      "But George was not alone. Other children in Corby were born with similar conditions.",
      "'Did I do this?'",
      "Lisa Atkinson was a security guard at the Corby steel mills, where her duties involved outside patrols, checking parking permits, and often having to move dust that had settled over everything.",
      "On 27 June 1989, she gave birth to her daughter, Simone, at Kettering General Hospital.",
      "Simone was born with three fingers on each hand.",
      "Doctors reassured Lisa, saying the only thing she would not be able to do was play the piano.",
      "Just as Fiona Taylor did with George, Lisa initially questioned whether she was responsible for her daughter's condition.",
      "\"There was probably part of me that sat there and went, 'What did I do? Did I do this?'\" she says.",
      "\"Because I've had a couple of miscarriages before Simone... I always thought maybe I was lucky; maybe I was given Simone... but she wasn't quite perfect. But I was lucky to have had that baby and not the two previous ones.\"",
      "Despite her initial self-doubt, Lisa \"knew\" she had done nothing wrong, as she had neither drunk nor smoked during pregnancy.",
      "She recalls the lack of follow-up care or investigation into her daughter's condition.",
      "\"You're let out into the world with a child that's a little bit different,\" she says.",
      "\"But there was nowhere to go. There was no follow-up or anything, no 'We're going to look into it.' So you just deal with it. And you did, because you had to.\"",
      "Lisa quickly adjusted to life with Simone's condition, saying: \"It shocked other people more than it shocked me. I got used to it really, really quickly.\"",
      "Winning the subsequent legal case against the borough council brought with it overwhelming attention.",
      "\"I'm not famous, but I feel like that's how famous people must feel... It was crazy.\"",
      "Growing up, Simone, now 35, faced relentless bullying.",
      "\"I had a great family and friends... but [school] was hard. I wasn't a very confident child, and I was an easy target,\" she remembers.",
      "Simone coped by using humour. She would joke that her mum had chopped off her fingers or that she was part alien, turning her differences into something entertaining.",
      "\"It was a bit of a front, because if I make a joke about myself, nobody else can. Just accept that's who you are; it's not going to change.\"",
      "At 18, she was offered surgery to reshape her hands, but declined.",
      "\"They admitted they didn't really know if it would help. By then, I'd adapted. I live with daily pain, but I didn't want to risk making things worse.\"",
      "Meeting her now-husband, she initially hid her hands, subtly positioning herself to avoid detection.",
      "Eventually, she told him - through a long message and sending him a link to the 2020 Horizon documentary about the case.",
      "His response? \"It's really not a big deal.\"",
      "Today, she is grateful for the legal battle her family fought. \"It set me up for life,\" she says.",
      "\"I was able to start my own life, and I went to university. I've got my own house and my daughter had the best start in life.\"",
      "'It felt like we were an inconvenience'",
      "Lewis Waterfield was born in 1994 with deformities to both hands.",
      "His father worked near the contaminated site as a roofer, and his pregnant mother often visited him there.",
      "\"My dad noticed something wasn't right straight away,\" Lewis recalls.",
      "As a child, he endured disruptive hospital stays, including an unsuccessful attempt to graft a toe on to his hand to create a functioning finger.",
      "\"I've had extensive surgery, but there are limits to what can be done.\"",
      "During the legal battle, Lewis's parents fought to prove a link between industrial pollution and birth defects.",
      "\"The council, I remember, was dismissive. It felt like we were an inconvenience to them.\"",
      "Now a senior lecturer in public health at the University of Northampton, Lewis acknowledges how his experiences shaped him.",
      "\"Every now and then, someone asks about my hands, and it takes me right back.\" he says.",
      "\"But I don't mind. It's part of who I am.\"",
      "Corby Borough Council ceased to exist in 2021 when it merged with other authorities to become North Northamptonshire Council.",
      "In 2010, its then chief executive, Chris Mallender, issued a formal apology over the scandal.",
      "\"The council extends its deepest sympathy to the children and their families,\" it said.",
      "\"Although I accept that money cannot properly compensate these young people for their disabilities and for all that they've suffered to date and their problems in the future, the council sincerely hopes that this apology, coupled with today's agreement, will mean they can now put their legal battle behind them and proceed with their lives with a greater degree of financial certainty.\"",

    "story": [
      "The UK death rate reached a record low last year, according to exclusive analysis carried out for BBC News.",
      "Mortality experts looked at death certificates registered in 2024 and found that deaths per head of the population had returned to pre-pandemic levels and were slightly below the previous record in 2019.",
      "However, the new figure puts the UK back on its long-term trend of only gradual improvement.",
      "The research was carried out by analysts from the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) at the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.",
      "What's been happening to death rates?",
      "\"This is five years of basically flat mortality improvement, it's pretty poor by historical standards,\" said Stuart McDonald from the CMI.",
      "There was also a \"concerning\" rise in the death rate at young working ages, he said.",
      "A Department of Health spokesperson said the government was \"shifting focus from sickness to prevention\".",
      "The registered death rate in the UK steadily halved from 1974 to 2011 largely driven by improvements in tackling heart disease, including smoking prevention and medical advances.",
      "From 2011 to 2019 the improvements drastically slowed, then changed direction during Covid as thousands more people died than normal. The first post-pandemic year of 2022 also saw high numbers of extra deaths.",
      "To calculate the record low 2024 UK figure of 989 deaths per 100,000 people, analysts at the CMI used provisional weekly death registration figures for the four nations of the UK.",
      "\"Clearly, it's very good news that our mortality rate is lower in 2024 than it was,\" says Dr Veena Raleigh, epidemiologist at health think tank The King's Fund. \"But if you look at the broader canvas then it's not so good.\"",
      "Although similar countries also experienced a slowdown since 2011, the UK's has been more severe and our life expectancy is at the \"bottom of the pack of comparable countries,\" she says, adding that nations such as Spain returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023.",
      "Causes and risk factors",
      "Researchers point to a variety of reasons behind the slowdown since 2011. Some of the \"low hanging fruit\" of improvements in heart disease and cancer, such as the cut in smoking rates, had already happened, making further gains harder.",
      "At the same time, the UK saw rising risk factors, including obesity, poor diet and low levels of exercise, against a backdrop of widening social inequality and pressure on the NHS.",
      "Some academics argue that austerity cuts to public services after the 2008 financial crash had a strong impact on life expectancy, while others say it's not possible to prove this directly.",
      "Dementia and Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the latest official figures. Heart disease, lung disease, strokes, lung cancer also feature highly, along with flu in some years.",
      "\"Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer in the UK,\" said Prof Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation.",
      "\"The plateau we have seen in reducing the number of deaths... is a serious cause for concern, made worse by the impact of the pandemic on an already overstretched health service.\"",
      "He added that early deaths from cardiovascular disease had grown in the most deprived areas of England and called for \"urgent government action\" in its prevention, detection and treatment.",
      "Deaths at younger ages",
      "Overall death rates are largely a reflection of older people's health as more than three-quarters of UK deaths happen over the age of 70.",
      "So the main trend is driven by what is happening to people in this age group.",
      "But the CMI found \"really significant differences\" at younger ages says Stuart McDonald, with a \"concerning\" upward trend in mortality among 20-44-year-olds.",
      "\"For this age group, death rates have actually been going up slightly, even before the pandemic. If we go back to 2011 we can see a slight increase in death rates year-on-year.\"",

      "Life expectancy is down but what does this mean?",

      "Death numbers among this age group are much lower than at older ages and the causes tend to be different. Fewer than 20,000 people aged 20-44 die in the UK each year, about 3% of all deaths.",
      "\"External and substance-related causes are most important because often that's what people die of in this age group,\" says Antonino Polizzi, researcher at the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford.",

      "Abramovich sold Chelsea in 2022, after he was sanctioned by the UK government over Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The \u00a32.5bn raised was meant to be used for humanitarian causes linked to the Ukraine war but it remains frozen in a UK bank account.",

      "The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) told the BBC its officials are in talks with Abramovich's representatives.",
      "But multiple sources said there have been no meetings between any Labour ministers and members of the foundation set up to oversee the funds since the general election last year.",
      "Sources close to the foundation said there was a deadlock and a political decision by a minister is needed to negotiate and sign off an agreement that can break the impasse.",
      "One source said: \"For three years, the government has been saying it's been working very hard to release the money. But they are not having meetings with the foundation. There has been no meeting with a minister since Labour took over, for example.\"",
      "The BBC understands the FCDO has acknowledged a request for a meeting between the foundation's board and Foreign Secretary David Lammy.",
      "Abramovich's representatives did not wish to comment, but those with knowledge of the situation acknowledged little contact or progress had been made on releasing the funds under the four prime ministers to have held power since the sale of the club.",
      "The issue has taken on new urgency after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced that part of the UK's overseas aid budget was being diverted to defence. In 2024/25, the UK is sending \u00a3282m in aid to Ukraine.",
      "The \u00a32.5bn - and the interest accrued on the funds - would make up for some of money taken from the aid budget, which was \u00a315.3bn in 2023.",
      "Alison Griffin, of charity Save the Children, said: \"This money has been sitting gathering dust - and interest - when it could and should have been spent helping the children of Ukraine cope with the horrors of a full-scale war that has lasted over three years.\"",
      "The delay in releasing the funds centres on a disagreement between the UK government and Abramovich's lawyers.",
      "Abramovich was granted a special licence to sell Chelsea, providing he could prove he would not benefit from the sale.",
      "At the time, Abramovich said proceeds from the sale would be donated via a foundation \"for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine\", and his position has not changed.",
      "Abramovich - a Russian billionaire who made his fortune in oil and gas - cannot access the \u00a32.5bn under UK sanctions but the money still legally belongs to him.",
      "He is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, something he has denied.",
      "Sources said Abramovich's lawyers have insisted on using the money for all victims of the war in Ukraine including those outside the country, but the UK government has pushed back and argued the funds should only be spent on humanitarian efforts inside the war-torn country.",
      "Portugal has also had a say in the matter because Abramovich has Portuguese citizenship and has been sanctioned by the EU.",
      "Elusive resolution",
      "The Portuguese authorities issued an exemption to the EU sanctions to allow the Chelsea funds to be used for \"exclusively for humanitarian purposes in Ukraine\".",
      "\"The EU and the UK have worked closely together to ensure that the proceeds of this sale be used for humanitarian purposes in Ukraine, via a charitable organisation, in line with the conditions laid out in the derogation,\" said Olof Gill, a Commission spokesperson for financial services.",

      "\"The humanitarian needs in Ukraine remain extremely high.\"",
      "Members of the foundation, which is headed by Mike Penrose, the former boss of Unicef UK and Norwegian diplomat Jan Egeland, met former Foreign Secretary David Cameron and his deputy Andrew Mitchell in the spring last year.",
      "Those with knowledge of the situation said the outcome of the meeting left a positive impression that the stalemate could be ended by allowing some of the funds to be used on humanitarian causes outside Ukraine.",
      "The BBC understands the former foreign secretary believed a workable solution was in progress and a statement of intent about how the funds would be used was being drawn up by the foundation.",
      "Lord Cameron had spoken to the European Commission about the proposal and had sought buy-in from Downing Street to sign off the agreement.",
      "But there was no resolution to the dispute before last year's general election and there have been no meetings with any ministers since Labour took office.",
      "'Working hard'",
      "The foundation has a plan ready to roll out immediately once the funds have been unlocked.",

      "In a statement with chief whip Lee Anderson, Yusuf also said the party had received allegations of bullying in Lowe's parliamentary and constituency offices.",
      "The party has appointed a lawyer to conduct an investigation into allegations of \"workplace bullying\" made by two female employees, he added.",
      "Writing on social media platform X, Lowe said the party's allegations were \"untrue and false\" and he was \"disappointed, but not surprised\" to read them.",
      "He added there was \"zero credible evidence\" against him and he was \"seeking legal advice immediately\".",
      "Lowe said his suspension was a reaction to having criticised party leader Nigel Farage in a newspaper interview.",
      "Reform, the successor to Farage's Brexit Party, has been riding high in recent polls - but this is a spectacular and very public explosion of divisions at the top of the party.",
      "The party had only five MPs in the Commons, and Lowe's suspension means it has now lost one.",

      "In an interview with the Daily Mail earlier this week, Lowe had said the party remained a \"protest party led by the Messiah\" under Farage's leadership.",
      "Farage, he added, would need the \"right people\" around him to \"deliver the goods\" as party leader.",
      "Farage hit back in an interview, saying Lowe was \"completely wrong\" and Reform UK was \"absolutely not a protest party\".",
      "A spokesman for Reform UK confirmed it had withdrawn the party whip from him, meaning he will not sit as part of the party's group in Parliament and becomes an independent MP.",
      "In response, Lowe said: \"I asked reasonable and constructive questions of Nigel Farage and Reform's leadership, following months of pushing for progress behind closed doors.",
      "\"The day after, I find a knife in my back over false allegations. Whip suspended.\"",
      "A Reform UK source denied the announcement of its investigation was connected to the public spat between Lowe and Farage.",
      "A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said: \"On Thursday 6 March we received an allegation of verbal threats made by a 67-year-old man on Friday 13 December 2024.",
      "\"Officers are carrying out an assessment of the allegations to determine what further action may be required.\"",
      "In its statement, the party said it had appointed a KC, a senior lawyer, to investigate the allegations of bullying in Lowe's offices, adding it understood complaints had been made to parliamentary authorities.",
      "\"To date, Mr Lowe has yet to cooperate with this investigation,\" the statement added.",
      "\"In addition to these allegations of a disturbing pattern of behaviour, Mr Lowe has on at least two occasions made threats of physical violence against our party chairman. Accordingly, this matter is with the police.\"",
      "Writing on X after Reform UK's statement, Lowe said he had \"cooperated and spoken at length\" with the lawyer appointed by the party.",
      "In a further post on Saturday morning, Lowe asked Farage to have dinner with him to resolve the situation, an invitation he claimed had been given to the Reform leader \"multiple times over many months\" but had been refused or ignored each time.",
      "Tim Montgomerie, a former Conservative commentator who defected to Reform last December, said as soon as he arrived in Reform he had \"picked up these tensions\" between Farage and Lowe.",

      "Labour MP Josh MacAlister, who brought the private members' bill, told MPs during a parliamentary debate on Friday that reducing smartphone use in law would be a \"process\", not one \"big bang\" event.",
      "The proposed legislation calls for the government to say within a year whether it will raise the digital age of consent from 13 to 16 - meaning companies could not receive children's data without parental permission until that age.",

      "The bill also says parents need further guidance on smartphone use by children and urges the government to come up with a plan for research into the impact of use of social media on children within 12 months.",
      "Bryant said his department had asked the University of Cambridge to run a feasibility study into the impact of smartphones and social media - and that it would work to \"roughly the same timetable\" as the bill was calling for.",

      "In a separate interview with BBC Politics Wales, to be broadcast on Sunday, he said \"we have to ask ourselves the question, how on earth did this happen?\"",

      "Things \"went from comedy to tragedy very quickly, as I went from being patient and well-meaning to irritable and disillusioned at times, if I was honest\", he added.",
      "He stopped short of saying the Conservative Party was \"ungovernable\", characterising his account as more of a \"description of politics more generally\".",

      "\"Perhaps the scrutiny around politics is a little bit more intense.\"",
      "To Politics Wales he said he does not think candidates, MPs and ministers are given \"the proper amount of support, training, mentoring, guidance that would be absolutely standard practice in a normal workplace\".",

      "More than 100 Labour MPs and peers have urged banks and investment firms to relax their rules on investing in defence companies.",
      "In an open letter, first reported by the Financial Times, they said \"ill considered\" ethical investment rules had been holding back their access to finance.",
      "They wrote that a change in approach would help the UK bolster its defences, and contribute to the government's drive to boost economic growth.",
      "It also reflects a trend in recent years to emphasise the national security element of defence investment since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",
      "Defence firms 'need reassuring' that big orders will be long-term",
      "Starmer cuts aid to fund increase in defence spending",
      "Leading weapons companies have seen sales and their share price surge in recent years, as countries seek to rearm after years of declining defence spending.",
      "The UK is among those countries committing to ramp up spending, with Sir Keir Starmer announcing plans last week to increase defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027, funded by cuts to overseas aid.",
      "However in their letter, the politicians argued that environmental, social and governance (ESG) rules adopted by some banks and fund managers are continuing to impact the sector's access to finance.",
      "They said ESG rules, which can prevent investment in oil, tobacco and other sectors deemed unethical, had generally driven \"positive change\" in the economy.",
      "But they added that financial institutions should \"rethink ESG mechanisms that often wrongly exclude all defence investment\".",
      "The letter was co-ordinated by the Labour Growth Group, a group of MPs formed last year in part to push the government to deliver major infrastructure projects.",
      "'Way of life'",
      "Some investment funds have adopted specific rules against investing in weapons manufacturers and others have broader rules obliging them to consider the risk that investment could lead to human rights breaches.",
      "But some analysts have pointed out that attitudes on the ethics of investing in the sector appear to have shifted in recent years, with the share of ESG funds holding shares in defence and aerospace firms on the up compared to 2022.",
      "The previous Conservative government had also sought to encourage defence investment, with former prime minister Rishi Sunak arguing there is \"nothing more ethical than defending our way of life\".",
      "The Investment Association, the trade body for UK investment managers, signed a statement last year stating that investment in \"good, high-quality, well-run defence companies\" was compatible with ESG considerations.",
      "Banking rules",
      "In their letter, the MPs and peers also argued that defence firms faced \"unnecessary barriers to doing business in the UK,\" echoing longstanding complaints from the sector about access to finance.",
      "ADS, the industry lobby group, has previously argued that defence firms face higher regulatory barriers when it comes to securing bank accounts and loans.",
      "These include rules obliging banks to run enhanced money laundering checks for defence and security companies, and to make sure they are not financing weapons banned under international treaties.",
      "The group has also said defence companies can often find it harder to provide relevant documents to banks because of national security considerations.",
      "Finance UK, a group representing British banks, acknowledged that compliance rules could prove \"complex\" but said banks provided a \"significant range of support\" to defence companies.",

    "story": [
      "A national policing unit has been criticised for telling local forces to block the release of information under laws designed to safeguard the public's right to know.",
      "The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has advised forces not to reveal information on topics including the use of banned surveillance software and the spread of super-strength drugs, the BBC has found.",
      "Campaign group Big Brother Watch said the NPCC team \u2013 known as the central referral unit (CRU) \u2013 was acting like an \"authoritarian censor\" rather than a public body.",
      "The CRU said it acted in line with legislation and only recommended how local forces should respond to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests.",
      "The BBC was alerted to the unit's involvement in local forces' FOI responses while researching the spread of potent synthetic opioids.",
      "Sixteen forces - more than a third of the UK's total number - had given us details about crimes linked with the drugs, but then retracted their responses at the unit's request.",
      "The unit argued the information would undermine national security as it could be exploited by drug traffickers.",
      "Our subsequent investigation found the CRU had advised local forces on 1,706 occasions in the first three months of 2024 - equivalent to one in every 11 requests submitted to forces in that time.",
      "On another occasion, it cited concerns about \"negative press\" when advising forces to retract earlier responses and instead neither confirm nor deny if their officers had used the facial recognition search engine PimEyes, according to documents obtained by Liberty Investigates.",
      "The software has been banned by Scotland Yard.",
      "Jake Hurfurt, the head of research and investigations at Big Brother Watch, said pressurising police forces to retract data was \"the practice of an authoritarian censor not an accountable public body\".",
      "\"It is alarming that the NPCC is going beyond giving advice to individual forces and instead seemingly orchestrating how every force responds to sensitive transparency requests,\" he said.",
      "The CRU said it was legitimately discussing \"negative press\" or \"media attention\" when researching what information was already published, but those factors did not influence whether it favoured disclosure.",
      "It also said it had had a smaller volume of work in each year since 2020.",
      "What is Freedom of Information?",
      "FOI laws came into force in the UK in January 2005 and allow anyone to apply to government or public bodies to see information, such as crime statistics or details on expenditure.",
      "Using those laws, citizens can ask for information from people in power - sometimes including details they might prefer had stayed a secret.",
      "The Freedom of Information Act presumes each request should lead to information being disclosed, unless a legal exemption applies.",
      "Our investigation revealed the CRU did not follow the so-called \"applicant-blind principle\" when responding to FOI requests.",
      "The principle states everyone should get the same level and quality of response, regardless of whether it is their first request or they use the act regularly in their work.",
      "The CRU, however, recorded whether requesters were members of the media and their organisation.",
      "It said it was not subject to the applicant-blind principle because it was only an advisor, but would stop the practice from March 2025.",
      "It also said it could not share records of when it had conducted public interest tests or if and when it had favoured the disclosure of information that was in the spirit of FOI laws.",
      "Akiko Hart, director of human rights advocacy group Liberty, said: \"It's incredibly concerning that police have continually tried to downplay, hide and rescind information that is in the public interest.",
      "\"At a time when public trust in police is at an all-time low, transparency in their actions has never been more important. The police have a statutory duty to provide information held by them when requested by the public and journalists, and must not try to circumvent this.\"",
      "In 2022, an independent review was conducted into a separate government unit that advised other departments on their FOI responses. The review found poor practice and recommended the unit's replacement.",
      "The so-called Clearing House was part of the Cabinet Office. It was alleged to have profiled journalists and treated their FOI requests inappropriately.",
      "The review rejected its approach of circulating the names of requesters who had asked the same questions of several departments \u2013 a so-called round robin requester \u2013 to help it coordinate similar responses.",
      "The government's response was to say it would pilot a new system \"immediately\", but the BBC found the NPCC's CRU still matched names to round robin requests 18 months after the Clearing House recommendations were published.",
      "Claire Miller, former data journalism editor and an expert in FOI, said further investigation was needed as the CRU did not seem to be \"operating within the spirit of the FOI Act.\"",
      "\"It does not seem to have taken on board the criticisms of and recommendations for the Clearing House, which perhaps it should have done,\" she said.",
      "The NPCC declined to give an interview but instead issued a statement.",
      "Chief Constable Rob Carden, its digital, data and technology lead, said: \"Policing is firmly committed to being open and transparent. Compliance with the Freedom of Information Act 2000 is one important way we remain accountable to the public.",
      "\"We always strive to share as much as we can in our responses with a presumption to disclose.  However, there are circumstances where information cannot be disclosed and needs to be redacted, and on occasions withheld, to ensure police can continue to use tactics to protect the public or to prevent sensitive information being exploited by criminals to cause harm.  These instances are strictly sanctioned with clear parameters, as set out in legislation.\"",
      "He said complaints about how forces applied the FOI Act could be referred to the Information Commisioner's Office (ICO).",
      "A spokeperson for the ICO said the data watchdog had used its powers \"proactively numerous times\" in the last two years to ensure police forces were compliant.",
      "They said: \"We will continue to take action when necessary, including keeping under review whether any central co-ordination in this sector is having a negative impact on compliance with the law when we examine the complaints that come to us.\"",

      "\"The ICO has taken enforcement action against 15 police forces because of their FOI failings, which is more than one in three forces nationally, and is the worst record of any part of the public sector,\" he said.",
      "Surrey and South Yorkshire police were among the forces issued with enforcement notices in 2024 for failing to answer requests within the 20 days set out by law.",

      "He said: \"In the south, the boundary was originally the road between Leicester and Stamford.\"",
      "But Defra suggested it be extended because a company in Wellingborough, which had been making the pork pies for decades, objected as it would have been outside the area, Mr O'Callaghan said.",

      "\"It would not have affected anybody currently producing Melton Mowbray pork pies,\" he added.",

      "Defra's notice rejecting the application said: \"The proposed amendment would reduce the geographical production area and exclude certain producers from using the PGI designation.",

      "Mr Goff recalled how Sir Winston Churchill had criticised the agreement, then said of the US leader: \"President Trump has restored the bust of Churchill to the Oval Office. But do you think he really understands history?\"",
      "His comments were \"deeply disappointing\" and made his position \"untenable\", New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said.",
      "His comments came after Trump paused military aid to Kyiv following a heated exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week.",

      "Mr Goff is a veteran politician who had been high commissioner since January 2023. Before that, he served for two terms as mayor of Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, and was leader of the Labour Party from 2008 to 2011. He had also held several ministerial portfolios, including justice, foreign affairs and defence.",

      "And he concedes that it couldn't actually be delivered.",
      "This is just one of the \"lessons from Downing Street\" which the man who presided over the worst ever election defeat for the Conservative Party says he's learned, in a conversation lasting more than two hours for my Political Thinking podcast.",
      "It covers not only the mistakes he thinks he made, but also the disagreements about the right way to manage the economy that he had with Boris Johnson; the radical ideas he wishes he could've implemented; the lessons he learned from being chancellor during the Covid pandemic - and his attitudes to race and faith and Englishness as the first British Asian prime minister.",
      "Sunak is in reflective mood talking about a job he was catapulted into, saying he didn't \"probably have the time to enjoy it in the moment or appreciate it in the moment because of the context in which I was doing it.\"",
      "That context was not just an economic crisis but a political one.",
      "The Tories were on their third leader in just 50 days, and there'd been no election of party members or the wider public.",
      "\"I didn't have a mandate,\" he says, and defends his approach of trying to bring warring factions together.",
      "To do otherwise, he says, \"would have been a huge gamble because the thing just could have collapsed. And would that have been good for the country? I don't think so. I think what the country needed was stability.\"",
      "He's not changed his mind about wanting to deport migrants who cross the channel to Rwanda, and says he now backs leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), if it's not reformed.",
      "He says the court has \"taken on new powers. There's been mission creep...It does need to reform or we should leave.\"",
      "When I asked him if he had taken his eye off the ball in regards to soaring levels of net migration, he concedes that although he \"took very strong action to bring the levels of legal migration down\u2026I should have done them sooner\".",
      "Stopping small boats is a priority for people - Sunak",
      "'Stop the boats' slogan was error, says Cleverly",
      "How many people cross the Channel in small boats?",
      "Sunak was in many ways an accidental prime minister. It was October 2022, and he learned that Liz Truss had survived in the job for less time than that famous lettuce, whilst having a meal with his two daughters at TGI's in Teesside after a game of bowling.",
      "Four days later, he walked into Number 10 as her successor.",
      "He says he \"had very mixed feelings\u2026given what had happened\" but was driven by Hindu belief in dharma which he says involves \"doing your duty\".",
      "\"You've just got to focus on doing your best, doing what you're there to do, and not worry about the rest,\" he says.",
      "\"It was a very helpful concept for me\u2026I kept coming back to that. I said, 'look, this is my job. This is what I'm here to do. I'm well-placed to try and solve the economic challenge that our country is facing'.\"",
      "Bringing the economy back under control after the markets panicked in the face of Truss's unfunded tax cuts \u2013 or what he calls \"fantasy economics\" - is the achievement he's clearly proudest of.",
      "However, he spells out for the first time the scale of the disagreements he had not just with Truss, but with Boris Johnson, who he served as Chancellor.",
      "\"He and I had quite different views on economic policy. I'm a small state conservative. I believe in prioritising, trying to restrain the growth of public spending, being careful with our borrowing so that we can cut people's taxes...he was less worried about those things.\"",
      "He tells me that at their regular Sunday night dinners in Downing Street they argued over what could and could not be afforded.",
      "He says his worries were inflation and interest rates rising, because \"when they go up it's going to have a big impact on our public finances, because we're going to have to pay more to service the debt that we've got\".",
      "He adds: \"We cannot afford to keep spending and borrowing at this rate, and that means you have to prioritise. We can't do everything.\"",
      "Sunak insisted that any plan to subsidise people's social care costs had to be paid for by higher taxes.",
      "Now he thinks \"we're having another review now...I tell you, the answer is, do we as a country think it's right to pay more taxes for a more generous social care policy? Yes or no? I personally think the answer is no.\"",
      "He believed in slashing billions from welfare bills, a more \"radical restructuring of the state\" to pay for increased defence spending, and he says he told Johnson that the UK's net zero obligations were saddling the economy with cost.",
      "Now he argues for abandoning the legal commitment to deliver net zero, made law by another Tory leader Theresa May.",
      "During the Covid pandemic both Sunak and Johnson faced fixed term penalties for breaking lockdown rules.",
      "Sunak tells me he thought long and hard about resigning after that but says he had a job to do and he clearly can still scarcely believe that he was fined for turning up at a work meeting early where a cake was produced for the prime minister's birthday.",
      "Much more interesting is the lesson he draws from that period.",

    "story": [
      "So in the end Charles de Gaulle was right.",
      "As president of France in the 1960s, it was he who launched the policy of French strategic independence.",
      "Of course, he said, Americans were more our friends than Russians are. But the US too had interests. And one day their interests would clash with ours.",
      "In the world of today, his warnings have never seemed more clairvoyant.",
      "From his principle of superpower detachment, de Gaulle conjured the notion of France's sovereign nuclear deterrent \u2013 whose existence is now at the centre of debates over European security.",
      "France and the UK are the only two countries on the European continent which have nuclear weapons. Currently France has just short of 300 nuclear warheads, which can be fired from France-based aircraft or from submarines.",
      "The UK has about 250. The big difference is that the French arsenal is sovereign \u2013 i.e. developed entirely by France \u2013 whereas the UK relies on US technical input.",
      "On Wednesday President Emmanuel Macron aired the idea that France's deterrence force (force de frappe) could \u2013 in this highly uncertain new era - be associated with the defence of other European countries.",
      "His suggestion drew outrage from politicians of the hard right and left, who say that France is considering \"sharing\" its nuclear arsenal.",
      "That \u2013 according to government officials as well as defence experts \u2013 is a falsification of the argument. Nothing is to be \"shared\".",
      "According to Defence Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, the nuclear deterrent \"is French and will remain French \u2013 from its conception to its production to its operation, under a decision of the president.\"",
      "What is under discussion is not more fingers on the nuclear button. It is whether France's nuclear protection can be explicitly extended to include other European countries.",
      "Until now French nuclear doctrine has been built around the threat of a massive nuclear response if the president thought the \"vital interests\" of France were at stake.",
      "The limits of these \"vital interests\" have always been left deliberately vague \u2013 ambiguity and credibility being the two watchwords of nuclear deterrence.",
      "In fact French presidents going back to de Gaulle himself have all hinted that some European countries might de facto already be under the umbrella. In 1964 de Gaulle said that France would consider itself threatened if, for example, the USSR attacked Germany.",
      "So in one way there is nothing new in Macron suggesting a European dimension to France's deterrent.",
      "What is new, according to defence analysts, is that for the first time other European countries are also asking for it.",
      "\"In the past when France has made overtures [about extending nuclear protection], other countries were reluctant to respond,\" says Pierre Haroche of the Catholic University of Lille.",
      "\"They didn't want to send out the signal that they did not have complete faith in the US and Nato.\"",
      "\"But Trump has clarified the debate,\" Mr Laroche says. \"It's not that the Americans are talking of removing their nuclear deterrent \u2013 let's be clear, that does not seem to be on the table right now.\"",
      "\"But the credibility of US nuclear dissuasion is not what it was. That has opened the debate, and led the Germans to look more favourably on the idea of coming under a French and/or British umbrella.\"",
      "Last month the likely next German chancellor Friedrich Merz surprised the country's partners by saying it might be the moment for discussion with Paris and London on the subject.",
      "How a French or Franco-British European nuclear deterrent might operate is still far from clear.",
      "According to Mr Haroche, one option might be to position French nuclear-armed planes in other countries, such as Germany or Poland. The decision to press the trigger would still rest entirely with the French president, but their presence would send a strong signal.",
      "Alternatively, French bombers could patrol European borders, in the same way they regularly do French borders today. Or airfields could be developed in other countries to which French bombers could quickly deploy in an emergency.",
      "Numbers are an issue. Are 300 French warheads enough against Russia's thousands? Maybe not \u2013 but in an alliance with the UK 300 become 550. Also (to repeat the point) the American nuclear deterrent is still in theory in place. There are US nuclear bombs in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.",
      "Another question is whether to reformulate the French nuclear doctrine so as to state unambiguously that \"vital interests\" cover European allies too.",
      "Some say there is no need, because the strategic vagueness that exists already is part of the very deterrent.",
      "But Mr Haroche says there is a political dimension to stating more clearly that France will use its arsenal to defend other European countries.",
      "\"If the US is to be less present, then European countries will be depending much more on each other. Our strategic world becomes more horizontal,\" he says.",
      "\"In this new world it is important to build trust and confidence among ourselves. For France to signal it is prepared to take on risk in support of others \u2013 that helps create a solid front.\"",

    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has earmarked \"several billion pounds\" in draft spending cuts to welfare ahead of her Spring Statement, according to the BBC.",
      "When asked about the welfare budget, the Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood said: \"Our current situation is unsustainable\u2026 we've seen a huge rise in that welfare budget.\"",
      "BBC Verify has examined this budget and where the cuts might fall.",
      "How big is the welfare budget?",
      "Before looking at where the welfare budget might be cut, it is necessary to understand the size of the budget and how it has grown.",
      "At the time of the October 2024 Budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that total spending on health and disability benefits would rise from \u00a364.7bn in 2023-24 to \u00a3100.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "And the OBR projected that the biggest contributor to this increase would be from welfare spending on working-age adults, defined as those aged between 16 and 64.",
      "The OBR projected spending on this sector would rise from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "Why is the welfare bill growing?",
      "The OBR cited rising numbers of people coming on to incapacity and disability benefits as driving its latest forecasts.",
      "The forecaster is essentially assuming the trend of rising benefits claims in recent years will continue.",
      "In the five years after 2009-2010, more people were coming off incapacity benefits than on.",
      "But in recent years - and especially since the 2020-21 Covid pandemic - more people have been coming on to benefits than off them.",
      "And the OBR forecast the share of the working-age population in receipt of an incapacity benefit would rise from 7% in 2024 to a record high of 7.9% in 2029.",
      "The reasons for this are not totally clear.",
      "Some experts point to the damaging and lasting impact of the pandemic on physical health.",
      "Others reference the rise in mental ill health, especially among younger people.",
      "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has reported that the number of people aged 18 to 24 who are not in education, employment or training (Neet) rose to 907,000 at the end of last year, a 30% increase on the level before the pandemic in 2020 (although the ONS also cautioned the survey used to collect the data was potentially unreliable).",
      "Other experts place the emphasis on financial incentives in the welfare system - where people can get higher payments for being on sickness benefits than from being unemployed or in low-paid, part-time work.",
      "The standard allowance for a single person on Universal Credit is \u00a3311.68 per month. If someone is deemed to have \"limited capacity for work-related activity\", the criteria to receive incapacity benefits, they are eligible for an extra \u00a3416.19 per month on top.",
      "But there is no consensus on what's causing the trend.",
      "\"It is not yet known what factors are driving this increase,\" says Eduin Latimer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.",
      "\"Figuring out what is behind the recent rise must surely be a top priority for the government if it is going to be able to respond appropriately.\"",
      "Which elements of the welfare bill might be cut?",
      "Ministers have not said where they will seek cuts, but the largest element of the working-age welfare bill is incapacity or long-term sickness benefits - paid via Universal Credit or the legacy system of Employment and Support Allowance.",
      "If the government wants to make significant savings from the working-age welfare bill it will probably need to find some savings here.",
      "But the second largest single element of the working-age welfare bill is Personal Independence Payments (PIP) - a benefit for people under state pension age who need help with daily activities because of a long-term illness or disability. PIP claimants can be in work.",
      "In 2023-24, PIP totalled \u00a318bn and that's projected to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30. That would mean the number of claimants rising from 2.7 million to 4.2 million.",
      "As with the rise in the overall welfare bill, there's no consensus among experts on what's driving rising PIP claims, but this is also somewhere the government might well look to make some savings.",
      "The previous Conservative government had explored making it harder for younger people with mental health conditions to claim PIP.",
      "Can significant savings be made?",
      "Many experts, such as the Resolution Foundation think tank and the Institute for Employment Studies, agree that more working-age people should be helped and encouraged into work, and that there is a case for reform of the working-age welfare system.",
      "But some argue that making sustainable, long-term savings requires upfront government investment in employment support programmes - schemes which aim to help people overcome barriers to getting into work.",
      "Analysts also warn that reducing spending on the welfare bill has been historically difficult.",
      "At the 2015 general election, the Conservative manifesto promised to cut \u00a312bn from the annual welfare budget.",
      "While some significant savings were initially found, ministers were forced to change policy after a political backlash over some of the cuts.",
      "The OBR later concluded \u00a34bn of the \u00a312bn a year promised cuts had not been achieved.",

      "The documentary - which will air on BBC Scotland at 21:00 on Sunday and is available on iPlayer from Friday -  shows her discussing the condition and her last year at Westminster.",

      "For Black, the diagnosis of ADHD has had a \"life-changing\" impact on her life.",
      "She told Scotcast: \"It was massive because it felt as though someone had just handed me the instruction manual for my own brain, and suddenly I was able to think like, I'm not mad, I'm just wired differently.",
      "\"It allowed me to stop beating myself up so much because there were times when I would struggle to do things that other folk do effortlessly.\"",
      "Black compares the condition to the BBC's Sherlock series, where Benedict Cumberbatch's famous detective would use his \"mind palace\" to work out cases.",
      "\"It feels like there's constantly three conversations in my head \u2013 and a song,\" she laughs.",
      "However, Black told Scotcast she decided not to go public with her diagnosis at the time as it \"would get used against me\" in Westminster - an aggressive culture that her wife Katie was surprised by.",
      "She recalls: \"When she [Mhairi] started telling me about her experiences since being in parliament, I almost couldn't believe what I was hearing.",
      "\"It was very different to what I'd believed. I was surprised how isolated she was.\"",
      "Black recounts seeing punch-ups and bullying during her time as an MP, and although she raised concerns with her party, the support offered was not enough.",
      "She said: \"I think leadership at all levels have been aware of people who've been unhappy with how they've been treated, and I imagine most people would agree that we could be better at how we handle it.\"",
      "Elected as the SNP dominated the Scottish vote, her departure from Westminster came on a night when, in her own words, \"the SNP got an absolute doing\".",
      "Black felt the SNP's poor result happened due to \"in-fighting that was spilling out into the public domain\".",
      "She added that this was not helped by power being centred around leader Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell who was the party's chief executive.",
      "She said: \"The reason that I think it spilled out into the public was because a lot of people had hit their limit because they felt like their voices weren't being listened to within the party.",
      "\"There were a lot of folk who weren't comfortable with the idea of the chief executive and the leader of the party basically being a couple in one house.\"",
      "Black added she believed the SNP worked best when on the left politically, and that if the views of current deputy Kate Forbes became party policy there would be a \"mass exodus\" of members.",
      "Forbes is known for her conservative views on issues such as gay marriage, abortion and trans rights.",

    "summary": "The briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant.",
    "story": [
      "The government briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant, in several different ways.",
      "First, it confirms what had been rumoured - that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent forecaster, believes that the chancellor's 'headroom' has been eliminated.",
      "This is the \u00a310bn worth of leeway which, as of last October, the OBR believed the government had before breaking its self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "Why has that headroom disappeared? The government's clear view is that this is because of global factors  - tariffs being imposed by President Trump, broader uncertainty emanating from the new US administration, persistent inflation in the UK and elsewhere, and the rising cost of government borrowing.",
      "But there will be a big political argument about this.",
      "The Conservatives will contend that the cost of government borrowing was rising even before President Trump took office and that the tax rises in Reeves's Budget in October were a major factor, as well as in stunting growth.",
      "Chancellor set to cut welfare spending by billions",
      "Labour ministers tread carefully as welfare reform looms",
      "What is the OBR and why does it matter?",
      "Relatedly, it is worth stressing that this month was not meant to be a big economic moment for the government.",
      "Over recent years, a fiscal rhythm has developed where there is one Budget a year and then a second (spring or autumn) statement which also contains significant tax and spend measures and is akin to a mini-budget.",
      "Reeves wanted to end that, with an autumn Budget and then a much more limited event in spring at which the OBR published updated forecasts but the government did not respond with major economic measures.",
      "Government sources say that this will not be a fiscal event because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "Yet the Charter for Budget Responsibility, recently updated by the Labour government, said that it was committed to one major fiscal event a year in order to \"give families and business more certainty\" not only about tax but \"spending changes\" too.",
      "The government did reserve the right to change that approach \"in the case of an economic shock\".",
      "Does that mean the government believes the effect of President Trump has been an economic shock?",
      "There are clear political sensitivities in where the cuts are likely to fall. The Labour Party has many factions and ideological nuances but all of its MPs are committed to a generous welfare state and many will be antsy at the prospect of welfare cuts.",
      "Those in government are adamant, though, that the numbers - which are rising fast - of claimants and the amount being spent by government are simply unsustainable.",
      "There will be reform as well as cuts  - Reeves has identified what she sees as \"perverse incentives\" in the system.",
      "In a preview of the potential rows to come, one Labour MP, speaking on the condition of anonymity, was critical, saying: \"There is always money for war, yet none left for the most vulnerable to lift them out of hardship.\"",
      "\"Austerity is a choice. Poverty is a political choice,\" they added.",
      "However others, including from the left of the party, said they recognised the welfare system was \"old fashioned\" and needed reform.",
      "\"We have people who can work but don't just automatically because the system is inflexible,\" one said.",
      "Notably the next target for cuts appears to be the civil service.",

      "President Trump's decision to pause military aid to Ukraine may well prove to be one of the most significant moments in the conflict since Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion.",

      "As we saw in the House of Commons on Monday, where MPs from different parties lined up to laud the prime minister for his sure-footed diplomacy, it is a strategy with broad support across the political spectrum.",

      "Towards the end of his statement in the Commons, the prime minister was asked about US media reports that Trump was considering withdrawing military aid.",
      "He replied that this was not his understanding of the US position. Evidently, this shortly turned out to be wrong.",
      "We now know that at some point later on Monday, Starmer and Trump spoke on the phone - their third phone call in four days.",
      "But we do not know whether Trump gave Starmer prior warning of his decision on military aid or not.",
      "It may be that Starmer tried to persuade Trump not to go ahead and failed. Or it may be that Trump did not tell Starmer what he was about to do.",
      "Neither of those scenarios would be especially positive for the prime minister.",
      "Vance comments row",
      "As it is, it seems Downing Street is still waiting on full details of the US administration's decision and how it will work.",
      "And it is worth stressing that this is a temporary pause in aid, not a permanent cessation. It may simply be another attempt by Trump to pressure Zelensky. The aid may resume.",
      "Or, this may be the clearest example that  - despite the unquestionable warmth Starmer has managed to foster with the US president - the fundamental frames through which they view this conflict and the western alliance more generally are irreconcilably different.",
      "Into this increasingly fraught transatlantic environment has come JD Vance, the US vice-president, scoffing at the idea Ukraine could be protected by \"20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\".",
      "So far only the UK and France have publicly committed troops towards policing any potential peace deal in Ukraine, and his comments were interpreted by many as having been a jibe at both countries.",
      "Vance has now insisted he was talking about other, unnamed countries - confining the diplomatic fallout for the time being.",
      "Yet even if Vance was referring to other countries which might be willing to take on some of the military burden of protecting Ukraine, it is hardly encouraging for the UK in its convening role in Europe if the response of the US vice-president is to mock their capabilities.",
      "Perhaps that is merely a more blunt-speaking approach from a new US administration determined to do away with niceties.",
      "After all, most European countries are now admitting themselves that their defence spending has been far too low for far too long.",
      "But all the signs suggest that before long, questions about Sir Keir Starmer's approach to Ukraine may give way to much more fundamental questions about Britain's place in a profoundly changed world."

      "It was supposed to spend 10 days searching for water ice, but the position of its solar panels and the cold temperatures of the rocky region mean it cannot recharge.",
      "Intuitive Machines partnered with US space agency Nasa to explore whether humans can live on the Moon.",

      "It is unlikely that the instruments on board can now be used, including a drill to penetrate the lunar soil, a hopping robot to explore a shadowed crater, and the first lunar antenna.",

      "But the ambitious mission still achieved milestones in ongoing exploration of the Moon.",

      "It is considered a difficult and risky area to land in.",
      "The sun is low in the sky and casts shadow that can confuse landers trying to touch down. And the amount of sunlight reaching the craft can limit how much electricity it produces in its solar panels.",

    "story": [
      "Butterfly populations in the US shrank by more than a fifth within the space of two decades, according to a new study.",
      "Numbers fell by 22% between 2000 and 2020, according to research by Binghamton University in New York.",
      "A third of species saw serious decline, with some, like Julia's Skipper, losing more than 90% of their populations.",
      "However, the researchers say butterflies may be able to recover if urgent conservation measures are taken.",
      "The study published in the journal Science measured butterfly \"abundance\" - the number of individuals of a species within a specific area. It analysed 12.6 million butterfly sightings from 76,000 surveys across 35 monitoring programmes.",
      "This included data from citizen science programmes like the North American Butterfly Association's Fourth of July counts.",
      "Using statistical models, they estimated population trends for 342 species.",
      "The results showed that 33% were in significant decline, with many exhibiting extreme losses - 107 species declined by more than 50%.",
      "\"While the results aligned with global trends, seeing the extent of the decline at such a large spatial scale was sobering,\" said Prof Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University.",
      "Some of the most affected species include the Florida white, Hermes copper, tailed orange, Mitchell's satyr, and West Virginia white, all of which have declined in abundance by more than 98% within the US.",
      "The West Coast lady, once a common backyard butterfly, has declined by 80%, raising alarm as even this highly adaptable species struggled.",
      "\"That's alarming because it suggests even common butterflies aren't safe,\" Prof Grames said.",
      "Habitat loss, pesticides, and climate change are key causes of this decline, according to the researchers.",
      "Butterflies are crucial pollinators, supporting plants and crops. Experts say their decline could disrupt food production and entire ecosystems.",
      "They also serve as indicators of environmental health - when butterfly numbers fall, it signals trouble for other species.",
      "Southwest US most affected",
      "Species are declining most severely in the US Southwest, one of the hottest and driest regions, researchers say. They believe drought may be a major contributor to these losses.",
      "\"Drought is a double threat - it harms butterflies directly and also affects their food and host plants,\" Prof Grames explained.",
      "The results could help drive important conservation efforts, such as prioritising species for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species and Endangered Species Act protection.",
      "Despite the decline, there is hope for recovery.",
      "\"Butterflies can recover quickly because they have short generation times. Small actions like planting wildflowers, reducing pesticide use, or even leaving part of a backyard unmowed can significantly improve their chances,\" Prof Grames said.",
      "She also stressed the need for government action.",
      "\"Insects are fundamental to life on earth, and we need conservation actions and policies that support insects.\""

    "summary": "Scientists have found a genetic cause of many labradors' - and some people's - tendency to overeat.",
    "story": [
      "Dogs that are constantly hungry and prone to being overweight share a common bit of biology with some obesity-prone humans.",
      "This is what UK scientists have discovered - identifying a genetic source of many labradors' - and some people's - tendency to overeat.",
      "Researchers found that changes in a particular gene, one of the building blocks of biological code that produces the blueprint for how our bodies work, alters the chemical signals that tell our brains we've had enough to eat.",
      "The scientists say their findings, published in the journal Science, reveal something \"powerful\" about the biology of obesity risk.",
      "\"By studying dogs, we've honed in on some interesting new biology here,\" explained lead researcher Dr Eleanor Raffan from the University of Cambridge's department of physiology, development and neuroscience.",
      "She added that the discovery showed that \"owners of slim dogs are not morally superior - and the same is true of slim people\".",
      "\"If you have a high genetic risk of obesity, you're prone to gaining weight unless you put a huge effort into not doing so. And those with low genetic risk just don't have to work so hard.\"",
      "This canine-human biological link came from the researchers' examination of the genetics of 250 labradors. The team looked for pieces of genetic code that were common in overweight dogs.",
      "They picked out one gene in particular - called DENND1B - that was associated with a higher body mass in the labradors. And when they searched through a library of genetic information from thousands of humans, they discovered that the same gene was associated with a higher body mass in people, too.",
      "Before this study of labrador genetics, Dr Raffan said, \"no one suspected that gene  had anything to do with obesity\".",
      "The gene interferes with a brain signalling pathway that helps regulate our appetite.",
      "Dr Raffan explained: \"It alters the predisposition to weight gain because it's tweaking a system that is involved in regulating how hungry we feel and how much energy we burn off.\"",
      "The findings could help in the future development of new drugs to tackle obesity. But the scientists say they reveal how much harder people - and owners of dogs - with this genetic predisposition have to work to offset its effects.",
      "Another member of the research team, Alyce McClellan, from Cambridge University  added that the results emphasised \"the importance of fundamental brain pathways in controlling appetite and body weight\".",

      "A group of weight loss drugs, that includes Ozempic, target some of this biology, and have exploded in popularity in recent years.",
      "What we've identified here is a different pathway [from the one targeted by those drugs],\" explained Dr Raffan.",
      "\"But it all speaks to the same important bit of biology, which is that obesity is not  about having low willpower.",
      "\"It's about the fact that some people are prone to weight gain because they have a genetic risk which increases their responsiveness to food and their appetite.",
      "\"This goes for dogs and humans alike -  they have a genetic drive to overeat.\""

      "The number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.",
      "Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.",
      "Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.",
      "But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.",
      "\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"",
      "What is a heat pump and how much do they cost?",
      "Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told",
      "Most UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases.",
      "With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.",
      "Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.",
      "About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support.",
      "One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.",
      "Ed Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.",
      "\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.",
      "In its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.",
      "Mr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive.",
      "\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.",
      "He also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.",
      "Despite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.",
      "But Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.",
      "\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.",
      "Madeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.",
      "\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.",
      "This explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.",
      "Ms Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.",
      "In a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills.",

      "The researchers in Israel say it transforms our understanding of how we are protected against infection.",
      "And gives a new place to look for antibiotics to tackle the growing problem of superbugs that resist our current drugs.",
      "The discovery centres on the proteasome \u2013 a tiny structure that is found in every cell of the body.",
      "Its main role is to chop up old proteins into smaller chunks so they can be recycled to make new ones.",
      "But a series of experiments, detailed in the journal Nature, shows the proteasome detects when a cell has been infected by bacteria.",
      "It then changes structure and role. It starts transforming old proteins into weapons that can rip open the outer layer of bacteria to kill them.",
      "Prof Yifat Merbl, from the Weizmann Institute of Science, told me: \"This is really exciting, because we never knew that this was happening.",
      "\"We discovered a novel mechanism of immunity that is allowing us to have a defence against bacterial infection.",

      "The research team went through a process they called \"dumpster diving\" to find these natural antibiotics.",
      "They were tested on bacteria growing in the laboratory and on mice with pneumonia and sepsis. The researchers said they were getting results comparable to some established antibiotics.",

      "More than a million people a year are estimated to die from infections that are resistant to drugs like antibiotics.",
      "Drug-resistant infections killing millions - study",
      "But despite the need, there has been a lack of research into developing new antibiotics to keep up with demand.",
      "Against that bleak background, having somewhere new to look is a source of optimism for some scientists.",
      "Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, told the BBC: \"It's a potential goldmine for new antibiotics, that's quite exciting.",
      "\"In previous years it's been digging up soil [to find new antibiotics], it is wild that it's something we have within us, but comes down to having the technology to be able to detect these things.\"",

      "Criticism has flooded in, including that engineering mammoth-like creatures is a big stretch from making mice hairier, as well as being unethical, and that the whole project is a publicity stunt.",
      "But the company says it has been misjudged and that the mouse is an important tool on the path to restoring Earth's depleted nature.",
      "Colossal Biosciences says that the experiments with hairy mice was a step towards genetically modifying elephants to be hairy and better able to withstand the cold.",
      "Its stated goal is to create herds of what it calls mammoth-like creatures to live in the arctic tundra. The company says the creatures' grazing habits would encourage grasslands to flourish and reduce the amount of carbon dioxide being released from melting permafrost.",
      "Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which is one of the main drivers of global warming.",
      "But critics say there are significant scientific challenges to overcome before these changes in mice can be tried out on elephants.",

      "She adds that the firm has other research programmes running in parallel, such as studying embryo development and creating artificial wombs for the genetically modified elephants to grow in, and which the company says will ensure that they achieve their target of creating cold adapted elephants in a few years.",
      "Prof Shapiro firmly disputes the allegation that the work is pointless. She says that the firm's plan to reintroduce extinct species, such as the Dodo and Tasmanian Tiger, as well as the mammoth, will fill ecological niches that have been lost, and so restore biodiversity and benefit the environment.",
      "The genetic tools it is developing in the meantime are already helping species at risk of extinction, she adds. These include developing a vaccine for elephants against a deadly virus; the creation of genetically modified marsupials in Australia known as quoll to be resistant to neurotoxins produced by the cane toad; and reintroducing genetic diversity in the pink pigeon in Mauritius.",
      "And Prof Shapiro says that elephants won't suffer. The team is developing techniques to screen only viable embryos, and she believes that they won't be treated as outcasts either.",
      "\"We really are only going to be changing a few letters in their DNA code. The elephants will be born to mothers who are not going to see them as freaks because they are going to be very much the same as them, just a lot more hair and can survive colder climates\".",

      "Criticism has flooded in, including that engineering mammoth-like creatures is a big stretch from making mice hairier, as well as being unethical, and that the whole project is a publicity stunt.",
      "But the company says it has been misjudged and that the mouse is an important tool on the path to restoring Earth's depleted nature.",
      "Colossal Biosciences says that the experiments with hairy mice was a step towards genetically modifying elephants to be hairy and better able to withstand the cold.",
      "Its stated goal is to create herds of what it calls mammoth-like creatures to live in the arctic tundra. The company says the creatures' grazing habits would encourage grasslands to flourish and reduce the amount of carbon dioxide being released from melting permafrost.",
      "Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which is one of the main drivers of global warming.",
      "But critics say there are significant scientific challenges to overcome before these changes in mice can be tried out on elephants.",
      "Colossal's co-founder and CEO, Ben Lam, told BBC News that the woolly mice marked a big step forward.",
      "\"We are on track to have the first cold adapted elephant by 2028 and that would mean having the first embryos by the end of 2026,\" he said.",
      "\"Over time we are going to have this entire lineage of cold adapted elephants that we can put back into the wild that can interbreed\"",
      "The woolly mice had eight of their genes modified: seven were adapted mice genes related to hair growth and the eighth was a mammoth gene related to increasing body fat.",
      "The researchers found that the animals had longer, curlier hair, but no evidence that the mammoth's fat-increasing gene had an effect.",
      "Colossal Biosciences work has been met with scepticism from scientists not employed by the company. Their concerns include:",

      "\"Validation that this works is really exciting for this project,\" says the firm's chief science officer, Prof Beth Shapiro.",
      "She adds that the firm has other research programmes running in parallel, such as studying embryo development and creating artificial wombs for the genetically modified elephants to grow in, and which the company says will ensure that they achieve their target of creating cold adapted elephants in a few years.",
      "Prof Shapiro firmly disputes the allegation that the work is pointless. She says that the firm's plan to reintroduce extinct species, such as the Dodo and Tasmanian Tiger, as well as the mammoth, will fill ecological niches that have been lost, and so restore biodiversity and benefit the environment.",
      "The genetic tools it is developing in the meantime are already helping species at risk of extinction, she adds. These include developing a vaccine for elephants against a deadly virus; the creation of genetically modified marsupials in Australia known as quoll to be resistant to neurotoxins produced by the cane toad; and reintroducing genetic diversity in the pink pigeon in Mauritius.",
      "And Prof Shapiro says that elephants won't suffer. The team is developing techniques to screen only viable embryos, and she believes that they won't be treated as outcasts either.",
      "\"We really are only going to be changing a few letters in their DNA code. The elephants will be born to mothers who are not going to see them as freaks because they are going to be very much the same as them, just a lot more hair and can survive colder climates\".",

      "However, some crypto enthusiasts have criticised the government for not being bolder, while others have raised question marks about the lack of transparency over the process.",
      "Sacks has ordered a full accounting of the federal government's existing crypto reserves, which he estimated at 200,000 Bitcoin alone. That's worth $17.5bn (\u00a313.6bn) at today's prices.",

      "It is also unclear whether the planned reserve could face legal hurdles, or if it might require an act of Congress.",
      "The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited in the reserve, said Sacks, and will instead keep it as an asset. While the reserve will exclusively contain Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies will go into a separate stockpile.",

    "summary": "Despite opposition investors are still looking at deep-sea mining technology.",
    "story": [
      "There's one. And another. This robot was hunting for rocks. A three-pronged claw descended from above and plucked a stone off the seabed.",
      "All the while, the autonomous machine's on-board camera scanned for creatures that might be resting on those rocks, to avoid snatching an innocent lifeform from its habitat.",
      "The test, carried out in a harbour in November, demonstrated one approach to mining for polymetallic nodules, potato-sized lumps containing metals scattered on the seabed in vast quantities, in much deeper parts of the ocean.",
      "Such metals are sought-after for use in renewable energy devices and batteries, for example. But deep-sea mining is a controversial means of obtaining them because of its potentially significant environmental impacts.",
      "\"We felt that a vehicle that used AI to look for life and avoid it could have much less of an environmental footprint,\" explains Oliver Gunasekara, co-founder and chief executive of Impossible Metals.",
      "The firm's system is 95% accurate at detecting lifeforms of 1mm or greater in size, he says.",
      "The robot's arms are similar to those that pick and place items in automated warehouses \u2013 they are optimised for speed. Plus, each claw kicks up a relatively small puff of sediment as it plucks its target off the seafloor. Impossible Metals aims to further reduce this disturbance.",
      "Such a system is not likely to convince everyone that deep-sea mining is a good idea, however.",
      "\"Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology,\" says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF.",
      "Deep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. \"If you're not sure what's down there, then leave it alone,\" says John Childs at Lancaster University. \"That's been the widespread position from science [to date].\"",
      "Scars left by mining experiments in the past, using highly disruptive technologies, have been severe.",
      "In 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later.",
      "Opposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies.",
      "Nautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019.",
      "Minerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition.",
      "Currently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact.",
      "No commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July.",
      "Mr Gunasekara's firm is currently building a larger version of its robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing claws.",
      "He adds that \"hundreds\" of such bots would need to harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to processing sites on land.",
      "Unlike some other methods, in which heavy subsea equipment is tethered to support ships, Impossible Metals' vessel would not have to remain in a precise spot for a long period, meaning its engines would not create as much noise. This would lessen the impact on wildlife, claims Mr Gunasekara.",
      "He also argues that deep-sea mining would reduce the need for mining on land: \"Anyone that doesn't want to do deep-sea mining is implicitly saying we need to do more land-based mining.\"",
      "Jovana Jovanova at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands is working on a different robot arm system that could gather metals from the seafloor. She stresses that those working in this field should seek to develop technology \"in sync\" with the environment.",
      "Some deep-sea materials might be removed using more invasive methods, however. Seabed Solutions, a Norwegian firm, is working on a saw-based device to extract mineral-containing crusts or layers. The company says it is trying to reduce the volume of sediment disturbed by this process.",
      "\"You shield the cutting area and you ensure that it is under pressure,\" says managing director B\u00e5rd Brekke J\u00f8rgensen. \"You have a suction head interface [on] your cutting tool.\"",
      "The Metals Company, a firm launched by former Nautilus Minerals investor Gerard Barron, is working on a different technique.",
      "Mr Barron, chief executive, is bullish about the company's prospects, despite the protests and lawsuits his firm has faced.  Among the problems is a class action lawsuit filed by investors over the company's reporting of proceeds from a partner company in 2023 -  Mr Barron says \"there's absolutely nothing in it\".",
      "Those calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining are \"virtue signalling\" he says, adding that the new Trump administration in the US may help his company.",
      "\"We have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration,\" says Mr Barron.",
      "The Metals Company intends to file an application for deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) later this year. The ISA is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities.",
      "Dutch company Allseas, which is working with Mr Barron's firm, has developed mining machinery for scooping polymetallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface.",
      "The Metals Company's own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of metres from the mining area, rather than many kilometres, and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time.",
      "Claims that sediment would be distributed many kilometres from the mining area were \"total nonsense\", says Mr Barron.",
      "Jeroen Hagelstein, a spokesman for Allseas, says his firm has adjusted the force of waterjets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimise sediment disturbance.",
      "Some sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean.  Mr Hagelstein says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometres rather than discarding it at the surface, though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact.",
      "Mr Barron acknowledges that his firm's machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules. \"If you're a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you, there will be an impact,\" he says. Though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind.",
      "Ann Vanreusel at Ghent University has studied deep-sea wildlife. She says the sought-after polymetallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures, which use them as a substrate. So even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance, pollution and noise, removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem.",
      "Dr Childs also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures. Mining could interfere with this, he suggests.",
      "And there's another issue. The market for metals metals sought by deep-sea mining firms is notoriously volatile, meaning the business case for deep-sea mining may not be as strong as some hope, says Lea Reitmeier at the London School of Economics.",

      "When BBC News contacted the CMA for a response to these comments, they pointed us to Mr Bamford's LinkedIn post, where he said: \"We are not blind to the length of time that this investigation has taken... We know pace matters to business confidence and investment.\"",
      "He added the reason this investigation took so long was because the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI had been changing over that time.",
      "In 2024, while Mr Bokkerink was chair, the CMA also issued similar \"found not to qualify\" decisions on other AI partnerships it reviewed involving firms including Microsoft, Amazon and Google.",
      "In April of same year, the CMA's chief executive Sarah Cardell said the body had \"real concerns\" about an \"interconnected web\" of AI partnerships between big tech firms.",
      "But in a set of instructions to the CMA issued in February, the government said it should prioritise \"pro-growth and pro-investment interventions\".",

      "She said it was \"reasonable to conclude\" that Hackman had died on 18 February.",

      "A relative latecomer to Hollywood, Hackman saw his breakthrough come in his thirties, when he was nominated for an Oscar for portraying Buck Barrow in 1967's Bonnie and Clyde - opposite Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway - and again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970.",
      "Both films saw him recognised in the supporting actor category. He was also nominated for best leading actor in 1988 for playing an FBI agent in Mississippi Burning.",

      "Brad Sigmon was shot to death just after 18:00 local time (23:00 GMT) on Friday by three state corrections department volunteers firing rifles at his chest with specially designed bullets.",
      "Sigmon, 67, was convicted of murdering David and Gladys Larke with a baseball bat in 2001 before kidnapping his ex-girlfriend at gunpoint. She managed to escape as he shot at her.",
      "He had requested death by firing squad over the other two state-approved methods of execution: electric chair and lethal injection.",
      "This story contains details of the execution, some of which are graphic",
      "Chrysti Shain, of the South Carolina Department of Corrections, said Sigmon was pronounced dead by a doctor at 18:08.",
      "Three members of the Larke family were present to witness his death, she said, as well as Sigmon's spiritual adviser.",
      "Sigmon was strapped to a chair, which had a basin underneath to catch blood,  witnesses said.",
      "He told witnesses he wanted his final statement \"to be one of love and a calling to my fellow Christians to help us end the death penalty\".",
      "\"An eye for an eye was used as justification to the jury for seeking the death penalty,\" he added.",
      "\"At that time, I was too ignorant to know how wrong that was.  Why? Because we no longer live under the Old Testament law but now live under the New Testament.\"",
      "After his final statement, a hood was placed over his head.",
      "A curtain that concealed three volunteers opened at 18:01. At 18:05, the trio fired from 15ft (4.6m) away without any countdown.",
      "Jeffrey Collins, a reporter for the Associated Press news agency, said at a news conference that Sigmon had a red bullseye target placed over his heart.",
      "When he was shot, his chest rose and fell several times, the reporter added.",
      "A doctor performed an exam that took about 90 seconds, before declaring him dead.",
      "The .308 Winchester Tap Urban bullets used are designed to break apart on impact and cause maximum damage. Medical experts have debated the amount of pain they may cause.",
      "Anna Dobbins, a reporter for WHFF-TV, added that Sigmon had worn a black jump suit but his bare arms had \"flexed\" when he was shot.",
      "All the shots were fired simultaneously, she said, and witnesses were unable to see the guns.",
      "Prison guards also offered witnesses ear plugs to protect their ears from the sound of the shots, added a reporter for the Post and Courier newspaper.",
      "Counselling services are being offered to any prison staff who were traumatised by the execution, said Ms Shain.",
      "Sigmon's lawyer, Bo King, had been hoping for a last-minute stay of execution by the South Carolina governor and accused the state of withholding information about the lethal injection process.",
      "\"Brad only wanted assurances that these drugs were not expired, or diluted, or spoiled - what any of us would want to know about the medication we take, or the food we eat, much less the means of our death,\" he said in a statement after his death.",
      "\"It is unfathomable that, in 2025, South Carolina would execute one of its citizens in this bloody spectacle.\"",
      "King said his client had been suffering from mental illness, and that the friendships he formed in prison were proof he had been rehabilitated.",
      "\"Brad is someone who, for his last meal, asked to get three buckets of original recipe Kentucky Fried Chicken so he could share with the guys that he's incarcerated with on death row,\" he told WYFF-TV earlier on Friday.",
      "\"With his last meal, he wanted to share something special with them,\" he said, later telling reporters that the request to share had been denied.",
      "Officials later confirmed his last meal as four pieces of fried chicken, green beans, mashed potatoes with gravy, biscuits, cheesecake and sweet tea. The meal was served on Wednesday evening.",
      "Since 1977 only three people had died by firing squad, all three of them in the state of Utah. The last to die had been Ronnie Lee Gardner in 2010.",
      "Ahead of Sigmon's execution, anti-death penalty protesters held a rally outside the jail in the city of Columbia.",
      "They held signs saying \"all life is precious\" and \"thou shalt not kill\".",
      "The state allows witnesses to observe the death from behind bulletproof glass, but the executioners are hidden from view to protect their identities.",
      "South Carolina passed a law in 2023 requiring that the identities of the execution team members remain secret.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 22:00:09 GMT",
    "summary": "Neuroscientists in Israel find signs that the drug helped festival survivors in the attack and the aftermath.",
    "story": [
      "As dawn approached on the morning of 7 October 2023, many of the partygoers at the Nova music festival near Gaza's border took illegal recreational drugs like MDMA or LSD.",
      "Hundreds of them were high when, shortly after sunrise, Hamas gunmen attacked the site.",
      "Now neuroscientists working with survivors from the festival say there are early signs that MDMA - also known as ecstasy or molly - may have provided some psychological protection against trauma.",
      "The preliminary results, currently being peer-reviewed with a view to publication in the coming months, suggest that the drug is associated with more positive mental states - both during the event and in the months afterwards.",
      "The study, carried out by scientists at Israel's Haifa University, could contribute to a growing scientific interest in how MDMA might be used to treat psychological trauma.",
      "It is thought to be the first time scientists have been able to study a mass trauma event where large numbers of people were under the influence of mind-altering drugs.",
      "Hamas gunmen killed 360 people and kidnapped dozens more at the festival site where 3,500 people had been partying.",
      "\"We had people hiding under the bodies of their friends for hours while on LSD or MDMA,\" said Prof Roy Salomon, one of those leading the research.",
      "\"There's talk that a lot of these substances create plasticity in the brain, so the brain is more open to change. But what happens if you endure this plasticity in such a terrible situation - is it going to be worse, or better?\"",
      "The research tracked the psychological responses of more than 650 survivors from the festival. Two-thirds of these were under the influence of recreational drugs including MDMA, LSD, marijuana or psilocybin - the compound found in hallucinogenic mushrooms - before the attacks took place.",
      "\"MDMA, and especially MDMA that was not mixed with anything else, was the most protective,\" the study has found, according to Prof Salomon.",
      "He said those on MDMA during the attack appeared to cope much better mentally in the first five months afterwards, when a lot of processing takes place.",
      "\"They were sleeping better, had less mental distress - they were doing better than people who didn't take any substance,\" he said.",
      "The team believes pro-social hormones triggered by the drug - such as oxytocin, which helps promote bonding - helped reduce fear and boost feelings of camaraderie between those fleeing the attack.",
      "And even more importantly, they say, it appears to have left survivors more open to receiving love and support from their families and friends once they were home.",
      "Clearly, the research is limited only to those who survived the attacks, making it hard to determine with any certainty whether specific drugs helped or hindered victims' chances of escape.",
      "But researchers found that many survivors, like Michal Ohana, firmly believe it did play a role - and say that belief, in itself, may help them to recover from the event.",
      "\"I feel like it saved my life, because I was so high, like I'm not in the real world,\" she told me. \"Because regular humans can't see all these things - it's not normal.\"",
      "Without the drug, she believes she would have just frozen or collapsed to the floor, and been killed or captured by the gunmen.",
      "Clinicians in various countries have already experimented with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in a trial setting -  though only Australia has approved it as a treatment.",
      "Countries that have rejected it include the US, where the Food and Drug Administration cited concerns about the design of the studies, that the treatment may not offer long-lasting benefits, and about the potential risk for heart problems, injury and abuse.",
      "MDMA is classified as a Class A drug in the UK, and has been linked to liver, kidney and heart problems.",
      "In Israel, where MDMA is also illegal, psychologists can only use it to treat clients on an experimental research basis.",
      "The preliminary findings from the Nova study are being closely followed by some of those Israeli clinicians experimenting with MDMA as treatment for PTSD after 7 October.",
      "Dr Anna Harwood-Gross, a clinical psychologist and director of research at Israel's Metiv Psychotrauma Centre, described the initial findings as \"really important\" for therapists like her.",
      "She is currently experimenting with using MDMA to treat PTSD within the Israeli military, and had worried about the ethics of inducing a vulnerable psychological state in clients when there is a war going on.",
      "\"At the beginning of the war, we questioned whether we were able to do this,\" she said. \"Can we give people MDMA when there's a risk of an air raid siren? That's going to re-traumatise them potentially. This study has shown us that even if there's a traumatic event during therapy, the MDMA might also help process that trauma.\"",
      "Dr Harwood-Gross says early indications of therapeutic MDMA use are encouraging, even among military veterans with chronic PTSD.",
      "It has also upended old assumptions about the \"rules\" of therapy - especially the length of sessions, which have to be adjusted when working with clients under the influence of MDMA, she says.",
      "\"For example, it's changed our thoughts about 50-minute therapy sessions, with one patient and one therapist,\" Dr Harwood-Gross told me. \"Having two therapists, and long sessions - up to eight hours long - is a new way of doing therapy. They're looking at people very holistically and giving them time.\"",
      "She says this new longer format is showing promising results, even without patients taking MDMA, with a success rate of 40% in the placebo group.",
      "Israeli society itself has also changed its approach to trauma and therapy following the 7 October attacks, according to Danny Brom, a founding director of the METIV Psychotrauma Centre at Herzog Hospital in Jerusalem, and a senior figure in the industry.",
      "\"It's as if this is the first trauma we're going through,\" he said. \"I've seen wars here, I've seen lots of terrorist attacks and people said, 'We don't see trauma here'.",
      "\"Suddenly, there seems to be a general opinion that now everyone is traumatised, and everyone needs treatment. It's a wrong approach.\"",
      "What broke, he said, is the sense of security many Jews believed Israel would provide them. These attacks uncovered a collective trauma, he says, linked to the Holocaust and generations of persecution.",
      "\"Our history is full of massacres,\" psychologist Vered Atzmon Meshulam told me. \"As a psychologist now in Israel, we are faced with an opportunity to work with lots of traumas that weren't previously being treated, like all our narratives for 2,000 years.\"",
      "Collective trauma, combat trauma, mind-altering drugs, sexual assault, hostages, survivors, body-collectors, the injured and the bereaved - Israel's trauma specialists are facing a complex cocktail of issues from the clients now flooding into therapy.",
      "The scale of that mental health challenge is mirrored in Gaza, where vast numbers of people have been killed, injured or left homeless after a devastating 15-month war - and where there are scant resources to help a deeply traumatised population.",
      "The war in Gaza, triggered by the Hamas attacks on Israeli communities in October 2023, was suspended in January in a six-week truce, during which Israeli hostages held by Hamas were exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.",
      "But there is little sense on either side that the peace and security needed to begin healing has arrived.",
      "The truce expired last weekend, with 59 Israeli hostages still in Hamas captivity. Many Gazans are waiting, with their bags packed, for war to resume.",
      "Meanwhile Nova survivor Michal Ohana says she feels that with the passage of time, some are expecting her to have moved on from the attacks, but she is still affected.",
      "\"I wake up with this, and I go to sleep with this, and people don't understand,\" she told me.",
      "\"We live this every day. I feel the country supported us in the first months, but now after one year, they feel: 'OK, you need to go back to work, back to life.' But we can't.\"",

      "Reports of Indians falling for employment scams and illegally entering other countries to look for work have become increasingly common.",
      "Perera, 47, had been accompanied by his brother-in-law Edison Charlas, who was injured in the incident. Mr Charlas was treated in hospital and spent a fortnight in prison before he was repatriated to India.",
      "The two men were from the southern Indian state of Kerala where they worked as auto-rickshaw drivers.",
      "An agent had promised them they could get blue-collar jobs in Jordan earning 350,000 rupees ($4,000; \u00a33,110) a month.",
      "Mr Charlas told the BBC he paid 210,000 rupees to an agent before they left India, and paid an additional $600 after reaching Jordan on a tourist visa.",
      "But when the two men arrived in Jordan's capital city Amman in early February, they were told by the agent that there were no jobs available.",

      "\"We were taken in a car. It was a long distance. We got into the car at 2pm and reached the location only around midnight. Then we were made to walk several kilometres along a coastline. It was while walking in the dark that we were shot,'' said Mr Charlas.",
      "The BBC has seen a letter sent to Perera's family by the Indian embassy in Jordan. It states that \"security forces tried to stop them but they did not listen to the warning, the guards opened fire on them\".",
      "\"One bullet hit Mr Thomas [Perera] in his head and he passed away on the spot.''",
      "Mr Charlas, however, disputed this account and said there was \"no such warning (from the guards). They just shot.''",
      "\"I was walking slowly behind the others in the dark... That was when the bullet hit me and I lost consciousness. I had no clue what happened to Thomas,'' he said.",
      "The BBC has asked India's foreign ministry and Jordanian authorities for comment on Mr Charlas' allegation.",
      "Mr Charlas said he was later taken to a hospital for treatment and then moved between several Jordanian government offices before being transferred to prison, where he was kept for 18 days.",
      "While in prison, he managed to contact his wife and told her what had happened, and his wife contacted Indian embassy officials.",
      "Mr Charlas was deported to India on 28 February.",
      "Perera's body is still in Jordan. In response to BBC queries, India's foreign ministry said they were working to bring the body back to India as soon as possible.",

      "He thought nothing of it when she took a seat close to his. Nor did he see the camera strapped to her shoulder, quietly recording.",
      "That morning, the woman had flown from Luton to Budapest to locate the mark. Dobrokhotov's flight information had been obtained in advance.",

An encrypted hard drive was left open. Telegram conversations were visible on Roussev's laptop.",
      "Among the masses of equipment, police discovered the business card of a one-time finance executive, Jan Marsalek.",
      "Roussev first met Jan Marsalek in 2015, introduced, he recalled, by a mutual acquaintance he had met at the offices of a British investor and wealth adviser. In emails from that time seen by the BBC, Marsalek enlists Roussev's help in acquiring a secure mobile phone from a Chinese company.",
      "Then, Jan Marsalek was the respected chief operating officer of German payments processing company Wirecard. While reports criticising Wirecard's business practices had started to appear in the Financial Times,  the company's reputation as a star performer in the European fintech sector, valued in excess of \u00a320 billion at its peak, was intact.",
      "Now, he was directing operations as Roussev's controller on the run from fraud charges - the subject of an Interpol red notice - following the company's 2020 collapse.",
      "Together, the pair conceived operations targeting journalists, dissidents, politicians, even Ukrainian soldiers thought to be training at a US military installation in Stuttgart. They discussed selling US drones captured from Ukrainian battlefields to China. And they did it for Russia.",
      "Linked to the state's intelligence services, Marsalek is believed to be hiding in Moscow. He faces no charges in the UK.",
      "The group Roussev employed, all Bulgarians, were not the spies of popular imagination.",
      "Alongside Dzhambazov, a medical courier, and Ivanova, a laboratory assistant, he employed a beautician with a salon in Acton, Vanya Gaberova; a painter and decorator, Tihomir Ivanchev; plus an MMA fighter nicknamed \"The Destroyer\" who wore his fights on his face, Ivan Stoyanov.",
      "A neighbour who knew two of the accused was sceptical they could be guilty. They were too stupid and didn't know anything, the neighbour asserted, though they admired the fighter's \"enormous calves\".",
      "But they were not ineffective \u2013 Roman Dobrokhotov recognised none of the group's faces when pictures were shown to him by police.",
      "The group operated a clear hierarchy. Roussev reported to Marsalek, who reported to his \"friends in Russia\". Roussev managed the rest of the Bulgarians, who he referred to as his \"minions\", Dzhambazov chief among them.",
      "\"There are no bosses here,\" Dzambhazov wrote, as he issued instructions to Ivanchev.",
      "Nonetheless, \"minion\" was attached to the decorator's number in Dzhambazov's phone.",

      "Between August 2020 and February 2023, Marsalek and Roussev exchanged 78,747 messages on the Telegram messaging app.",
      "They reveal at least six operations the spy cell was tasked with over a period of years \u2013 four of which targeted individuals who were enemies of Putin's regime.",
      "As well as Dobrokhotov, the Bulgarian investigative journalist Christo Grozev was watched at home in Vienna. Cameras in the window of a rented apartment nearby were trained on his front door.",
      "He was tailed on flights and photographed in a Valencia hotel eating breakfast with co-founder of the Bellingcat investigative collective Elliott Higgins.",
      "A thorn in the side of Russian intelligence services, he was observed in Bulgaria meeting with an arms trader who had been the victim of an assassination attempt Grozev linked to the Russian state.",
      "Gaberova was instructed to befriend him.",
      "In Montenegro, the cell searched for Kirill Kachur, who had worked for the Investigative Committee of Russia until he fell foul of the Kremlin. They were anxious to impress. A second Russian intelligence team circled, including a chain-smoking blonde woman referred to only as \"Red Sparrow\".",
      "Marsalek and Roussev discussed the kidnap and murder of both Grozev and Kachur. It wasn't an empty threat \u2013 a colleague of Kachur's had separately been taken to Moscow.",

      "When confronted, the MMA fighter claimed he was working for a Kensington hospital, delivering tests. The next day, an NHS logo had been placed in the windscreen.",
      "Prosecutors said providing information on a political dissident like Ryskaliyev \"is predicated on Russian attempts to control diplomatic relations\".",
      "Indeed, Marsalek would further task Roussev with another project: a hare-brained scheme to initiate a staged protest at the Kazakh Embassy featuring blood dropped from drones, an astroturf human rights campaign involving Just Stop Oil, a letter addressed to the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, advertising on London buses and unrealised deepfake pornographic video of the Kazakh president's son. Russia would then help nervous Kazakh security services \"uncover\" the \"activists\" responsible.",
      "In February 2022, Telegram exchanges between Marsalek and Roussev reveal a preoccupation with following Christo Grozev to Kyiv, where he was believed to have travelled.",
      "Their offers to help were rebuffed.",
      "Fewer than three weeks later, Russian tanks surged across Ukraine's eastern, southern and northern borders.",
      "Later that year, Marsalek asked Roussev if one of the cell's three IMSI grabbers \u2013 sophisticated communications interception equipment \u2013 could be deployed to spy on Ukrainian soldiers in Germany. Roussev promised to retrieve it from his \"Indiana Jones garage\", where it was \"gathering dust\".",
      "Marsalek returned to the idea repeatedly.",
      "By February 2023, Roussev and Marsalek were plotting to send Dzhambazov and \"one more person\" to Stuttgart, where they believed Ukrainian soldiers to be training on Patriot missile systems.",
      "Had they successfully deployed and captured Ukrainian troops' mobile phone data as planned, they might have used it to pinpoint those same troops on the battlefield \u2013 leading Russian forces to Western-supplied Ukrainian air defences.",
      "\"This was espionage activity of the highest level of seriousness,\" prosecutor Alison Morgan KC told the jury at the Old Bailey.",
      "Before their plans could be put into action, they were arrested \u2013 Dzhambazov, Ivanova, Gaberova and Stoyanov in London, Roussev in his guest house.",
      "Though Ivanchev identified himself to police outside Gaberova's flat, he would not be arrested for another year.",
      "In his first police interview, he told officers he had spoken to MI5 in the interim. The interview was paused.",
      "None of the six denied their actions.",
      "Roussev, Dzhambazov and Stoyanov pleaded guilty before trial. Ivanova, Gaberova and Ivanchev denied knowing they were working for Russia.",
      "The jury disagreed.",
      "Ivanova, Gaberova and Ivanchev were found guilty after the jury deliberated for over 32 hours. Ivanova was also found guilty of possessing multiple false identity documents.",

      "As part of Denmark's increased defence spending, it's bolstering its strength in the \"High North\" with an extra two billion euros announced in January and three new Arctic naval vessels and investment in long-range drones.",

      "The serenity of his room reflects the temperament of a man who grew up in a settlement of just \"seven or eight people\" in the Nuuk fjord of the island.",
      "But a key reason his homeland is now coming under increasing scrutiny from outsiders is the rich mineral deposits beneath the Arctic ice.",
      "We've seen how Ukraine's natural resources have caught President Trump's eye in much the same way.",
      "\"All these minerals that they talk about like rare metals, rare earth elements - they are actually not rare. What is rare is the use of them,\" he reasons.",
      "Prof Rosing says the vastness of Greenland and the lack of infrastructure are just two elements why the island may not be the cashpoint some Americans are hoping for.",
      "\"They are a minuscule part of the mining industry and the economy of extracting them is very uncertain, whereas the investment to start extracting is very high. The risk of the investment is too high relative to the potential gain.\"",
      "The current Greenlandic government says there will be a vote on independence at some point following next week's election.",
      "Although surely unintentional, President Trump's designs on the island have shone a light on a desire found among the Inuit to finally break free from 300 years of Danish control.",
      "But Prof Rosing believes, despite all the latent mineral wealth, his fellow Greenlanders are in no hurry to forego the annual block grant of the equivalent of \u00a3480m (\u20ac570m) it receives from Copenhagen.",
      "This accounts for easily more than half of the island's public budget.",
      "\"People talk about health services, schools, the next outboard engine they want on their boat and what is the price of gas and all of these things that normal people do,\" he says.",
      "\"It's not like they stand up with a big knife, wave it in the air and shout independence, independence.\"",
      "In terms of Trump's apparent obsession with taking Greenland, Fogh Rasmussen fears there may be a troubling conclusion to be drawn.",
      "One that would render the Danes unable to do business with a man whose view on territorial integrity is so wildly incompatible from theirs.",
      "\"I understand very well the American strategic interest in the minerals, but when it comes to mining in Greenland, they have shown no interest,\" he says.",
      "\"That leaves me with the concern that maybe it's not about security, maybe it's not about minerals, maybe it is just a question of expanding the territory of the United States.",
      "\"And that's actually a point where we are not able to accommodate President Trump.\"",

      "Osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease that causes pain and stiffness, typically affects older people, but can strike at any age.",
      "\"I couldn't believe it when I was diagnosed. My biggest fear was, what happens to life now?\" Joshuanette says.",
      "Good Humans' far-reaching work ranges from pushing for the establishment of an equal rights tribunal to preside over purported discriminatory practices, to a recycling programme that in turn employs local residents with disabilities.",
      "The latter has already been implemented in more than 80 local schools, diverting about a million bottles and cans from the national dump site. Eight people have been hired to sort and process, and sometimes repurpose, the waste.",

      "\"Change starts with us. I was amazed to see how much plastic we diverted from landfill in a short space of time; imagine if everyone did it,\" she says.",
      "There have been some smaller triumphs too. Like the case of the 10-year-old girl who for several years couldn't use the toilet at school unassisted because of the lack of wheelchair-friendly facilities. That indignity went largely overlooked until Joshuanette took it on as a personal endeavour, leading to the creation of an accessible bathroom.",
      "\"We must shift the way we do things. People with disabilities must be able to do the same things everyone else can,\" Joshuanette says passionately. \"I'm so excited by what I know Good Humans can achieve.\"",

      "Both Bernard's group and Good Humans have been calling for legislation passed in 2017, which seeks to protect the rights of those with disabilities, to be enforced. An equal rights tribunal was a key part of the act, but has never been created.",
      "\"There's a lot of discrimination; people are treated with indifference or turned away from employment opportunities,\" Bernard says. \"And due to poverty, most don't have money to hire lawyers.\"",
      "Bernard lost his right leg when his motorbike was struck by a drunk driver in 1996. Despite a lengthy court case, which ruled in his favour, he has never received compensation.",
      "\"After years of torment, I now rally for a better society,\" he explains. \"We have to alter our mindset with how we view people with disabilities. We've been leaving them out for too long. Even now, I see high-rise buildings going up with no disability access,\" he adds.",
      "Kelly Hedges, principal of the Victory Centre for children with special needs, agrees. Her school currently has 27 students aged five to 18.",
      "\"The challenge is, when students leave us as young adults, where do they go? People are still wary about hiring people with special needs or disabilities. Unless they have personal connections or can go to work with a parent, they generally just stay home,\" she says.",

      "\"As Good Humans becomes bigger and needs more staff, hopefully our children can segue into positions there, become contributing members of society and live more independently,\" Kelly adds.",

      "\"I'm glad that we're getting rid of American products and supporting local businesses,\" Ms Russell told the BBC on Thursday. \"I think it's an important thing to do.\"",

      "Although Trump has since lifted some of the tariffs imposed this week and put others on pause until 2 April, many Canadians say the damage has already been done.",
      "After Thursday's reversal, foreign minister Melanie Joly told CNN that Canada has been shown \"too much disrespect by the Trump administration at this point, calling us a 51st state, calling our prime minister 'governor.'\"",

      "The potential impact is devastating enough that the Canadian government has announced it will bring in relief measures, similar to those implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic, to help impacted individuals and businesses.",
      "Even with the tariffs being scaled back temporarily, the uncertainty alone is hurting both American and Canadian economies, says Rob Gillezeau, an assistant professor of economic analysis and policy at the University of Toronto.",

      "Aiken said that contrary to what the perception might be, it was not \"a holiday\".",
      "\"You need to be over your brief and able to talk authoritatively and you need to have the answers to those questions \u2013 and you will be asked lots of questions and you will have a lot thrown at you,\" he said.",

      "Former Sinn F\u00e9in politician M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Muilleoir knows about both the benefits of being in the room and the disappointment of missing out.",
      "The publisher of the Irish Echo attended the White House twice in that role, but did not travel to Washington during his time as Northern Ireland's finance minister, after the Stormont Executive collapsed two months before the 2017 festivities.",

      "The tradition has continued and is an opportunity for the leader of a country as small as the Republic of Ireland to meet the US president face to face.",
      "A special relationship?",
      "Apart from helping to develop a positive relationship between the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United States, it is slightly harder to pin down direct outcomes from the yearly visits - after all, there is a lot more to the relationship than just St Patrick's Day.",
      "In the 1990s, in particular, the visits were seen as important in the process that eventually led to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, which largely ended the worst of three decades of violence known as the Troubles.",

      "By the turn of the century that had fallen to 169,600.",
      "The end of the Troubles also meant fewer headlines about Northern Ireland.",

    "summary": "Data from India's second Time Use Survey shows that women still do far more domestic work than men.",
    "story": [
      "A new Bollywood film - Mrs - has once again laid bare a stark reality: even in well-educated households in India a woman's role is often confined to unpaid domestic work.",
      "The protagonist, married to a gynaecologist, finds herself trapped in an endless cycle of cooking, cleaning and caregiving. Her dreams are sidelined not by force, but by relentless criticism and quiet coercion.",
      "While the film, which is a remake of the hit Malayalam movie The Great Indian Kitchen, has sparked conversation - and pushback, especially from men on social media - its themes resonate with hard data.",
      "A recent government survey reveals that Indian women spend over seven hours a day on unpaid domestic and caregiving work - more than twice the time men do. Data shows that women spend 289 minutes on unpaid domestic work and 137 minutes on unpaid caregiving, whereas men spend 88 minutes on chores and 75 minutes on care work.",
      "They also spent less time than men doing paid work and engaging in self-care activities.",
      "What's disappointing is that the last such survey which came out six years ago had similar results. Despite the government launching campaigns to empower women,  the situation hasn't changed much.",
      "India's Time Use Surveys (TUS) track how people spend their time across various activities. Surveyors gather data nationwide by asking individuals aged six to 59 how they spent the previous day. The first TUS was released in 2019, with the second published last week.",
      "When the government released findings from the second Time Use Survey (TUS), it highlighted two key shifts: women aged 15 to 59 spent 10 minutes less on unpaid domestic work, while their participation in employment and related activities rose by just over three percentage points.",
      "The survey concluded this marked a \"shift from unpaid to paid activities\" for women - a positive sign that they were spending less time on domestic chores and more time in paid employment.",
      "However, economists argue this isn't necessarily true. Even if it is, the slight drop in domestic work suggests women are still juggling paid jobs with a heavier load of unpaid work than men.",
      "Ashwini Deshpande, an economics professor at Ashoka University, says TUS data should be analysed alongside India's Female Labour Force Participation Rate (FLFPR) for a deeper understanding of how women spend their time. FLFPR measures the percentage of women aged 15 and above in the labour force.",
      "According to government data, the FLFPR grew from about 23% in 2017-2018 to 37% in 2022-2023. Prof Deshpande says that this increase is not solely due to an increase in employment opportunities for women, but has also been spurred by economic distress.",
      "\"Women are not waiting for their time spent on domestic chores to reduce to take up jobs. Research shows that women want to work to supplement household incomes and so they end up working 'double-shifts', doing paid work outside the home and unpaid work inside,\" Prof Deshpande says.",

      "Coronavirus: How India's lockdown sparked a debate over maids",
      "Coronavirus in India: Did men do more housework during lockdown?",
      "Indian women aren't alone in shouldering a disproportionate share of household and caregiving work -  it's a global reality. However, the gap in time spent on domestic work is significantly wider in India.",
      "Where globally women spend about 2.8 hours more than men on domestic and care work, for Indian women, this difference is closer to four hours.",
      "Sociologists attribute this to India's deeply patriarchal society, which continues to enforce strict gender norms. Even among the educated elite, women remain confined by roles upheld and perpetuated not just by men, but also by women.",
      "This rigid enforcement of gender roles doesn't just shape women's lives - it also shapes the way stories about them are received.",
      "So, while Mrs struck a chord with many, it also faced sharp criticism - especially from men on social media.",
      "A men's rights group accused it of \"spreading toxicity\" against traditional joint families, while others dismissed its premise altogether.",
      "Kajol Srinivasan, a Mumbai-based comedian, says the film ruffled feathers because it held up an uncomfortable mirror to society.",
      "She told the BBC how her father, who quit his job at 40 to take over household duties while her mother continued working, quickly realised that housework was no easy task.",

      "She believes that women are expected and raised to accept this lower rung of power.",
      "\"When Indian men talk about what they like about their wives and mothers, it often has a lot to do with how much they have sacrificed for them or how much they take care of them or the home,\" Ms Srinivasan says.",
      "India's Time Use Survey shows that social change is slow, and it may take time before women spend less on domestic work.",
      "In the meantime, films like Mrs spark conversations around everyday questions many prefer to avoid - like, who's doing the dishes?"

    "story": [
      "New Mexico officials have announced the cause of death for actor\u00a0Gene Hackman\u00a0and his wife Betsy Arakawa, a week after they were found dead\u00a0at their home in Santa Fe. Hackman died of heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor, and Arakawa died several days before him of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Chief Medical Investigator Dr. Heather Jarrell said Friday.",
      "Investigators had been trying to determine a cause of death for the couple since they died in their home last month.",
      "How did Gene Hackman die?",
      "Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 65, were found dead in their home in a gated community in Santa Fe on Feb. 26, but appear to have died earlier in the month.",
      "Hackman likely died around Feb. 18, when the last activity was detected on his pacemaker, Jarrell said during a Friday news conference.",
      "An autopsy determined that Hackman died of heart disease and also suffered from advanced Alzheimer's. He tested negative for hantavirus.",
      "\"He was in a very poor state of health,\" Jarrell said. \"He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that is what resulted in his death.\"",
      "Arakawa likely died first, with Feb. 11 being the last time that she was known to be alive, Jarrell said. People with hantavirus infections can initially feel flu-like symptoms for roughly three to six days and then start to have fluid in and around their lungs.",
      "\"At that point, a person can die very quickly, within 24-48 hours, roughly speaking, without medical treatment,\" Jarrell said. \"It's not uncommon to find someone down on the floor as part of a terminal collapse, so to speak, and that may very well have been what happened.\"",
      "Asked if Hackman was aware of his wife's passing, Jarrell said: \"That question's difficult to answer, but I can tell you that he was in an advanced state of Alzheimer's and it's quite possible that he was not aware that she was deceased.\"",
      "There was no food in Hackman's stomach, meaning he had not eaten recently before he died, Jarrell said. She didn't find evidence of dehydration.",
      "Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said there was no indication of a caretaker at the home.",
      "What is hantavirus?",
      "Hantaviruses are found worldwide, carried by rodents and transmitted from animals to humans, Dr. Erin Phipps, the state public health veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department, told reporters Friday. The hantavirus found in New Mexico is found throughout the state, primarily in deer mice but in other rodents too, Phipps said.",
      "The hantavirus strain in the Southwest has a mortality rate of about 38%-50%, Jarrell said. Hantavirus can be contracted from exposure to excrement from a mouse species that carries the virus.",
      "\"Avoiding contact with or breathing in aerosolized rodent urine or feces, especially in a poorly ventilated area, is key,\" Phipps said.",
      "The various strains in the U.S. aren't transmissible from person to person.",
      "A hantavirus infection is characterized by flu-like symptoms, including fever, muscle aches, cough and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea that can progress to shortness of breath and heart or lung failure, Jarrell said.",
      "The illness is rare, with the state Health Department reporting there were only seven confirmed cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in New Mexico in 2024. In the last 50 years, officials have identified 136 infections in New Mexico residents, including five in Santa Fe County.",
      "\"This is a serious disease \u2014 42% of these infections here in New Mexico were fatal,\" Phipps said. Most infections occur around the home or workplace, she said.",
      "State health investigators conducted a risk assessment of the couple's property Wednesday, Phipps said. While the main residence itself was deemed a low risk for hantavirus exposure, signs of rodent entry were found on other structures on the property, she said.",
      "Investigation into Hackman's and Arakawa's deaths",
      "Mendoza said last Friday there were no apparent signs of foul play in the deaths. The initial findings from the autopsies found no external trauma on either of the bodies, Mendoza said.",
      "Hackman's body was found in a mudroom near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses nearby, according to an affidavit for a search warrant.",
      "The sheriff's office found medication for blood pressure and thyroid issues as well as Tylenol during a search of the home, according to an inventory of the search filed in court. Some pills were scattered on a bathroom countertop near where Arakawa's body was found, according to the affidavit. Mendoza wouldn't say who was prescribed the medication, citing patient privacy laws.",
      "One of the couple's three dogs also was found dead in a crate near Arakawa, while their two other dogs were found alive. Phipps said the dog may have died from dehydration or starvation. Dogs don't get sick from hantavirus, she said.",
      "Investigators also collected two cellphones from the home and a monthly planner, Mendoza said. No surveillance cameras had been found at the home, according to the sheriff.",
      "\"I think everybody here understands that they were very private individuals and a very private family,\" Mendoza said.",
      "The sheriff's office said Tuesday that the company that provides natural gas service for the home made no significant findings after looking for gas leaks and carbon monoxide, the colorless, odorless gas that can be fatal by depriving people from getting enough oxygen. Mendoza said last Friday that both bodies tested negative for carbon monoxide.",
      "Hackman, who won Oscars for his performances in 1971's \"The French Connection\" and the 1992 Western \"Unforgiven,\" was honored at Sunday's Academy Awards in Los Angeles.",

      "How did Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa die?",
      "Hackman died of heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributory factor, New Mexico's chief medical investigator, Dr. Heather Jarrell, said at a news conference on Friday, March 7.",
      "\"He had very extensive heart disease,\" she said.",
      "Arakawa's cause of death was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a severe respiratory illness, Jarrell said. Hantavirus is spread mainly by rodents, and infections are rare, but Jarrell noted the strain in the Southwest has a high mortality rate of about 38-50%.",
      "It does not spread from person to person, and Hackman tested negative for hantavirus, Jarrell said.",
      "Both Hackman and Arakawa tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning. They also tested negative for COVID-19, the flu and other common respiratory viruses, Jarrell said.",
      "How long had Hackman and Arakawa been dead?",
      "\"There is no reliable scientific method to accurately determine the exact time or date of death,\" Jarrell said.",
      "But with data from Hackman's pacemaker, which showed the last record of heart activity on Feb. 18, \"it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Hackman probably died around Feb. 18,\" she said.",
      "Arakawa's last known communication and activity was on Feb. 11, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said. She had an email conversation with a massage therapist and was seen at a local grocery store, CVS and pet food store before returning to her home, he said.",
      "Based on that information, Jarrell said it is \"reasonable to conclude\" Arakawa died before Hackman, but the exact day was not known.",
      "A search warrant issued on Feb. 26, the day Arakawa and Hackman's bodies were found, states the two showed signs of decomposition, bloating in the face and mummification of hands and feet.\u00a0Mummification preserves a body after death and can happen naturally when the skin dries out, according to the National Library of Medicine.",
      "It is unclear what Hackman knew during the time between Arakawa's death and his own. He showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer's disease, Jarrell said.",
      "Where were Hackman and Arakawa found?",
      "Hackman and Arakawa were found dead in their home outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico, according to deputies who responded to the house at about 1:45 p.m. local time on Feb. 26.",
      "Hackman was found in what is believed to be the home's mudroom. It appeared he had fallen suddenly, the search warrant says. He was found wearing sweatpants, a long-sleeve T-shirt and slippers.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom near the front door of the home, according to the warrant. The door to the bathroom was opened.",
      "Arakawa was on the ground, wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt. An opened orange prescription bottle and scattered pills were seen on a countertop near Arakawa, the warrant says.",
      "The pills were a thyroid medication that had been taken as prescribed, Jarrell said. They were not believed to have contributed to Arakawa's death.",
      "Hackman and Arakawa's dog also found dead",
      "One of Hackman and Arakawa's dogs was found dead in a closet of the bathroom where Arakawa's body was discovered, the warrant says. Mendoza said the dog, named Zinna, was in a kennel or crate.",
      "As of March 7, investigators were awaiting autopsy results for Zinna. Arakawa had picked Zinna up from a veterinary hospital on Feb. 9 after a procedure, Mendoza said.",
      "Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, New Mexico State Veterinarian Erin Phipps said at the March 7 news conference.",
      "There were two other dogs found alive on the property when deputies arrived, the warrant says.",
      "How did Arakawa get hantavirus?",
      "Hantaviruses are primarily carried by rodents. Humans can become infected after exposure to urine, droppings or saliva from an infected rodent.",
      "It was not immediately clear exactly how or when Arakawa was infected.",
      "Her and Hackman's home had a low risk of exposure, \"similar to other well-maintained houses in New Mexico,\" Phipps said, but added there were signs of rodent entry in other structures on their property.",
      "Hantavirus initially presents with flu-like symptoms and can progress to shortness of breath. \"At that point, a person can die very quickly, within 24 to 48 hours roughly speaking, without medical treatment,\" Jarrell said.",
      "There was no known communication from Arakawa indicating she was feeling ill, Mendoza said.",
      "No signs of a carbon monoxide leak",
      "There were no obvious signs of a gas leak at the home, deputies said.",
      "Santa Fe Fire Department personnel and the New Mexico Gas Company conducted testing at the scene and did not find evidence of a carbon monoxide leak or problems with the pipes, according to the search warrant.",
      "The gas company issued five \"red tags,\" the sheriff's office said in an update on March 4. One was for \"a minuscule leak,\" or 0.33% gas in the air, at a stove burner, which is not a lethal amount, the office said. The other tags were for violations unrelated to gas leaks or carbon monoxide.",
      "Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that kills hundreds of people each year.",
      "No signs of foul play",

      "Oscar-winning costume designer Paul Tazewell says his creative process for \"Wicked\" began with abstract concepts, transforming the land of Oz through detailed costume design.",
      "\"That was where the idea of the spiral came into play for 'Wicked,' and the idea of the texture of mushrooms,\" Tazewell said. \"I am working to align those elements.\"",
      "The designer, who made history as the first Black man to win an Oscar for costume design, described how his approach focuses on character development.",
      "\"All of it is about telling stories through what my medium is, which is clothing, and making those characters visually more interesting or more specific,\" Tazewell said.",
      "His reimagining of the iconic witch's hat demonstrates his innovative approach.",
      "\"It was a number of things. One was that there's the moment when Glinda gives the hat to Elphaba, which is given as a joke,\" Tazewell explained. \"The way that John Chu wanted to start the film, he was describing it from the very beginning, that it would be, you would see it from a distance, and it would look like a mountain, and then you'd come in close and you realize it.\"",
      "The costume designer's journey began in the Midwest.",
      "\"We would sleep outside and behind our house in Akron, Ohio, and dream about what our lives would be as adults,\" Tazewell reflected. \"It was being, becoming famous, and, you know, leading a glamorous life... but I didn't know that it would give me the full, rich life that I've had, which has been being a costume designer, working with amazing talents, being able to tell really important stories.\"",
      "With this Oscar win, Tazewell expressed gratitude for the opportunity to inspire others.",
      "\"Being an inspiration for just all of the young people who find themselves in the world of costume and want to express themselves creatively. I mean, it's exactly where I came from, as well developing as a creative person, going from wanting to be a performer to wanting to be a costume designer, and finding my power in that. I'm so grateful.\"",

      "TV funnyman Conan O'Brien\u00a0took the stage as host of the 97th annual Academy Awards on Sunday night as the 2025 Oscar nominees competed for top honors.",
      "O'Brien inherited hosting duties from fellow comedian and late-night star\u00a0Jimmy Kimmel, who presided over the Oscars four times before.",
      "\"America demanded it and now it's happening: Taco Bell's new Cheesy Chalupa Supreme. In other news, I'm hosting the Oscars,\" O'Brien said in a statement when he was announced as host.",
      "O'Brien kept things moving in the broadcast and delivered some few comedic interludes, including a musical number in which he sang about not wasting the audience's time.",
      "The Oscars ceremony was broadcast on ABC on Sunday night from the Dolby Theatre at Ovation Hollywood, in Los Angeles. \"Anora\" went home with five awards, including best picture. See the full list of winners here.",
      "Who is Conan O'Brien?",
      "Conan O'Brien is best known for hosting the late-night talk shows \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien,\" \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" and \"Conan.\"",
      "O'Brien, now 61, spent nearly three decades as a late-night host. In 2015, he became the \"longest-working current late night talk show host\" in the U.S., following David Letterman's retirement, according to TBS.",
      "This was his first time as the Oscar host, but he has done the honors for other high-profile awards shows, including hosting the Emmys in 2002 and 2006.",
      "Before he became a well-known TV personality, O'Brien was a writer for \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons.\"",
      "Who hosted the Oscars in the past?",
      "O'Brien joined an illustrious list of Oscar hosts that includes the likes of Johnny Carson, Billy Crystal, David Letterman, Whoopi Goldberg, Chris Rock, Jon Stewart, Hugh Jackman and Neil Patrick Harris.",
      "\"He joins an iconic roster of comedy greats who have served in this role, and we are so lucky to have him center stage for the Oscars,\" said Craig Erwich, president of the Disney Television Group, when O'Brien was named.",
      "Jimmy Kimmel, Whoopi Goldberg and Jack Lemmon have each hosted the show four times, while three-timers include Jerry Lewis and David Niven.",

      "That year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences decided against having a host for the first time in 30 years and didn't have an official host again until 2022, when Regina Hall, Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes co-hosted the ceremony.

    "summary": "As host of \"The Tonight Show\" for 30 years, Johnny Carson was the king of late-night TV. But the public rarely saw his private side. A new biography, \"Carson the Magnificent,\" examines the late-night host's enduring impact, and his difficulties off-camera.",
    "story": [
      "It may not look like much now, but once upon a time, Stage 1 at the Burbank Studios was where the king of comedy held court, addressing his subjects at the end of each day. Johnny Carson presided over not just late night, but American popular culture.",
      "\"Johnny Carson was the biggest star in America,\" said writer Mike Thomas. \"Movie stars, rock stars, I don't think anybody was bigger than Johnny, because he was on night after night after night.\"",
      "Thomas' new book is \"Carson the Magnificent,\" a biography of Carson his late friend Bill Zehme started.",
      "Everybody who was anybody appeared on \"The Tonight Show,\" and 17 million Americans tuned in \u2013 many from their beds. It was Johnny Carson vs. sleep, and sleep usually lost. \"It did!\" said Thomas. \"I think Johnny brought a lot of people peace at the end of the day. People love to laugh, but I think he gave them hope that the world would go on the next day no matter what was happening.\"",
      "His audience \u2013 more than triple the size of all three current network late-night shows combined \u2013 made him the national agenda setter of the 1960s, '70s, and '80s.\u00a0 \"Johnny would say things and do things that became water cooler conversation the next morning,\" said Thomas.",
      "It also made Johnny the pre-eminent Hollywood talent broker for several generations. Fifty-seven years after comedian Robert Klein made the first of his 97 appearances on \"The Tonight Show,\" he's still grateful for the rocket fuel career boost that Carson's imprimatur provided. \"He's one of the most important people in my life, and we were not personal friends,\" Klein said.",
      "For his career, Klein said Carson was the most important: \"Appearances on that show were everything. I am a creature of 'The Tonight Show.' That was the vertebra of my career.\"",
      "Comedian George Wallace knew what was on the line when he did Carson: an invitation to \"The Tonight Show\" was a necessary bullet point on his resume \u2013 and each appearance was a climb up comedy's Everest. And then, when the routine would end, comedians would look nervously at the desk, waiting to see if Carson gave then the OK. \"Always got that,\" said Wallace.",
      "I asked, \"Were you looking for it?\"",
      "\"Hell, yeah. I was looking for it!\" he said.",
      "But what he was also looking for was a gesture from Carson to come over to the couch. \"I didn't get that,\" he said.",
      "Forty years later, this big-time comedy headliner still feels he didn't make the \"Tonight Show\" summit. I asked, \"What did that mean to get called over?\"",
      "\"That meant that you're in,\" said Wallace. \"You got called over, you're in the club.\" He said the fact that he did get that \"kinda hurts today.\"",
      "All that power, rested in the hands of a complicated man: master connector at work, cold and aloof at home. \"I think there were two Johnnys to a certain degree,\" said Thomas. \"On screen, impossibly cool guy. But there was also the side of Johnny that was introverted off-screen. I think some of the aloofness may have been introversion.\"",
      "In Mike Wallace's classic \"60 minutes\" profile in 1979, Carson acknowledged the dichotomy. He said, \"If I pulled out my old high school annual book and read some of the things, people might say, 'Oh he's conceited, he's aloof.' Actually that was more shy. See, when I'm in front of an audience, it's a different thing.\"",
      "Life with no audience was challenging for Carson. He was married four times. \"Johnny needed to be married for some reason; he needed to be with someone,\" said Thomas. \"He didn't need to stay married. They would fall out. Johnny's behavior would pry them apart. They just never lasted.\"",
      "But actress Dyan Cannon has a different story to tell. \"Aloof and cold? Never.\" She described him as \"Warm, open, willing. I've never known anyone like him. I've never known anyone like Johnny.\"",
      "And this from a woman who was married to Cary Grant. \"Cary was more of an enigma,\" said Cannon. \"Much more of a, 'Can I approach him or can't I?'\u00a0 But people would approach Johnny as if he were family.\"",
      "\"So, it was a different kind of star?\" I asked.",
      "\"There was nobody as big a star as Johnny.\"",
      "In a \"Tonight Show\" episode from October 1985, where Cannon and Carson are chatting, she flustered the normally unflappable Carson as she held his hand. \"Hi, sweetheart,\" she said.",
      "\"We've gone out a couple of times, right?\" he said.",
      "Cannon erupted in laughter \u2013 as did Cannon today, re-watching the video. \"He still makes me laugh,\" she said.",
      "Asked what exactly was going on there, Cannon laughed again: \"Well, you will never know! You will never, never know!\"",
      "\"You gotta give me a little somethin' here.\"",
      "\"Oh, no, I don't!\" she laughed.",
      "To hear her tell it, this was not a man who had trouble understanding women. \"How do I describe a relationship where you're so intimate with somebody, and yet, you haven't been intimate physically? We were closer than that.\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you describe it as a love affair?\"",
      "\"Yes, absolutely, a love affair,\" Cannon said. \"Absolutely. Real love. Physically, we were never together. But spiritually, we were.\"",
      "\"In some ways, it sounds like you're describing the love of your life?\"",
      "\"Isn't that interesting?\" said Cannon. \"Wow. Hope you're hearing this, Johnny!\"",
      "Maybe Carson was just like so many of us, full of contradictions \u2026 only ours aren't examined by millions under the brightest lights our culture has to offer. Whoever Johnny Carson was, safe to say, in our deeply fragmented culture, there will never be another.",
      "As Mike Thomas put it, \"We're all siloed. We're all watching things that either confirm our own biases or that are attuned to our own specific sense of humor. There will never be that communal experience again where people watch the show at the same time and then talk about the show the next day. It was a communal experience. That was part of the magic of Carson: community.\"",

    "summary": "Many actors have launched their careers in horror movies. But two of our most acclaimed stars are now headlining a low-budget horror film: \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" about a psychopath terrorizing his fellow nursing home residents with a sinister doll puppet.",
    "story": [
      "It might be known as winter elsewhere, but in Hollywood, they call it \"awards season\" \u2026 and just about everyone's in town for tonight's grand finale. One of the stars of \"Conclave,\" John Lithgow, is looking forward to it. \"Yes, I haven't been to the Oscars in years.\"",
      "Lithgow says he really likes playing the bad guy.",
      "\"Everything you do seems like it's a lot of fun for you,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I try to find things that are fun,\" Lithgow said. \"I don't go looking for them. They come to me. By now, I'm on a short list of actors, who is well known for being ready, willing, and able to do just about anything. So, wild roles come my way. Nothing normal!\"",
      "Also in town: esteemed actor Geoffrey Rush. He might live Down Under, but he's picked up a few awards up here, including a Tony, an Oscar, and an Emmy, or as he puts it, \"a TOE.\"",
      "We got both Rush and Lithgow in the same room to talk about something they've done together. In \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" Rush plays a wheelchair-bound stroke patient recovering in a nursing home, and Lithgow is the merciless bully who terrorizes his fellow residents, often with a sinister doll puppet, named Jenny Pen.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" click on the video player below:",
      "If it looks like a low-budget horror film, that's because it is!",
      "\"Lot of times, this is how people get their start in the business \u2013 they do a low-budget horror movie,\" I said.",
      "\"This is where we ended up!\" said Rush.",
      "\"Geoffrey's just one of the great actors,\" said Lithgow. \"And you just read the script and said, 'This is a hell of a double act.'\"",
      "\"I thought I was reading for the doll!\" said Rush.",
      "Lithgow's character starts out as merely sinister, and quickly graduates to terrifying. It's the classic horror film villain, and for Lithgow, a role with teeth.",
      "Rush said, \"Typical John, he said, 'I've had some teeth made.' And I thought, 'You're my kind of actor,' because really, the first time I saw the face, I just went, 'This guy is creepy.'\"",
      "\"Look, we're in the impact business,\" Lithgow said. \"You're after making people laugh, cry, or scream out in terror. And this was scream-out-in-terror time, with deep feeling sort of invested in it.\"",
      "Lithgow's been evoking deep feelings for more than half a century. But before he was the acclaimed movie star. He was the acclaimed stage actor, the guy in David Storey's play \"The Changing Room\" who made winning a Tony look easy, picking up the award just two weeks after making his first appearance on a Broadway stage. \"I think I must have the record for the quickest win sprint from Broadway debut to a Tony Award,\" he said.",
      "Rush has a similar story: He also won a Tony for his Broadway debut, 2009's \"Exit the King.\" And the movie \"Shine,\" about real-life pianist David Helfgott, was only his second feature film. He still can't believe he took home the Oscar for best actor. \"It still doesn't make sense,\" he said.",
      "But it was hardly beginner's luck. Both Rush and Lithgow have had once-in-a-lifetime roles \u2026. again and again.",
      "I asked, \"Has there ever been a role that the guy sitting next to you had that you looked at and said either, 'Wow. That was perfect,' or, 'Ooh, I wish I could have played that'?\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"I don't know. I defer to an actor who does a much better job than I could possibly do in that role. I was the second choice for Hannibal Lecter. If Tony Hopkins had turned it down, it was coming to me. And there's no way I could have played that part as well as he did.\"",
      "\"Wow, that's a bold statement,\" said Rush.",
      "\"It's true! And I feel that way about Geoffrey in 'Shine.' That was his role. It belonged to him. And there's no point being \u2026\"",
      "\"What John doesn't know is that I got offered most of the roles that he's got first!\" Rush laughed.",
      "Truth is, just about any role they play is iconic. And with director James Ashcroft's \"Jenny Pen,\" they get to do something extra-special: act their age.",
      "Rush recalled, \"I said to James Ashcroft, 'How old is this judge in the film?' He said, 'How old are you now?' I said, 'I'm 73.' He said, 'Let's make him 73.' And that's the first time I've played my own age.\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"Geoffrey and I have the great advantage of having grown to a certain age where we are each other's only competition. You get the great old man roles dealing with big issues like mortality and facing the loss of your own viability and the loss of your own cognition. It's been a blessing. I mean, my career has sort of aged along with me. And who would have believed I would still be going strong at this point?\"",

    "story": [
      "Health care is so expensive that 31 million U.S. adults, or 12%, had to borrow a total of $74 billion last year to obtain medical care, new data shows. That includes people with health insurance, making such numbers even more troubling.",
      "Almost one-third of the more than 3,500 people surveyed by Gallup and West Health, a group of nonprofit health care organizations, said they're \"very concerned\" that a major health event would lead to medical debt despite most of them having some form of health care coverage.",
      "The survey results underscore how exposed individuals and families can be to financial hardship just to pay for essential health care services.",
      "\"What's very visible here is families are forced to take out loans and borrow to cover expensive care that is needed,\" Tim Lash, president of West Health, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These big numbers are concerning, but the humanity is lost in the billions and trillions as we reduce this down to what the lived experience is of the American individual and families.\"",
      "To avoid taking on debt, families sometimes make tradeoffs, such as purchasing fewer groceries or not paying rent in order to get the care they need, Lash added.",
      "Nearly one in five adults between the ages of 18 and 28 reported borrowing money to pay for health care, according to the survey. Only 9% of Americans between 50 and 64 and 2% of those 65 or older reported having to borrow money to obtain needed medical care.",
      "\"There are a lot of disparities in terms of who borrows,\" Lash said. That's in part because Medicare, which is available to people who are 65 or older, provides enrollees with relatively comprehensive coverage.",
      "As of mid-2024, U.S. residents owed at least $220 billion in medical debt, according to data from the American Hospital Association. Health care bills have for years been a leading cause of personal bankruptcies.",
      "\"We need reforms to find savings that can trickle down to the individual, so that these circumstances \u2014 of making what should be unnecessary tradeoffs \u2014 aren't the condition moving forward,\" Lash added.",

      "The resignation of Thomas Corry, a Trump administration appointee, was first reported by Politico. Corry did not respond to multiple requests from CBS News for comment.",
      "Corry's departure came just days after Kennedy faced criticism for how he handled a question about the growing measles outbreak in Texas at a White House Cabinet meeting, calling it \"not unusual\" and misstating the number of deaths reported in the state.",
      "A former HHS official and a person familiar with Corry's thinking said that he had voiced disappointment with how Kennedy handled the question. It was a missed opportunity, making headlines for appearing indifferent to the deadly outbreak.",
      "But Corry's frustrations extended beyond that, as his office triaged a deluge of inquiries on agency actions ranging from canceled vaccines meetings to stalled research funding.",
      "Unlike previous officials in the role, who usually closely work with the secretary, Corry had been cut off from Kennedy, one former HHS official said. Federal officials said they were unsure if Corry had the trust of Kennedy or his inner circle, undermining his authority.",
      "In an interview with Fox News that aired Tuesday, Kennedy claimed he never met Corry and did not know much about his former top spokesperson.",
      "\"I think that individual had personnel problems and was about to be terminated, and so they may have made up a story to explain their termination, and then, you know, quit before he got that news,\" Kennedy said.",

    "summary": "A new study finds that long, unproductive meetings can lead to \"meeting hangovers,\" affecting workflow and productivity.",
    "story": [
      "A recent Harvard Business Review\u00a0article identified a phenomenon called \"meeting hangovers\" which new research shows can derail productivity well beyond the meeting itself.",
      "A survey conducted by University of North Carolina Charlotte and other institutions found that more than 90% of employees occasionally experience these \"meeting hangovers,\" with over half reporting that these negative effects hurt their overall workflow and productivity.",
      "\"A meeting hangover is the idea that when we have a bad meeting, we just don't leave it at the door. It sticks with us and it negatively affects our productivity,\" said Steven Rogelberg, a professor at UNC Charlotte and author of \"The Surprising Science of Meetings.\"",
      "The study found that employees often ruminate about bad meetings and feel compelled to share their frustrations with colleagues, creating what Rogelberg terms \"co-rumination\" that can spread negative impacts throughout an organization.",
      "Common factors contributing to negative meeting experiences include unnecessary meetings that could have been emails, irrelevant agenda topics, poor facilitation, too many attendees, excessive length, domination by a few participants, and unclear decisions.",
      "Rogelberg recommends several strategies to prevent meeting hangovers:",
      "\"Keep the attendee list as small as possible,\" Rogelberg said. \"Remember that the more the leader talks, the lower the rating of effectiveness. Thus, the meeting leader needs to talk less and facilitate more.\"",
      "Rather than organizing agendas as topics to be discussed, Rogelberg suggests structuring them as questions to be answered.",
      "\"By framing agenda items as questions, you have a better sense of who really has to be invited to the meeting,\" he said. \"You know when to end the meeting and if the meeting has been successful \u2014 the questions have been answered.\"",
      "This question-based approach creates an engaging challenge that draws people in, he said, adding that \"if you just can't think of any questions, it likely means you don't need to create a meeting.\"",
      "For employees already suffering from meeting hangovers, Rogelberg suggests venting but centering on problem-focused conversations with colleagues.",
      "\"Chatting with your colleague about how to deal with the situation for the future, getting their thoughts, engaging in sense-making where you're trying to understand, taking different perspectives on what just happened \u2014 those types of conversations increase your skills and your resilience when you do have a bad meeting,\" Rogelberg said.",

    "summary": "The Social Security Administration said it will restart a policy that had caused financial distress for some beneficiaries.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) said it is reinstating a plan to recover 100% of overpayments to beneficiaries, a policy the agency abandoned last year after an outcry over cases in which the practice led some Americans to receive shock bills amounting to thousands of dollars.",
      "In a statement, SSA said late Friday that it will increase the default overpayment withholding rate for Social Security recipients to 100% of a person's monthly benefit, the same level that it had in place before last year's reform. The agency is required by law to claw back overpaid benefits.",
      "Because of public backlash over the 100% recovery policy, the agency last year had capped\u00a0the withholding rate for someone who had been overpaid at 10% of the person's monthly benefit. On Friday, the SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments, while the withholding rate for people with overpayments before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.",
      "\"People who are overpaid after March 27 will automatically be placed in full recovery at a rate of 100% of the Social Security payment,\" the agency said.",
      "The 100% clawback policy had sparked an outcry after instances in which beneficiaries were hit with surprise bills that demanded repayment within 30 days. In some cases, the bills were for tens of thousands of dollars. If beneficiaries were unable to immediately pay the bill, the agency could dock their entire monthly Social Security payment, leaving some people financially destitute, as reported by \"60 Minutes,\"\u00a0KFF Health News\u00a0and other media outlets,",
      "In many cases, the overpayments were the fault of SSA. A\u00a02022 report\u00a0by the agency's inspector general found that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "In the agency's new statement, SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek said it is the agency's \"duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding.\"",
      "He added, \"We have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people.\"",
      "Raising the clawback rate to 100% from its current 10% will increase the amount of recovered funds by $7 billion over the next decade, the agency said. SSA pays out about $1.6 trillion in benefits each year.",

      "Economists had forecast that the economy added 160,000 jobs last month, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate last month was 4.1%, slightly higher than the 4% rate forecast by economists polled by FactSet.",
      "Hiring has eased since December's blowout number of 323,000 new jobs, but the labor market has remained resilient at the start of 2025, experts say.",
      "What it means",
      "The February job figures suggest the labor market \"is showing signs of weakness with hiring across sectors,\" said Joe Gaffoglio, CEO of Mutual Of America Capital Management, in an email.",
      "He added, \"Deteriorating indicators like hiring intentions, new job listings and temporary staffing suggest a potential slowdown in employment growth.\"",
      "Notably, the widespread, ongoing cuts across the government sector also aren't reflected in today's report, according to Andy Stettner, an unemployment insurance expert at The Century Foundation. That's because unemployment claims for federal workers can take several weeks to appear in the official government data, he noted.",
      "Although the full impact of those cuts aren't yet visible in the data, federal employment declined by 10,000 last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday. The U.S. has more than 2 million federal workers.",
      "Layoffs across the U.S.\u00a0spiked last month to their highest levels since 2020, led by firings of federal workers ordered by Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency,\u00a0or DOGE,\u00a0 outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said on Thursday.",
      "Employers cut more than 172,000 jobs last month, a 245% increase from January and double the number announced during the same month a year ago, the company said. That marks the highest monthly number of layoffs since July 2020, when nearly 263,000 cuts were announced, the firm added.",
      "What the experts say",
      "The slightly weaker-than-expected February jobs report could prompt the Federal Reserve to resume cutting its benchmark rate, noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multi sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "The Fed in January hit the brakes on interest rate cuts, citing persistent inflation. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled the central bank is closely watching the labor market for signs of weakness, which could prompt additional rate cuts.",
      "The Fed will receive one more piece of major economic data ahead of its next rate decision meeting, scheduled for March 19, with the Consumer Price Index set to be released on March 12. The CPI likely rose 2.9% last month, slightly easing from January's 3% pace, according to FactSet.",
      "President Trump's tariffs are expected to boost prices for consumers, although they aren't likely to show up in inflation data for several months as Mr. Trump on Thursday paused 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada until early April.",
      "\"Overall, this report is a sigh of relief for the Fed as they can continue to sit on the sidelines for the next couple meetings as they assess the potential inflation impacts resulting from U.S. tariff policy over the coming months,\" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, in an email.",
      "Currently, only about 1 in 10 economists polled by FactSet expect the Fed to cut rates at its March 19 meeting. About half of those polled are forecasting a rate cut at the Fed's subsequent meeting, scheduled for May 7.",
      "\"The payrolls growth surprised slightly to the downside and the unemployment rate ticked up justifying the momentum that's been building for a resumption in the Fed's cutting cycle,\" Rosner noted.",

    "summary": "Powell says the Fed is in no hurry to change course, citing \"uncertainty\" over the impact of the Trump administration economic policies",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that the central bank can remain patient in adjusting its benchmark interest rate, citing uncertainty around the potential impact of President Trump's economic policies.",
      "Powell said the Trump administration is making policy changes in several areas, including trade, taxes, government spending, immigration and regulation, and added that the \"net effect\" of those changes are what will matter for the economy and the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"While there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high,\" Powell said at a conference in New York. \"As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\"",
      "Most economists say that Trump's plans to slap tariffs on a wide array of imports, including 25% duties on goods from Canada and Mexico that he partially delayed Thursday, will push up prices and slow growth. But many also expect that tax cuts and deregulation could boost the economy.",
      "Powell's comments pushed some traders to pare back their forecasts for how many interest rate cuts the Fed may deliver this year. They had been banking on at least three following a stream of weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy. But Powell reiterated the Fed is likely on hold for a while. That sent Treasury yields higher in the bond market.",
      "Rate reductions could help bring down borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, and business loans.",
      "President Trump in January pressed the Fed to ease borrowing costs, saying in a speech at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland that he planned to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\"",
      "Inflation expectations are key",
      "In a question and answer session, Powell acknowledged that typically tariffs would cause a \"one-time\" price increase, rather than persistent inflation, and the Fed could ignore such a temporary effect. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday made a similar argument: \"We could get a one-time price adjustment,\" Bessent said, before adding, \"I'm not worried about inflation.\"",
      "Yet Powell also said there were other considerations the Fed has to take into account when deciding whether to keep its rate unchanged, or even raise rates. For example, Powell suggested tariffs might have more than just a one-time impact \"if it turns into a series\" of tariff hikes, or \"if the increases are larger, that would matter.\"",
      "\"What really does matter is what is happening with long-term inflation expectations,\" Powell added. Powell noted that shorter-term expectations have risen, partly out of concern about tariffs, though longer-term expectations have been stable.",
      "Expectations that prices will rise can worsen inflation if they cause consumers and businesses to change their behavior in anticipation. Some companies might charge more when they expect their own costs to increase.",
      "When Trump imposed tariffs in his last administration, Powell noted, the Fed ended up reducing its key rate, \"because growth weakened so much.\"",
      "Economists with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley this week forecast that inflation is likely to edge up in 2025, citing the potential impact of tariffs and other Trump administration policies.",
      "\"Larger tariffs are also likely to hit GDP harder through their tax-like effect on disposable income and consumer spending and their effect on financial conditions and uncertainty for businesses,\" Goldman analysts wrote in a report.",
      "The cost of food, shelter and other items remains a top economic issue around the U.S., with the\u00a0soaring cost of eggs\u00a0becoming a national talking point. A recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0found that 77% of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping up with the pace of inflation.",
      "Powell says economy remains solid",
      "Powell said the economy remains mostly healthy despite \"elevated uncertainty.\" He characterized Friday's jobs report, which showed employers added 151,000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%, as in line with the \"solid\" gains of the past six months.",
      "He also noted that there were signs consumer spending has slowed compared with the healthy gains in the second half of last year, and said surveys of consumers and businesses \"point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.\" Further complicating matters, he acknowledged that measures of consumer sentiment \"have not been a good predictor\" of consumer spending in recent years.",
      "The Fed's own beige book, a collection of anecdotes from hundreds of businesses, mentioned uncertainty 47 times in its latest edition released Wednesday, up from just 17 times in January. The Fed publishes the beige book eight times a year.",
      "Powell spoke at a conference organized by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.",
      "President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policy and rapid-fire layoffs of government workers has created a spike in uncertainty among businesses and caused a sharp drop in consumer confidence. Many economists have marked down their estimates for the economy's growth to as low as 1% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from 2.3% in last year's final quarter.",
      "Yet as Fed governor Christopher Waller noted Thursday, there are \"good news\" cuts and \"bad news\" cuts. \"Bad news\" cuts occur if the Fed reduces rates out of concern that the economy is slowing, while \"good news\" reductions are those that reflect a sense by the Fed that inflation is returning to its target of 2%.",
      "Waller added that he still believes it will be possible for the Fed to engineer \"good news\" rate cuts later this year, though he dismissed the potential for a cut at the Fed's next meeting this month.",
      "After cutting its key rate three times last year to about 4.3%, Powell indicated in January that the Fed would pause any further cuts amid signs that inflation has remained stuck above its target. The central bank's preferred inflation gauge shows that prices rose 2.5% in January compared with a year ago. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.6%, the smallest increase since June.",

    "summary": "Experts say you could save thousands of dollars by buying a car now, versus later in 2025 if tariffs are enacted.",
    "story": [
      "Buying a car can be a fraught financial decision even in the best of times. Now, car shoppers are facing the added pressure of deciphering U.S. tariff policy.",
      "On Wednesday, President Trump issued a one-month delay for U.S. automakers on tariffs placed on imports from Canada and Mexico, trading partners that provide many of the car makers' vehicle parts and components. If the 25% levies are enacted, auto manufacturers will face higher costs and are likely to\u00a0pass on some of those price hikes to consumers, industry players say.",
      "The upshot, according to experts, is that consumers who are thinking of buying a car in the next year may want to consider buying a car sooner in 2025 rather than later. If the tariffs eventually take effect, car prices could rise by between $2,000 and $12,200 for some models, according to a recent estimate from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it, will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them,\" AEG CEO Patrick Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The timing of the tariffs remain uncertain, and it's possible that Mr. Trump could further delay the import duties on Canada and Mexico, while the U.S. could also shelve the trade measures if the sides reach agreement. Even if the tariffs are ultimately deployed in April, it's unclear how long they might remain in place, which adds to the uncertainty surrounding the import duties, according to Morningstar equity strategist David Whiston.",
      "Spreading the costs",
      "While certain car models source a greater share of their components from Canada and Mexico than others, automakers are expected to spread any added costs they incur across their vehicle lineups.",
      "\"If the tariffs are here, and permanent, by the time we get to summer we'd expect to see higher prices everywhere,\" Tyson Jominy, vice president of analytics at J.D. Power, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That means even U.S.-sourced and assembled vehicles with components that aren't subject to tariffs could see moderate price hikes.",
      "\"If we are talking about 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, prices will go up, and we are expecting most automakers to peanut-butter spread the impact across their entire portfolio, even if the vehicle is built in the U.S.,\" Jominy explained. \"The reality is that every automaker, regardless of where they final assemble, is likely to be affected if these parts tariffs go into effect.\"",
      "Automakers are likely to be strategic about how they implement price hikes in order to mitigate the effect on sales, experts say.",
      "\"Automakers will smooth costs out across their vehicle lineups,\" Edmunds head of insights Jessica Caldwell told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They won't increase one model's price by 40%. They'll figure out ways to spread out the costs in a way that doesn't harm profitability as much, and doesn't kill sales at the same time.\"",
      "When could car prices rise?",
      "Although vehicle prices wouldn't skyrocket overnight if the Canada and Mexico tariffs kick in, they could start to rise by summer, industry analysts say. That means car buyers should seriously consider starting their search now.",
      "Manufacturers with more inventory in stock could push off price hikes for some time, whereas those that are running low could be forced to incorporate them into sales prices earlier. Jominy said the range could be a few weeks to \"many months\" from the time tariffs take effect.",
      "\"If you think you'll need a car within the next several months, you should probably get into the market sooner rather than later,\" Jominy said.",
      "That doesn't mean buying on impulse, and experts urge consumers to do their homework before signing on the dotted line for what is, after all, a major financial decision for most people.",
      "\"But if you're planning to be in market the first half of year, it probably makes sense to speed up what you can and make sure you're ready to go,\" he said.",
      "What about used cars?",
      "When new vehicle prices rise, some buyers turn to the used car market, which in turn can drive up costs in that segment.",
      "\"If something comes to pass on tariffs, we'd expected higher prices on both new and used vehicles,\" Jominy said.",
      "Demand for cars \u2014 and other products impacted by tariffs \u2014 may be pulled forward, experts say. \"Because we don't know what's doing to happen, I would be buying everything that I needed that's an appliance that could have content coming from Canada or Mexico,\" Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's a little bit like eating your lunch at recess. You get the same amount of food \u2014 you just get it earlier,\" he added.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs more than once already, it's unclear if and when auto tariffs will hit. But Robert Handfield, professor of supply chain management at North Carolina State University, said for the risk-averse, buying an automobile now versus later in the year is a wise move.",
      "\"He postponed the tariffs for a month to give automakers a little breathing room,\" he said. \"I think it's a good idea to buy now. You'd be able to get in under the wire and save around $4,000 for a regular sedan or up to $10,000 to $12,000 for a truck, which are significant savings.\"",
      "Even if the tariffs never come to fruition, consumers wishing to play it safe can't go wrong by making purchases now, according to Edmunds' Caldwell.",
      "\"Some people don't have the finances to get it wrong. We are stretched thin financially as a country and new vehicle prices aren't cheap, so I can see a lot of people don't want to take the risk,\" she said. \"Sure, it might not happen.

    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security said Friday it is ending the collective bargaining agreement with the union representing thousands of frontline workers with the Transportation Security Administration, a decision the TSA union called an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
      "In announcing the decision, DHS criticized the union \u2014 which represents worker responsible for screening airline passengers \u2014 claiming TSA employs more people working full-time on union issues than those \"performing screening functions at 86% of our airports.\"",
      "\"This action will ensure Americans will have more effective and modernized workforces across the nation's transportation networks,\" Homeland Security said in a statement. \"TSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.\"",
      "The decision to end collective bargaining was criticized by the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing flight attendants, and Democratic lawmakers, with both claiming that the action will make flying less safe. DHS's decision comes after the agency last year pushed to boost TSA workers' pay, which has historically lagged that of other government employees.",
      "In May 2024, the TSA administrator at the time, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement and credited\u00a0pay increases\u00a0that went into effect in 2023 for helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",
      "\"Attempting to negate [TSA workers'] legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2013 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, in a statement on Friday.",
      "In the announcement, DHS said poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \"to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from Thompson and the union.",
      "The decision is \"terrible for aviation security and everyone who depends on safe travel,\" the Association of Flight Attendants said. The group added, \"This will take us back to the days of security at the lowest price with the highest costs for our country.\"",
      "Impact on 47,000 TSA workers",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the TSA workers, said in a statement that the order would strip collective bargaining rights from roughly 47,000 transportation security officers, or TSOs. Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",
      "The union said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump's administration were violating the right of staffers to join a union. It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \"completely fabricated.\"",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers.",
      "AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\"Our union has been out in front challenging this administration's unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \"Now our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\"",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers' collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration's \"vision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\"",
      "\"By removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\" Stahl wrote. \"This determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\"",
      "Stahl said the agency \"will establish alternative procedures\" to address employee concerns and grievances \"in a fair and transparent manner.\"",
      "\"Anti-union talking points\"",
      "Rep. Thompson criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \"flat out wrong anti-union talking points.\" He said the real aim was \"diminishing\" the workforce so \"they can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\"",
      "\"Attempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" Thompson said. \"Since the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA's attrition rates have plummeted.\"",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's barrage of tariffs on key U.S. trading partners and ongoing crackdown on immigration are likely to result in higher prices for American consumers and businesses, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "Economists with Morgan Stanley Research said in a report on Friday that they expect inflation in 2025 to rise 2.5%, up from their previous forecast in December of 2.3%. Another key gauge that strips out volatile food and energy costs is now projected to reach 2.7%, up from 2.5% in the bank's earlier forecast.",
      "\"We now see higher inflation in 2025 with a more pronounced and sooner re-acceleration in goods prices,\" the analysts wrote.",
      "\"If our narrative entering the year was 'slower growth, stickier inflation' then we now think 'slower growth, firmer inflation,'\" they added.",
      "Analysts at Goldman Sachs also said on Friday they're now projecting higher inflation, largely due to Mr. Trump's tariffs. Core PCE inflation, or price increases excluding food and energy costs, could rise to 3% this year, rather than sinking to 2.1% by year-end if there were no tariffs in place.",
      "The cost of food, shelter and other items remains a top economic issue around the U.S., with the soaring cost of eggs\u00a0becoming a national talking point. A recent CBS News poll\u00a0found that 77% of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping up with the pace of inflation.",
      "Inflation during the pandemic soared to its highest level since 1981, peaking at 9.1% in June 2022. The pace of price increases has cooled since then, but costs remain roughly 10% higher than before the COVID crisis, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0data shows.",
      "Recently, inflation has been moving in the wrong direction. After dipping to 2.4% in September, the closely watched Consumer Price Index has nosed up, and in January rose to an annual rate of 3% \u2014 higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target and the fourth straight monthly increase. The Commerce Department is scheduled to release CPI data for February on March 12.",
      "Many businesses are also expecting higher prices. As of early February, manufacturers and service firms expected inflation over the next year of 3.5% and 4%, respectively, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey out this week. Companies pointed to stiffer U.S. tariffs on foreign imports, which raise their operating costs, as a major reason they're bracing for higher inflation.",
      "President Trump on Friday again suspended 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the second time he has paused steeper levies on the two largest U.S. trade partners. The White House\u00a0also recently raised tariffs on China by an additional 10% and has vowed to deploy broader \"reciprocal tariffs\" against other nations on April 2.",
      "Although the delays leave open the possibility of a breakthrough in trade talks, the whipsaw in policy makes it more challenging for businesses to plan in advance.",
      "Tighter immigration restrictions can contribute to inflation by reducing the nation's supply of labor, according to economists.",
      "\"One factor that we think limits services disinflation is reduced immigration, which could lead to labor shortages in many face-to-face service sectors (retail, restaurants, leisure, hospitals) that could result in supply-side driven inflation,\" the Morgan Stanley analysts said in their report.",
      "Persistent inflation could deter the Fed from moving to nudge down interest rates and lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, experts note. About 1 in 10 economists polled by FactSet expect the central bak to cut rates at its next meeting on March 19.",

    "summary": "The Department of Education doesn't oversee school curriculums, but it does offer a range of services affecting millions of Americans.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Education could be headed for some major changes, with President Trump expected to issue an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to start the process of dissolving the agency.",
      "Although the timing of such a move is unclear, reports that is in the works are already raising questions for millions of parents, students and taxpayers about the future of the Education Department and how the services it provides will be handled if the agency is dismantled.",
      "What does the Department of Education do?",
      "In 1979, President Jimmy Carter signed a bill creating the Department of Education. The agency's key functions include:",
      "Disbursing billions in student loans each yearOperating the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which allows students to apply for loans, grants and other college aidProviding funding to help poor and disabled students enrolled in K-12 schoolsEnsuring equal access to education through its Office of Civil RightsOperating the Pell grant program, which provides qualifying low- and middle-income students with up to $7,400 per year to attend collegeFunding public charter schoolsOverseeing the the college accreditation system by reviewing all federally recognized accrediting agenciesCollecting data on education and student outcomes, from early to higher education",

      "Operating the Pell grant program, which provides qualifying low- and middle-income students with up to $7,400 per year to attend college",
      "Funding public charter schools",
      "Overseeing the the college accreditation system by reviewing all federally recognized accrediting agencies",
      "Collecting data on education and student outcomes, from early to higher education",
      "The Department of Education is \"primarily about ensuring who can access the classroom \u2014 it's not so much about what is being talked about in the classroom,\" Peter Granville, a fellow at The Century Foundation and expert on higher education, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "One major misconception held by many Americans is that the Education Department oversees school curriculums and learning, which are instead overseen by states and local school districts. Rather than setting public school curriculums, the Education Department's role is primarily financial, distributing billions in government money to colleges and schools and managing the federal student loan portfolio.",
      "\"Curriculum is handled by states and local governance \u2014 the Department of Education has historically had no role in setting curriculum,\" Granville said. \"The primary role of the Department of Education has been as a grant maker and a loan lender.\"",
      "For instance, the Education Department operates the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which is used by about 17 million students each year to apply for federal loans, grants and scholarships to attend college or vocational programs. The agency also manages $1.5 trillion in student loans, including repayment programs.",
      "Additionally, the Education Department handles Title I funding for low-income schools as well as for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Here's what to know about the agency.",
      "Why does the Trump administration want to close the Education Department?",
      "Mr. Trump is a vocal critic of the Education Department, describing\u00a0it last month as \"a big con job\" and falsely claiming the U.S. is ranked 40th in education internationally but spends the most per pupil. (Spending on K-12 education is largely determined by local school boards and funded by property taxes.)",
      "One of the president's executive orders, signed Jan. 30,\u00a0directed the Education Department to investigate \"school choice programs,\" saying that parents need \"opportunities for students to attend the school that best fits their needs.\" Vouchers that allow families to pay for private K-12 schools are a priority of conservatives, as such programs allow parents to use tax credits to pay for private schools, including Christian-based institutions.",
      "In an email earlier this month to the agency's staff entitled \"Our Department's Final Mission,\" McMahon wrote that her goal is to \"restore the rightful role of state oversight in education and to end the overreach from Washington.\" That echoes language from Project 2025, the blueprint for a conservative administration written by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "\"Federal money is inevitably accompanied by rules and regulations that keep the influx of funds from having much, if any, impact on student outcomes,\" Project 2025's section on the Education Department claims. \"Eventually, policymaking and funding should take place at the state and local level, closest to the affected families.\"",
      "Can Mr. Trump abolish the Education Department?",
      "Complete elimination of the Education Department would need congressional approval and 60 votes in the Senate, which is unlikely given the current makeup.",
      "However, the Trump administration could make changes to the agency, such as by cutting staff, without closing the entire department. The Trump administration is currently making massive employment cuts at several other federal agencies, such as the Social Security Administration and Veterans Affairs Department, describing the efforts as a way to reduce federal waste.",
      "The Trump administration could change some of the department's oversight duties, such as those carried out by its Office for Civil Rights, which issues guidance on how civil rights laws should be applied. Trump has suggested a different interpretation of the office's civil rights role.",
      "Under his administration, the department has instructed the office to prioritize complaints of\u00a0antisemitism, and has opened investigations into colleges and school sports leagues for allowing transgender athletes to\u00a0compete on women's teams, according to the Associated Press.",
      "The Trump administration isn't expected to defend the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness and repayment programs, which have been tied up in court cases, experts say. Last month, the Education Department removed the online application for income-driven repayment plans, according to Business Insider.",
      "What would happen to student loans?",
      "The Education Department manages $1.5 trillion in student loan debt for more than 40 million borrowers. Although the Trump administration hasn't outlined how it might want to reallocate the Education Department's responsibilities, student loans could be moved to the Treasury Department, Granville noted.",
      "\"If this is going to be a smooth handoff, some other agency has to pick up what the Education Department is setting down,\" he said. \"The most logical destination is the Treasury, but I worry about the risk of disruption from any handoff.\"",
      "Project 2025 posits that student loans should be handled by a \"new government corporation with professional governance and management.\" The blueprint calls for federal loans \"to be assigned directly to the Treasury Department, which would manage collections.\"",
      "Project 2025 also favors phasing out income-based repayment plans, which help borrowers lower their monthly loan payments by making them proportional to their wages and salaries, and creating a new repayment plan that would require people earning above poverty wages to pay 10% of their income toward their loans.",
      "\"[T]here should be no loan forgiveness,\" Project 2025 states.",
      "What would happen to the FAFSA if the Education Department is abolished?",
      "The Education Department required by law to release the FAFSA on or close to Oct. 1, allowing students and their families to apply for loans and other student aid during the college application season. Families must complete the FAFSA each year a student is enrolled in a college program if they wish to qualify for loans or other aid.",
      "\"Congress passed a law that created the FAFSA, and unless Congress creates a new law, the FAFSA has to continue,\" Granville said.",
      "Still, it's unclear which agency would handle the FAFSA if the Department of Education is dismantled, he added.",
      "What would happen to federal funding for public K-12 schools?",
      "Much of the Education Department's money for K-12 schools is funneled through large federal programs, such as Title I for low-income schools and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Those programs support services for students with disabilities, smaller class sizes with additional teaching positions, and pay for social workers and other non-teaching roles in schools.",
      "During his campaign, Mr. Trump called for shifting those functions to the states. He has not offered details on how the agency's core functions of sending federal money to local districts and schools would be handled.",
      "Project 2025 suggests sending oversight of programs for kids with disabilities and low-income children first to the Department of Health and Human Services, before eventually phasing out the funding and converting it to no-strings-attached grants to states.",
      "What do educators and Democrats say?",
      "There's concern that making massive changes to the Education Department could impact millions of families and students who rely on the agency for loans, grants and other support, experts say.",
      "Moving some of those tasks to states and local governments could drive up costs for many families, said Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont.",
      "\"That will mean higher local and state taxes to fill the void,\" Sanders said at a Thursday press conference organized by the Senate Democrats about the potential dismantling of the Education Department. \"In other words, shutting down the Department of Education would be a disaster for low income and working class families in every state of our country.\"",
      "The American Federation of Teachers, a union that represents 1.8 million K-12 teachers, said that it planned to fight the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the agency.",
      "\"The directive to 'return decision-making to the states' fails the smell test,\" said AFT President Randi Weingarten in a statement. \"States and districts already govern schools through locally elected school boards, as they should. They put up most of the money and control most of the decisions\u2014from approving curriculum to deciding who graduates.\"",
      "She added, \"The Department of Education, and the laws it is supposed to execute, has one major purpose: to level the playing field and fill opportunity gaps to help every child in America succeed.\"",

      "Mr. Trump announced the delay in the Mexico tariffs in a social media post after a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. On Thursday afternoon, he signed two executive orders stating the exemptions would apply to U.S. imports of products from both Mexico and Canada that are covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Goods that are not covered by the agreement remain subject to tariffs.",
      "\"After speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement,\" Mr. Trump wrote, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. He characterized the move \"as an accommodation\" for the Mexican leader.",
      "\"Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl. Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "When asked if any concessions had been offered by Canada or Mexico to lead to the pause, a White House official told CBS News that during leader-to-leader discussions, Mexico brought up progress it had made cracking down on cartels and drugs, including cocaine.",
      "The USMCA agreement covers the vast majority of imports from Mexico. In a press conference Thursday, Sheinbaum said that nearly all of Mexico's trade with the U.S. is covered under the trade pact which is in effect until April 2.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. imported more than $45 billion worth of agricultural products from Mexico. Almost three-quarters of such imports consisted of vegetables, fruit, beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Canadian energy, which is not included in the USMCA, is expected to be tariffed at 10%, which could boost gas prices and heating and electricity costs in the U.S. Potash that U.S. farmers import from Canada would be tariffed at the same rate.",
      "According to a White House official, in 2024, 38% of all imports from Canada were covered by the USMCA and therefore exempt from tariffs, while 49.6% of all imports from Mexico were covered under the agreement.",
      "International trade expert Barry Appleton, a senior fellow at the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that \"a massive amount of goods\" fall under the brief exemption from tariffs on imports from Canada. They include auto parts, steel and aluminum, beef and other products.",
      "Despite the brief reprieve. uncertainty around the tariffs have \"broken complex supply chains that will never be fixed,\" Appleton said.",
      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, underlined the importance of cooperation on trade.",
      "\"Though today's delay mitigates some of economic damage U.S. tariffs will cause, this is not a moment to celebrate. The economy is not a toy to play with. Constant threats and economic uncertainty have taken their toll. We see it in delayed business investments, shaky consumer confidence, stalled capital flows and a volatile stock market. People's livelihoods are at stake,\" he said in a statement provided to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The only outcome that makes sense for both economies is for all tariffs to be taken off the table, without exception,\" Holmes added.",
      "Economists have warned that tariffs are likely to lead to price increases on an array of goods, from vegetables and fruit to automobiles. Levies on materials from Canada and Mexico used in car production won't go into effect immediately after Mr. Trump also issued one-month exemption from tariffs for automakers Wednesday, following conversations with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram.",
      "Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs before, and business leaders say uncertainty around which policies will actually take effect has created confusion for businesses and consumers.",

      "Employers cut 172,017 jobs last month, a 245% increase from January and double the number that was announced during the same month a year ago, the company said. That marks the highest monthly number of layoffs since July 2020, when 262,649 cuts were announced, the firm added.",
      "The job cuts were led by losses in federal jobs, largely directed by DOGE, which says it is dedicated to rooting out government waste and fraud. DOGE-related job losses have cut a wide swath across federal government agencies by targeting newly hired workers, regardless of their job performance or whether their jobs are essential.",
      "In a few cases, some agencies have scrambled to rehire workers who were fired under DOGE's policies, such as the U.S. Agriculture Department bringing back bird flu experts who were mistakenly cut.",
      "Federal agencies announced 62,242 job cuts last month, an increase of 41,311% from a year earlier, Challenger, Gray said. More federal cuts are on the way, with the Veterans Affairs Department planning to cut thousands of jobs in the coming months, while some government workers may opt to leave because of the uncertainty caused by the layoffs, the group said.",

      "Health care is so expensive that 31 million U.S. adults, or 12%, had to borrow a total of $74 billion last year to obtain medical care, new data shows. That includes people with health insurance, making such numbers even more troubling.",
      "Almost one-third of the more than 3,500 people surveyed by Gallup and West Health, a group of nonprofit health care organizations, said they're \"very concerned\" that a major health event would lead to medical debt despite most of them having some form of health care coverage.",
      "The survey results underscore how exposed individuals and families can be to financial hardship just to pay for essential health care services.",
      "\"What's very visible here is families are forced to take out loans and borrow to cover expensive care that is needed,\" Tim Lash, president of West Health, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These big numbers are concerning, but the humanity is lost in the billions and trillions as we reduce this down to what the lived experience is of the American individual and families.\"",
      "To avoid taking on debt, families sometimes make tradeoffs, such as purchasing fewer groceries or not paying rent in order to get the care they need, Lash added.",
      "Nearly one in five adults between the ages of 18 and 28 reported borrowing money to pay for health care, according to the survey. Only 9% of Americans between 50 and 64 and 2% of those 65 or older reported having to borrow money to obtain needed medical care.",
      "\"There are a lot of disparities in terms of who borrows,\" Lash said. That's in part because Medicare, which is available to people who are 65 or older, provides enrollees with relatively comprehensive coverage.",
      "As of mid-2024, U.S. residents owed at least $220 billion in medical debt, according to data from the American Hospital Association. Health care bills have for years been a leading cause of personal bankruptcies.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0An\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that was sent to lawmakers this week showed that budget goals outlined in a House GOP plan could not be reached without reducing spending on Medicaid, clashing with commitments from Republicans not to cut the popular entitlement program.",
      "House Republicans adopted a budget proposal last week that serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda. The resolution must be adopted by the Senate before the chambers can move forward with the budget reconciliation process, a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But opponents of the resolution have warned that the proposed cuts implicate key programs that Americans rely on, concerns that the CBO analysis backed up.",
      "Republicans want to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending over a 10-year period to pay for trillions in tax cuts, while increasing funding in some areas. The budget resolution directs congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview.",
      "The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, is tasked with finding at least $880 billion in cuts over the next decade. A pair of House Democrats asked the CBO for the projected mandatory spending on programs under the committee's jurisdiction, excluding Medicare, which offers health coverage for seniors. Medicaid provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans, with costs split between the federal government and the states.",
      "CBO found that Medicaid accounts for 93% of all remaining non-Medicare mandatory spending, with $581 billion going to other programs. That means the committee couldn't meet its $880 billion target without touching the program. GOP leaders have not proposed cutting Medicare, leaving Medicaid as the source of potential cuts.",
      "House Republican leaders have stressed that Medicaid isn't specifically mentioned in the budget resolution and said benefits would not be cut, noting that last week's vote was merely to begin the reconciliation process. But Republicans have said they plan to remove \"fraud, waste and abuse\" within the program, and many members support work requirements that could limit eligibility for benefits. Other GOP lawmakers have expressed concerns about making cuts to the program, since many of their constituents and voters rely on coverage.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Thursday that the CBO findings \"confirmed what we have long understood to be the case with the reckless Republican budget.\"",
      "\"Republicans are trying to rip healthcare away from tens of millions of Americans,\" the New York Democrat said, pledging that \"every single Democrat\" will stand against the House plan.",

      "What will cost more with tariffs?",
      "Products imported directly from Canada, Mexico and China could see price hikes as businesses pass along the tariff costs, either in full or in part, to consumers.

      "Vegetables, fruit, beef, beer and spirits",

      "At the same time, the U.S. imported roughly $40 billion worth of Canadian agricultural products, including beef, pork, grains, potatoes and canola oil, the USDA notes.",
      "Subject to 25% tariffs, prices on such products could rise substantially, depending on how much of the cost increase businesses pass along to shoppers. Fresh produce prices could increase by about 3%, while food prices overall may increase by 2%, according to a new analysis from Democrats on Congress' Joint Economic Committee.",
      "According to the\u00a0Atlanta Fed, the tariffs on three key U.S. trading partners would bring up prices on everyday purchases, including food and beverages, by as much as 1.63%, if businesses pass along anywhere from half to all of the added costs to consumers.",

    "story": [
      "Salt Lake City \u2014 Utah on Wednesday became the first state to pass legislation requiring app stores to verify users' ages and get parental consent for minors to download apps to their devices.",
      "The bill headed to the desk of Gov. Spencer Cox has pitted Meta, which operates Facebook and Instagram, against app store giants Apple and Google over who should be responsible for verifying ages. Similar bills have been introduced in at least eight other states in the latest fight over children's online safety. The proposals targeting app stores follow legal fights over laws requiring social media platforms to verify the ages of users.",
      "Meta and other social media companies support putting the onus on app stores to verify ages amid criticism that they don't do enough to make their products safe for children - or verify that no kids under 13 use them.",
      "\"Parents want a one-stop shop to verify their child's age and grant permission for them to download apps in a privacy-preserving way. The app store is the best place for it,\" Meta, X and Snap Inc. said in a joint statement Wednesday. \"We applaud Utah for putting parents in charge with its landmark legislation and urge Congress to follow suit.\"",
      "The app stores say app developers are better equipped to handle age verification and other safety measures. Requiring app stores to confirm ages will make it so all users have to hand over sensitive identifying information, such as a driver's license, passport, credit card or Social Security number, even if they don't want to use an age-restricted app, Apple said.",
      "\"Because many kids in the U.S. don't have government-issued IDs, parents in the U.S. will have to provide even more sensitive documentation just to allow their child to access apps meant for children. That's not in the interest of user safety or privacy,\" the company said in its most recent online safety report.",
      "Apple considers age a matter of privacy and lets users decide whether to disclose it. The company gives parents the option to set age-appropriate parameters for app downloads. The Google Play Store does the same.",
      "Apple and Google are among a litany of tech companies that help support the Chamber of Progress, a tech policy group that lobbied Utah lawmakers to reject the bill. Last year, Apple helped kill a similar bill in Louisiana that would have required app stores to help enforce age restrictions.",
      "Kouri Marshall, a spokesperson for the Chamber of Progress, called the measure \"a tremendous encroachment of individual privacy\" that he said places a heavy burden on app stores to ensure online safety.",
      "Republican Sen. Todd Weiler, the bill's sponsor, argued it's \"a lot easier to target two app stores than it is to target 10,000 (app) developers.\"",
      "Under the bill, app stores would be required to request age information when someone creates an account. If a minor tries to open one, the bill directs the app store to link it to their parent's account and may request a form of ID to confirm their identity. Weiler said a credit card could be used as an age verification tool in most cases.",
      "If a child tries to download an app that allows in-app purchases or requires them to agree to terms and conditions, the parent will first have to approve.",
      "Melissa McKay, a Utah mother, is among those who pushed for the legislation. She said she started asking questions about device safety after her nephew in 2017 was exposed to \"really harmful content on another student's device at school.\" Inaccurate age ratings on apps and faulty parental controls are \"at the root of online harm,\" McKay said.",
      "The eight other states considering proposals would similarly place responsibility on app stores to verify ages and seek parental permissions. A legislative committee advanced Alabama's bill last week.",
      "Lawsuits have delayed implementation of state laws regulating social media apps and websites. A federal judge in 2024 temporarily blocked Utah's first-in-the-nation law requiring social media companies to check the ages of all users and place restrictions on accounts belonging to minors.",
      "If Cox signs the Utah bill into law, most provisions would take effect May 7. The governor's office didn't respond to emails seeking comment Wednesday. Cox, a Republican, supported the state law currently on hold that requires age verification on social media."

      "\"Since President Trump's successful USMCA was signed, Ford has invested billions in the United States and committed to billions more in the future to both invest in American workers and ensure all of our vehicles comply with USMCA,\" Ford said in a statement. \"We will continue to have a healthy and candid dialogue with the administration to help achieve a bright future for our industry and U.S. manufacturing.\"",
      "In its own statement on the tariff delay, GM said the automaker \"has more vehicle assembly plants in the U.S. than any other automaker,\" adding that \"we continue to invest billions of dollars every year in our manufacturing base, supply chain and U.S. jobs.\"",
      "The goal of the tariff pause is to give U.S. automakers time to shift their supply chains to within the U.S., Leavitt said. Mr. Trump \"told them they should get on it, start investing, start moving, shift production here to the U.S. of America, where they will pay no tariffs. That's the ultimate goal,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has said the tariffs are aimed at curbing the flow of migrants and drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S., as well as redressing trade imbalances with other countries. The taxes quickly triggered retaliatory measures by Canada and China, with Mexico planning to announce its response on Sunday.",
      "The new tariffs Canada and Mexico could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs\u00a0close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers",

The stock index regained some ground on Wednesday, rising 21 points, or 0.4%, to 5,799 in afternoon trading.",
      "According to Wall Street analysts, the market reaction reflects investor concerns that a trade war could crimp U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation, putting pressure on U.S. consumers who are already financially strained after grappling with several years of elevated price increases. Some recent economic data also points to\u00a0souring outlooks from consumers and businesses, with both groups now\u00a0expecting higher inflation in the face of Mr. Trump's new tariffs.",
      "With uncertainty on the rise, employees exposed to stocks through their retirement plans should brace for more investment volatility, experts say.",
      "\"There is evidence that a cooling in the economy is underway,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst and founder of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"U.S. equities are bearing the brunt of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also sometimes sent mixed messages about its tariff plans, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday night saying the administration might \"modify the tariffs somewhat.\"",
      "Those mixed signals add to the challenges facing businesses in deciding their strategy, experts say. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. businesses on goods they import from other nations, some companies are uncertain about the costs they'll face moving forward under the Trump administration, Crisafulli said.",
      "\"I look at tariffs as a corporate tax,\" he said. \"Imagine if corporate tax rates were set in this chaotic of a fashion \u2014 it would create a lot of hesitation among companies. They don't know what the ground rules will be.\"",
      "Walmart executives, noting that the U.S. is entering what they characterized as \"an uncertain time,\" said last month that consumers are paring their spending, while Target on Tuesday said costs from tariffs could put \"meaningful pressure\" on the retailer's profits. Such caution is also fueling market volatility, experts said.",
      "\"Uncertainty around the scope and implementation of tariffs is high,\" investment firm BlackRock said in a March 5\u00a0note\u00a0to investors. \"In markets, we think U.S. equities could come under pressure in the next few months as investors seek additional compensation for these risks.\"",
      "How could this impact your 401(k)?",
      "While investors spooked by the roller-coaster stock swings might be tempted to exit the market, that's generally a losing strategy, Crisafulli said. Timing the market, or attempting to buy and sell stocks to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible to execute and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, Charles Schwab research\u00a0has found.",
      "The strategy is almost always doomed to fail because investors don't know when to get back into the market to capture the rebound, while the stock market has historically always recovered even from major setbacks. For instance, investors who sold during the March 2020 rout that followed the eruption of COVID-19 around the U.S. and failed to re-enter the market that year could have missed out on the rebound, with the S&P 500 gaining 15% by the end of December.",
      "For most investors with a 401(k) plan, sticking tight and avoiding checking your balance each day may be the best strategy for coping with volatile periods, experts say.",
      "\"Your 401(k) should be on autopilot, and you don't look at day-to-day volatility,\" Crisafulli said. \"I don't think people should make dramatic changes with their 401(k)s.\"",
      "Still, investors may want to examine their asset allocation and shift to investments that could provide more protection in the face of a possible global trade war, researchers note. For instance, automobile companies could be hard-hit by the Trump administration's tariffs, BlackRock notes, given that U.S. automakers import many components from Mexico and Canada.",
      "Restaurants and grocery companies could also feel the impact of the new tariffs, as U.S. food costs could increase by 3% due to the higher import duties, BlackRock noted.",
      "\"On the other hand, financials and health care services may be relatively insulated, since these sectors have minimal exposure to imported goods,\" the wealth management firm noted.",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump vowed that his tariffs \"are about making America rich again and making America great again.\" Some of his goals in implementing the tariffs are to bring about a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing by convincing companies to move factories to the U.S.",
      "While that could take months or even years to pan out, investment experts say it's also important to keep a long-term view on the U.S. economy.",
      "\"It may be hard for investors to believe, but there is more to market volatility than reacting to the latest Trump executive action,\" Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street, wrote in a new report.",
      "Despite recent data that suggests the U.S. economy is slowing, \"an economic growth scare is not the same thing as a recession. And the economic environment remains respectable. U.S. real GDP is likely to expand in the first quarter,\" he added.",
      "Given that the economy is continuing to grow, the labor market remains strong and inflation is still cooling, it's important to \"differentiate between signal and noise,\" Arone said.",
      "\"And, rightly or wrongly, the Trump administration uses the economy and stock market as barometers for its success,\" he added. \"They won't purposefully harm the economy or the bull market.\"",

      "Beijing \u2014 China has responded to President Trump's trade war with defiance, something Mr. Trump is not accustomed to. Now facing 20% tariffs on all exports to the U.S., Beijing has refused to back down \u2014 despite its own economic problems \u2014 and is hitting the U.S. with its own retaliatory tariffs. The air of strength from Beijing was projected clearly on Wednesday at the opening of the National People's Congress.",
      "Thousands of delegates from around the country descended on the Chinese capital's central Tiananmen Square. Dressed in their finery, including some in traditional garments, they came to Beijing for the most important event in China's political calendar. But for the members of China's rubber-stamp legislature, certain topics were clearly off limits when speaking with CBS News.",
      "None of the legislators would respond when asked about any concerns they might have regarding the trade war between the world's two largest economies, or whether Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping might be able to get over their differences.",
      "Once inside the cavernous Great Hall of the People, the cameras turned to the main event. While the NPC is focused mainly on China's sluggish economy, this year, that discussion and the public proclamations are being overshadowed by geopolitical events \u2014 and the trade war with the U.S. in particular.",
      "President Xi, who's government announced its retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. just one day before the NPC opened, was an observer at the massive gathering on Wednesday. His deputy, Premier Li Qiang, delivered the keynote address.",
      "He announced an ambitious\u00a0GDP growth target of 5% and committed more fiscal resources aimed at stimulating the economy, which is mired in youth unemployment and weak consumer spending, in addition to the lingering fallout from a property crisis.",

      "\"As this sort of rivalry goes on, there will come a point where we can have a good settlement,\" predicted Delegate Lin Shun-chao, from Hong Kong.",
      "While many Chinese people hope Beijing and Washington will eventually reach a trade deal, it's worth noting how stock markets in both countries have reacted to the tit-for-tat tariffs thus far: Chinese stocks overall are up about 15% from the beginning of the year, while U.S. markets are down almost 2%.",
      "It's another sign \u2014 and perhaps a more telling one than the rhetoric from the podium at the NPC \u2014 of a belief in China that the country's economy will be able to manage whatever Mr. Trump throws at it.",

    "story": [
      "The Hong Kong-based conglomerate that operates ports near the Panama Canal has agreed to sell shares of its units that operate the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., after President Trump alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane.",
      "In a press release, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and all shares in Hutchison Port Group Holdings, in a deal valued at $22.8 billion. The two units hold 80% of the Hutchison Ports group that operates 43 ports in 23 countries, including two of the four major ports that exist along the Panama Canal. The deal will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere.",
      "The consortium, comprised of BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited will acquire 90% interests in Panama Ports Company, which owns and operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama, according to the filing.",
      "\"This agreement is a powerful illustration of BlackRock and GIP's combined platform and our ability to deliver differentiated investments for clients. These world-class ports facilitate global growth,\" BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a joint announcement with TilL of the deal. \"Through our deep connectivity to organizations like Hutchison and MSC/TIL and governments around the world, we are increasingly the first call for partners seeking patient, long-term capital. We are thrilled our clients can participate in this investment.",
      "In January, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, raised concerns that China could exploit or block passage through the canal and that the ports \"give China ready observation posts\" to take action. \"This situation, I believe, posts acute risks for U.S. national security,\" Cruz said.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations.",
      "Panama quit China's Belt and Road Initiative following Rubio's visit, drawing condemnation from Beijing.",

      "\"Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal, and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal, and a couple of other canals,\" the president said.",

      "With 40 million container ships passing through every year, the Panama Canal \u2014 a 51 mile waterway that cuts through Central America, linking the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans \u2014 is vital to the U.S. economy. Disputes over the canal were first sparked in 2024 when Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, made accusations that Chinese companies have taken control of the ports.",
      "But while much attention was focused on Mr. Trump's threat to retake control of the canal, his administration trained its sights on Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based consortium that manages the canal's key ports, at either end of the canal. As a result of BlackRock's deal with CK Hutchison Holding, those two key ports will be placed under American control.",
      "The United States is the canal's largest user, with about 70% of shipping traffic going through the canal either coming to or from the U.S. Its second largest user is China.",
      "Hutchison Ports had recently been awarded a 25-year no-bid extension to run the ports, but an audit looking at that extension was already underway. Observers believed the audit was a preliminary step toward eventually rebidding the contract, but rumors had swirled in recent weeks that a U.S. firm close to the White House was being lined up to take over.",

      "President Trump's imposition of blanket 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico drew swift vows of retaliation from the United States' immediate neighbors on Tuesday. China, which was hit with a second 10% tariff on U.S. exports since Mr. Trump took office, bringing the total levy to 20%, immediately announced its own reciprocal measures \u2014 deliberately targeting America's agricultural sector.",

      "Below is a look at the measures being imposed or planned by Canada, China and Mexico, and the rhetoric coming from officials in those countries as Mr. Trump ramps up his trade war against one of America's biggest adversaries, and its two closest neighbors.",
      "Canada announces reciprocal tariffs; Trudeau calls Trump's move \"a very dumb thing to do\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced immediate retaliation to the new U.S. tariffs in a statement late Monday evening. He said Canada would impose a $30 billion counter-tariff on goods imported from the U.S. immediately, escalating to $155 billion worth of American products within the next 21 days. Trudeau has said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances, along with Florida orange juice, with its measures.",
      "\"Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,\" Trudeau said, adding that he was already discussing with Canada's provincial leaders various non-tariff measures that could be imposed if the Trump administration doesn't lift its tariffs.",
      "\"Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas, and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs. Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term,\" Trudeau said.",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Trudeau lashed out at President Trump's decision.",
      "\"We should be working together to ensure even greater prosperity for North Americans in a very uncertain and challenging world,\" he said. \"Now, it's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal, but Donald, they point out that even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.\"",
      "\"Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they're talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\" said Trudeau. \"We two friends fighting is exactly what our opponents around the world want to see.\"",
      "Trudeau also said Canada will challenge the U.S. action by filing dispute resolution claims at the World Trade Organization and through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade deal that replaced NAFTA.",
      "Mr. Trump responded with a post on social media threatening to raise tariffs further: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"",
      "Some of Canada's state leaders have pushed for a tougher response.",
      "\"If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything, including cut off their energy with a smile on my face. And I'm encouraging every other province to do the same; Quebec, Manitoba, BC [British Columbia], we all have to act in unison,\" Doug Ford, the Premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said at an industrial convention on Monday. \"They rely on our energy. They need to feel the pain. They want to come at us hard. We're going to come back twice as hard.\"",
      "Ford said retaliatory measures that Canada could consider going forward included halting shipments of critical minerals such as uranium, potash and nickel, in addition to cutting the energy supply, which he said could leave 1.5 million people without power in New York, Michigan and Minnesota, potentially causing significant disruptions to the U.S. economy.",
      "He said he had also asked officials in his province to end billions of dollars in contracts with the U.S. and to stop the import of American alcohol to Ontario.",
      "\"It's going to be an absolute disaster for both countries,\" he acknowledged in a separate interview with NBC News. \"I don't want to respond, but I will respond like they have never seen before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has framed his tariffs on Canada as a response to what he says is the country's failure to stem the flow of both undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across the northern U.S. border \u2014 though very little of the drug enters that way, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.",
      "In a message posted to his own Truth social platform early Tuesday, Mr. Trump also took issue with Canadian banking regulations, saying the country \"doesn't allow American Banks to do business in Canada, but their banks flood the American Market,\" but providing no further context.",
      "\"I heard he talked about banking again this morning,\" Trudeau said during his Tuesday news conference, \"which doesn't make any sense, because American banks \u2014 of 16 American banks currently active in Canada \u2014 holding about $113 billion worth of assets in this country. So the American banks are alive and well and prospering in Canada. It's an example of not really being able to see what it is that he [Trump] wants, because even the excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false. So we actually have to fall back on the one thing he has said repeatedly, that what he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that Canada should become a U.S. \"51st state.\"",
      "Trudeau defended Canada's actions on border control and the illegal flow of fentanyl on Monday, saying that between December 2024 and January 2025, seizures of the drug from Canada by U.S. authorities dropped 97%, to just 0.03 pounds. That drop came, he said, after Canada implemented a $1.3 billion plan to deploy more helicopters and more boots on the ground, and to appoint a \"Fentanyl Czar.\"",
      "China announces tariffs, warns against \"maximum pressure\" tactic",
      "Mr. Trump has long accused China of giving its manufacturers and other businesses an unfair advantage in trade with the U.S. and vowed to balance the extremely lopsided flow of goods. But he has framed his latest round of tariffs on the country as punishment for what he claims is a Chinese refusal to crack down on the flow of fentanyl and the chemicals used to make it to the U.S.",
      "China's government has refused to back down in the face of the escalating trade war with the Trump administration, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian telling reporters in Beijing on Tuesday that the \"Chinese people cannot be swayed by fallacies, deterred by intimidation, and bullying tactics are not the right way to deal with China.\"",
      "\"Attempting to exert maximum pressure on China is targeting the wrong opponent and is a misreading of the situation. If the U.S. truly wants to resolve the fentanyl issue, it should engage in consultation with China built on the principles of equality, respect, and mutual benefit to address each other's concerns,\" he said, according to China's official media.",
      "\"If the U.S. has other intentions and is committed to waging a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, China will respond in kind,\" Lin said, adding a call for the White House \"to abandon its bullying tactics and return to the necessary track of dialogue and cooperation at an early date.\"",
      "China retaliated immediately, announcing its own 10-15% tariff on U.S. agricultural products and foods, from wheat, corn and cotton to soybeans, beef, chicken and dairy. Beijing also placed 25 U.S. firms under export and investment restrictions, citing what it said were national security concerns.",
      "Veteran Chinese analyst Victor Gao told CBS News that while China's counter-tariffs will impact U.S. farmers \u2014 perceived by Beijing to be among Mr. Trump's support base \u2014 he believes Beijing is being measured in its response and that it doesn't want to inflame the situation.",
      "Gao, who has worked with the country's leadership and is now vice president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, said China is better prepared for a trade war with the U.S. than it was during Mr. Trump's first term, as it has diversified into other, non-U.S. markets.",
      "He said if President Xi Jinping really wanted to step up Beijing's retaliation, it could halt imports of U.S. gas and oil, but he warned against the implications for both nations if the trade war continues to escalate, saying at best, it would end in a \"bloody tie.\"",
      "But Gao said he believed talks were still going on behind the scenes between U.S and Chinese officials, and that both countries likely have little interest in a deteriorating, tit-for-tat tariffs battle.",
      "Mexican president vows retaliation to \"inconceivable\" tariffs",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that her country would respond to the 25% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration with its own retaliatory tariffs and non-tariff measures, but held off announcing exactly what those would be, promising a statement on Sunday in Mexico City's main square. She said she was scheduled to have a call with Mr. Trump this week, probably on Thursday.",
      "She said the reciprocal measures Mexico would take were \"not in any way or with the purpose of starting an economic or commercial confrontation that unfortunately and regrettably is the opposite of what we must be doing.\"",
      "\"It's inconceivable that they don't think about the damage this is going to cause to United States citizens and businesses with the increase in prices for things produced in our country,\" Sheinbaum said. \"Also, the damage it will cause by stopping job creation in both countries. No one wins with this decision.\"",
      "Sheinbaum stressed how Mexico had been working alongside the U.S. to respond to requests by Mr. Trump to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and to reinforce the U.S.-Mexico border to curb migration.",
      "\"We collaborate to avoid illegal drug trafficking to the United States, but as we have said on multiple occasions, that country's government must take responsibility, too, for the crisis of opioid consumption that has caused so many deaths in the United States,\" the Mexican leader said.",
      "\"There is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations,\" added Sheinbaum.",

      "What is the average Social Security retroactive payment?",
      "The retroactive payments are due to the law's elimination of two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",

      "The tariffs come as more U.S. households are showing signs of economic strain, with retailers such as Target and Walmart recently warning that inflation-weary consumers are cutting back on spending. Mr. Trump's tariffs could push up prices on everything from avocados imported from Mexico to gasoline prices, potentially undermining the president's pledge to eradicate inflation.",
      "\"Everything from cars to agricultural products will see cost surges, exacerbating inflationary pressures that had only recently shown signs of easing,\" said Nigel Green, the CEO of investment advisory firm de Vere Group, in an email.",
      "Stocks tumbled on Monday after Mr. Trump said the tariffs would move forward on March 4, with the S&P 500 shedding 1.8%, marking its biggest one-day decline so far this year. Wall Street continued the sell-off on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite both losing 1.7% in early morning trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.5%.",
      "China, Canada and Mexico react",
      "China responded immediately, announcing it would put additional tariffs of up to 15% on imports of key U.S. farm products, including chicken, pork, soy and beef. They're slated to take effect March 10. China also imposed export controls and other curbs on about two dozen more U.S. companies.",
      "What's more, foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, \"If the United States ... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end,\" according to Agence France-Presse.",

      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his nation would respond with 25% tariffs on some $107 billion worth of U.S. goods over the course of three weeks \u2014 with $20.7 billion immediately \u2014 if the U.S. levies remained in effect. He had said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances and Florida orange juice.",
      "\"Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship,\" the Reuters news agency quoted Trudeau as saying.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford told NBC News he was prepared to retaliate by ending shipments of nickel and the transmission of electricity to the U.S. from his province.",
      "Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that Mexico will respond with its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Sheinbaum said she will announce the products Mexico will target on Sunday in a public event in Mexico City's central plaza, perhaps indicating Mexico still hopes to de-escalate the trade war set off by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Did Canada have tariffs on U.S. products before?",
      "Canada had imposed some limited tariffs on U.S. products before 2025, and vice versa. Under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement, which was signed by President Trump in 2020, the countries had negotiated a complex set of rules aimed at promoting trade.",
      "One of the biggest changes in the USMCA pact was providing American farmers greater access to Canada's dairy markets. That included a plan\u00a0eliminating existing Canadian-imposed tariffs on some U.S. dairy products over a number of years, including whey and margarine.",
      "The U.S. has also previously imposed tariffs on some Canadian products, including duties placed by the first Trump administration on imported softwood lumber. Under the Biden administration, the tariffs on Canadian lumber rose from 8% to 14.5% in 2024.",

      "Investors\u00a0reacted negatively\u00a0to Monday's news that the tariffs on Mexico and Canada would take effect as planned, with the stock market slumping on Monday and Tuesday. Trade war fears sent markets falling in Asia and Europe, as well on Tuesday.",
      "\"The market finally took the Trump administration at its word, and the realization that the tariff talk wasn't just a negotiating tactic is starting to sink in,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, in an email. \"The sell-off that we are beginning to see has room to run (to the downside) as long as the tariff threats remain more than idle talk.\"",
      "On Monday, a reporter asked Mr. Trump if there was room left for Canada and Mexico to arrive at a deal before the deadline.",
      "\"No room left for Mexico or for Canada, no,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"The tariffs, they're all set, they go into effect tomorrow.\"",
      "He has wielded tariffs as an instrument to extract concessions from foreign governments and encourage manufacturing in the U.S.",
      "\"It's a very powerful weapon that politicians haven't used because they were either dishonest, stupid, or paid off in some other form,\" he said at the White House Monday after announcing a $100 billion investment by a Taiwanese semiconductor company. \"And now we're using them.\"",
      "The tariffs are in response to what Mr. Trump views as Mexico and Canada's irresponsible handling of the southern and northern borders, including\u00a0fentanyl entering the United States. Both countries won last-minute delays on the tariffs in February after Sheinbaum and Trudeau vowed to do more to crack down on fentanyl and illegal border crossings.",

The market's trajectory could continue downward, he added, depending on how long the tariffs remain in effect.",
      "The burgeoning trade war between the U.S., China, Canada and Mexico is helping to extend a recent slump for U.S. stocks that was prompted by signs of weakness in the economy.

      "Markets in Europe fell sharply while stocks in Asia saw more modest declines.",

      "Anxiety over tariffs is also bleeding into the corporate side of the economic equation. Target reported Tuesday that sales and profit in the crucial holiday quarter both fell from a year ago, though they were better than expected. The Minnesota retailer said there will be \"meaningful pressure\" on its profits to start the year because of tariffs and other costs.",
      "Shares of Target and Best Buy fell after the retailers warned of pressure on sales and higher prices for consumers. Target shares tumbled $3.62, or 3.0%, to $117.14.",
      "Many had hoped Mr. Trump would choose a less painful path on global trade. Monday's loss shaved the S&P 500's gain since Election Day down to just over 1% from a peak of more than 6%. That rally had been built largely on hopes for policies from Mr. Trump that would strengthen the U.S. economy and businesses.",
      "After the S&P 500 set a record  last month following a parade of fatter-than-expected profit reports from big U.S. companies, the market began diving following weaker-than-expected reports  on the U.S. economy, including a couple showing U.S. households are getting much more pessimistic  about inflation because of the threat of tariffs. Such pessimism is not unwarranted, according to analysts.",

    "summary": "A spike in cryptocurrency prices Monday morning after President Donald Trump's surprise Sunday announcement quickly fizzled by Monday afternoon.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Sunday that his administration is working toward creating a \"crypto strategic reserve\" that will include bitcoin and ethereum, along with lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, and cardano. He later followed up with another post saying his planned reserve would also include bitcoin and ether, the two most popular cryptocurrencies.",
      "The announcement helped crypto prices rebound after recent sell-offs, but only for a few hours. After rising to $90,000 Monday morning, bitcoin fell to roughly $87,000, or 7.3%, by Monday afternoon. Ethereum tumbled 14.6% to $2,153. Massive price spikes in XRP, solana and cardano also fizzled, dropping 12.1%, 13% and 12.3%, respectively.",
      "Nic Puckrin, financial analyst, investor and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in a note that the cause of the temporary price boost was most likely a \"combination of 'hopium' with a classic short squeeze,\" adding that more concrete information on the crypto reserve plan is needed to reassure investors of its worth.",
      "\"While the crypto reserve announcement was a bullish catalyst for crypto prices in the short term, its long-term impact remains questionable. For one thing, no actual details have been disclosed yet,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That said, the creation of digital currency reserve is a milestone moment for bitcoin and blockchain technology.",
      "\"The launch of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve marks a pivotal moment for digital assets, reflecting a major step in the government's engagement with the crypto industry,\" said Federico Brokate, head of the U.S. business at 21Shares, in an analyst note. \"This initiative not only reinforces Bitcoin's role as a maturing store of value but also highlights the importance of blockchain networks like ethereum, solana, XRP and cardano in financial infrastructure, payments and decentralized finance.\"",
      "What is a crypto strategic reserve?",
      "As described in the president's executive order\u00a0from January 23, the crypto strategic reserve would be a national stockpile of digital assets created under a federal regulatory framework developed by the newly established Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.",
      "The working group will be chaired by high ranking officials, including the White House AI & crypto czar, the secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump pledged support for a \"strategic national bitcoin\" stockpile, which would include bitcoin the U.S. government has previously seized in law enforcement actions. Sunday's announcement was the first time he advocated for the government to hold other types of cryptocurrencies.",
      "How the crypto strategic reserve would be structured and maintained is not yet clear, as the White House did not immediately provide additional details, including how much of each type of cryptocurrency Trump wants the U.S. to hold, and how the government would acquire them.",
      "But more information could be revealed this week, as Trump has also recently announced he will speak at and host industry leaders on Friday at a White House \"Crypto Summit.\"",
      "\"The first White House Crypto Summit on Friday will be crucial to watch,\" said Puckrin. \"We will be waiting to see who will be there, what will be discussed, and whether any actual steps toward implementation are outlined. The key question is, how will they fund and legislate this reserve? Until we have some answers, there's little substance to support this rally, and it could fizzle out as quickly as it started.\"",
      "What's the point of a strategic crypto reserve?",
      "Similar to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects the U.S. economy from disruptions in oil supplies, a national crypto reserve would help diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risks, according advocates of the plan.",
      "Critics, however, say the volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them a poor choice as a reserve asset.",
      "Potential hurdles",
      "Creating a crypto strategic reserve is likely to require an act from Congress, just as with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was created in December 1975 when then President Gerald Ford signed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.",
      "Also, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin is likely to face sustained pushback among some corners of the heavily divided cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin is the oldest and by far most popular cryptocurrency, and accounts for more than half of the world's global crypto market cap.",
      "The president has cast himself as hero to the crypto industry, which he said in his announcement had been the target of \"years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration.\" The crypto industry felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win election.",
      "The first several weeks of his administration have seen several moves to boost crypto, including ending or pausing high-profile enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Crypto prices soared after Trump's victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted \"YOU'RE WELCOME!!!\" on social media.",
      "But prices have fallen since Trump's inauguration and Trump has faced criticism, including from allies within the crypto industry, for helping launch a personal meme coin just before he took office that has since collapsed in value.",

      "President Trump's tariffs on three key U.S. trade partners, which are set to go into effect\u00a0Tuesday, could drive up automobile costs for U.S. consumers by thousands of dollars and put a dent in U.S. car sales, industry analysts and U.S.-based automakers say.",
      "The 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers.",
      "The price hikes from Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to be substantial enough that some car buyers might balk at the higher costs, according to AEG CEO Patrick Anderson.",
      "\"Our analysis shows the proposed tariffs would have a very big effect on North American assembled cars by multiple automakers,\" Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them.\"",
      "Some product lines and equipment combination could become uneconomical for automakers to continue producing, he noted. \"It would be a huge disruption to the industry,\" Anderson said.",
      "Which vehicles could see the greatest price increases?",
      "The range of added costs on vehicles could run from $4,000 to $10,000, with the cost of producing some electric vehicles that rely heavily on components from China rising by as much as $12,200, according to AEG's analysis.",
      "Here are the projected impacts of the tariffs on some types of popular vehicles, according to the study:",

      "Tariff-driven cost increases may lead to a \"potential loss of sales\" for domestic automakers, given that consumers might turn to the used car market, or seek out automobiles assembled in Japan, for example, for cheaper alternatives, Anderson added.",
      "\"Or, they could decide simply not to buy one at all,\" he said.",
      "Automobile supply chains are complex because they involve numerous parts, some of which can cross borders more than once over the course of the assembly process. With tariffs added to the equation, costs could quickly escalate for automakers.",
      "\"The automobile sector, in particular, is likely to see considerable negative consequences, not only because of the disruption of the supply chains that crisscross the three countries in the manufacturing process, but also because of the expected increase in the price of vehicles, which can dampen demand,\" Cornell University professor of government and public policy Gustavo Flores-Macias said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Dan Hearsch, Americas leader of the automotive & industrial practice at AlixPartners, a global consulting firm, said the tariffs will present at least a momentary advantage for manufacturers that assemble vehicles in Japan, Korea or Europe, for example.",
      "\"For automakers that don't import from Canada or Mexico, they'll end up with a little bit of an advantage, because they won't be hit with this brand-new tariff,\" he said. \"So for some period of time, vehicles coming in that aren't subject to additional tariffs will have a big advantage over domestic companies, or those that are producing in Canada, Mexico or the U.S.\"",
      "He added, \"It's basically penalizing companies relative to those that are importing vehicles from other places, for now.\"",
      "Ford CEO says tariffs would have \"huge impact\"",
      "In an earnings call with analysts on last month, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley said a prolonged period of higher tariffs would wipe out the company's profits, drive up vehicle prices and slow economic growth.",
      "\"There is no question that tariffs at 25% level from Canada and Mexico, if they're protracted, would have a huge impact on our industry with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out and adverse effect on the U.S. jobs as well as the entire value system in our industry,\" Farley said. \"Tariffs would also mean higher prices for customers.\"",

    "summary": "Investors wary of President Trump's plan to add tariffs of 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as a negative GDP forecast.",
    "story": [
      "Stocks fell sharply on Monday after President Trump said he has decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, with Wall Street concerned that the import duties could threaten U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "The broad-based S&P 500 index tumbled 105 points, or 1.8%, to 5,850, marking its biggest one-day decline so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index shed 2.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5%.",
      "Additionally, new data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is forecasting an economic contraction in the first quarter, with gross domestic product projected to\u00a0decline an annualized 2.8% in the current quarter \u2014 a reversal from growth of almost 3% that was forecast as recently as early February.",
      "Economists are sounding alarms about growing economic uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's tariffs, which could push up prices in the U.S. and undermine the president's pledge to eliminate the inflation that ate into consumers' purchasing power during the Biden administration. At the same time, recent economic data is showing some cracks in the financial health of U.S. households, with consumer confidence dropping in February to its lowest in four years.",
      "\"We expect that inflation in the U.S. will be stoked by between 1.1% and 1.4% from tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with another 0.7% coming from those slapped on China,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, in an email. \"The economic implications are vast: the price of everyday goods will rise, corporate profits will feel the squeeze and consumers will ultimately foot the bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Americans say their outlook for the next year is mixed, with more people likely to say the economy is getting worse than better, according to CBS News polling. Consumers say they believe the economy and inflation should be Mr. Trump's top issues, but most say they see the president prioritizing other issues, such as downsizing the federal workforce, another CBS News poll found.",
      "The push behind Mr. Trump's tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump views tariffs \u2014 taxes on imports \u2014 as an economic elixir that can restore factories to the American heartland, raise money for the government and pressure foreign countries to do what he wants.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump put tariffs on most Chinese goods and on imported solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminum. The tax increases might have raised prices on those items, but they had little or no impact on overall inflation, which remained modest. Nor did they do much to restore factory jobs.",
      "Economists agree that a second Trump trade war could be far costlier than the first.",
      "\"That was then. This is now,'' said trade analyst William Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, his trade team carefully focused its tariff hit list to avoid or at least delay the impact on consumers. They targeted industrial products and not those \"that would show up on Walmart's shelves,\" said Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official. \"That tamped down the impact.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession, said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco.",
      "Because U.S. businesses must bear the added costs from tariffs, they largely pass on the costs to American consumers. That, in turn, could weigh on consumer spending at a time when households are still grappling with the fallout from post-pandemic inflation.",
      "The Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through widespread job cuts, could have a ripple effect, curtailing spending by U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

      "\"A meeting hangover is the idea that when we have a bad meeting, we just don't leave it at the door. It sticks with us and it negatively affects our productivity,\" said Steven Rogelberg, a professor at UNC Charlotte and author of \"The Surprising Science of Meetings.\"",

      "Rogelberg recommends several strategies to prevent meeting hangovers:",
      "\"Keep the attendee list as small as possible,\" Rogelberg said. \"Remember that the more the leader talks, the lower the rating of effectiveness. Thus, the meeting leader needs to talk less and facilitate more.\"",
      "Rather than organizing agendas as topics to be discussed, Rogelberg suggests structuring them as questions to be answered.",
      "\"By framing agenda items as questions, you have a better sense of who really has to be invited to the meeting,\" he said. \"You know when to end the meeting and if the meeting has been successful \u2014 the questions have been answered.\"",
      "This question-based approach creates an engaging challenge that draws people in, he said, adding that \"if you just can't think of any questions, it likely means you don't need to create a meeting.\"",
      "For employees already suffering from meeting hangovers, Rogelberg suggests venting but centering on problem-focused conversations with colleagues.",
      "\"Chatting with your colleague about how to deal with the situation for the future, getting their thoughts, engaging in sense-making where you're trying to understand, taking different perspectives on what just happened \u2014 those types of conversations increase your skills and your resilience when you do have a bad meeting,\" Rogelberg said.",

    "story": [
      "State Department staff were taken aback this week by a department directive instructing embassies and consulates to stop publishing air quality monitoring data.",
      "CBS News has reviewed the message that was sent to staff on March 4, which says \"currently there is no anticipated date for real-time data to be available.\" Embassy staff and their families relied on the reports to alert them to poor air quality days.",
      "\"I was shocked by the announcement,\" said a current staffer, who asked to remain anonymous due to concerns about their job, and who said the decision doesn't make much sense as the existing infrastructure to monitor air quality is already in place and operational. \"I don't see any purpose in turning off this data, it doesn't make any sense,\" said another department employee.",
      "A State Department spokesman told CBS News in a statement that the air quality monitors are running, but the effort to transmit air pollution data from embassies and consulates is no longer happening \"due to funding constraints that have caused the Department to turn off the underlying network.\" When asked what it costs to operate the program, the State Department did not provide an answer.",
      "\"The cost to maintain these systems is trivial,\" said Rick Duke, who served as the deputy special envoy for climate at the State Department until January and believes this isn't about saving money as much as it's driven by misplaced anti-climate ideology in the Trump administration. \"These monitors aren't even about climate,\" said Duke, \"Why take away health information from embassy staff and the public?\"",
      "Air monitoring at U.S. embassies began informally in 2008 when a single monitor was placed at the embassy in Beijing, China. The results were posted hourly on Twitter, informing the public about levels of air pollution in the city. The account called\u00a0AirBeijing became internet-famous in 2010 when it tweeted that the air on Nov. 11 was \"Crazy Bad\" when the machine registered dangerously high levels of air pollution.",
      "The purpose behind the monitoring was to inform U.S. citizens living in the region about the state of the city's air, but the Chinese public quickly picked up the information and began demanding their government address the toxic pollution that local officials often downplayed.",
      "The State Department expanded air monitoring at other embassies around the world, installing 78 monitors elsewhere, and made the data available on AirNow.gov. A 2022 scientific study found that the embassy program was highly successful in reducing air pollutants, \"resulting in substantial decreases in the premature mortality risk faced by the over 300 million people living in cities home to a US embassy monitor.\"",
      "But now that the program is terminated, the webpage for embassy data only produces an error message. The last available reading in Beijing was posted on March 4, the day the agency stopped transmitting data.",
      "Current State Department staff told CBS News that access to air quality data is key when weighing overseas assignments, especially for those who must move their entire family and children to places with unhealthy air, or in locations where air monitoring by local governments is unreliable or non-existent.",
      "\"Robbing employees of the information they need for the health decisions of their children is immoral,\" said a current staffer, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.",
      "A State Department spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that the air data continues to be collected and \"will be made available when there is a secure and reliable way to transmit it.\" They said the department is \"evaluating other transmission options.\"",
      "The spokesperson also said the air quality monitoring equipment \"is only one of a number of tools the Department uses to ensure the health and safety of our staff.\"",
      "When CBS News asked staffers about the other tools, they said they were not aware of any and did not know how else to access the information.",

      "ICE on Thursday was detaining the first group of migrant parents and children in a detention facility in Texas designed to hold families with minors, according to an internal government report obtained by CBS News. The group includes three children, the report shows.",

      "\"We aren't going to ignore the rule of law,\" McLaughlin told CBS News.",
      "The Karnes detention facility is located in Karnes City, Texas, a small town east of San Antonio. The other ICE detention center equipped to house families with minor children is located in Dilley, Texas, another small town south of San Antonio. The Biden administration used those sites to detain migrant adults.",
      "The move by the Trump administration reverses a policy change by the Biden administration, which discontinued the long-term detention of migrant families. It's a practice that was first implemented on a large-scale by the Obama administration, in an attempt to discourage families from crossing the southern border illegally.",
      "Advocates and child welfare experts have long denounced family detention, saying it is harmful to children and their psychological well-being. A 2016 report commissioned by the Department of Homeland Security called for family immigration detention to be phased out.",
      "\"There is no safe way to detain families and no legitimate justification for this inhumane practice,\" said Neha Desai, an attorney at the California-based National Center of Youth Law representing migrant children in a federal court case.",
      "The U.S. government has long faced legal, humanitarian and operational challenges when processing migrant parents and children who are in the country without legal permission. In 2015, for example, a federal judge ruled that the government should generally not hold migrant children for longer than 20 days, dramatically limiting family detention in the immigration context.",
      "The revival of family detention is the latest step taken by the Trump administration to expand ICE's capabilities to arrest, detain and deport migrants who are in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Officials at ICE have been under tremendous pressure from top Trump administration officials to ramp up arrests and deportations.",
      "Unlike its efforts to seal off the U.S.-Mexico border, which have yielded a 25-year low in illegal crossings, the Trump administration's immigration enforcement campaign in the interior of the country has run into operational obstacles.",
      "ICE's detention capacity, for example, has been depleted. As of Thursday, the agency's detention system was at 120% capacity, holding more than 46,000 migrants, despite only having 38,000 beds on paper, internal government statistics show.",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security said Friday it is ending the collective bargaining agreement with the union representing thousands of frontline workers with the Transportation Security Administration, a decision the TSA union called an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
      "In announcing the decision, DHS criticized the union \u2014 which represents worker responsible for screening airline passengers \u2014 claiming TSA employs more people working full-time on union issues than those \"performing screening functions at 86% of our airports.\"",
      "\"This action will ensure Americans will have more effective and modernized workforces across the nation's transportation networks,\" Homeland Security said in a statement. \"TSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.\"",
      "The decision to end collective bargaining was criticized by the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing flight attendants, and Democratic lawmakers, with both claiming that the action will make flying less safe. DHS's decision comes after the agency last year pushed to boost TSA workers' pay, which has historically lagged that of other government employees.",
      "In May 2024, the TSA administrator at the time, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement and credited\u00a0pay increases\u00a0that went into effect in 2023 for helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",
      "\"Attempting to negate [TSA workers'] legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2013 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, in a statement on Friday.",
      "In the announcement, DHS said poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \"to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from Thompson and the union.",
      "The decision is \"terrible for aviation security and everyone who depends on safe travel,\" the Association of Flight Attendants said. The group added, \"This will take us back to the days of security at the lowest price with the highest costs for our country.\"",
      "Impact on 47,000 TSA workers",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the TSA workers, said in a statement that the order would strip collective bargaining rights from roughly 47,000 transportation security officers, or TSOs. Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",
      "The union said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump's administration were violating the right of staffers to join a union. It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \"completely fabricated.\"",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers.",
      "AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\"Our union has been out in front challenging this administration's unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \"Now our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\"",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers' collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration's \"vision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\"",
      "\"By removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\" Stahl wrote. \"This determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\"",
      "Stahl said the agency \"will establish alternative procedures\" to address employee concerns and grievances \"in a fair and transparent manner.\"",
      "\"Anti-union talking points\"",
      "Rep. Thompson criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \"flat out wrong anti-union talking points.\" He said the real aim was \"diminishing\" the workforce so \"they can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\"",
      "\"Attempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" Thompson said. \"Since the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA's attrition rates have plummeted.\"",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

    "summary": "A rugged stretch of the U.S. southern border has seen a steep decline in the illicit movement of people and drugs in recent weeks.",
    "story": [
      "Sunland Park, New Mexico \u2014 On a recent afternoon, CBS News accompanied U.S. Border Patrol agent Claudio Herrera along this rugged stretch of the U.S. southern border.",
      "Herrera said the area, located within Border Patrol's sprawling El Paso sector, has long been a hotspot for the illicit movement of people and drugs. But the situation there has changed markedly in recent weeks.",
      "\"The activity is very slow,\" Herrera said along the New Mexico border, which is patrolled by El Paso sector agents. \"There's multiple factors attached to why we have seen a significant drop in apprehensions recently.\"",
      "He continued: \"One of them, of course, is consequences,\" referring to deportations of those entering the U.S. unlawfully.",
      "President Trump has moved aggressively to carry out the large-scale crackdown on illegal immigration he promised on the campaign trail. Since his inauguration, illegal border crossings, which were on the decline during the last year of the Biden administration, have plunged even further.",
      "In February, Border Patrol recorded roughly 8,500 apprehensions of migrants who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, the lowest level in at least 25 years, according to government figures obtained by CBS News.",
      "Asked if the dramatic change stems from new policies out of Washington, D.C., Herrera said, \"It has a lot to do with that.\"",
      "Citing muscular presidential powers, Mr. Trump has effectively shut down the American asylum system, allowing U.S. border agents to swiftly expel migrants under the legal premise that the country is facing an \"invasion.\" He has also deployed thousands of additional troops to the U.S. southern border and tasked the military with carrying out deportations.",
      "During that recent ride-along with Border Patrol in the El Paso sector, CBS News cameras captured a heavily fortified U.S. border, spotting Border Patrol agents, soldiers, vehicles and barriers. But there were no migrants in sight.",
      "Mr. Trump's crackdown was also on full display when CBS News traveled to the other side of the border.",
      "At a shelter in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Eduardo Medina and his wife Joanna Cortes described how they had brought their three children to northern Mexico last year after fleeing the high levels of crime and violence in the southern state of Michoac\u00e1n.",
      "The young family said they had been staying in a small room for six months, hoping to get an appointment to enter the U.S. with the government's permission. But the app the Biden administration set up to distribute entry appointments to migrants in Mexico, known as CBP One, was quickly terminated after Mr. Trump returned to the White House.",
      "While her dream involved opening a restaurant in the U.S. and enrolling her children in American schools, Cortes said her family is thinking of \"returning to the land where we were born\" due to the suspension of the CBP One system.",
      "\"What else are we going to do?\" she said in Spanish, adding later that she did not want her family to cross into the U.S. illegally.",
      "Still, returning to Michoac\u00e1n is a devastating prospect for Cortes.",
      "Breaking down in tears, Cortes said she and her husband \"sold everything\" to ensure their children could have a \"different life\" away from the \"hell\" in Michoac\u00e1n.",
      "But that dream, she said, has \"ended.\"",
      "Asked what he would tell families like the ones interviewed by CBS News in Mexico, Walter Slosar, the top Border Patrol official in the El Paso sector, said U.S. immigration laws must be enforced.",
      "\"We're going to make sure that we're securing the border, and we're going to do so unapologetically,\" Slosar said. \"I understand that people ended up in these areas, but we did not bring those individuals to this specific area.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Friday that he is \"strongly considering\" imposing sanctions and tariffs on Russia until it agrees to a ceasefire and peace deal that would halt Moscow's three-year war with Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump's post on his social media platform, Truth Social, appears to be in response to drone and missile attacks launched on Ukrainian energy facilities Friday. The president said that because Russia is \"absolutely 'pounding'\" Ukraine, \"I am strongly considering large scale banking sanctions, sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a cease fire and final settlement agreement on peace is reached.\"",
      "\"To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "The president's threats of tariffs and sanctions are the first indication he is weighing adverse action against Russia since his tense meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House one week ago. But Mr. Trump told reporters\u00a0 in the Oval Office on Friday that he is \"finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine, and they don't have the cards.\"",
      "\"I find that in terms of getting a final settlement, it may be easier dealing with Russia \u2014 which is surprising \u2014 because they have all the cards,\" he said.",
      "The president acknowledged that Ukraine is taking \"tremendous punishment\" from Russia's air assaults but appeared to defend Russian President Vladimir Putin, telling reporters that he is \"doing what anybody else would do.\"",
      "\"I think he wants to get it stopped and settled and think he's hitting it harder than he's been hitting them,\" Mr. Trump said of Putin. \"I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now. He wants to get it ended, and I think Ukraine wants to get it ended.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy were on track last week to sign a key rare earth minerals agreement and hold a news conference at the White House, but the Ukrainian leader's visit ended abruptly after an Oval Office meeting between the two and top U.S. and Ukrainian officials became openly contentious.",
      "The president told Zelenskyy at the meeting that he should reach a ceasefire deal with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vice President JD Vance accused Ukraine's leader of being \"disrespectful\" and not sufficiently grateful for U.S. support of its efforts to combat Russia's aggression.",
      "In the wake of the meeting, Mr. Trump paused U.S. military aid to Ukraine and intelligence sharing.",
      "But negotiations between the U.S. and Ukraine appear to be resuming, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House national security adviser Michael Waltz set to head to Saudi Arabia next week for discussions with a Ukrainian delegation, Waltz said Friday.",
      "\"We had initial engagement with the Russians, the Ukrainians had a great opportunity to bind our economies together through that mineral deal,\" Waltz told reporters at the White House. \"Unfortunately that didn't go so well, but we think we're going to get things back on track.\" Mr. Trump also said NATO Secretary General Rutte would be coming for a visit next week.",
      "Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, told reporters Wednesday that the goal is to \"get down a framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire.\"",
      "Separately, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said during a speech Thursday that the Trump administration has kept enhanced sanctions on Russia in place \"and will not hesitate to go 'all in,' should it provide leverage in peace negotiations,\" according to Reuters.",
      "Zelenskyy, meanwhile, said the first step toward achieving peace is for Russia to stop its attacks.",
      "\"Ukraine is ready to pursue the path to peace, and it is Ukraine that strives for peace from the very first second of this war. The task is to force Russia to stop the war,\" he wrote on social media Friday.",

    "summary": "Asked about NATO Article 5 commitment, Trump says U.S. \"not going to defend\" allies that fail to meet his spending requirements.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump suggested Thursday that members of the U.S.-led NATO transatlantic military alliance would not come to the aid of the U.S., should America come under attack. NATO members are bound to back each other militarily in the face of any aggression under the collective defense clause in the alliance's founding treaty.",
      "\"Do you think they're going to come and protect us? Hmm. They're supposed to. I'm not so sure,\" Mr. Trump said as he addressed reporters at the Oval Office.",
      "He said in the same conversation that he would breach that treaty and only send the U.S. military to defend NATO allies that contribute what he deems to be a fair share of their national GDPs to their defense budgets.",
      "A core foundation upon which the nearly 80-year-old alliance is built is Article 5 of the NATO founding treaty. Under that article, should any NATO nation become the victim of an armed attack, the other members will consider it as an attack against all members and will \"take the actions it deems necessary\" to assist.",
      "Article 5 has only been invoked once in NATO's history, and that was on Sept. 12, 2001, one day after Al-Qaeda killed almost 3,000 people in its unprecedented terrorist attack on Washington and New York.",
      "In the U.S.-led invasions that followed in Iraq and Afghanistan, America's NATO allies cumulatively lost well over 1,000 troops in combat over a 20 year period. Britain alone lost 642 members of its armed forces.",
      "More than 7,000 members of the U.S. armed forces were killed during that same period, according to the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University.",
      "President Trump was speaking in response to a question about whether the U.S. would defend NATO partners if they were not paying what he deems to be their fair share toward their own defense.",
      "The president has long argued that the U.S. carries an undue burden, spending more to help ensure Europe's defense than the NATO members on the continent, and he's pushing now for those members to boost their domestic defense spending to at least 5% of their respective GDPs.",
      "\"I said if you're not going to pay, we're not going to defend\u2026 if you're not going to pay your bills, we're not going to defend you,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The 5% defense spending Mr. Trump has demanded of America's NATO allies is a significantly higher proportion than what the U.S. pays. The U.S. currently allocates about 3% of its GDP to defense annually, one of the higher amounts relative to other NATO nations, but not the highest.",
      "According to data compiled by the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, the highest spender, relative to its GDP, is Poland, which shares a long border with Ukraine. Then, after the U.S., come Greece and a number of NATO nations right on the eastern edge of democratic Europe, closest to Ukraine and, beyond it, Russia, along with the Nordic states.",
      "Over the past decade, European NATO members and Canada have steadily increased their collective spending on defense from 1.43% of their combined GDP in 2014, to 2.02% in 2024, according to figures posted on NATO's website \u2014 but many individual member states are still falling well short of the 5% mark that Mr. Trump has called for. Some have yet to even meet the 2% of GDP spending threshold currently set as a target by the alliance.",
      "Poland's President Andrzej Duda on Thursday said he had proposed a spending minimum of 3% of GDP for all NATO members in a post on social media.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the likely next leader of Germany, also announced a plan this week to raise hundreds of billions of dollars in extra spending on defense and infrastructure should he take office.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks came at the end of a week in which his administration ruffled European feathers by appearing to question the contributions of America's NATO allies.",
      "In pointed comments on Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron said France and the U.S. were \"loyal and faithful allies,\" and that France had \"respect and friendship\" for the United States.",
      "\"I think we're entitled to expect the same,\" Macron said",
      "Vance irks U.K. and France with remark he claims wasn't aimed at them",
      "In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Vice President JD Vance appeared to diminish the value of military contributions by key U.S. allies \u2014 both past and future \u2014 while discussing the proposed minerals deal between Ukraine and the U.S.",
      "Vance said the potential economic deal, which the White House has pushed Kyiv hard to sign, \"is a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years.\"",
      "Those comments sparked outrage from politicians in France and the U.K. \u2014 the only two countries that have thus far said they might send troops to help maintain peace under a ceasefire in Ukraine.",
      "While Vance later appeared to walk his remarks back on social media, saying that both countries had, \"fought bravely alongside the US over the last 20 years\" and that he did not \"even mention the UK or France\" in the interview, the diplomatic damage was done.",
      "France's far right leader Marine Le Pen condemned Vance's comments, defending the \"noble memory\" of French troops and saying that \"no patriot will therefore allow it to be said that our country is ordinary.\"",

      "Term limits prevent current California Gov. Gavin Newsom from running again, and the election to replace him will take place next year. Politico first reported the timing on Harris' self-imposed deadline to decide whether to run. Candidates have until early March 2026 to file paperwork ahead of the June 2, 2026, primary.",
      "Another source familiar with Harris' thinking told CBS News that she is \"seriously considering\" a run for governor. A gubernatorial bid would likely mean she would not run for president in 2028, which she is also considering.",
      "The field to replace Newsom, who has been governor since 2019, is expected to be sizable, but Harris' entry into the race could dissuade other Democrats from launching bids of their own.",
      "A former Harris adviser said \"she'd be great,\" and has already proven she could lead at the national level and as California attorney general.",
      "\"On a national level, what Newsom has been able to do with that job, there is a lot of upside with what she can do as the governor of the fifth-largest economy with her name ID, when our party is looking for national leadership and California looking for good governance \u2014 especially at a time when California is going through a lot,\" the former adviser said.",
      "Harris, 60, has largely stayed out of the spotlight since her November loss to President Trump. Following the election, Harris and former second gentleman Doug Emhoff first headed back to California, while she took time to decide her next move. Her primary residence is in Los Angeles.

    "summary": "Among the CISA cuts were top recruits tasked with protecting the nation's critical infrastructure from foreign and domestic cyber attacks.",
    "story": [
      "For Kelly Shaw, unemployment is unfamiliar territory. \"I've never been in this situation before. I've never been fired,\" Shaw said, suddenly quiet, while seated at her kitchen table in Northern Virginia.",
      "Nearly three years ago, the longtime senior intelligence analyst left the Navy, after being recruited by the nation's top cyber defense agency and rising up through the ranks. Eventually, Shaw helped establish a congressionally mandated program designed to continuously monitor and detect cyber breaches of the nation's power grid, pipelines and water system \u2013 installing sensors across critical infrastructure designed to detect insider threats and foreign adversaries like China, Russia and Iran.",
      "\"It was all about the information we can get within networks to find the bad guys \u2013 any indicators of compromise, evidence of the adversary, moving through a network and attempting to do bad things. That's what we did,\" Shaw said, pausing. \"Well, that's what some will still do.\"",
      "The former manager for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency's \"CyberSentry\" program, Shaw was also among the 130 probationary CISA workers mass fired in the \"Valentine's Day Massacre\" during the holiday weekend last month.",
      "That weekend, the form letter termination notices arrived for over 4% of CISA's workforce, telling them they were \"not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency's current needs.\" Among them were the nation's threat hunters, incident response team members, disabled veterans and employees who'd already signed onto the federal government's deferred resignation program.",
      "Others were former private sector workers who left lucrative jobs making seven-figure salaries to join the federal government and officials recruited into DHS' innovative hiring program \u2014 dubbed the \"Cyber Talent Management System\" \u2014 and analysts with top secret security clearances.",
      "\"I waited literally 13 months from the moment I got my offer letter to the moment I started this job,\" said former cybersecurity specialist Paula Davis, recounting her arduous security clearance process. Before her termination letter arrived in her email inbox, Davis said she was required to send agency leadership an email justifying her position, but she never received a response.",
      "Davis spent her days analyzing code for state and local municipalities, identifying risks or abnormalities across the nation's aging critical infrastructure.",
      "\"We're being targeted daily, hourly and every single minute,\" Davis said, citing suspected cybercriminals' attempts to infiltrate water systems and the power grid. She called her role fighting those intrusions her \"dream job.\"",
      "\"I didn't take an oath to the Constitution just to start getting a paycheck,\" Davis said, \"Or else I would have just gone back into the private sector. I would have stayed at a big corporation.\"",
      "Since last month, the rapid-fire firings have shaken lawmakers and high-ranking officials, leaving many current and former employees dumbfounded. CBS News has spoken with over a dozen current and former CISA employees, including several who were granted anonymity in interviews, due to fear of reprisal.",
      "\"These are the people that are the first line of defense in responding to incidents like Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon, and if we go even further back, SolarWinds,\" said one former CISA employee, referencing a string of foreign cyber espionage campaigns dating back to President Trump's first administration.",
      "\"These are elite hunters that look across critical infrastructure and government networks to figure out if these bad actors are active in these networks,\" the former employee continued. \"The people who find how deeply they've penetrated and 'how do we get them out of there?'\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, warned at a hearing Wednesday that lawmakers are hearing that \"significant cuts are coming for the remaining workforce\" at CISA.",
      "\"That kind of talent, you just don't find it every day,\" Thompson told CBS News. \"You have to convince many of those individuals to leave lucrative private sector employment and come and accept the public mission of securing our cyber security systems and protecting our country.\"",
      "In a post on LinkedIn, last month, Former CISA Director Jen Easterly wrote that the agency had hired over 2,000 new employees during her more than three-year tenure.",
      "Since 2021, CISA's \"strategic recruitment\" program \u2013 congressionally mandated and more than seven years in the making \u2013 has competed with the private sector to attract and retain world-class talent to execute a core mission of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CISA. Cyber Talent Management System or \"CTMS\" hires were by law employees with \"measurable or observable\" attributes including \"knowledge, skills, abilities and behaviors.\"",
      "A former human resources employee for CISA who was among those fired told CBS News that before his termination, he was tasked with compiling a list of probationary employees, and among them were over 100 CTMS staff members.",
      "\"Everybody in CTMS is automatically in a three-year probation, so it's easier to get rid of them,\" the former HR employee told CBS News. \"Close to 99% of our CTMS employees were probationary.\"",
      "\"You are extinguishing the best and brightest in one fell swoop,\" a current CISA employee said.",
      "A CISA spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that the agency had 142 employees as part of its talent recruitment program, but did not disclose the number of employees fired.",
      "Shaw was among the first recruits to the \"CTMS\" program, entering with 12 years of government service, two master degrees in electrical engineering and cybersecurity, plus at least nine different specialized cyber certifications.",
      "\"I had such confidence,\" Shaw said. \"With all my prior experience. I just completed my doctorate in May of last year. So I thought I was well positioned to stay at CISA\u2026.But when I saw that executive order come through about probationary employees, I kind of panicked.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the Trump administration is \"making sweeping cuts and reform across the federal government to eliminate egregious waste and incompetence that has been happening for decades at the expense of the American taxpayer.\"",
      "\"To me, knowing how sleek and how well organized of an engine we had at CISA, that's a lie,\" Shaw said of the effort\u00a0to slash federal spending by eliminating federal workers. \"I don't know who else is going to be cut loose from our nation's cyber defense organizations. But I'm worried about that. I'm worried about that. This should be the last place that we should be cutting this expertise.\"",
      "Along with firing scores of probationary workers, over the last month, CISA has put on leave at least a dozen employees who are tasked with stopping foreign interference in U.S. elections, part of a wider trend of dismantling U.S. efforts to fight foreign meddling in elections.",
      "But concerns stemming from cybersecurity workforce cuts extend beyond the CISA workforce.",
      "Former NSA cybersecurity director Rob Joyce raised \"grave concerns\" that aggressive threats to cuts of U.S. government probationary employees will have a \"devastating impact on the cybersecurity and our national security.\"",
      "\"At my former agency, remarkable technical talent was recruited into developmental programs that provided intensive unique training and hands-on experience to cultivate vital skills,\" Joyce said. \"Eliminating probationary employees will destroy a pipeline of top talent responsible for hunting and eradicating [Chinese] threats.\"",
      "To help assist fired employers at her former agency, Easterly has created a matching website to connect former CISA alumni and prospective employers.",
      "For his part, Thompson has started a hotline to encourage fired employees at the Department of Homeland Security and its components to share their stories.",
      "After the Trump administration tapped the Office of Personnel Management to fire federal employees en masse, a federal judge temporarily blocked it, citing OPM's lack of authority to fire employees at other agencies. This week, OPM updated its guidance to reflect that firing decisions are made by individual departments and agencies, spurring the rehiring or reinstatement of batches of fired workers in the weeks since. CISA has yet to follow suit.",
      "Asked if she'd return to the agency, Shaw paused. \"I would have to go back,\" she finally said, citing CISA's essential mission and a regular paycheck. \"I mean, they'd have to earn my trust back. But I don't know how you do that.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hampton Dellinger, the former head of the office that investigates whistleblower retaliation, has dropped his legal challenge to his firing by President Trump from his role as special counsel.",
      "Dellinger's decision to end his legal fight comes hours after a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit cleared the way for Mr. Trump to terminate him as leader of the Office of Special Counsel.",
      "The D.C. Circuit granted a request from the president to halt a lower court order that blocked Dellinger's firing. The judge in that case, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, sided with the former special counsel in his challenge to his removal and said in a ruling Saturday that he must remain in the role.",
      "Dellinger's decision to walk away from the case cuts off its path to the Supreme Court, which has in a pair of recent decisions reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at will.",
      "In a letter\u00a0filed Thursday, lawyers for Dellinger told the D.C. Circuit Court that he decided to no longer pursue judicial relief. They said they are still in talks with the federal government over the next steps to bring the litigation to a close, but wrote \"Dellinger's final and public decision means that there is presently no live appeal for this court to address.\"",
      "\"I'm stopping the fight because, yesterday, circuit court judges reviewing the trial court decision in my favor granted the government's request that I be removed from office while the case continues,\" Dellinger wrote in a statement obtained by CBS News. \"This new ruling means that OSC will be run by someone totally beholden to the president for the months that would pass before I could get a final decision from the U.S. Supreme Court.\"",
      "The ethics watchdog warned that the harm to those dependent on the agency under a future special counsel sympathetic to the Trump administration \"could be immediate, grievous, and, I fear, uncorrectable.\"",
      "\"I think the circuit judges erred badly because their willingness to sign off on my ouster \u2014 even if presented as possibly temporary \u2014 immediately erases the independence Congress provided for my position, a vital protection that has been accepted as lawful for nearly fifty years. Until now,\" Dellinger said. \"And given the circuit court's adverse ruling, I think my odds of ultimately prevailing before the Supreme Court are long.\"",
      "The Justice Department, though, called Dellinger's assertion that there is no longer a live issue before the D.C. Circuit \"plainly incorrect\" because the government is subject to a permanent injunction issued by the district court Saturday. That injunction needs to be dissolved and Dellinger's complaint dismissed in order for the appeal to become moot, it said.",
      "Dellinger continued to take numerous actions under the scope of his former role while the legal battle over his firing played out. He petitioned against the Trump administration's recent mass firings of federal workers\u00a0and, on Tuesday, argued to the Merit Systems Protection Board, the administrative system for federal workers to appeal employment issues, that the Department of Agriculture's firing of over 5,000 probationary workers violated civil service protections.",
      "Dellinger was appointed by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate in February 2024 to a five-year term. But on Feb. 7, he received an email from the head of the White House's Presidential Personnel Office informing him that \"your position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel is terminated, effective immediately. Thank you for your service.\"",
      "Dellinger swiftly challenged his firing in federal district court, alleging that it was unlawful because federal law restricts his removal by the president only for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\"",
      "Soon after, Jackson ordered Dellinger to be reinstated as special counsel while she considered his request for longer relief.",
      "The Trump administration asked the D.C. Circuit and then the Supreme Court to intervene in the dispute during the earlier stages and greenlight the president's firing of Dellinger. But last month, the high court declined to immediately step into the fight and instead put off a decision while the proceedings before the district court moved forward.",
      "Then, on Saturday, Jackson ruled in favor of Dellinger and rejected the Trump administration's claim that the removal protections laid out in the Civil Service Reform Act were unconstitutional.",
      "The Justice Department again sought emergency relief from the D.C. Circuit, which granted its request to halt the district court's ruling while it considered the appeal.",
      "\"This order gives effect to the removal of appellee from his position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel,\" the unsigned order from the three-judge panel said.",
      "Dellinger's firing came as part of the president's efforts to overhaul the federal government and reduce its size and spending. Since returning to the White House for his second term, Mr. Trump has removed the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board, and fired more than a dozen agency watchdogs, actions that have sparked legal challenges.",
      "A different federal judge in Washington, D.C., ordered Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, to be reinstated earlier this month. The Justice Department has appealed that decision to the D.C. Circuit. Another district judge on Thursday ruled Mr. Trump's firing of NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox   was unlawful.",
      "Thousands of federal workers deemed probationary have been laid off after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., declined to stop the firings, and the White House personnel and budget offices have told agencies to submit \"reorganization plans\" and prepare for \"reductions in force.\"",
      "A federal judge in California last month\u00a0found that the mass terminations are likely illegal in a separate case brought by labor unions and nonprofit organizations.",
      "Separately, roughly 75,000 workers accepted Mr. Trump's offer to resign their positions and retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30 through a \"deferred resignation\" program.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast. Rosen has been a producer for several CBS News podcasts, including \"The Takeout,\" \"The Debrief\" and \"Agent of Betrayal: The Double Life of Robert Hanssen.\""

    "summary": "War heroes and historic military events are among the tens of thousands of photos and online posts marked for deletion as the PentAgon works to purge diversity, equity and inclusion content, the AP reports.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 References to a World War II Medal of Honor recipient, the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan and the first women to pass Marine infantry training are among the tens of thousands of photos and online posts marked for deletion as the Defense Department works to purge diversity, equity and inclusion content, according to a database obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The database, which was confirmed by U.S. officials and published by AP, includes more than 26,000 images that have been flagged for removal across every military branch. But the eventual total could be much higher.",
      "One official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details that have not been made public, said the purge could delete as many as 100,000 images or posts in total, when considering social media pages and other websites that are also being culled for DEI content. The official said it's not clear if the database has been finalized.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had given the military until Wednesday to remove content that highlights diversity efforts in its ranks following President Trump's executive order ending those programs across the federal government.",
      "",
      "The vast majority of the Pentagon purge targets women and minorities, including notable milestones made in the military. And it also removes a large number of posts that mention various commemorative months - such as those for Black and Hispanic people and women.",
      "But a review of the database also underscores the confusion that has swirled among agencies about what to remove following Mr. Trump's order.",
      "In some cases, photos seemed to be flagged for removal simply because their file included the word \"gay,\" including service members with that last name and an image of the B-29 aircraft Enola Gay, which dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II.",
      "Several photos of an Army Corps of Engineers dredging project in California were marked for deletion, apparently because a local engineer in the photo had the last name Gay. And a photo of Army Corps biologists was on the list, seemingly because it mentioned they were recording data about fish - including their weight, size, hatchery and gender.",
      "In addition, some photos of the Tuskegee Airmen, the nation's first Black military pilots who served in a segregated WWII unit, were listed on the database, but those may be protected due to historical content.",
      "The Air Force briefly removed new recruit training courses that included videos of the Tuskegee Airmen soon after the president's order. That drew the White House's ire over \"malicious compliance,\" and the Air Force quickly reversed the removal.",
      "Many of the images listed in the database already have been removed. Others were still visible Thursday, and it's not clear if they will be taken down at some point or be allowed to stay, including images with historical significance such as those of the Tuskegee Airmen.",
      "Asked about the database, Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot said in a statement, \"We are pleased by the rapid compliance across the Department with the directive removing DEI content from all platforms. In the rare cases that content is removed that is out of the clearly outlined scope of the directive, we instruct components accordingly.\"",
      "He noted that Hegseth has declared that \"DEI is dead\" and that efforts to put one group ahead of another through DEI programs erodes camaraderie and threatens mission execution.",
      "In some cases, the removal was partial. The main page in a post titled \"Women's History Month: All-female crew supports warfighters\" was removed. But at least one of the photos in that collection about an all-female C-17 crew could still be accessed. A shot from the Army Corps of Engineers titled \"Engineering pioneer remembered during Black History Month\" was deleted.",
      "Other photos flagged in the database but still visible Thursday included images of the World War II Women Air Service Pilots and one of U.S. Air Force Col. Jeannie Leavitt, the country's first female fighter pilot.",
      "Also still visible was an image of then-Pfc. Christina Fuentes Montenegro becoming one of the first three women to graduate from the Marine Corps' Infantry Training Battalion and an image of Marine Corps World War II Medal of Honor recipient Pfc. Harold Gonsalves.",
      "It was unclear why some other images were removed, such as a Marine Corps photo titled \"Deadlift contenders raise the bar pound by pound\" or a National Guard website image called \"Minnesota brothers reunite in Kuwait.\"",
      "The database of the 26,000 images was created to conform with federal archival laws, so if the services are queried in the future, they can show how they are complying with the law, the U.S. official said. But it may be difficult to ensure the content was archived because the responsibility to ensure each image was preserved was the responsibility of each individual unit.",
      "In many cases, workers are taking screenshots of the pages marked for removal, but it would be difficult to restore them if that decision was made, according to another official, who like the others spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide additional details that were not public.",
      "A Marine Corps official said every one of its images in the database \"either has been taken down or will be taken down.\" The Marines are moving on the directive as fast as possible, but as with the rest of the military, very few civilian or contractor employees at the Pentagon can perform content removal, the official said.",
      "In the Marine Corps, just one defense civilian is available to do the work. The Marine Corps estimates that person has identified at least 10,000 images for removal - and that does not count more than 1,600 social media sites that have not yet been addressed.",
      "Many of those social media sites were military base or unit support groups created years ago and left idle. No one still has the administrative privileges to go in and change the content.",
      "The Marine official said the service is going through each site and getting new administrative privileges so it can make the changes.",
      "On Feb. 26, the Pentagon ordered all the military services to spend countless hours poring over years of website postings, photos, news articles and videos to remove any mentions that \"promote diversity, equity and inclusion.\"",
      "If they couldn't do that by Wednesday, they were told to \"temporarily remove from public display\" all content published during the Biden administration's four years in office.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 05:00:18 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA has relied on food companies for decades to determine whether their ingredients are safe.",
    "story": [
      "Joseph Shea, who sells athletic wear in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, wonders and worries about the food he eats.",
      "The chemical ingredients with mystifying names. The references on product labels to unspecified natural or artificial flavors. The junk food that fits his budget but feels addictive and makes him feel unwell.",
      "Shea, one of 1,310 people who responded to a poll the health policy research group KFF conducted on health care priorities, said he assumes the FDA is making sure the ingredients are safe.",
      "In many cases, it is not.",
      "The FDA's restraints on food ingredients are limited and relatively feeble, especially compared with those in Europe, a KFF Health News examination found. There are at least 950 substances in our food that are not permitted in Europe, according to one expert's estimate, and chemicals linked to health concerns show up in hundreds of products that line the shelves of American supermarkets.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new head of the Department of Health and Human Services, has railed about the risks of food additives for years and has said he wants to end \"the mass poisoning of American children.\" At a March 6 confirmation hearing, Martin Makary, President Trump's nominee to head the FDA, expressed concern about foods \"with a lot of molecules that do not appear in nature.\"",
      "\"These are chemicals that the industry insists are safe, a subset of which are concerning,\" he said.",
      "But the Trump administration's initial moves to reduce staff at the FDA led the director of its food safety unit, Jim Jones, to resign last month and raised fears among food safety specialists that the administration could weaken oversight.",
      "To a great extent, the FDA leaves it to food companies to determine whether their ingredients and additives are safe. Companies don't have to tell the FDA about those decisions, and they don't have to list all ingredients on their product labels.",
      "Though pharmaceutical companies are required to share research on humans with the FDA, the agency is largely blind to what food-makers know about their products.",
      "\"The food industry does massive amounts of research that we have no access to,\" Robert Califf told a Senate committee in December on his way out as FDA commissioner.",
      "As a result: The FDA's oversight of food additives is much weaker than its oversight of prescription drugs.",
      "\"There is good reason to be concerned about the chemicals that are routinely included in much of our food,\" Califf testified.",
      "Food is a big business. American consumers spend almost $1.7 trillion annually on food and beverages, according to Circana, a research and advisory firm.",
      "Yet American food companies keep secret much of what they put in their products.",
      "KFF Health News asked nine of the largest food manufacturers \u2014 The Coca-Cola Co., Conagra Brands, General Mills, Kellanova (successor to Kellogg), The Kraft Heinz Co., Mondel\u0113z International, Nestl\u00e9, PepsiCo, and Unilever \u2014 for the number of ingredients, if any, that go unnamed on their product labels and the names of those ingredients deemed safe without involvement by the FDA, and substances used in their products in the United States but not in Europe, and vice versa.",
      "None provided answers to those questions.",
      "\"We focus on the quality of the ingredients that we use, and all comply with applicable regulatory requirements,\" Nestl\u00e9 spokesperson Dana Stambaugh said.",
      "Chemicals such as titanium dioxide and potassium bromate, whose safety has been debated, are allowed in foods in the United States but not in Europe.",
      "Corporations may turn a blind eye to potential dangers, a July 2024 FDA-funded report warned.",
      "Potentially harmful ingredients \"are not necessarily required to be named on a product label,\" the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA, an adjunct to the agency, said in the report, which was based largely on interviews with representatives of companies across the food supply chain.",
      "\"Companies may choose not to track the presence of these ingredients/compounds due to concern about future litigation,\" the report said.",
      "Some additives can remain hidden from the public behind such catchall terms as \"spices\" and \"artificial flavors,\" as the Center for Science in the Public Interest has reported, or shrouded by other exemptions from disclosure requirements.",
      "And some ingredients that should have been listed on product labels \u2014 potential allergens such as milk, wheat, eggs, and dyes \u2014 have at times gone undisclosed, according to a series of food recalls. Gaps in oversight have alarmed political leaders on both sides of the aisle, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, watchdog groups such as the CSPI, and academic researchers.",
      "Adding to the concern: the profusion of ultra-processed foods, which use a wide array of chemicals to add flavor and color, extend shelf life, reduce cost, control texture or consistency, and generally tempt people to eat more. Ultra-processed foods now make up 73% of the U.S. food supply, researchers have estimated. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, has said there's growing evidence they are \"deliberately designed to be addictive,\" contributing to an epidemic of obesity \u2014 a rare point of agreement between him and Kennedy.",
      "At his confirmation hearing, Makary said some ingredients cause a chronic, low-grade inflammatory reaction in the gastrointestinal tract. \"And what are we doing? We are drugging our nation's children at scale,\" he said.",
      "The KFF poll found that 58% of respondents want the Trump administration to prioritize setting stricter limits on chemicals in the U.S. food supply.",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, which represents many of the largest food-makers, defends the regulatory system as \"rigorous,\" \"evidence-based,\" and \"proven.\" The system enables companies \"to innovate to meet consumer demand,\" Sarah Gallo, the association's senior vice president of product policy, said in a statement to KFF Health News.",
      "\"Food manufacturers attest to the safety of an ingredient through the development of extensive scientific evidence and third-party expert review,\" Gallo added.",
      "More than a decade ago, Pew Charitable Trusts estimated that there were about 10,000 additives allowed in food in the United States \u2014 and that the FDA had not reviewed the safety of about 3,000 of them.",
      "\"The system is fundamentally broken,\" said Thomas Neltner, one of the authors of the Pew study. \"It's so bad, nobody knows \u2014 not even FDA knows \u2014 what's in our food.\"",
      "Banned abroad",
      "The FDA allows titanium dioxide to be used to enhance the appearance of foods, among other purposes. According to an Environmental Working Group database, it's listed as an ingredient in more than 1,900 products, including many candies.",
      "The European Union takes a more cautious approach. In 2021, an EU regulatory panel concluded that titanium dioxide \"can no longer be considered as safe when used as a food additive.\" The panel said it couldn't rule out the possibility that titanium dioxide could damage chromosomes.",
      "The FDA allows potassium bromate\u00a0to be used in baking, and, according to the EWG database, it's listed as an ingredient in more than 200 products, including bread, buns, and bagels.",
      "Potassium bromate has been banned from food in many countries, including those of the European Union, Canada, India, and Peru. In 2023, California banned it from food effective in 2027. The United Kingdom prohibited it in 1990. The International Agency for Research on Cancer identified it as possibly carcinogenic more than 25 years ago. A joint committee of the United Nations and the World Health Organization identified it as a \"genotoxic carcinogen\" in 1992.",
      "On its website, the FDA says it has worked with industry to minimize potassium bromate levels and is reviewing the chemical, among others.",
      "The EWG says that it created the database to help consumers make healthier choices and that the raw data on product labels is supplied by Label Insight \u2014 which is owned by NielsenIQ, a major provider of data to industry. The EWG has called for tighter regulation of foods.",
      "Based on a review of FDA and European Commission databases, it appears that at least 950 more additives are used in foods in the United States than are allowed in the European Union, said Erik Millstone, an emeritus professor at the University of Sussex in England who has been studying food safety policy since the 1970s.",
      "Direct comparisons are difficult because the two regulatory systems and the way they keep their records differ greatly.",
      "A definitive count is elusive because the FDA doesn't require industry to inform it of everything used in foods in the United States.",
      "\"That kind of casual neglect totally would be unacceptable in Europe,\" Millstone said.",
      "\"Several decades behind Europeans\"",
      "When the FDA formally approves substances for use in food, it can let decades pass without reassessing them \u2014 even when subsequent research raises doubts about their safety.",
      "In January, when the FDA banned Red Dye No. 3 from foods, it cited research published in 1987. (The FDA said it had no evidence the dye puts people at risk; invoking one of the stricter consumer protections, it said a law from 1960 prohibits the use of additives found to induce cancer in animals.)",
      "In the European Union, substances used in foods must pass regulatory approval before being introduced. The EU has also required that its regulators reassess all additives that were on the market before Jan. 20, 2009, a process that is ongoing.",
      "\"In the FDA, although we have authorization to do post-market reviews, there's no statutory mandate to do them,\" Jones, the former deputy commissioner of the FDA's Human Foods Program, told a Senate committee in December. \"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized at some point in the past.\"",
      "The FDA website lists 19 post-market determinations since 2010 that substances were not \"generally recognized as safe.\" Four involve chemical constituents of one mushroom and the mushroom itself. Others include an anabolic steroid, caffeinated alcoholic beverages, cannabidiol (CBD), Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, and partially hydrogenated oils.",
      "Meanwhile, trichloroethylene, banned by the Environmental Protection Agency in December as \"an extremely toxic chemical known to cause liver cancer, kidney cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,\" is still allowed under FDA rules for use as a solvent in the production of foods.",
      "FDA spokesperson Enrico Dinges said the agency will work with new leadership at HHS \"to safeguard the food supply through pre-market and post-market safety evaluations of chemicals in the food supply.\"",
      "\"The loophole swallowed the law\"",
      "The biggest gap in the FDA's oversight of foods goes back generations.",
      "In 1958, Congress mandated that, before additives could be used in foods, manufacturers had to prove they were safe and get FDA approval. However, Congress carved out an exception for substances \"generally recognized as safe,\" which came to be known simply as GRAS.",
      "As conceived, GRAS promised regulatory relief for standard ingredients like salt, sugar, vinegar, and baking powder \u2014 along with many chemicals.",
      "Over time, \"the loophole swallowed the law,\" said a 2014 report by Neltner and Maricel Maffini for the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Companies can unilaterally decide their ingredients are already recognized as safe and use them without asking the FDA for permission or even informing the agency.",
      "A better translation of GRAS would be \"Generally Recognized as SECRET,\" the Natural Resources Defense Council report said.",
      "A federal watchdog reached a similar conclusion. \"GRAS substances can be marketed without FDA's approval or even its knowledge,\" the Government Accountability Office warned in 2010.",
      "That spared the FDA from spending time reviewing countless substances.",
      "For advice on whether ingredients are GRAS, companies may convene panels of specialists. The FDA has noted that panel members could be paid by the companies commissioning the review, but, in guidance to industry, it says \"such compensation is not itself an unacceptable conflict.\"",
      "About 3,000 flavoring ingredients have been deemed GRAS by a panel of scientists working for an industry group, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association of the United States, known as FEMA, said George Southworth, the organization's executive director.",
      "The scientists on the FEMA panel \"adhere to stringent conflict-of-interest policies,\" and their GRAS determinations are submitted to the FDA, which includes them in an online database, Southworth said.",
      "Southworth described the panel as independent, and the FEMA website says panel members have never been employees of companies in the food industry.",
      "Asked how many times FEMA's panel found that a flavoring didn't meet the test, Southworth wouldn't say. He indicated that some reviews are called off before a conclusion is reached.",
      "\"Publicly reporting these numbers without full context could lead to misinterpretations about the safety of substances,\" he added.",
      "Another way",
      "Food companies have another option: They can voluntarily notify the FDA that they believe their product is GRAS for its intended use and lay out their reasons \u2014 giving the FDA a heads up and essentially seeking its blessing.",
      "If they take that route, they don't have to wait for an answer from the FDA to begin marketing the product, the agency has said.",
      "And they don't risk much. If the FDA spots weaknesses in a company's argument or reasons to worry about a chemical's safety, it routinely calls off its review instead of declaring the substance unsafe.",
      "FDA records posted on the agency's website show that the FDA often coaches companies to ask the agency to cease its evaluation. That, too, leaves the company free to sell the product, food watchdogs said.",
      "For companies that voluntarily run their products past the FDA, victory is a letter saying the agency has no questions.",
      "But if companies market products as \"generally recognized as safe\" without firm grounds, they run the risk that the FDA could one day take enforcement action, such as issuing a warning or stopping sales. That's if the FDA notices.",
      "Psyched out",
      "On March 8, 2022, a Canadian company, Psyched Wellness, issued a news release saying it had a green light to market products in the United States.",
      "An \"independent review panel of scientific experts\" concluded that an extract the company developed, AME-1, was \"Generally Recognized As Safe,\" paving the way for it to be sold in bulk and used as an ingredient, the company said.",
      "The company described the panel's judgment as a successful \"certification\" and \"a key milestone.\" The extract was derived from a hallucinogenic mushroom, Amanita muscaria, which the company said \"has incredible healing and medicinal powers.\" As the company later put it in a news release, it had obtained \"self-Gras status.\"",
      "In June 2024, the company announced that it would soon release Amanita muscaria watermelon gummies.",
      "However, the FDA later took issue with the company and its product.",
      "In a memo dated Sept. 9, 2024, an FDA toxicologist said Psyched Wellness' claim of GRAS certification was false. The firm failed to show that its extract was generally recognized as safe, the FDA memo said.",
      "Speaking of the mushroom, its extracts, and its known \"pharmacologically active constituents,\" the FDA memo posted on the agency's website said they have \"potential for serious harm and adverse effects on the central nervous system.\"",
      "The FDA was focusing on the mushroom against the backdrop of a spate of medical problems linked to another company's \"Diamond Shruumz\" brand chocolate bars, gummies, and infused cones. When it recalled those products in June 2024, that other company announced that a chemical found in Amanita mushrooms was a possible cause of symptoms, including seizures and loss of consciousness.",
      "The FDA memo discussed that recall and said one death and 30 hospitalizations might have been related.",
      "The memo did not connect Psyched Wellness to the outbreak or the Diamond Shruumz products.",
      "The chief executive of Psyched Wellness, Jeffrey Stevens, did not respond to an interview request or written questions.",
      "As recently as Feb. 1, Psyched Wellness said in a securities filing that it will \"continue to market its products in the U.S. using the Self-GRAS designation.\"",
      "\"Probably poisoning us\"",
      "If food ingredients cause acute reactions \u2014 sending people to emergency rooms, for example \u2014 the potential dangers may be relatively easy to identify, and regulatory action might naturally follow. Some critics of the system say they worry more about health effects that could take years or decades to develop.",
      "Then, when it's too late, it could be hard to trace the harm to any particular ingredient.",
      "All that leaves Joseph Shea of Myrtle Beach in a tough spot.",
      "For a while, Shea tried shopping at a market that has a lot of organic offerings, he said in an interview. That proved too expensive.",
      "Shea said the entire picture is \"incredibly frustrating.\"",
      "\"They're probably poisoning us, and we don't know,\" he said. \"We'll figure it out 30 years down the road when we get sick.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Thursday he was moving to suspend the security clearances of attorneys at Perkins Coie, a law firm linked to Democratic-funded opposition research during the 2016 presidential campaign into any ties between Mr. Trump and Russia.",
      "The sanction against Perkins Coie is the latest in a series of moves by Mr. Trump and his administration to target a broad cross-section of perceived adversaries, including Justice Department prosecutors, career intelligence officials and, most recently, private-practice attorneys.",
      "\"This is an absolute honor to sign. What they've done is just terrible. It's weaponization \u2014 you could say weaponization against a political opponent, and it should never be allowed to happen again,\" Mr. Trump said as he prepared to sign the executive order in the Oval Office.",
      "The order directs the attorney general, the director of national intelligence and other relevant agency heads to \"take steps consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Perkins Coie, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.\" It does not specify how many lawyers at the law firm would be subject to losing their clearances.",
      "It also instructs agency heads to restrict access to government buildings by attorneys at the firm \"when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States\" and to identify, and cancel, contracts they have with the firm.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for the firm said, \"We have reviewed the Executive Order. It is patently unlawful, and we intend to challenge it.\"",
      "The punishment arises from the hiring by Perkins Coie of Fusion GPS, a research and intelligence firm, to conduct opposition research on then-candidate Trump's potential ties to Russia. The arrangement was brokered by Marc Elias, who at the time was a well-connected partner at Perkins Coie and top lawyer for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, but who has since left the firm and started his own practice.",
      "Fusion GPS in return retained former British spy Christopher Steele, whose dossier of research circulated among journalists and government officials in Washington during the campaign. The dossier, which was turned over to the FBI for its review, contended that Russia was engaged in a longstanding effort to aid Trump and had amassed compromising information about him.",
      "But the material has since been largely discredited as containing salacious and unverified rumors linking Trump to Russia, with special counsel John Durham's 2023 report on the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation saying that FBI investigators who tried to corroborate Steele's findings were unable to verify a \"single substantive allegation.\" Steele has stood by his work.",
      "The dossier created a political firestorm in January 2017, when it was revealed that then-FBI Director James Comey had briefed Trump before he took office on the existence of allegations from the research. The subsequent revelation that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee had helped fund the dossier added to questions about the legitimacy of Steele's research, which Trump as president repeatedly attacked as \"phony\" and inaccurate.",
      "Trump and his allies have long tried to use the dossier's flaws to undermine the entire investigation into connections between his 2016 campaign and Russia. But the investigation began weeks before the FBI agents who were working on it came into possession of dossier and was opened based on an entirely different tip \u2014 that a Trump campaign aide claimed to have knowledge that Russia had dirt on Hillary Clinton, Trump's opponent, well before Russia was known to have hacked Democratic emails.",
      "And though special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation did not conclude that Russia and the Trump campaign had criminally conspired to tip the election, it did identify a sweeping effort by the Kremlin to intervene on the Republican candidate's behalf, as well as evidence that the campaign welcomed the help.",
      "Since taking office, the Trump administration has fired Justice Department prosecutors who participated in special counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Trump. It also said it was stripping security clearances of lawyers who provided legal services for Smith and of dozens of former intelligence officials who signed onto a 2020 letter asserting that the Hunter Biden laptop saga bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign.",
      "The Perkins Coie executive order also alleges that the firm engages in what the Trump administration describes as unlawful diversity, equity and inclusion practices.",
      "That follows a directive from Attorney General Pam Bondi last month that calls on the Justice Department's civil rights division to \"investigate, eliminate and penalize illegal\" DEI \"preferences, mandates, policies, programs and activities in the private sector and in educational institutions that receive federal funds.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 22:00:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Retired Lt.-Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said he thinks Ukraine could \"move forward\" after signing a key minerals deal.",
    "story": [
      "Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, President Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, says Ukrainians brought the pause in U.S. intelligence sharing \"on themselves.\"",
      "It's \"sort of like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across the nose,\" Kellogg said of the impact of the intelligence pause on the battlefield. \"Got their attention.\"",
      "The intelligence the U.S. has been sharing has been critical in helping Ukraine strike Russian military targets, as well as anticipate and block Russian attacks.",
      "\"But it's a pause. It's not an end,\" Kellogg told CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan in an interview at the Council on Foreign Relations Thursday. \"But it's sort of of like, okay, we're trying to get your attention.\"",
      "\"That's a pretty major concession to Russia, to constrain Ukraine's ability to target and hit Russian forces,\" Brennan said, pointing out, \"this pressure really seems to be directly impacting, potentially, what they can do on the battlefield.\"",
      "\"Very candidly, they brought it on themselves,\" Kellogg responded, to hisses from the audience.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe acknowledged the intelligence sharing pause Wednesday, a move that followed the contentious White House visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last Friday. The meeting with President Trump was supposed to culminate in the signing of a rare earth minerals deal but instead ended in recrimination, as Zelenskyy sought to remind the president and Vice President JD Vance of the treaties Russian President Vladimir Putin has broken in the past, while Mr. Trump and Vance berated the Ukrainian leader in the Oval Office, accusing him of not saying \"thank you\" for U.S. military aid.",
      "Though Kellogg indicated that intelligence sharing could resume, he declined to say when. \"That's up to the president of the United States,\" he told Brennan.",
      "Kellogg also said the Trump administration would be willing to work with Zelenskyy once the minerals agreement is finalized.",
      "\"Sign a document, and then once you sign the document that you want to go forward, that you're serious about it, then I think you can move forward,\" said Kellogg. \"When I was in Kyiv two weeks ago, I was very clear to President Zelenskyy \u2014 the outcome if we didn't have a signed agreement.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is now likely to be the administration official who signs the deal with Ukraine. And next week, on Tuesday or Wednesday, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff expects to meet with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, he told reporters Thursday.",
      "Witkoff met with Putin for about three and a half hours last month in Russia and returned to the U.S. with \"an indication of where the Russians are\" on peace negotiations, Kellogg said.",
      "\"We want to do the same thing with the Ukrainians, as well,\" Kellogg told Brennan.",
      "Notably, Kellogg denied an earlier statement by Witkoff that the Istanbul protocol, drafted shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, could serve as the basis for a peace deal framework between Ukraine and Russia.",
      "The right-leaning Institute for the Study of War describes the Istanbul protocol as \"entirely incompatible with the current stated U.S. policy\" and argues it \"cannot be the basis or guidepost for negotiations that amount to anything other than capitulation to Russia's pre-war demands.\"",
      "The institute noted that a draft of that agreement would have had Ukraine surrender its sovereignty and would have prevented it from maintaining armed forces sufficient to deter a Russian attack.",
      "\"Steve said it's a departure point. I think that's a good word to use,\" said Kellogg. \"I don't believe for all of us that that is an equitable framework. And I think we have to develop something entirely new,\" he continued.",
      "\"I think Steve made a comment as a general comment, and it is not the Trump administration policy\u00a0 because they haven't made their policy,\" he added.",
      "At this point, Kellogg estimates that the Ukrainians should have enough military aid to continue fighting through the summer.",
      "\"They have an ability with the assets they've got to continue to prosecute the fight, to do it,\" said Kellogg.",
      "Kellogg would not confirm that as part of a peace agreement the U.S. would backstop any European peacekeeping forces by providing security guarantees to Ukraine.",
      "\"That's part of the discussion we're having with the Europeans as well \u2014 when you talk what does [a] backstop look like,\" said Kellogg.",
      "\"What does that look like on the economic side, what do sanctions look like, what do frozen assets, whatever it's going to be? And then we also look at the military side as well,\" he said.",
      "Beyond bringing the conflict to a close, Kellogg also said president seeks a \"reset\" of U.S. relations with Russia.",
      "\"The need to reset relations with Russia to secure Americans' vital national interest, and ultimately, to stop U.S. entanglement in an endless proxy war, are the driving reasons why President Trump's approach and the framing of this war is distinct from the broader, conventional approach that we see publicly to the war,\" said Kellogg.",
      "He acknowledged, however, that existing sanctions against Russia need to be enforced more aggressively to be more effective.",
      "If you ranked U.S. sanctions against Russia on a scale of 1 to 7, he said, \"the problem is with enforcement, we're probably at a 3.\"",
      "\"I think the most important thing is the enforcement of sanctions \u2014 not necessarily the sanctions themselves,\" he added.",

    "summary": "As Russia bombs Ukraine and Trump pushes Zelenskyy for a \"better deal,\" what will it take to end the war Vladimir Putin started?",
    "story": [
      "The CIA chief confirmed Wednesday that the Trump administration had paused not only the flow of military hardware and financial support to Ukraine, but also vital intelligence gathering that has helped Kyiv anticipate and block incoming missile and drone attacks and effectively target Russia's invading forces. The U.S. military's European Command has also said shipments of arms that were already on their way \u2014 approved by the Biden administration but not yet delivered \u2014 have been paused.",
      "The pause is part of President Trump's abrupt shift in policy on Ukraine, which has seen the White House adopt rhetoric closely aligned with Russia's narrative justifying the three-year war on its smaller neighbor, and Mr. Trump's bid to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept a ceasefire deal that could involve significant concessions by Kyiv.",
      "Speaking Thursday at a Council on Foreign Relations event in Washington moderated by CBS News' Margaret Brennan, Mr. Trump's special envoy to Russia and Ukraine Keith Kellogg defended the intelligence cutoff as a necessary wake up call to Kyiv of the White House's determination to forge a peace deal.",
      "\"The best way I can describe it is like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across their noses \u2014 we got their attention,\" he said. \"But it's a pause, it's not an end. It's then up to them.\"",
      "Kellogg did not play down the severity of the measure, but said it would not have taken Kyiv by surprise, as \"they were warned this was coming. I told them.\"",
      "\"If you take away support like that, of course it's important,\" said Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general in the U.S. Army, adding: \"But that's why it was done.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have said Vladimir Putin will also have to make concessions to bring about a ceasefire, but those have not been outlined by the White House to date. To even engage in real negotiations on a potential ceasefire agreement, Mr. Trump has made it clear that he wants Zelenskyy to first give the U.S. access to a major share of Ukraine's mineral resources.",
      "Why Ukraine says security guarantees are essential",
      "Zelenskyy's reluctance to sign an economic deal thus far, without clear guarantees that it would come with a commitment from the U.S. to help defend Ukraine from further Russian attack, appeared to enrage Mr. Trump during their\u00a0chaotic Oval Office meeting on Friday. The White House has repeatedly suggested that American business investment in Ukraine, with U.S. workers on the ground, would, by default, shield the country from Russian aggression, and Mr. Trump has said himself that he trusts Russia to keep any promises it makes.",
      "Ukraine and America's European allies do not trust Putin's Russia. They note that as the Biden administration warned of Russia's looming invasion at the beginning of 2022, top officials in Moscow insisted repeatedly that they had no such intentions.",
      "\"I am certain that there is no risk of a large-scale war. \u2026 We do not intend to take any aggressive actions. We will not attack, raid or invade Ukraine,\" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said about a month before Putin ordered the full-scale invasion, sparking the bloodiest conflict on European soil since World War II.",
      "Given that recent history, Ukraine's former Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze told CBS News on Wednesday that any talk of a ceasefire with Russia now, without clear security guarantees from the West, would only give Putin time to regroup and rearm his strained military, and then to reinvade.",
      "Could a Ukrainian \"goodwill gesture\" get Trump on board?",
      "\"We are interested in peace, but we are definitely interested in something that would be guaranteed as a peace, and that would not be used by the Russian Federation as a pause to remobilize and to attack with a tsunami wave over Ukraine and also over European countries,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze told CBS News in Kyiv on Wednesday.",
      "After Zelenskyy's dressing-down at the White House, Ukrainian officials \u2014 including Zelenskyy himself \u2014 made it clear they were\u00a0still willing to sign an economic agreement with the U.S.",
      "\"I think the only thing that that deal is potentially going to give us is a discussion on another deal,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze said, suggesting the economic agreement could serve as a framework, \"and the possibility to engage the United States. \u2026 It's a goodwill gesture with hope that it would translate into the U.S. standing with good against the evil.\"",
      "Russia, Europeans stress, has shown no willingness so far to bend on any of its maximalist demands that Ukraine cede the roughly 20% of its territory currently occupied by Putin's forces. The Kremlin has repeatedly ruled out agreeing to any European peacekeeping forces helping maintain a truce.",
      "Russia's attacks on Ukraine continue",
      "Far from any signs of d\u00e9tente, Russian missiles, bombs and explosive drones have continued falling on Ukraine.",
      "Overnight, the attacks intensified. The eastern city of Krivy Rih, President Zelenskyy's hometown, was targeted by a Russian ballistic missile. In a post on social media,\u00a0Zelenskyy said among the damaged buildings was a hotel full of aid workers, including some U.S. and British volunteers. At least 30 people were injured in the attack and four killed, Zelenskyy said, adding that none of those killed were from the U.S. or U.K.",
      "\"Unfortunately, I do not see the readiness of the Russian Federation to really engage,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze said, noting that \"every single night\" Ukraine has faced Russian bombardment. \"That is not something that is showing goodwill of terminating these attacks.\"",
      "What Ukraine wants, what Russia wants",
      "Klympush-Tsintsadze said she hoped an agreement with the Trump administration on minerals \"would give us the possibility, hopefully, to come to a real peace settlement,\" but she cautioned that \"a peace settlement that would not have security provisions on the side of our partners would barely hold with the Russian Federation.\"",
      "\"We've been there before,\" she said, stressing that when Russia first attacked her country 11 years ago, sending in forces to seize the Crimean Peninsula while denying their presence, Moscow claimed it was because \"NATO is expanding,\" but she said at the time Ukraine was \"a totally neutral and non-aligned, non-block country.\"",
      "\"And then all the other lies that the Russian Federation has been coming up with against the Ukrainian people, just because they don't want us to exist. They just want to exterminate us as a nation and as a country, and that's their goal. So, in order for us to reach peace, we would have to see the way to that peace settlement \u2014 which definitely comes through a ceasefire, but not necessarily ends with a ceasefire.\"",
      "Moscow has defended its aggression against Ukraine for more than a decade as a justified reaction to the U.S.-led NATO alliance's territory inching toward Russia's western border. That expansion began in the wake of the communist Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, with former Soviet bloc republics choosing to join the Western alliance to ensure their own security.",
      "Ukraine has expressed interest in joining the NATO alliance for over 20 years, and it has cooperated with NATO as a neutral partner for about that long, but it was not given a clear\u00a0path to membership \u2014 largely due to many members worrying it would be seen as a provocation by Russia \u2014 until after Putin launched his full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "In 2023, with the war well underway, then-President Biden said he didn't believe Ukraine was \"ready for membership in NATO,\" adding that he didn't see unanimity among the alliance's members \"about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war.\"",
      "President Trump's administration has\u00a0ruled out Ukraine joining the alliance and launched unilateral negotiations with Russia. That direct Washington-Moscow dialogue and the lack of any clear demands by Mr. Trump for concessions from Putin have stoked fears in Kyiv and Western European capitals about the White House's commitment to both the NATO alliance and to securing a ceasefire in Ukraine that looks like anything other than humiliation and capitulation for pro-Western Zelenskyy.",
      "Russia insists it wants to end the war it started in Ukraine, and Mr. Trump has said he believes Moscow on that point. Speaking Thursday to reporters in Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov doubled down on the Russian narrative, pushed since Mr. Trump engaged in talks with Putin, that Europe, to a greater degree than Washington, is to blame for the conflict's enduring nature.",
      "Peskov said that while the U.S. under Mr. Trump \"is not a friendly country to us at the moment, the United States is a country with which we are now trying to revive and restore our bilateral relations.\"",
      "That is not the case, he made clear, of America's NATO allies in Europe.",
      "Ukraine seeks Europe's support, but hopes the \"United States will stand for democracy\"",
      "Peskov cited remarks by President Emmanuel Macron of France, who called Wednesday for Europe to boost its collective military capabilities and assume more responsibility for the continent's defense \u2014 as President Trump has demanded \u2014 as evidence that \"France is really looking for a continuation of the war.\" He said Macron had suggested that \"France is ready to use its nuclear weapons for security purposes and so on,\" claiming the French leader had issued \"a claim to nuclear leadership in Europe, that is, it is very, very confrontational.\"",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday called Macron's remarks \"a threat to Russia,\" while dismissing European suggestions that it is in fact Russia which poses a threat to security on the continent, calling that \"stupid\" and \"delirious nonsense.\"",
      "Macron did reference atomic weapons in his Wednesday night address, saying France's \"deterrent capabilities\" had helped to protect the country \"much more than many of our neighbors\" who do not possess such weapons. He did not mention plans to bolster France's nuclear deterrent specifically, but said that as the Trump administration signals less willingness to come to its European allies' defense, he would consider requests from nations such as Germany to extend \"the protection of our allies on the European continent by our deterrent.\"",
      "As Europe grapples over how to ensure its own defense from future Russian or other threats, Ukrainians will be hoping the continent's leaders move quickly to boost their own defenses against Russia's current, ongoing assault.",
      "France was quick to confirm it would continue sharing its intelligence with Ukraine after the U.S. cutoff, with Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu saying: \"Our intelligence is sovereign. We have intelligence that we allow Ukraine to benefit from.\"",
      "\"We are hoping that all the great... warm political will of the European nations will also, as urgently as possible, will translate in upscaling their defense engagement with Ukraine,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze told CBS News. \"They've given a lot. They have much more limited capacities than the United States, but we hope that they will be able to invest in Ukrainian defense capacities, that they will be able to upscale their defense production, that they will help us also to procure weaponry in order for us to stay strong while Russia has not given up on their plans to just destroy us.\"",
      "She made it clear that Ukraine would also continue working toward an agreement with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"We are to try to get the message across to the American public. I think that this is also very important, and I'm sure that President Trump really cares about the support that he enjoys back in the United States, and I hope that he hears also his citizens [saying] why this is important, and why it is expected that the United States will stand for democracy, will stand for freedoms.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump on Thursday said he is pausing 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday said he will pause 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada that are covered under a 2020 trade agreement, delaying levies\u00a0imposed on the nations\u00a0earlier this week.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the delay in the Mexico tariffs in a social media post after a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. On Thursday afternoon, he signed two executive orders stating the exemptions would apply to U.S. imports of products from both Mexico and Canada that are covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Goods that are not covered by the agreement remain subject to tariffs.",
      "\"After speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement,\" Mr. Trump wrote, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. He characterized the move \"as an accommodation\" for the Mexican leader.",
      "\"Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl. Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "When asked if any concessions had been offered by Canada or Mexico to lead to the pause, a White House official told CBS News that during leader-to-leader discussions, Mexico brought up progress it had made cracking down on cartels and drugs, including cocaine.",
      "The USMCA agreement covers the vast majority of imports from Mexico. In a press conference Thursday, Sheinbaum said that nearly all of Mexico's trade with the U.S. is covered under the trade pact which is in effect until April 2.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. imported more than $45 billion worth of agricultural products from Mexico. Almost three-quarters of such imports consisted of vegetables, fruit, beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Canadian energy, which is not included in the USMCA, is expected to be tariffed at 10%, which could boost gas prices and heating and electricity costs in the U.S. Potash that U.S. farmers import from Canada would be tariffed at the same rate.",
      "According to a White House official, in 2024, 38% of all imports from Canada were covered by the USMCA and therefore exempt from tariffs, while 49.6% of all imports from Mexico were covered under the agreement.",
      "International trade expert Barry Appleton, a senior fellow at the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that \"a massive amount of goods\" fall under the brief exemption from tariffs on imports from Canada. They include auto parts, steel and aluminum, beef and other products.",
      "Despite the brief reprieve. uncertainty around the tariffs have \"broken complex supply chains that will never be fixed,\" Appleton said.",
      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, underlined the importance of cooperation on trade.",
      "\"Though today's delay mitigates some of economic damage U.S. tariffs will cause, this is not a moment to celebrate. The economy is not a toy to play with. Constant threats and economic uncertainty have taken their toll. We see it in delayed business investments, shaky consumer confidence, stalled capital flows and a volatile stock market. People's livelihoods are at stake,\" he said in a statement provided to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The only outcome that makes sense for both economies is for all tariffs to be taken off the table, without exception,\" Holmes added.",
      "Economists have warned that tariffs are likely to lead to price increases on an array of goods, from vegetables and fruit to automobiles. Levies on materials from Canada and Mexico used in car production won't go into effect immediately after Mr. Trump also issued one-month exemption from tariffs for automakers Wednesday, following conversations with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram.",
      "Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs before, and business leaders say uncertainty around which policies will actually take effect has created confusion for businesses and consumers.",
      "Some of the most prominent retail executives in the U.S. have spoken out about the tariffs, saying they'd almost certainly lead to increased costs, some of which will be passed along to American consumers.",

    "summary": "\"They told me to do these actions, to make these payments, and then they fired me,\" said Mary Comans, who was FEMA's chief financial officer.",
    "story": [
      "A former government official who says she was falsely accused of illegally sending funds to New York City to book luxury hotels for undocumented migrants \u2014 and then publicly ridiculed and fired \u2014 said Thursday that just days earlier she had been directed by a member of the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, to make the payments.",
      "Mary Comans, who was the chief financial officer at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, sued the agency and the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, on Tuesday.",
      "\"I was fired illegally by the Trump administration for doing my job, for doing exactly what I was directed to do by the Trump political appointees at the Department of Homeland Security and at the DOGE,\" she told CBS News in an interview Thursday. \"They told me to do these actions, to make these payments, and then they fired me.\"",
      "A DHS spokesperson did not respond for comment, nor did Brad Smith, the DOGE official Comans says she interacted with.",
      "The lawsuit argues she was \"unlawfully terminated\" from her position \"without cause or the due process required by law and the Constitution.\" As chief financial officer, Comans was a member of the \"senior executive service,\" the highest-level civil servant.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that DHS and FEMA publicly disclosed information about her",
      "termination that was protected under the Privacy Act and that she was defamed by the false portrayal about her conduct. At the time of her dismissal, Comans says the agency suggested falsely in a press release that she was a \"deep state activist.\"",
      "Comans joined DHS in 2004, inspired to serve in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. She called herself \"apolitical,\" noting that she served both Republican and Democratic administrations, often deploying to the scenes of natural disasters to help manage the federal government's response.",
      "\"My job is to serve the administration that was elected by the American people,\" she said.",
      "She had served as FEMA's chief financial officer since 2017 before she was abruptly fired on Feb. 11.",
      "During President Trump's first days back in office, Comans said the executive leadership team at FEMA was fielding executive orders as quickly as the president could sign them and \"were implementing them to the letter that he expected.\"",
      "One of the orders Comans carried out required DHS, and by extension FEMA, to freeze money going to nongovernmental organizations that provide services to undocumented immigrants. Payments that continued came from a $650 million Customs and Border Protection program created by Congress to reimburse cities for housing and sheltering migrants that had entered into the country illegally and were awaiting court proceedings. FEMA administered payments issued by the immigration program, but those funds were separate from the billions of dollars the agency spends on disaster relief.",
      "On Feb. 5, Comans says she and her team met with Smith, one of Elon Musk's top lieutenants, who was overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency's work at DHS. According to Comans, Smith instructed them to keep the funds from the CBP program flowing.",
      "Comans said it was \"very clear\" from the conversation with Smith \"that FEMA was doing the right thing in continuing\" the payments.",
      "\"We also received written guidance from the acting general counsel at FEMA that payments to state and locals needed to continue under the normal course of business,\" she said.",
      "Despite those assurances from Smith, on Feb. 10, Musk posted on X that DOGE \"just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants. Sending this money violated the law and is in gross insubordination to the President's executive order.\"",
      "Later that day, when she arrived at work, Comans says she met with her boss, acting FEMA Administrator Cameron Hamilton. She says Hamilton was also surprised by Musk's tweet and told her she had done nothing wrong. Comans then drafted a report, which CBS News reviewed, that documented her conversations with DOGE.",
      "\"I told him I was going to put together an after-action report detailing each of the conversations, the dates, the actions that FEMA took to show that we were operating within the guidelines provided to use by the Trump administration,\" Comans said. \"He thanked me, hugged me and again reassured me that nobody at FEMA would be fired for making these payments.\"",
      "Comans said she had another conversation with Hamilton that night to tell him that the funds had been recouped.",
      "\"I shared with him that I had successfully reversed the payment and the funds were being returned to Treasury as we speak,\" she said.",
      "The next morning, on Feb. 11, Comans says a colleague walked into Coman's office to tell her that she had been terminated effective immediately.",
      "\"Unfortunately, my colleague had no answers to provide me,\" Comans said.",
      "Her name went viral later that morning after conservative broadcaster Benny Johnson posted on X that Comans was \"fired for illegally funding migrant luxury hotels in NYC against the orders of President Trump.\" The post was spread by other rightwing accounts.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security sent out its press release about the firings shortly after that.",
      "\"Effective immediately, FEMA is terminating the employment of four individuals for circumventing leadership to unilaterally make egregious payments for luxury NYC hotels for migrants. Firings include FEMA's Chief Financial Officer, two program analysts and a grant specialist,\" the release said. \"Under President Trump and Secretary Noem's leadership, DHS will not sit idly and allow deep state activists to undermine the will and safety of the American people.\"",
      "Musk also shared a post about Comans, writing that her behavior was \"criminal.\"",
      "Comans said she feels betrayed by the department and agency because \"they have allowed Mr. Musk and others to slander my name, to defame me.\"",
      "\"The department has sat by idly and in some ways they have joined that choir of saying untrue statements about me,\" she said.",
      "Comans wants her name cleared and to be compensated for the damage she says has been caused. She would also take her job back if given the opportunity.",
      "\"I don't know that you can put a price on it,\" she said. \"To me, the No. 1 goal is clearing my name.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump removed Gwynne Wilcox from her position on the National Labor Relations Board soon after taking office.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Washington ruled Thursday that President Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board was unlawful and said she must be allowed to continue in her role.",
      "In a 36-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, who sits on the U.S. District Court in Washington, said that the Constitution and past decisions make clear that Congress can limit the president's removal power. She ruled that the president's firing of Gwynne Wilcox from the NLRB violated federal law that allows for a board member to be removed only for \"neglect of duty or malfeasance in office,\" and declared her termination void.",
      "\"Under our constitutional system, such checks, by design, guard against executive overreach and the risk such overreach would pose of autocracy,\" Howell wrote in a 36-page decision. \"An American president is not a king \u2014 not even an 'elected' one \u2014 and his power to remove federal officers and honest civil servants like plaintiff is not absolute, but may be constrained in appropriate circumstances, as are present here.\"",
      "Howell, appointed by former President Barack Obama, wrote that Mr. Trump \"seems intent on pushing the bounds of his office and exercising his power in a manner violative of clear statutory law to test how much the courts will accept the notion of a presidency that is supreme.\"",
      "Wilcox was nominated to the NLRB by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in September 2023. She was designated chair of the board in December 2024.",
      "But soon after returning to a second term in the White House, Mr. Trump replaced Wilcox as chair and fired her from her position on the board in late January. While the National Labor Relations Act requires the president to remove a member \"upon notice and hearing, for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office,\" the email sent to Wilcox on behalf of the president stated that she and another board member have not \"been operating in a manner consistent with the objectives of my administration.\"",
      "Wilcox told CBS News last month that she was \"stunned\" when she received a letter from the White House firing her.",
      "\"I handled cases where workers were fired and retaliated against for their conduct, but I never imagined that I would be the person being fired for doing my job,\" Wilcox, 71, said. She swiftly challenged her firing in federal court.",
      "In her decision, the judge noted that in the 90 years since the NLRB was founded, the president has never removed a member of its board.",
      "\"His attempt to do so here is blatantly illegal, and his constitutional arguments to excuse this illegal act are contrary to Supreme Court precedent and over a century of practice,\" she said.",
      "The court found that a Supreme Court decision from 1935 binds the outcome of Wilcox's case. That case carved out an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers. The Supreme Court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections for multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "\"The 150-year history and tradition of multimember boards or commissions and 90-year precedent from the Supreme Court approving of removal protections for their officers dictates the same outcome for the NLRB here,\" Howell wrote.",
      "She added that \"nothing in the Constitution or the historical development of the removal power has suggested the president's removal power is absolute.\"",
      "\"The president does not have the authority to terminate members of the National Labor Relations Board at will, and his attempt to fire plaintiff from her position on the Board was a blatant violation of the law,\" the judge found.",
      "Howell criticized Mr. Trump for portraying himself as a king \u2014 pointing to a social media post from the White House last month that featured an illustration of the president wearing a crown, along with the headline \"long live the king\" \u2014 and said that he misunderstands the role of Article II of the Constitution, which lays out the scope of the president's powers.",
      "\"At issue in this case, is the president's insistence that he has authority to fire whomever he wants within the Executive branch, overriding any congressionally mandated law in his way,\" she wrote. \"Luckily, the Framers, anticipating such a power grab, vested in Article III, not Article II, the power to interpret the law, including resolving conflicts about congressional checks on presidential authority. The president's interpretation of the scope of his constitutional power \u2014 or, more aptly, his aspiration \u2014 is flat wrong.\"",
      "The decision from Howell sets the case on a path to the Supreme Court and could lead it to overturn the 1935 decision in the case known as Humphrey's Executor v. United States. Sarah Harris, the acting solicitor general, wrote in a letter to Congress last month that the Trump administration believes that certain for-cause removal restrictions for multi-member commissions are unconstitutional and would urge the Supreme Court to overturn its precedent.",
      "The high court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in recent years chipped away at that 90-year-old ruling and reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at will. Most notably in 2020, the\u00a0Supreme Court ruled\u00a0that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's structure of a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance was unconstitutional.",
      "Two justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, have already indicated that they believe the Supreme Court should reverse Humphrey's Executor.",
      "\"The decision in Humphrey's Executor poses a direct threat to our constitutional structure and, as a result, the liberty of the American people,\" Thomas wrote in a\u00a0concurring opinion\u00a0to its 2020 decision on the CFPB, which was joined by Gorsuch.",
      "Thomas, the longest-serving member of the court, said that in a future case, he \"would repudiate what is left of this erroneous precedent.\"",

    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. warned vaccines could turn \"birds into mutant factories.\"",
    "story": [
      "Federal health agencies oppose the use of bird flu vaccines in poultry right now, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said, weighing in publicly on it for the first time in his new role. The Trump administration has been considering poultry vaccination as it seeks to combat the outbreak that is fueling a record surge in egg prices.",
      "U.S. Department of Agriculture officials said last month that they were ramping up planning on potentially deploying a vaccine for poultry, with the hopes of putting a draft of the plan before trading partners \"as quickly as possible,\" since it could affect billions of dollars in exports.",
      "\"There's no indication that those vaccines actually provide sterilizing immunity and all three of my health agencies, NIH, CDC, and FDA, the acting heads of those agencies have all recommended against the use of the bird flu vaccine,\" Kennedy said in an interview on Fox News published this week.",
      "Sterilizing immunity means vaccine protection that completely stops infections and spread. Vaccines are rarely able to offer this kind of effectiveness, though the USDA said last month it would step up investments in \"potential new generation vaccines\" with better protection.",
      "Kennedy's remarks mark a sharp turn from the Biden administration, multiple former officials said.",
      "Biden officials from the health and agriculture departments had wrestled extensively with calls to roll out vaccines for animals as outbreaks mounted on farms nationwide. It was concerns from agriculture officials, not human health officials, that ultimately blocked plans to roll out vaccines.",
      "\"At no point did they express a concern or anything other than robust support for an animal vaccination program,\" one former USDA official said of the health agencies.",
      "At the time, Biden-era health officials viewed the ultimate decision as one outside of their expertise and better left to agriculture department experts, two people familiar with the planning said.",
      "Would vaccinating poultry turn birds into \"mutant factories\"?",
      "Kennedy said the new opposition from his health agencies was based on concerns that vaccinating poultry without being able to provide sterilizing immunity would amount to \"turning those birds into mutant factories,\" resulting in worrying genetic changes to the virus.",
      "\"That could actually accelerate the jump to human beings,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Experts say vaccination would need to be managed with strict biosecurity measures \u2014 extra precautions to prevent vaccinated birds from becoming infected \u2014 to reduce the risk of genetic changes in the virus.",
      "\"Creating conditions where the virus can freely mutate increases the likelihood of a strain emerging that can infect humans,\" said Daniel Perez, chair in poultry medicine at the University of Georgia, in an email.",
      "Perez said the risk is higher in large-scale poultry operations, where birds can have weaker immune systems.",
      "But he added that he sees vaccination as a strategic option to curb outbreaks for egg-laying chickens and backyard poultry, alongside other measures like intensive surveillance to detect outbreaks and continued culling of infected flocks of chickens raised for meat.",
      "\"Vaccination can be a useful tool when combined with strict biosecurity. If birds are kept from exposure to the virus, then vaccination can help to contain outbreaks,\" said Perez.",
      "Instead, Perez warned that another idea floated by Trump administration officials could pose a far greater risk: relying on immunity from poultry surviving bird flu infections.",
      "\"We've in fact said, at the USDA, that they should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds and preserve the birds that are immune to it,\" Kennedy had said.",
      "Perez said this approach would make surviving birds breeding grounds for worrying mutations.",
      "\"This implies a potentially dangerous misunderstanding of how avian influenza works. Allowing highly pathogenic avian influenza to spread through a poultry flock is extremely risky and counterproductive,\" he said.",
      "The Biden administration opted against vaccinating poultry for different reasons, former officials said.",
      "Agriculture officials had worried it could lead to missed spread of the virus through asymptomatic birds, trigger bans on imports of U.S. poultry products and be logistically challenging to thoroughly administer to massive commercial flocks.",
      "Kennedy's comments come days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released an updated assessment of the virus, finding that the risk remains \"low\" to the general population but higher for people like farm workers or veterinarians who might be exposed to infected animals or contaminated surfaces.",
      "Most confirmed bird flu cases in humans to date have been largely mild, except for a handful of hospitalizations and one death.",
      "The CDC stressed that its assessment of the risk, while low at this time, \"could change, as influenza A viruses can mutate quickly, and therefore have the potential to cause pandemics.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House voted Thursday morning to censure Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas for disrupting President Trump during his address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday.",
      "In a 224 to 198 vote, the House approved a censure resolution against Green, with 10 Democrats joining all Republicans in favor of the move. Two members, including Green, voted present.",
      "Green is the 28th lawmaker in U.S. history to be censured by the House. After the vote, he was ordered to stand in the well of the chamber while the resolution, which called his behavior \"a breach of proper conduct,\" was read aloud.",
      "Minutes into Mr. Trump's speech on Tuesday, Green stood and raised his cane in the president's direction and shouted. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, warned Green to take his seat and \"maintain decorum,\" but Green refused. Johnson then directed the sergeant at arms to \"restore order\" and \"remove this gentleman from the chamber.\"",
      "What does it mean to censure a congressman?",
      "Censure is essentially a formal rebuke by the House for some form of misconduct. The punishment usually requires the censured member to stand in front of the dais in the House chamber while the resolution is read by the presiding member \u2014 Johnson, in Green's case. It does not remove the member from office or impose any other penalties, beyond the reputational damage and historical notoriety that accompanies it.",
      "The practice was relatively rare throughout history, but it has become more frequent in recent years. Three other Democrats \u2014\u00a0Adam Schiff\u00a0of California,\u00a0Rashida Tlaib\u00a0of Michigan and\u00a0Jamaal Bowman\u00a0of New York \u2014 were censured in 2023. Republican Rep. Paul Gosar faced the punishment in 2021.",
      "It was most common during the Civil War and Reconstruction, when 13 members were censured for offenses ranging from assault in the Capitol to insulting another member.",
      "Republican Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington, who introduced the resolution to censure Green, said the move was not personal and called it a \"difficult step.\"",
      "\"We cannot ignore the willful disruption intended to stop a proceeding,\" Newhouse, who is one of two remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Mr. Trump over the Capitol riot, said Wednesday. \"Without decorum, without respect, what do we got? What do we have, truly?\"",
      "Newhouse said Green's behavior reflects on all members of Congress and the moment serves as a reminder \"that we all need to raise our level of accountability.\"",
      "\"This is truly a wakeup call for this chamber,\" he said. \"The lack of decorum has reached a new low. When the president of the United States cannot even come into our chamber invited and complete his speech without the interaction that we saw last night, we have to take this action of censure.\"",
      "Before Green spoke during floor debate on the resolution Wednesday, he walked over to Newhouse and shook his hand. Green said he did not hold any ill will toward Johnson, the officers who escorted him out of the president's speech or those who supported his censure.",
      "\"The president indicated that he had a mandate. I said to the president, 'You do not have a mandate to cut Medicaid.' I have constituents who need Medicaid. They will suffer and some will die if they don't get Medicaid,\" Green said of why he heckled Mr. Trump. \"I would do it again.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts said Republicans have shown \"selective outrage\" in their condemnation of certain behavior.",
      "\"I can't believe we're having this debate,\" McGovern said Wednesday.",
      "The conservative House Freedom Caucus, however, thought that the censure did not go far enough and is seeking to remove Green from his committee assignment. The group said it will introduce a resolution to strip him of his seat on the House Financial Services Committee, and expects Johnson to bring it up for a vote next week.",
      "\"Green was censured in a bipartisan vote but he needs real consequences to demonstrate that no one gets to disrupt the People's business in lame attempts to derail President Trump's agenda,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the caucus.",

      "House Republicans adopted a budget proposal last week that serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda. The resolution must be adopted by the Senate before the chambers can move forward with the budget reconciliation process, a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But opponents of the resolution have warned that the proposed cuts implicate key programs that Americans rely on, concerns that the CBO analysis backed up.",
      "Republicans want to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending over a 10-year period to pay for trillions in tax cuts, while increasing funding in some areas. The budget resolution directs congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview.",
      "The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, is tasked with finding at least $880 billion in cuts over the next decade. A pair of House Democrats asked the CBO for the projected mandatory spending on programs under the committee's jurisdiction, excluding Medicare, which offers health coverage for seniors. Medicaid provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans, with costs split between the federal government and the states.",
      "CBO found that Medicaid accounts for 93% of all remaining non-Medicare mandatory spending, with $581 billion going to other programs. That means the committee couldn't meet its $880 billion target without touching the program. GOP leaders have not proposed cutting Medicare, leaving Medicaid as the source of potential cuts.",
      "House Republican leaders have stressed that Medicaid isn't specifically mentioned in the budget resolution and said benefits would not be cut, noting that last week's vote was merely to begin the reconciliation process. But Republicans have said they plan to remove \"fraud, waste and abuse\" within the program, and many members support work requirements that could limit eligibility for benefits. Other GOP lawmakers have expressed concerns about making cuts to the program, since many of their constituents and voters rely on coverage.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Thursday that the CBO findings \"confirmed what we have long understood to be the case with the reckless Republican budget.\"",
      "\"Republicans are trying to rip healthcare away from tens of millions of Americans,\" the New York Democrat said, pledging that \"every single Democrat\" will stand against the House plan.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Rhode Island barred the Trump administration from freezing federal assistance, extending the block he put in place weeks ago in a case brought by a group of 23 states and the District of Columbia while the case moves forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge John McConnell issued a preliminary injunction Thursday that prohibits agencies from halting the flow of federal funds awarded to the states through grants, contracts or other financial assistance based on a memo from the Office of Management and Budget issued during President Trump's first days in office.",
      "\"The executive's categorical freeze of appropriated and obligated funds fundamentally undermines the distinct constitutional roles of each branch of our government,\" McConnell, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, wrote. \"The interaction of the three co-equal branches of government is an intricate, delicate, and sophisticated balance \u2014 but it is crucial to our form of constitutional governance. Here, the executive put itself above Congress.\"",
      "The judge said that the OMB order freezing federal funds across the government was \"without regard to Congress's authority to control spending,\" and found that the Trump administration failed to point to any statutory or constitutional authority to impose the government-wide pause.",
      "\"The court is not limiting the executive's discretion or micromanaging the administration of federal funds,\" McConnell wrote. \"Rather, consistent with the Constitution, statutes, and caselaw, the court is simply holding that the executive's discretion to impose its own policy preferences on appropriated funds can be exercised only if it is authorized by the congressionally approved appropriations statutes.\"",
      "He said that the freeze has impacted an array of programs, including Head Start and other childcare initiatives, as well as law enforcement and public safety agencies that rely on the federal dollars.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is part of the coalition of states challenging the freeze, cheered the decision and reiterated that the power of the purse rests with Congress.",
      "\"The Trump administration's illegal funding freeze jeopardized law enforcement funding, essential health care and childcare services, and other critical programs that millions of Americans rely on,\" James said in a statement.",
      "McConnell had issued a temporary order at the end of January that ordered OMB to keep federal assistance flowing. His decision, as well as a February order finding that the Trump administration failed to comply with that directive, has made him a target of Mr. Trump's supporters. He is one of several federal judges who have ruled against the Trump administration at the early stages of cases and faced threats of impeachment by congressional Republicans.",
      "The case before McConnell was brought by the group of states and the District of Columbia in response to the OMB memo issued in late January that called for federal agencies to temporarily pause grants, loans and other federal assistance programs that were implicated by Mr. Trump's executive orders.",
      "The memo targeted roughly $3 trillion in federal assistance programs.",
      "Shortly after it was issued, OMB walked back the memo amid widespread chaos and confusion over what funds were at risk, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said only the memo was rescinded, and the freeze itself would remain in force.",
      "The states brought their challenge to the OMB funding freeze in late January and argued that the directive violated federal law and the separation of powers.",
      "In his decision, McConnell called OMB's pause on federal assistance \"indiscriminate and unpredictable,\" and he said it is \"disingenuous\" to suggest that the challenged pauses stem from independent agency decisions, instead of the OMB directive.",
      "\"Overall, the OMB directive amounted to a command, not a suggestion, that agency defendants shall execute a categorical, indefinite funding freeze to align funding decisions with the president's priorities,\" the judge wrote.",
      "He also noted that there is no evidence Mr. Trump followed the federal law that lays out the procedures for withholding or cutting money appropriated by Congress, the Impoundment Control Act. The law requires the president to send a special message to Congress detailing the request to rescind or withhold funds, which McConnell said Mr. Trump did not do.",
      "McConnell wrote that the Trump administration \"abruptly froze\" billions of dollars in federal funding for an indefinite period of time.",
      "\"It is difficult to perceive any rationality in this decision \u2014 let alone thoughtful consideration of practical consequences \u2014 when these funding pauses endanger the states' ability to provide vital services, including but not limited to public safety, health care, education, childcare, and transportation infrastructure,\" he said.",
      "Similar challenges are underway in federal district courts across the East Coast. A judge in Washington, D.C., has also barred the Trump administration from pausing the federal aid.",
      "The OMB funding freeze is among an array of actions taken since Mr. Trump returned to office that is part of his plan to shrink the size of the federal government and spending. He created the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to spearhead the effort. Mr. Trump has said DOGE is led by Elon Musk, though the White House has claimed its acting administrator is Amy Gleason, who has worked for DOGE's precursor entity.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/athena-moon-lander-tips-over-intuitive-machines-mission/",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 11:29:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Intuitive Machines says its Athena lunar lander was unable to recharge its batteries while resting on its side, bringing the moon mission to an early end.",
    "story": [
      "A dramatic photograph from Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander shows it touched down Thursday in a crater near the lunar south pole and tipped over on its side. Given a low sun angle and the orientation of the lander's solar cells, the spacecraft's battery quickly drained, bringing the mission to an early end, company officials said Friday",
      "\"Images downlinked from Athena on the lunar surface confirmed that Athena was on her side,\" the company said on its website.",
      "\"After landing, mission controllers were able to accelerate several program and payload milestones, including NASA's PRIME-1 (drill) suite, before the lander's batteries depleted,\" the statement continued. \"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge. The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission.\"",
      "Launched Feb. 26 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the Athena lander carried 10 science instruments and technology demonstrations funded by a NASA program that pays commercial spacecraft operators to deliver the agency's payloads to the moon. The goal is to collect data needed before astronauts return to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe.",
      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia cellular communications equipment and another $41 million to help finance an innovative rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to jump into and out of a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice.",
      "Athena performed flawlessly from launch to lunar orbit and most of the way to the lunar surface. But shortly before touchdown, the lander's autonomous guidance and navigation system began steering to one side, presumably to avoid boulders or some other hazard on the surface, and ended up coming down in a crater some 820 feet from the intended target.",
      "The spacecraft may have tipped over after hitting the ground at an angle or due to some residual sideways motion. Intuitive didn't address the final seconds of the landing, but said that even resting on its side, Athena remained functional, acknowledging commands from the ground, downlinking data and attempting to recharge its batteries. But it was not enough.",
      "\"This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,\" Intuitive Machines said on its web page. \"This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.\"",
      "The landing mishap was the second such disappointment for Intuitive Machines. The company's first moon lander, named Odysseus, touched down on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected and a landing leg failed. The vehicle ended up on its side and unable to complete its mission.",
      "Athena's arrival was preceded by the successful touchdown of a commercial lander built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace that also carried NASA-sponsored payloads to the surface. That spacecraft, known as Blue Ghost, landed Sunday in a different region of the moon with much more forgiving terrain.",
      "A third privately-built lander, this one from Tokyo-based ispace, was launched atop the same Falcon 9 that boosted Blue Ghost into space. The Japanese Resilience lander is taking a longer, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to land in June.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/butterfly-populations-declining-us-science-study/",
    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 20:35:21 -0500",
    "summary": "A study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Butterflies, known for their beauty and vital role in pollination, are vanishing from U.S. landscapes at an alarming rate. A comprehensive study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
      "The new research offers a stark warning about the potential future of these cherished insects.",
      "\"Losing one out of every five butterflies over 20 years should be a big wake-up call to people,\" said Dr. Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University and co-author of the study. \"These declines are not stopping.\"",
      "While butterflies are the most extensively monitored insect group in the U.S., most past studies have been limited by geography or focused on specific species, a news release on the study said. The researchers behind the Science study used data from more than 12.6 million butterflies spanning 342 individual species, drawing from 76,000 surveys across 35 nationwide monitoring programs.",
      "Funded by the U.S. Geological Survey, the study was the first to integrate such a vast dataset, its authors said. The findings revealed that 33% of butterfly species have experienced significant population declines over the past two decades, with 107 out of the 342 species examined losing more than half of their population \u2014 including 22 species that declined by more than 90%. Meanwhile, only 3% of species showed population increases.",
      "One of the most striking examples is the monarch butterfly. In December 2024, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the monarch under the Endangered Species Act, saying the species' eastern population has declined by about 80% and the western population has dropped by more than 95% since the 1980s.",
      "The species was already designated an endangered species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in 2022.",
      "Ultimately, the butterfly decline is part of a larger global trend of insect population loss, with insects declining by about 1-2% annually, the study's authors said.",
      "Butterflies play an essential role in ecosystems, pollinating flowers, crops, and other plants. Their decline could have far-reaching impacts on plant reproduction and the health of ecosystems.",
      "According to the Science study, habitat loss, climate change, and pesticide use are driving their declines. Rising temperatures and changing climates threaten butterfly populations by disrupting breeding cycles, reducing food sources, and increasing habitat stress. Insecticides have been identified as leading causes of butterfly decline, which can be tackled with policy intervention such as restricting harmful insecticides, promoting integrated pest management and encouraging diversified cropping, according to the study.",
      "Despite the declines, individuals can take steps to help butterfly populations recover, Grames said.",
      "\"One of the really positive messages about insect conservation is that the things we do in our own backyards actually make a difference,\" she said.",
      "She recommends allowing a portion of yards to grow wild with native plants, reducing pesticide use, and creating habitat spaces like small brush piles for insects. \"Even simple actions \u2014 like leaving a strip of wildflowers or planting species that support pollinators \u2014 can provide crucial resources for butterflies and other insects.\"",
      "On a larger scale, experts say conservation efforts, including habitat preservation and climate adaptation strategies, are also essential to protecting vulnerable species and ensuring butterfly populations remain resilient in the face of ongoing environmental changes.",

    "summary": "Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander is \"alive,\" but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
    "story": [
      "A second commercially-built moon lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, landed near the moon's south pole Thursday, but telemetry indicated it ended up on its side.",
      "The lander is \"alive,\" Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
      "\"We don't believe we're in the correct attitude (orientation) on the surface of the moon yet again,\" Altemus disclosed. \"I don't have all the data yet to say exactly what the attitude of the vehicle is. We're collecting photos now and downlinking those, and we're going to get a picture from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera from above, from orbit, and we'll confirm that over the coming days as we get that data down.\"",
      "The touchdown came one year after Intuitive's first moon lander, named Odysseus, landed on the moon while still moving sideways. A landing leg broke and the spacecraft tipped over on its side, limiting the mission's scientific return. Intuitive's stock fell 20% in the wake of the latest landing problem.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft from Intuitive Machines\u00a0was launched eight days ago by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Sharing the ride to space were three other spacecraft: a moon-bound NASA orbiter known as the Lunar Trailblazer, a commercial deep space asteroid prospecting probe named Odin, and a privately-built space tug designed to work in Earth orbit.",
      "NASA lost contact with its Lunar Trailblazer satellite shortly after launch, and AstroForge ran into problems commanding its Odin prospector probe. Both payloads are likely lost, officials say.",
      "Athena carried a set of sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to bounce from site to site near the lander. The lander apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing and the lander's exact location were not immediately known as company flight controllers worked to evaluate confusing telemetry from the spacecraft.",
      "But they eventually confirmed the spacecraft's main engine had shut down, its solar cells were generating power and the lander's flight computer was in contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Altemus, a former NASA shuttle engineer and senior manager at the Johnson Space Center, said the most reliable information came from the lander's inertial measurement unit, or IMU, which indicated Athena was resting on its side.",
      "\"We think that's the case,\" he said. \"I would like to get a picture, though, to know the orientation of exactly where the antennas are pointed, where the engine bell is pointed, where are the solar panels so that we can figure out a power profile.\"",
      "\"With the payloads, we can talk to them and command them on and off. So if we can figure out the orientation correctly with imagery, we can then develop a power profile (that will) result in a series of priorities in the science and technology list that would allow us to capture some mission objectives.\"",
      "But time is short. The solar-powered Athena will only be able to operate for about 10 days before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "\"When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,\" Altemus said. \"And then we'll figure out what the mission profile will look. It will be off-nominal because we're not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications, et cetera.\"",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reduce its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent, scanning the surface ahead for hazards.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region. But the spacecraft autonomously maneuvered to find a safer landing area after evaluating the surface ahead. The details of the final phases of the descent are not yet known.",
      "NASA is targeting the south polar region for astronaut landings, in large part because data from orbiting satellites indicate ice may be present in permanently shadowed craters that never see the light of the sun and are among the coldest spots in the solar system.",
      "The water molecules presumably were delivered over billions of years by comet impacts and interactions between moon dust and the electrically charged solar wind.",
      "The innovative \"Grace\" hopper was designed to jump into one of those dark craters about a quarter of a mile from Athena for in situ measurements, radioing its observations back to the lander using 4G/LTE cellular network equipment provided by Nokia.",
      "Other instruments on the lander were expected to look for the chemical traces of water and other compounds, along with taking measurements of soil temperature and composition. Two small rovers were on board to explore the landing site and to test innovative mobility systems.",
      "Altemus said it may still be possible to deploy the hopper and the rovers, but that will depend on the lander's orientation.",
      "Second lunar lander to reach moon this year",
      "Athena's arrival is the second of three to reach the moon this year.",
      "A lander built by Austin-based\u00a0Firefly Aerospace successfully touched down on the moon early Sunday, March 2. The commercially-developed Blue Ghost lander is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments designed to collect data needed for the Artemis program.",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million for delivery of the agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations to the moon's surface. The instruments cost NASA another $44 million.",

      "NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million went to Intuitive Machines to help finance the \"Grace\" hopper.",
      "Another $89 million paid for a lunar satellite built by Lockheed Martin that was launched on the same Falcon 9 rocket as Athena. But the Lunar Trailblazer satellite dropped out of contact with Earth shortly after launch and has not been heard from since.",
      "Blue Ghost and Athena were both funded in large part by NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. The CLPS initiative is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface later this decade.",

      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Just last year, the company said they made a breakthrough in efforts to bring back the extinct Tasmanian tiger.",
      "Colossal has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \"engineer them into living animals,\" said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "In a 2023 interview, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti told Lamm, \"I hear mammoth and dodo in the same sentence and, you know, it's science fiction to me.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it is,\" said Lamm, \"until it's not.\"",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\"You're not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you're not bringing back the ancient past,\" said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \"Colossal woolly mouse.\"",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\" said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \"make it a lot more efficient and easier,\" said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \"present already in some living mice,\" said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \"we put them all together in a single mouse.\"",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Independent experts skeptical of \"de-extinction\"",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \"a lot of processes and red tape\" before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",

      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",

      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

      "A little over a month after\u00a0a civilian jet broke the sound barrier, Boom Supersonic and NASA have released a photo of one of the aircraft's\u00a0historic test flights over the Mojave Desert.",
      "The image released Monday shows the XB-1 aircraft, which Boom Supersonic said is the \"first civil supersonic jet made in America,\" during its second supersonic flight on Feb. 10. The company said it partnered with NASA using a technique known as Schlieren photography to visualize what can't be seen with the naked eye.",
      "\"This image makes the invisible visible,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a news release.",
      "Chief test pilot Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg had to make sure XB-1 was in the right place at the right time to allow NASA's team on the ground to photograph it in-flight as it eclipsed the sun, the Colorado-based company said. Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground. The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",

    "summary": "Intuitive Machines says its Athena lunar lander was unable to recharge its batteries while resting on its side, bringing the moon mission to an early end.",
    "story": [
      "A dramatic photograph from Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander shows it touched down Thursday in a crater near the lunar south pole and tipped over on its side. Given a low sun angle and the orientation of the lander's solar cells, the spacecraft's battery quickly drained, bringing the mission to an early end, company officials said Friday",
      "\"Images downlinked from Athena on the lunar surface confirmed that Athena was on her side,\" the company said on its website.",
      "\"After landing, mission controllers were able to accelerate several program and payload milestones, including NASA's PRIME-1 (drill) suite, before the lander's batteries depleted,\" the statement continued. \"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge. The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission.\"",
      "Launched Feb. 26 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the Athena lander carried 10 science instruments and technology demonstrations funded by a NASA program that pays commercial spacecraft operators to deliver the agency's payloads to the moon. The goal is to collect data needed before astronauts return to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe.",
      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia cellular communications equipment and another $41 million to help finance an innovative rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to jump into and out of a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice.",
      "Athena performed flawlessly from launch to lunar orbit and most of the way to the lunar surface. But shortly before touchdown, the lander's autonomous guidance and navigation system began steering to one side, presumably to avoid boulders or some other hazard on the surface, and ended up coming down in a crater some 820 feet from the intended target.",
      "The spacecraft may have tipped over after hitting the ground at an angle or due to some residual sideways motion. Intuitive didn't address the final seconds of the landing, but said that even resting on its side, Athena remained functional, acknowledging commands from the ground, downlinking data and attempting to recharge its batteries. But it was not enough.",
      "\"This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,\" Intuitive Machines said on its web page. \"This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.\"",
      "The landing mishap was the second such disappointment for Intuitive Machines. The company's first moon lander, named Odysseus, touched down on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected and a landing leg failed. The vehicle ended up on its side and unable to complete its mission.",
      "Athena's arrival was preceded by the successful touchdown of a commercial lander built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace that also carried NASA-sponsored payloads to the surface. That spacecraft, known as Blue Ghost, landed Sunday in a different region of the moon with much more forgiving terrain.",
      "A third privately-built lander, this one from Tokyo-based ispace, was launched atop the same Falcon 9 that boosted Blue Ghost into space. The Japanese Resilience lander is taking a longer, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to land in June.",

    "story": [
      "A second commercially-built moon lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, landed near the moon's south pole Thursday, but telemetry indicated it ended up on its side.",
      "The lander is \"alive,\" Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
      "\"We don't believe we're in the correct attitude (orientation) on the surface of the moon yet again,\" Altemus disclosed. \"I don't have all the data yet to say exactly what the attitude of the vehicle is. We're collecting photos now and downlinking those, and we're going to get a picture from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera from above, from orbit, and we'll confirm that over the coming days as we get that data down.\"",
      "The touchdown came one year after Intuitive's first moon lander, named Odysseus, landed on the moon while still moving sideways. A landing leg broke and the spacecraft tipped over on its side, limiting the mission's scientific return. Intuitive's stock fell 20% in the wake of the latest landing problem.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft from Intuitive Machines\u00a0was launched eight days ago by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Sharing the ride to space were three other spacecraft: a moon-bound NASA orbiter known as the Lunar Trailblazer, a commercial deep space asteroid prospecting probe named Odin, and a privately-built space tug designed to work in Earth orbit.",
      "NASA lost contact with its Lunar Trailblazer satellite shortly after launch, and AstroForge ran into problems commanding its Odin prospector probe. Both payloads are likely lost, officials say.",
      "Athena carried a set of sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to bounce from site to site near the lander. The lander apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing and the lander's exact location were not immediately known as company flight controllers worked to evaluate confusing telemetry from the spacecraft.",
      "But they eventually confirmed the spacecraft's main engine had shut down, its solar cells were generating power and the lander's flight computer was in contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Altemus, a former NASA shuttle engineer and senior manager at the Johnson Space Center, said the most reliable information came from the lander's inertial measurement unit, or IMU, which indicated Athena was resting on its side.",
      "\"We think that's the case,\" he said. \"I would like to get a picture, though, to know the orientation of exactly where the antennas are pointed, where the engine bell is pointed, where are the solar panels so that we can figure out a power profile.\"",
      "\"With the payloads, we can talk to them and command them on and off. So if we can figure out the orientation correctly with imagery, we can then develop a power profile (that will) result in a series of priorities in the science and technology list that would allow us to capture some mission objectives.\"",
      "But time is short. The solar-powered Athena will only be able to operate for about 10 days before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "\"When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,\" Altemus said. \"And then we'll figure out what the mission profile will look. It will be off-nominal because we're not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications, et cetera.\"",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reduce its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent, scanning the surface ahead for hazards.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region. But the spacecraft autonomously maneuvered to find a safer landing area after evaluating the surface ahead. The details of the final phases of the descent are not yet known.",
      "NASA is targeting the south polar region for astronaut landings, in large part because data from orbiting satellites indicate ice may be present in permanently shadowed craters that never see the light of the sun and are among the coldest spots in the solar system.",
      "The water molecules presumably were delivered over billions of years by comet impacts and interactions between moon dust and the electrically charged solar wind.",
      "The innovative \"Grace\" hopper was designed to jump into one of those dark craters about a quarter of a mile from Athena for in situ measurements, radioing its observations back to the lander using 4G/LTE cellular network equipment provided by Nokia.",
      "Other instruments on the lander were expected to look for the chemical traces of water and other compounds, along with taking measurements of soil temperature and composition. Two small rovers were on board to explore the landing site and to test innovative mobility systems.",
      "Altemus said it may still be possible to deploy the hopper and the rovers, but that will depend on the lander's orientation.",
      "Second lunar lander to reach moon this year",
      "Athena's arrival is the second of three to reach the moon this year.",
      "A lander built by Austin-based\u00a0Firefly Aerospace successfully touched down on the moon early Sunday, March 2. The commercially-developed Blue Ghost lander is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments designed to collect data needed for the Artemis program.",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million for delivery of the agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations to the moon's surface. The instruments cost NASA another $44 million.",
      "Athena's instruments and technology demonstrations also were funded by NASA. The agency paid the company $62.5 million to deliver a powerful drill and mass spectrometer, known collectively as Prime-1, to the moon's surface.",
      "NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million went to Intuitive Machines to help finance the \"Grace\" hopper.",
      "Another $89 million paid for a lunar satellite built by Lockheed Martin that was launched on the same Falcon 9 rocket as Athena. But the Lunar Trailblazer satellite dropped out of contact with Earth shortly after launch and has not been heard from since.",
      "Blue Ghost and Athena were both funded in large part by NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. The CLPS initiative is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface later this decade.",
      "In the meantime, a Japanese lander known as Resilience was launched in January atop the same Falcon 9 rocket that boosted the Blue Ghost into space. Built by Tokyo-based ispace, Resilience took a longer, low-energy route to the moon and will not arrive until early June.",

    "summary": "Starliner commander Barry Wilmore offered an even-handed response to questions about the intrusion of politics into his ISS mission.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore said Tuesday he did not think politics played any role in the crew's extended mission, but he did not directly address earlier comments by President Trump and Elon Musk that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"Obviously, we've heard some of these different things that have been said,\" Wilmore said during an orbital news conference. \"I can tell you at the outset, all of us have the utmost respect for Mr. Musk and obviously, respect and admiration for our president of the United States, Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"The words they've said, politics, I mean, that's part of life. We understand that. And there's an important reason why we have a political system and the political system that we do have, and we're behind it 100%.\"",
      "Wilmore and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams said in earlier comments that they didn't feel stranded or abandoned. But again on Tuesday, the crew took multiple questions about what some see as the intrusion of politics on their mission.",
      "\"From my standpoint, politics is not playing into this at all,\" Wilmore said. \"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight program is all about, planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams, both former military test pilots, launched to the International Space Station\u00a0on June 5 last year aboard a Boeing Starliner crew ferry ship for a mission that was expected to last about eight days.",
      "The Starliner docked at the outpost the day after launch, but the ship ran into multiple problems with its propulsion system during its approach to the lab.",
      "In mid August, after a detailed engineering analysis, Boeing managers argued the problems were well understood and could be safely managed during the crew's return to Earth. But NASA managers disagreed and eventually decided to bring the Starliner back to Earth by remote control, without its crew, in early September.",
      "To minimize the disruption to the station's crew rotation schedule and on-going research, NASA opted to bump two astronauts from the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight and to launch that mission, known as Crew 9, in late September with just two crew members on board. That left two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Crew 9 mission was initially expected to end this month, but the flight was extended to late March because of issues preparing a new Crew Dragon for launch, sources said. NASA later decided to use a different Crew Dragon, clearing the way for Crew 9 to undock and head for Earth around March 19.",
      "On Jan. 28, President Trump blamed the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's extended stay in space, saying he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\"",
      "\"They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Hours before the president's post, Musk said on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding, \"We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Musk later said he offered to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but he said his offer was turned down because \"they did not want positive press for someone who supported Trump. That's it. End of story.\"",
      "Wilmore described the SpaceX CEO as \"absolutely factual.\" But he added that the crew had no knowledge of such an offer.",
      "\"We have no information on that, though ... what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that processes went,\" Wilmore told a reporter Tuesday. \"That's information that we simply don't have.\"",
      "\"So I believe him. I don't know all those details, and I don't think any of us really can give you the answer that maybe you would be hoping for.\"",
      "NASA plans to operate the ISS through 2030. In another recent post on X, Musk said the station should be brought down earlier: \"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.\"",
      "When asked by tech and science news outlet Ars Technica to clarify, Musk responded on X by saying \"the decision is up to the president, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now.\"",
      "Williams said he disagreed.",
      "\"This place is ticking, it's just really amazing,\" she said of the station. \"So I would say we're actually in our prime right now. We've got all the power, all of the facilities up and operating. So I would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.\"",
      "Given that the ISS is operated by NASA and multiple partner nations, the Starliner pilot said they should make the most out of it for taxpayers and international partners and \"hold our obligations and do that world-class science that this laboratory is capable of.\"",
      "If all goes well, Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov will blast off and head for the space station on March 12.",

    "story": [
      "Firefly Aerospace's \"Blue Ghost\" lander dropped out of lunar orbit and swooped to a rocket-powered touchdown early Sunday, pulling off the first fully successful moon landing by a commercially-built and operated robotic spacecraft.",
      "Flying above the far side of the moon in a circular 62-mile-high orbit, the squat lander fired its main engine at 2:31 a.m. EST, kicking off a white-knuckle 63-minute descent to the landing site in Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crises \u2014 in the northeast quadrant of the moon as viewed from Earth.",
      "The 6.6-foot-tall lander coasted for the next 52 minutes before using its main engine and eight smaller reaction control system, or RCS, thrusters to reduce its velocity from about 3,800 mph to just 90 mph as it moved into position above the landing site.",
      "After autonomously analyzing the terrain below for boulders, slopes, and other hazards, Blue Ghost descended using the power of its eight reaction control system jets. The jets pulsed as needed to control velocity and orientation before slowing the craft to just 2.2 mph for the last 30 feet or so of the descent.",
      "Firefly Aerospace employees and family members, known collectively as \"Fireflies,\" watched telemetry stream in on a large monitor near the company's Austin, Texas, headquarters and mission control center, no doubt on the edges of their seats as the 11.5-foot-wide spacecraft neared the surface.",
      "\"Eleven meters up,\" a flight controller said on the Firefly mission control audio loop. A moment later, the thrusters shut down and surface contact sensors on Blue Ghost's shock-absorbing landing legs indicated they were on the lunar surface.",
      "\"Engine shutdown confirmed,\" a flight controller verified.",
      "\"Power is nominal, vehicle is charging (with its solar cells),\" someone else chimed in.",
      "\"IMU (inertial measurement unit) reports lunar gravity, and it is stable,\" another controller reported, prompting the start of applause from onlookers.",
      "Will Coogan, the chief engineer, then came on the line with the official results: \"You all stuck the landing! We're on the moon!\"",
      "The assembled Fireflies instantly burst into cheers, hugs and raucous applause. A few minutes later, \"Make Space Great Again\" hats were handed out.",
      "\"Firefly successfully touched down on the moon in an upright, stable condition, becoming the first commercial company to complete a fully successful moon landing,\" said Brigette Oakes, Firefly vice president of engineering.",
      "Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin said in a post on the social media platform X: \"'Contact light, engine stop!' Congratulations FireFly Aerospace for Blue Ghost's Mission 1 successful Moon landing today! It also marks a new milestone in the collaborations between NASA and private Space companies.\"",
      "Launched on Jan. 15, the landing was timed to coincide with the start of a two-week-long lunar day. The solar-powered Blue Ghost will operate 10 NASA-sponsored experiments while sunlight is available and, if all goes well, for a few hours into the lunar night using stored battery power. After that, it will fall silent.",
      "\"Once in a blue-moon long-time ago, these type of lunar landers took billions of dollars and countries behind (them) to land on the moon,\" Firefly CEO Jason Kim told CBS News in a pre-launch interview.",
      "\"This is Firefly Aerospace that's gonna land on the moon at fractions of the cost on a fixed-price contract, and doing it with the latest commercial technology,\" he said. \"Just like Simone Biles stuck the landing in the Olympics, we're gonna do the same thing for the state of Texas, for America and for the world.\"",
      "For Ray Allensworth, spacecraft program director at Firefly, the moon will never look the same.",
      "\"We were all dreaming up until now that you look up at the (moon) and you just imagine, like, that's where it's gonna be,\" she said. \"But now, you know it's there, and that's a totally different feeling. So, yeah, the next full moon, I just won't sleep. I'll just stare at it all night.\"",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million to carry 10 agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations, built for $44 million, to the moon as part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program aims to encourage private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"Before we can send our humans back to the moon, we are sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\" said Nicky Fox, director of space science at NASA Headquarters.",
      "\"We learned so many lessons during the Apollo era, and the technological and science demonstrations on board Firefly's Blue Ghost will be critical in our ability to not only discover more science, but also to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments, and, most importantly, the safety of our astronauts.\"",
      "Firefly's instruments include three designed to study how landing thrusters disturb the lunar soil, how fine-grained dust particles adhere to spacecraft surfaces and whether electrodynamic techniques for removing accumulated contamination will work in the lunar environment.",
      "A drill will bore into the surface below the Blue Ghost to measure soil temperatures at different depths while a novel sample collection system will attempt to literally blow surface particles into a capture device, foregoing the need for robot arm-type retrieval systems.",
      "A radiation-tolerant computer will be tested, another instrument will attempt to pull in and process GPS navigation satellite data from Earth, a retroreflector will serve as a positioning target for Earth-based lasers and another instrument will take X-ray images showing interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field.",
      "Along with its initial Blue Ghost mission, Firefly holds a $130 million CLPS contract for a second flight in 2026, this one to the moon's far side featuring a Blue Ghost lander and an orbital spacecraft called Elytra. Another CLPS contract valued at $179 million is helping pay for a Blue Ghost lander, a rover and another orbiter.",
      "\"One of these days, we're going to get there in terms of the commercial aspects of the moon,\" Kim said. \"There's going to be a lot of business plans that are going to be self-sustaining and growing. It's a great location to frequently go and test out new missions to sustain life in space, and it's a stepping stone for Mars as well.\"",
      "Blue Ghost is the first of three commercially-developed landers, all launched within the last month and a half, to reach the lunar surface.",
      "Sharing a ride to space with Blue Ghost aboard the same SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket last January was another moon lander, a spacecraft called \"Resilience\" that was built by Tokyo-based ispace. The company sent its first lander to the moon last year, but it crashed to the surface after running out of fuel due to a software glitch.",
      "The appropriately-named Resilience took a different route to the moon than Blue Ghost, a low-energy trajectory utilizing lunar gravity to help reach the desired descent orbit for a landing attempt in May.",
      "Yet another lunar lander, built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines and known as Athena, was launched last Wednesday by another Falcon 9 and is expected to touch down on the moon March 6. The company's first lander, Odysseus, successfully landed on the moon last year, but it tipped over on touchdown and was unable to complete all its planned research.",
      "Athena also was funded in large part by NASA's CLPS program, which agreed to pay the company $62.5 million to carry a sophisticated drill and mass spectrometer to the moon.",
      "NASA awarded a $15 million technology \"tipping point\" contract to Nokia to test cellular communications on the moon and another $41 million to Intuitive Machines for a small rocket-powered \"hopper\" that will jump into a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",

      "The image released Monday shows the XB-1 aircraft, which Boom Supersonic said is the \"first civil supersonic jet made in America,\" during its second supersonic flight on Feb. 10. The company said it partnered with NASA using a technique known as Schlieren photography to visualize what can't be seen with the naked eye.",
      "\"This image makes the invisible visible,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a news release.",
      "Chief test pilot Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg had to make sure XB-1 was in the right place at the right time to allow NASA's team on the ground to photograph it in-flight as it eclipsed the sun, the Colorado-based company said. Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground. The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",

My heart started pounding a little after Sigmon's lawyer read his final statement. The hood was put over Sigmon's head, and an employee opened the black pull shade that shielded where the three prison system volunteer shooters were.",
      "About two minutes later, they fired. There was no warning or countdown. The abrupt crack of the rifles startled me. And the white target with the red bullseye that had been on his chest, standing out against his black prison jumpsuit, disappeared instantly as Sigmon's whole body flinched.",
      "It reminded me of what happened to the prisoner 21 years ago when electricity jolted his body.",
      "I tried to keep track, all at once, of the digital clock on the wall to my right, Sigmon to my left, the small, rectangular window with the shooters and the witnesses in front of me.",
      "A jagged red spot about the size of a small fist appeared where Sigmon was shot. His chest moved two or three times. Outside of the rifle crack, there was no sound.",
      "A doctor came out in less than a minute, and his examination took about a minute more. Sigmon was declared dead at 6:08 p.m.",
      "Then we left through the same door we came in.",
      "The sun was setting. The sky was a pretty pink and purple, a stark contrast to the death chamber's florescent lights, gray firing squad chair and block walls that reminded me of a 1970s doctor's office.",
      "The death chamber is less than a five-minute drive from Correction Department headquarters along a busy suburban highway. I always look out the window on the drive back from each execution. There is a pasture with cows behind a fence on one side, and on the other, I can see in the distance the razor wire of the prison.",
      "Armed prison employees were everywhere. We sat in vans outside the death chamber for what I guess was around 15 minutes, but I can't say for certain because my watch, cellphone and everything else was taken away for security, save for a pad and a pen.",
      "Over to my right, I saw the skinny, barred windows of South Carolina's death row. There were 28 inmates there earlier Friday, and now there are 27.",
      "That's down from 31 last August. After a 13-year pause while South Carolina struggled to obtain the drugs for lethal injections, the state has resumed executions. Inmates may choose between injections, electrocution or the firing squad.",
      "I witnessed Freddie Owens being put to death Sept. 20. He locked eyes with every witness in the room.",
      "I saw Richard Moore die Nov. 1, looking serenely at the celling as his lawyer, who became close to him while fighting for his life over a decade, wept.",
      "And I was there, too, when Marion Bowman Jr. died Jan. 31, a small smile on his face as he turned to his lawyer, then closed his eyes and waited.",
      "I remember other executions too. I've seen family members of victims stare down a killer on the gurney. I've seen a mother shed tears as she watched her son die, almost close enough to touch if the glass and bars weren't in the way.",
      "Like that thunk of the breaker back in 2004, I won't forget the crack of the rifles Friday and that target disappearing. Also etched in my mind: Sigmon talking or mouthing toward his lawyer, trying to let him know he was OK before the hood went on.",
      "I'll likely be back at Broad River Correctional Institution on April 11. Two more men on death row are out of appeals, and the state Supreme Court appears ready to schedule their deaths at five-week intervals.",
      "They would be the 12th and 13th men I've seen killed by the state of South Carolina. And when it is over, I will have witnessed more than a quarter of the state's executions since the death penalty was reinstated.",

    "story": [
      "New Mexico officials announced the cause of death Friday for actor Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa weeks after the couple was found dead at their home in Santa Fe.",
      "The pair died within days of each other\u00a0and there were no apparent signs of foul play, New Mexico Chief Medical Investigator Dr. Heather Jarrell said at a news conference. Their bodies were discovered on Feb. 26.",
      "Hackman, 95, likely died on Feb. 18, from heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor, officials said after medical investigators performed autopsies.",
      "His wife, 65, likely died about a week before him of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare disease often spread by rodents in the Southwest. She was last known alive on Feb. 11, investigators said.",
      "There were only seven confirmed cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in New Mexico in 2024, according to state health officials.",
      "What is hantavirus pulmonary syndrome?",
      "Hantaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause rare but potentially deadly illnesses.",
      "There are many different types of hantaviruses worldwide.",
      "\"These viruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted from animals to humans,\" Dr. Erin Phipps, the state public health veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department said at Friday's news conference.",
      "Hantaviruses can cause two syndromes: hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, known as HPS, or hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, also known as HFRS,\u00a0according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "HFRS is found mostly in Europe and Asia, the CDC said, while HPS is found in the Western Hemisphere, including the United States.",
      "Hantaviruses have been found throughout New Mexico, primarily in deer mice, but in other rodents as well.",
      "\"A small number of human infections are found every year in New Mexico,\" said Phipps.",
      "Between one and seven cases have been confirmed annually in the state over the past five years, she said. There have been 136 infections confirmed statewide over the past 50 years, with five in Santa Fe County.",
      "\"This is a serious disease,\" Phipps said, adding that 42% of the infections in New Mexico were fatal.",
      "There is no current specific treatment to cure hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.",
      "How does hantavirus pulmonary syndrome spread?",
      "The virus is spread in the U.S. through rodents, primarily through deer mice and other similar mice.",
      "The CDC started monitoring hantavirus in 1993 after an outbreak of severe respiratory illness in the Four Corners region \u2014 the area where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah meet. As of 2022, there had been 864 cases of hantavirus disease\u00a0reported in the U.S. since surveillance began, according to the CDC.",
      "The virus is not spread from person-to-person, but from animals to humans.",
      "Hantavirus can be transmitted from rodent dropping, urine and saliva. An infected person can get HPS by breathing in the virus, the New Mexico health department said, and this happens when droppings or urine containing the virus is stirred up in the air as mist or dust. It could also spread if someone touches their eyes, nose, or mouth after they have touched droppings or dust that contains the virus.",
      "\"Avoiding contact with or breathing in aerosolized rodent urine or feces, especially in a poorly ventilated area, is key,\" Phipps said.",
      "People can also get hantavirus from a mouse bite, but this is rare, the New Mexico health department said.",
      "Most transmissions occur around the resident's home or workplace. On March 5, New Mexico health officials conducted an inspection of the Hackman's property, said Phipps. Signs of rodent entry were found on structures on the Hackman's property, but not in the main residence, officials said.",
      "What are the symptoms of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome?",
      "Hantavirus infections can initially cause flu-like symptoms that last roughly three to six days. An infected person can suffer from fever, muscle aches, coughs and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea.",
      "These symptoms can sometimes progress to shortness of breath, heart and lung failure, said Jarrell. This can occur anywhere from one to eight weeks after exposure to excrement from a mouse species that carries hantavirus, she said.",

    "published": "Sat, 08 Mar 2025 07:34:37 -0500",
    "summary": "The Social Security Administration said it will restart a policy that had caused financial distress for some beneficiaries.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) said it is reinstating a plan to recover 100% of overpayments to beneficiaries, a policy the agency abandoned last year after an outcry over cases in which the practice led some Americans to receive shock bills amounting to thousands of dollars.",
      "In a statement, SSA said late Friday that it will increase the default overpayment withholding rate for Social Security recipients to 100% of a person's monthly benefit, the same level that it had in place before last year's reform. The agency is required by law to claw back overpaid benefits.",
      "Because of public backlash over the 100% recovery policy, the agency last year had capped\u00a0the withholding rate for someone who had been overpaid at 10% of the person's monthly benefit. On Friday, the SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments, while the withholding rate for people with overpayments before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.",
      "\"People who are overpaid after March 27 will automatically be placed in full recovery at a rate of 100% of the Social Security payment,\" the agency said.",
      "The 100% clawback policy had sparked an outcry after instances in which beneficiaries were hit with surprise bills that demanded repayment within 30 days. In some cases, the bills were for tens of thousands of dollars. If beneficiaries were unable to immediately pay the bill, the agency could dock their entire monthly Social Security payment, leaving some people financially destitute, as reported by \"60 Minutes,\"\u00a0KFF Health News\u00a0and other media outlets,",
      "In many cases, the overpayments were the fault of SSA. A\u00a02022 report\u00a0by the agency's inspector general found that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "In the agency's new statement, SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek said it is the agency's \"duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding.\"",
      "He added, \"We have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people.\"",
      "Raising the clawback rate to 100% from its current 10% will increase the amount of recovered funds by $7 billion over the next decade, the agency said. SSA pays out about $1.6 trillion in benefits each year.",

    "published": "Sat, 08 Mar 2025 07:00:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Researchers are discovering that \"springing ahead\" each March for daylight saving time is connected with serious negative health effects.",
    "story": [
      "Beth Ann Malow\u00a0is a professor of neurology and pediatrics at Vanderbilt University.",
      "As people in the U.S. prepare to turn their clocks ahead one hour in mid-March, I find myself bracing for the annual ritual of media stories about the disruptions to daily routines caused by switching from standard time to daylight saving time.",
      "About a third of Americans say they don't look forward to these twice-yearly time changes. An overwhelming 63% to 16% majority would like to eliminate them completely.",
      "But the effects go beyond simple inconvenience. Researchers are discovering that \"springing ahead\" each March is connected with serious negative health effects.",
      "I'm a professor of neurology and pediatrics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, and the director of our sleep division. In a 2020 commentary for the journal JAMA Neurology, my co-authors and I reviewed the evidence linking the annual transition to daylight saving time to increased strokes, heart attacks and teen sleep deprivation.",
      "Based on an extensive body of research, my colleagues and I believe that the science establishing these links is strong and that the evidence makes a good case for adopting permanent standard time nationwide \u2013 as I testified at a recent Congressional hearing.",
      "Missing sleep, worse health",
      "\"Falling back\" \u2013 going from daylight saving time to standard time each November by turning the clocks back one hour \u2013 is relatively benign. While some people may feel thrown off balance and need a few weeks to recover, research hasn't linked it to serious impacts on health.",
      "Springing forward is harder on the body, however. This is because our clock time is moved an hour later; in other words, it feels like 7 a.m. even though our clocks say it is 8 a.m. So it's a permanent shift to later morning light for almost eight months \u2013 not just for the day of the change or a few weeks afterward. This is particularly notable because morning light is valuable for helping to set the body's natural rhythms: It wakes us up and improves alertness.",
      "Although the exact reasons are not yet known, this may be due to light's effects on increasing levels of cortisol, a hormone that modulates the stress response or the effect of light on the amygdala, a part of the brain involved in emotions.",
      "In contrast, exposure to light later into the evening delays the brain's release of melatonin, the hormone that promotes drowsiness. This can interfere with sleep and cause us to sleep less overall, and the effect can last even after most people adjust to losing an hour of sleep at the start of daylight saving time.",
      "Because puberty also causes melatonin to be released later at night, meaning that teenagers have a delay in the natural signal that helps them fall asleep, adolescents are particularly susceptible to sleep problems from the extended evening light of daylight saving time. This shift in melatonin during puberty lasts into our 20s.",
      "Adolescents also may be chronically sleep deprived due to school, sports and social activity schedules. For instance, many children start school around 8 a.m. or earlier. This means that during daylight saving time, many young people get up and travel to school in pitch darkness.",
      "The \"western edge\" effect",
      "Geography can also make a difference in how daylight saving time affects people. One study showed that people living on the western edge of a time zone, who get light later in the morning and light later in the evening, got less sleep than their counterparts on the eastern edge of a time zone.",
      "This study found that western edge residents had higher rates of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and breast cancer, as well as lower per capita income and higher health care costs. Other research has found that rates of certain other cancers are higher on the western edge of a time zone.",
      "Scientists believe that these health problems may result from a combination of chronic sleep deprivation and \"circadian misalignment\". Circadian misalignment refers to a mismatch in timing between our biological rhythms and the outside world. In other words, the timing of daily work, school or sleep routines is based on the clock, rather than on the sun's rise and set.",
      "A brief history of daylight saving time",
      "Congress instituted daylight saving time during World War I and again during World War II, and once again during the energy crisis of the early 1970s. The idea was that having extra light later into the afternoon would save energy by decreasing the need for electric lighting. This idea has since been proved largely inaccurate, as heating needs may increase in the morning in the winter, while air conditioning needs can also increase in the late afternoon in the summer.",
      "Another pro-daylight saving argument has been that crime rates drop with more light at the end of the day. While this has been proved true, the change is very small, and the health effects appear to outweigh the lower rates of crime.",
      "After World War II, it was left to state governments to set the start and end dates for daylight saving time. Because this created many railroad scheduling and safety problems, however, Congress passed the Uniform Time Act in 1966. This law set the nationwide dates of daylight saving time from the last Sunday in April until the last Sunday in October.",
      "In 2007, Congress amended the Uniform Time Act to expand daylight saving time from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November, dates that remain in effect today.",
      "The law allows states and territories to opt out of daylight saving time, however. Arizona and Hawaii are on permanent standard time, along with Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam and American Samoa. Now, many other states are considering whether to stop falling back and springing ahead.",
      "The question then becomes: Should they pick permanent daylight saving time or permanent standard time?",
      "The strong case for permanent standard time",
      "Americans are split on whether they prefer permanent daylight saving time or permanent standard time. However, my colleagues and I believe that the health-related science for establishing permanent standard time is strong.",
      "Standard time most closely approximates natural light, with the sun directly overhead at or near noon. In contrast, during daylight saving time from March until November, the natural light is shifted unnaturally by one hour later.",
      "Based on abundant evidence that daylight saving time is unnatural and unhealthy, I believe we should abolish daylight saving time and adopt permanent standard time.",

      "After investigators gave the news to John Blauvelt, he became their prime suspect. Investigator Keith Morecraft spoke with him and noted that he didn't seem surprised, \"didn't ask normal questions \u2026 such as \u2026 where did you find her? How did she die?\" And Investigator Cheryl Schofield was concerned for Thompson's safety, stating \"If he was willing to kill his own wife, there's no telling what kind of danger Hannah Thompson would've been in by fleeing with him.\"",
      "Cati Blauvelt was just 22. She loved animals and had many friends. Her mother Patti Piver described Cati as \"a free spirit \u2026 5'1\"f \u2026 a teeny, little thing.\" She had met John Blauvelt when she was 20 and he was 26. John Blauvelt was well-known and respected by many in the small city of 20,000. He was a recruiter for the U.S. Army. He loved being part of the U.S. military. The job put him in touch with many of the area's young people.",
      "At the time, Cati worked at a restaurant next door to the recruiting office. They started dating. Friends say that initially they seemed like a happy couple. But that changed fast, almost as soon as they got back from their honeymoon.",
      "The home John Blauvelt owned, and that Cati Blauvelt moved into, was turned into a party house. John Blauvelt invited underaged kids there, to smoke weed, drink, and do drugs. Cati Blauvelt had wanted to start a new life and build a family with John. Instead, she got a crash pad. One of the kids John Blauvelt welcomed was Hannah Thompson. Friend Aly Somerville would say that Hannah was \"a 100%\" in love with John Blauvelt. Schofield said Thompson was like \"John's puppy\" and would do anything John Blauvelt wanted. And adds Schofield, Thompson hated Cati Blauvelt.",
      "A bad situation got much worse the night of Feb. 26, 2016, when police -- alerted by Thompson's father -- showed up at John Blauvelt's house. He would be charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, his soldier's image replaced with a mug shot. That same day, Cati Blauvelt told police that a month earlier, John Blauvelt had threatened her with a gun. For that he would be charged with domestic violence.",
      "John Blauvelt's Army career was in tatters. The Department of the Army cut his pay and disciplined him, removing him from the recruiting duties that defined him. John Blauvelt reportedly blamed Cati Blauvert and told friends he intended to get revenge. Investigators say that was at the heart of why he murdered Cati. But before cops could build their case, John Blauvelt went on the run; with him was 17-year-old Hannah Thompson.",
      "They would head toward the Pacific Northwest, but after a month, Thompson had enough of life on the run. She headed back home to Simpsonville. Then, over several years, she began to slowly provide information to authorities as to where she thought John Blauvelt might be. Leads Thompson provided, in part, led them to a house in Medford, Oregon.",
      "On July 20, 2022, six years after Cati Blauvelt's murder, U.S. Marshals and other law enforcement arrested John Blauvelt. He was brought back to face a South Carolina jury. \u00a0Thompson would be a key witness against John Blauvelt. He would be convicted and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Prosecutors and investigators agreed that Thompson's testimony was critical to the case against him. He has appealed his conviction.",
      "Thompson was charged with five felony counts, including obstruction of justice and \"accessory after-the-fact.\" Thompson has pleaded not guilty. Authorities do not believe that Thompson was present when John Blauvelt murdered Cati Blauvelt. She faces 55 years in prison and has been released on bail. A judge will decide her fate.",

      "\"We are in a place where the biology of aging has been demystified,\" said Dr. Douglas Vaughan, director of the Potocsnak Longevity Institute at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, and the head of the study. \"...If we can slow down aging, just a little bit, we can push back the onset of disease, and we can give people a longer health span.\"",
      "The foundation of Vaughan's research came from a small Amish community in Indiana, where he found that a genetic variation in about 10% of the population allows them to live, on average, a decade longer than those in their community.",
      "\"They can teach us a lot about what's required for healthy aging to take place,\" Vaughan said.",
      "That work has evolved into an international examination of aging Vaughan leads at the Longevity Institute. \u00a0 \"As you get older, you want to know, like, am I going stay sharp,\" Vaughan said.  \u00a0The Longevity Institute was established in 2022. Study participants undergo a one-time visit that lasts anywhere from 60 minutes to 3 hours, with follow-ups to provide updates on their health status.",
      "\"Being able to be a representative from minority community is really important because I wanna know, how does this information measure up to people like me?\" study participant Kalinda Marshall said.\u00a0 \u00a0 The researchers use a series of tests to calculate biological age, including a scan of the retina and an analysis of participants' physical movement.",
      "They also measure body mass in a machine called a Bod Pod. They do an electrocardiogram for heart function. They then use artificial intelligence to scour the mountain of data to come up with a number for a participant's biological age.",
      "\"Artificial intelligence gives us the opportunity to find patterns in the data that we can't find with our eyes, that we can't detect with a human brain,\" said Dr. Josh Cheema, a cardiologist with Northwestern Medicine involved in the project.",
      "The work has a special focus on people in marginalized communities and those living with long-term medical problems.  \u00a0 \"We are really interested in finding out ways to slow down aging in people that are disadvantaged,\" Vaughan said.",
      "A network of similar labs conducting the same research on three other continents is in the works, and there are already signs of progress. In trials, pills that mimic the genetic variation that helps Amish live longer has done the same thing for mice.",
      "Says Vaughan, \"So, theoretically, we could bring this Amish advantage to everybody.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/interest-rates-federal-reserve-jerome-powell-trump/",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 17:05:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Powell says the Fed is in no hurry to change course, citing \"uncertainty\" over the impact of the Trump administration economic policies",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that the central bank can remain patient in adjusting its benchmark interest rate, citing uncertainty around the potential impact of President Trump's economic policies.",
      "Powell said the Trump administration is making policy changes in several areas, including trade, taxes, government spending, immigration and regulation, and added that the \"net effect\" of those changes are what will matter for the economy and the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"While there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high,\" Powell said at a conference in New York. \"As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\"",
      "Most economists say that Trump's plans to slap tariffs on a wide array of imports, including 25% duties on goods from Canada and Mexico that he partially delayed Thursday, will push up prices and slow growth. But many also expect that tax cuts and deregulation could boost the economy.",
      "Powell's comments pushed some traders to pare back their forecasts for how many interest rate cuts the Fed may deliver this year. They had been banking on at least three following a stream of weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy. But Powell reiterated the Fed is likely on hold for a while. That sent Treasury yields higher in the bond market.",
      "Rate reductions could help bring down borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, and business loans.",
      "President Trump in January pressed the Fed to ease borrowing costs, saying in a speech at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland that he planned to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\"",
      "Inflation expectations are key",
      "In a question and answer session, Powell acknowledged that typically tariffs would cause a \"one-time\" price increase, rather than persistent inflation, and the Fed could ignore such a temporary effect. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday made a similar argument: \"We could get a one-time price adjustment,\" Bessent said, before adding, \"I'm not worried about inflation.\"",
      "Yet Powell also said there were other considerations the Fed has to take into account when deciding whether to keep its rate unchanged, or even raise rates. For example, Powell suggested tariffs might have more than just a one-time impact \"if it turns into a series\" of tariff hikes, or \"if the increases are larger, that would matter.\"",
      "\"What really does matter is what is happening with long-term inflation expectations,\" Powell added. Powell noted that shorter-term expectations have risen, partly out of concern about tariffs, though longer-term expectations have been stable.",
      "Expectations that prices will rise can worsen inflation if they cause consumers and businesses to change their behavior in anticipation. Some companies might charge more when they expect their own costs to increase.",
      "When Trump imposed tariffs in his last administration, Powell noted, the Fed ended up reducing its key rate, \"because growth weakened so much.\"",
      "Economists with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley this week forecast that inflation is likely to edge up in 2025, citing the potential impact of tariffs and other Trump administration policies.",
      "\"Larger tariffs are also likely to hit GDP harder through their tax-like effect on disposable income and consumer spending and their effect on financial conditions and uncertainty for businesses,\" Goldman analysts wrote in a report.",
      "The cost of food, shelter and other items remains a top economic issue around the U.S., with the\u00a0soaring cost of eggs\u00a0becoming a national talking point. A recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0found that 77% of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping up with the pace of inflation.",
      "Powell says economy remains solid",
      "Powell said the economy remains mostly healthy despite \"elevated uncertainty.\" He characterized Friday's jobs report, which showed employers added 151,000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%, as in line with the \"solid\" gains of the past six months.",
      "He also noted that there were signs consumer spending has slowed compared with the healthy gains in the second half of last year, and said surveys of consumers and businesses \"point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.\" Further complicating matters, he acknowledged that measures of consumer sentiment \"have not been a good predictor\" of consumer spending in recent years.",
      "The Fed's own beige book, a collection of anecdotes from hundreds of businesses, mentioned uncertainty 47 times in its latest edition released Wednesday, up from just 17 times in January. The Fed publishes the beige book eight times a year.",
      "Powell spoke at a conference organized by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.",
      "President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policy and rapid-fire layoffs of government workers has created a spike in uncertainty among businesses and caused a sharp drop in consumer confidence. Many economists have marked down their estimates for the economy's growth to as low as 1% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from 2.3% in last year's final quarter.",
      "Yet as Fed governor Christopher Waller noted Thursday, there are \"good news\" cuts and \"bad news\" cuts. \"Bad news\" cuts occur if the Fed reduces rates out of concern that the economy is slowing, while \"good news\" reductions are those that reflect a sense by the Fed that inflation is returning to its target of 2%.",
      "Waller added that he still believes it will be possible for the Fed to engineer \"good news\" rate cuts later this year, though he dismissed the potential for a cut at the Fed's next meeting this month.",
      "After cutting its key rate three times last year to about 4.3%, Powell indicated in January that the Fed would pause any further cuts amid signs that inflation has remained stuck above its target. The central bank's preferred inflation gauge shows that prices rose 2.5% in January compared with a year ago. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.6%, the smallest increase since June.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 15:52:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts say you could save thousands of dollars by buying a car now, versus later in 2025 if tariffs are enacted.",
    "story": [
      "Buying a car can be a fraught financial decision even in the best of times. Now, car shoppers are facing the added pressure of deciphering U.S. tariff policy.",
      "On Wednesday, President Trump issued a one-month delay for U.S. automakers on tariffs placed on imports from Canada and Mexico, trading partners that provide many of the car makers' vehicle parts and components. If the 25% levies are enacted, auto manufacturers will face higher costs and are likely to\u00a0pass on some of those price hikes to consumers, industry players say.",
      "The upshot, according to experts, is that consumers who are thinking of buying a car in the next year may want to consider buying a car sooner in 2025 rather than later. If the tariffs eventually take effect, car prices could rise by between $2,000 and $12,200 for some models, according to a recent estimate from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it, will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them,\" AEG CEO Patrick Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The timing of the tariffs remain uncertain, and it's possible that Mr. Trump could further delay the import duties on Canada and Mexico, while the U.S. could also shelve the trade measures if the sides reach agreement. Even if the tariffs are ultimately deployed in April, it's unclear how long they might remain in place, which adds to the uncertainty surrounding the import duties, according to Morningstar equity strategist David Whiston.",
      "Spreading the costs",
      "While certain car models source a greater share of their components from Canada and Mexico than others, automakers are expected to spread any added costs they incur across their vehicle lineups.",
      "\"If the tariffs are here, and permanent, by the time we get to summer we'd expect to see higher prices everywhere,\" Tyson Jominy, vice president of analytics at J.D. Power, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That means even U.S.-sourced and assembled vehicles with components that aren't subject to tariffs could see moderate price hikes.",
      "\"If we are talking about 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, prices will go up, and we are expecting most automakers to peanut-butter spread the impact across their entire portfolio, even if the vehicle is built in the U.S.,\" Jominy explained. \"The reality is that every automaker, regardless of where they final assemble, is likely to be affected if these parts tariffs go into effect.\"",
      "Automakers are likely to be strategic about how they implement price hikes in order to mitigate the effect on sales, experts say.",
      "\"Automakers will smooth costs out across their vehicle lineups,\" Edmunds head of insights Jessica Caldwell told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They won't increase one model's price by 40%. They'll figure out ways to spread out the costs in a way that doesn't harm profitability as much, and doesn't kill sales at the same time.\"",
      "When could car prices rise?",
      "Although vehicle prices wouldn't skyrocket overnight if the Canada and Mexico tariffs kick in, they could start to rise by summer, industry analysts say. That means car buyers should seriously consider starting their search now.",
      "Manufacturers with more inventory in stock could push off price hikes for some time, whereas those that are running low could be forced to incorporate them into sales prices earlier. Jominy said the range could be a few weeks to \"many months\" from the time tariffs take effect.",
      "\"If you think you'll need a car within the next several months, you should probably get into the market sooner rather than later,\" Jominy said.",
      "That doesn't mean buying on impulse, and experts urge consumers to do their homework before signing on the dotted line for what is, after all, a major financial decision for most people.",
      "\"But if you're planning to be in market the first half of year, it probably makes sense to speed up what you can and make sure you're ready to go,\" he said.",
      "What about used cars?",
      "When new vehicle prices rise, some buyers turn to the used car market, which in turn can drive up costs in that segment.",
      "\"If something comes to pass on tariffs, we'd expected higher prices on both new and used vehicles,\" Jominy said.",
      "Demand for cars \u2014 and other products impacted by tariffs \u2014 may be pulled forward, experts say. \"Because we don't know what's doing to happen, I would be buying everything that I needed that's an appliance that could have content coming from Canada or Mexico,\" Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's a little bit like eating your lunch at recess. You get the same amount of food \u2014 you just get it earlier,\" he added.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs more than once already, it's unclear if and when auto tariffs will hit. But Robert Handfield, professor of supply chain management at North Carolina State University, said for the risk-averse, buying an automobile now versus later in the year is a wise move.",
      "\"He postponed the tariffs for a month to give automakers a little breathing room,\" he said. \"I think it's a good idea to buy now. You'd be able to get in under the wire and save around $4,000 for a regular sedan or up to $10,000 to $12,000 for a truck, which are significant savings.\"",
      "Even if the tariffs never come to fruition, consumers wishing to play it safe can't go wrong by making purchases now, according to Edmunds' Caldwell.",
      "\"Some people don't have the finances to get it wrong. We are stretched thin financially as a country and new vehicle prices aren't cheap, so I can see a lot of people don't want to take the risk,\" she said. \"Sure, it might not happen. But what if it does? Now you're paying how much more that you can't afford.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security said Friday it is ending the collective bargaining agreement with the union representing thousands of frontline workers with the Transportation Security Administration, a decision the TSA union called an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
      "In announcing the decision, DHS criticized the union \u2014 which represents worker responsible for screening airline passengers \u2014 claiming TSA employs more people working full-time on union issues than those \"performing screening functions at 86% of our airports.\"",
      "\"This action will ensure Americans will have more effective and modernized workforces across the nation's transportation networks,\" Homeland Security said in a statement. \"TSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.\"",
      "The decision to end collective bargaining was criticized by the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing flight attendants, and Democratic lawmakers, with both claiming that the action will make flying less safe. DHS's decision comes after the agency last year pushed to boost TSA workers' pay, which has historically lagged that of other government employees.",
      "In May 2024, the TSA administrator at the time, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement and credited\u00a0pay increases\u00a0that went into effect in 2023 for helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",
      "\"Attempting to negate [TSA workers'] legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2013 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, in a statement on Friday.",
      "In the announcement, DHS said poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \"to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from Thompson and the union.",
      "The decision is \"terrible for aviation security and everyone who depends on safe travel,\" the Association of Flight Attendants said. The group added, \"This will take us back to the days of security at the lowest price with the highest costs for our country.\"",
      "Impact on 47,000 TSA workers",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the TSA workers, said in a statement that the order would strip collective bargaining rights from roughly 47,000 transportation security officers, or TSOs. Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",
      "The union said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump's administration were violating the right of staffers to join a union. It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \"completely fabricated.\"",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers.",
      "AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\"Our union has been out in front challenging this administration's unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \"Now our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\"",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers' collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration's \"vision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\"",
      "\"By removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\" Stahl wrote. \"This determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\"",
      "Stahl said the agency \"will establish alternative procedures\" to address employee concerns and grievances \"in a fair and transparent manner.\"",
      "\"Anti-union talking points\"",
      "Rep. Thompson criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \"flat out wrong anti-union talking points.\" He said the real aim was \"diminishing\" the workforce so \"they can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\"",
      "\"Attempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" Thompson said. \"Since the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA's attrition rates have plummeted.\"",

The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",

      "Koppal is about 217 miles from Bengaluru, India's startup and technology powerhouse.",

      "Sexual assaults on women have become familiar in India, where police recorded 31,516 rape cases in 2022, a 20% increase from 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. That's an average of about 90 rapes per day, CBS News previously reported, and the real figure is believed to be far higher due to the stigma surrounding sexual violence and victims' lack of faith in police.",
      "Rape and sexual violence have been under the spotlight since the brutal 2012 gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus. The attack galvanized massive protests and inspired lawmakers to order the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases and stiffen penalties.",
      "The rape law was amended in 2013, criminalizing stalking and voyeurism and lowering the age at which a person can be tried as an adult from 18 to 16. The government in 2018 approved the death penalty for people convicted of raping children under age 12.",

      "The ceasefire that began in mid-January brought a pause in Israel's campaign of bombardment and ground offensives in Gaza aimed at destroying Hamas after its oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel. The ceasefire's first phase saw the release of 25 Israeli hostages held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza and the bodies of eight others in exchange for the freeing of nearly 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel.",

      "The decision to withhold intelligence and military aid came on the heels of a tempestuous White House visit last week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Without U.S. satellite imagery, Ukraine's ability to strike inside Russia and defend itself from bombardment is significantly diminished.",

      "\"Last night, the Russian army fired two ballistic missiles at the center of Dobropillya,\" he said. \"After emergency services arrived at the scene, they launched another strike, deliberately targeting rescuers.

      "South Korea's impeached conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol was released from prison on Saturday, a day after a Seoul court canceled his arrest to allow him to stand trial for rebellion without being detained.",
      "After walking out of a detention center near Seoul, Yoon waved, clenched his fists and bowed deeply to his supporters who were shouting his name and waving South Korean and U.S. flags. Yoon climbed into a black van headed to his presidential residence in Seoul.",
      "In a statement distributed by his lawyers, Yoon said that he \"appreciates the courage and decision by the Seoul Central District Court to correct illegality,\" in an apparent reference to legal disputes over his arrest. He said he also thanks his supporters and asked those who are on hunger strike against his impeachment to end it.",
      "Yoon was arrested and indicted by prosecutors in January over his Dec. 3 martial law decree that plunged the country into huge political turmoil. The liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly separately voted to impeach him, leading to his suspension from office.",
      "The Constitutional Court has been deliberating whether to formally dismiss or reinstate Yoon. If the court upholds his impeachment, a national election will be held to find his successor within two months.",
      "The Seoul Central District Court said Friday it accepted Yoon's request to be released from prison, citing the need to address questions over the legality of the investigations on the president. Yoon's lawyers have accused the investigative agency that detained him before his formal arrest of lacking legal authority to probe rebellion charges.",
      "The Seoul court also said the legal period of his formal arrest expired before he was indicted.",
      "Yoon's release came after prosecutors decided not to appeal the decision by the Seoul court. South Korean law allows prosecutors to continue to hold a suspect while pursuing an appeal, even after his or her arrest is canceled by a court.",
      "The main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which led Yoon's Dec. 14 impeachment, lashed out at the prosecutors' decision, calling them \"henchmen\" of Yoon, a former prosecutor general. Party spokesperson Cho Seung-rae urged the Constitutional Court to dismiss Yoon as soon as possible to avoid further public unrest and anxiety.",
      "At the heart of public criticism of Yoon over his martial law decree was his dispatch of hundreds of troops and police officers to the National Assembly after placing the country under military rule. Some senior military and police officials sent to the assembly have testified that Yoon ordered them to pull out lawmakers to thwart a parliamentary vote on the decree. Yoon has countered that he aimed to maintain order.",
      "Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter an assembly hall and voted unanimously to overturn Yoon's decree.",
      "Investigators have alleged Yoon's martial-law decree amounted to rebellion. If he's convicted of that offense, he would face the death penalty or life imprisonment. Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions but that doesn't cover grave charges like rebellion and treason.",
      "Yoon has said he didn't intend to maintain martial law for long as he only attempted to inform the public of the danger of the Democratic Party, which obstructed his agenda and impeached many senior officials and prosecutors. In his martial law announcement, Yoon called the assembly \"a den of criminals\" and \"anti-state forces.\"",
      "South Korea's conservative-liberal divide is severe, and rallies either supporting or denouncing Yoon's impeachment have divided Seoul streets. Experts say whatever decision the Constitutional Court makes, the division is certain to worsen.",

      "State Department staff were taken aback this week by a department directive instructing embassies and consulates to stop publishing air quality monitoring data.",
      "CBS News has reviewed the message that was sent to staff on March 4, which says \"currently there is no anticipated date for real-time data to be available.\" Embassy staff and their families relied on the reports to alert them to poor air quality days.",
      "\"I was shocked by the announcement,\" said a current staffer, who asked to remain anonymous due to concerns about their job, and who said the decision doesn't make much sense as the existing infrastructure to monitor air quality is already in place and operational. \"I don't see any purpose in turning off this data, it doesn't make any sense,\" said another department employee.",
      "A State Department spokesman told CBS News in a statement that the air quality monitors are running, but the effort to transmit air pollution data from embassies and consulates is no longer happening \"due to funding constraints that have caused the Department to turn off the underlying network.\" When asked what it costs to operate the program, the State Department did not provide an answer.",
      "\"The cost to maintain these systems is trivial,\" said Rick Duke, who served as the deputy special envoy for climate at the State Department until January and believes this isn't about saving money as much as it's driven by misplaced anti-climate ideology in the Trump administration. \"These monitors aren't even about climate,\" said Duke, \"Why take away health information from embassy staff and the public?\"",
      "Air monitoring at U.S. embassies began informally in 2008 when a single monitor was placed at the embassy in Beijing, China. The results were posted hourly on Twitter, informing the public about levels of air pollution in the city. The account called\u00a0AirBeijing became internet-famous in 2010 when it tweeted that the air on Nov. 11 was \"Crazy Bad\" when the machine registered dangerously high levels of air pollution.",
      "The purpose behind the monitoring was to inform U.S. citizens living in the region about the state of the city's air, but the Chinese public quickly picked up the information and began demanding their government address the toxic pollution that local officials often downplayed.",
      "The State Department expanded air monitoring at other embassies around the world, installing 78 monitors elsewhere, and made the data available on AirNow.gov. A 2022 scientific study found that the embassy program was highly successful in reducing air pollutants, \"resulting in substantial decreases in the premature mortality risk faced by the over 300 million people living in cities home to a US embassy monitor.\"",
      "But now that the program is terminated, the webpage for embassy data only produces an error message. The last available reading in Beijing was posted on March 4, the day the agency stopped transmitting data.",
      "Current State Department staff told CBS News that access to air quality data is key when weighing overseas assignments, especially for those who must move their entire family and children to places with unhealthy air, or in locations where air monitoring by local governments is unreliable or non-existent.",
      "\"Robbing employees of the information they need for the health decisions of their children is immoral,\" said a current staffer, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.",
      "A State Department spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that the air data continues to be collected and \"will be made available when there is a secure and reliable way to transmit it.\" They said the department is \"evaluating other transmission options.\"",
      "The spokesperson also said the air quality monitoring equipment \"is only one of a number of tools the Department uses to ensure the health and safety of our staff.\"",

      "Level 3: Reconsider travel",

      "Level 1 is the lowest advisory and indicates there is some risk in any international travel. Level 2 means there are \"heightened risks to safety and security,\" which could apply to specific areas of the country.",
      "Level 3 advises Americans to reconsider traveling to the nation because of \"serious risks to safety and security.\" Level 4 is the highest advisory level indicating there is a \"greater likelihood of life-threatening risks.\" The department advises Americans to write a will and leave DNA samples if they decide to travel to a Level 4 nation in preparation for possible worst-case scenarios.",
      "Some nations could have multiple levels, with parts of the country more of a concern. For example, the advisory for Mexico, as of March 7, has specific levels for each state within the country, ranging from Level 1 to Level 4.",
      "In each advisory, the State Department explains the factors contributing to the level designation, identifies possible areas of more risk and gives advice on what to do if you decide to travel to that country.",
      "Examples of countries with each travel advisory level",
      "Here are examples of countries in each advisory level, as of March 7:",
      "Level 1: Canada, Australia, Ireland, Portugal, Argentina and multiple Caribbean islands, including Aruba and St. Lucia, are among the Level 1 countries.",
      "Level 2: Popular European destinations, including France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and Germany, have Level 2 advisories. Other examples are mainland China, South Africa, Morocco, Peru and The Bahamas.",
      "Level 3: Countries with Level 3 advisories include Colombia, Egypt, Guatemala and Jamaica. Most of the Level 3 nations include specific higher risk areas that the State Department says to avoid.",
      "Level 4: The State Department has designated more than a dozen nations as Level 4, advising Americans not to travel to them. They include Russia and Ukraine due to Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Others at Level 4 include Syria, Iraq, Sudan and South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Venezuela and Haiti.",

He made the announcement in an interview with Fox Business News, which Fox said was recorded this week. In the interview, Mr. Trump said he sent the letter \"yesterday,\" but the exact timing remained unclear.",
      "\"I would rather negotiate a deal. I'm not sure that everybody agrees with me, but we can make a deal that would be just as good as if you won militarily,\" Mr. Trump said in a clip from the interview, which was shared by the network ahead of its full airing this weekend, Fox said.",
      "\"But the time is happening now. The time is coming up,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Something's going to happen one way or the other. I hope that Iran \u2014 and I've written him a letter, saying, 'I hope you're going to negotiate.' Because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing \u2014 for them.\"",
      "In the interview, Mr. Trump said he believed Iran wanted \"to get that letter,\" adding that \"the other alternative is, we have to do something. Because you can't let them have a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "Iran's state-run media said Friday that no letter had been received from Mr. Trump, and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told the French news agency AFP on Friday that Iran would not negotiate with the U.S. while heavy U.S. sanctions against the country remain in place.",
      "A\u00a0report last month\u00a0by the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Iran had \"significantly increased production and accumulation of high enriched uranium,\" marking a progression in the country's nuclear program since Mr. Trump was reelected.",

Mr. Trump imposed a wide range of new sanctions on Iran at the time, calling it a policy of \"maximum pressure\" to force Tehran to broker a new deal. That policy has decimated Iran's economy, but there have been no new negotiations between the two sides acknowledged publicly since.",
      "Under the original nuclear deal, Iran was permitted to enrich uranium up to 3.67% purity and maintain a stockpile of no more than 661 pounds at that level. At that purity, uranium can be used for medical, research and other civilian purposes, but not to build a nuclear weapon.",
      "The most recent IAEA report found Iran was enriching more uranium to 60% purity \u2014 much closer to the level required for weapons, which is about 90%, and a level at which it was only confirmed to have started enriching after Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear agreement. Its stockpile of that highly enriched uranium had risen as of February to about 606 pounds, according to the IAEA report.",
      "Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for entirely peaceful purposes, as tension has continued to rise with the U.S. over its sanctions, and with Israel over its war against the Iranian-backed, U.S.-designated terrorist group Hamas.",

      "President Trump suggested Thursday that members of the U.S.-led NATO transatlantic military alliance would not come to the aid of the U.S., should America come under attack. NATO members are bound to back each other militarily in the face of any aggression under the collective defense clause in the alliance's founding treaty.",

      "A core foundation upon which the nearly 80-year-old alliance is built is Article 5 of the NATO founding treaty. Under that article, should any NATO nation become the victim of an armed attack, the other members will consider it as an attack against all members and will \"take the actions it deems necessary\" to assist.",
      "Article 5 has only been invoked once in NATO's history, and that was on Sept. 12, 2001, one day after Al-Qaeda killed almost 3,000 people in its unprecedented terrorist attack on Washington and New York.",
      "In the U.S.-led invasions that followed in Iraq and Afghanistan, America's NATO allies cumulatively lost well over 1,000 troops in combat over a 20 year period. Britain alone lost 642 members of its armed forces.",

      "The president has long argued that the U.S. carries an undue burden, spending more to help ensure Europe's defense than the NATO members on the continent, and he's pushing now for those members to boost their domestic defense spending to at least 5% of their respective GDPs.",
      "\"I said if you're not going to pay, we're not going to defend\u2026 if you're not going to pay your bills, we're not going to defend you,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The 5% defense spending Mr. Trump has demanded of America's NATO allies is a significantly higher proportion than what the U.S. pays. The U.S. currently allocates about 3% of its GDP to defense annually, one of the higher amounts relative to other NATO nations, but not the highest.",
      "According to data compiled by the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, the highest spender, relative to its GDP, is Poland, which shares a long border with Ukraine. Then, after the U.S., come Greece and a number of NATO nations right on the eastern edge of democratic Europe, closest to Ukraine and, beyond it, Russia, along with the Nordic states.",
      "Over the past decade, European NATO members and Canada have steadily increased their collective spending on defense from 1.43% of their combined GDP in 2014, to 2.02% in 2024, according to figures posted on NATO's website \u2014 but many individual member states are still falling well short of the 5% mark that Mr. Trump has called for. Some have yet to even meet the 2% of GDP spending threshold currently set as a target by the alliance.",

      "\"I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers for my health from the square,\" Francis said in the message played out to those who have been praying for him in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican.",
      "That Francis was able to speak to record the message was an encouraging sign, but his frailty could be heard in the recording. Francis' voice sounded weak and breathless.",
      "The pope was admitted on February 14 with a bad case of bronchitis that devolved into bilateral pneumonia, or pneumonia in both lungs. It would be a serious prognosis for anyone, but especially for someone of the pope's age \u2014 and even more so for a man who had part of one lung removed due to a respiratory infection as a young man in his home country of Argentina.",
      "In a clear setback, the Vatican said Francis suffered two episodes of acute respiratory failure on Monday. At one point, doctors had to intervene by aspirating mucus from his airways. He's been alternating between high-flow oxygen and mechanical ventilation since then and, according to the Vatican's twice-daily updates, resting well.",
      "Francis has been adamant about sharing an unprecedented level of detail when it comes to his health, going against centuries of secrecy surrounding pontiffs as they near the end of their lives \u2014 as well as the old Italian adage that \"a pope is always well until he dies.\"",

Senator Natasha Akpoti Uduaghan accused the legislative body's president, Godswill Akpabio, of making unwanted advances toward her in an interview with Nigerian media last week and filed a petition against him.",

      "Seoul, South Korea \u2014 South Korea suspended the training flights of air force aircraft and all live-fire drills following its fighter jets' accidental bombing of a civilian area, officials said Friday, posing a potential setback to its upcoming annual military training with the United States.",
      "On Thursday, two South Korean KF-16 fighter jets mistakenly released four MK-82 bombs each on a civilian area in Pocheon, a city near the tense border with North Korea. The bombing, which injured nearly 30 people, two of them seriously, occurred when South Korean and U.S. forces were engaging in a live-fire drill in connection with their broader Freedom Shield command post exercise set to begin Monday.",
      "This year's Freedom Shield exercise is the allies' first major joint training since President Trump returned to office in January and comes amid concerns about North Korea's booming military cooperation with Russia.",
      "South Korea and the U.S. announced details of the exercises on Thursday, but that was overshadowed by the news of bombing, which drew intense public criticism in South Korea.",
      "Both the South Korean and U.S. militaries halted all live-fire exercises across South Korea. Military officials said South Korea's air force also stopped the flights of all its aircraft except surveillance planes and others needed for emergency situations.",
      "Military officials said the Freedom Shield training will proceed as scheduled and they plan to restart live-fire and flight training after they find the exact cause of the bombing and formulate preventative steps.",
      "But if they fail to resume the paused training by Monday, when they kick off the Freedom Shield exercise with the U.S. military, that would hurt the workings of the early parts of the exercise, observers say.",
      "Possible issues with U.S.-South Korean joint exercises",
      "Lee Illwoo, an expert with the Korea Defense Network in South Korea, said the suspension of flight training would particularly cause \"really a big problem in examining the two countries' operational plans.\" He said flying warplanes would be essential to determining their actual capabilities, discussing the size of reinforcements of U.S. aircraft from abroad and modifying the allies' operational plans.",
      "Initial investigations found the pilot of one of the KF-16s entered wrong coordinates for a bombing site. Officials said the pilots of the two jets had more than 200-400 hours of flying time. But Lee said they likely piloted KF-16s only two to three years.",
      "The South Korean and U.S. militaries have already begun field exercises in connection with the Freedom Shield, and Thursday's live-fire drill was one of them. Col. Ryan Donald, spokesperson for the U.S. military in South Korea, confirmed that American servicemembers were participating in Thursday's live-fire training but said no U.S. air force aircraft were still involved.",
      "\"We take this incident very seriously. We are coordinating closely with the ROK Ministry of Defense and are committed to a thorough and transparent investigation,\" Donald said in a statement, using the acronym of South Korea's official name, the Republic of Korea.",
      "The incident happened as North Korea was ramping up its fiery rhetoric against the U.S. and South Korea, as it views their joint drills as invasion rehearsals. North Korea's state news agency warned Friday that the U.S. and South Korea \"will have to pay dearly for their stupid and reckless war drills.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said he would reach out to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un again to revive diplomacy, but Pyongyang hasn't responded to any overtures he might have made.",

      "The decision by the Seoul Central District Court would allow Yoon to stand trial while not being physically detained. The hearings in his separate impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court concluded in late February and the court is expected to rule soon on whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him.",
      "The Seoul Central District Court said it accepted Yoon's request to be released from jail because the legal period of his formal arrest expired before he was indicted in late January. The court said the investigative agency that detained Yoon before his formal arrest didn't have legal rights to investigate the criminal rebellion charges.",
      "Yoon's defense team welcomed the court's decision and urged prosecutors to release him immediately. The presidential office also welcomed the court's decision, saying it hopes Yoon will swiftly return to work.",
      "However, South Korea law allows prosecutors to hold a suspect temporarily while they pursue an appeal.",
      "Yoon's lawyer, Seok Dong-hyeon, told Agence France-Presse Yoon \"will be released only if the prosecutor waives the right to appeal or does not file an appeal within the prescribed period.\"",
      "Prosecutors didn't immediately respond when AFP requested a comment.",
      "Investigators have alleged that the martial-law decree amounted to rebellion. If he's convicted of that offense, he would face the death penalty or life imprisonment.",
      "Yoon's martial law decree, which involved the dispatch of troops and police forces to the National Assembly, evoked traumatic memories of past military rules among many South Koreans. The decree lasted only six hours as enough lawmakers managed to get into an assembly hall to allow a vote and then voted unanimously to overturn it.",
      "Yoon later argued his decree was only meant to inform the people of the danger of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which undermined his agenda and impeached top officials, and said he dispatched troops to the assembly only in order to maintain order. But some top military and police officers sent to the assembly have told Constitutional Court hearings or investigators that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to obstruct a vote on his decree or detain politicians.",
      "If the Constitutional Court upholds Yoon's impeachment, he would be officially thrown out of office and a national election would be held to choose his successor within two months.",
      "Massive rallies by opponents and supporters of Yoon have filled the streets of Seoul and other major South Korean cities. Whatever the Constitutional Court decides, experts say it will likely further polarize the country and intensify its conservative-liberal divide.",
      "Yoon is the first South Korean president to be arrested while in office. South Korean law gives a president immunity from most criminal prosecution, but not for grave charges like rebellion or treason.",
      "By law, a president in South Korea has the power to put the country under martial law in wartime and similar emergency situations, but many experts say South Korea wasn't in such conditions when Yoon declared martial law.",

      "\"She appears totally self-consumed and tone deaf,\" Schofield added. \"You're standing next to Mindy Kaling, and you're not asking her how she built her girl boss empire? Why?\"",
      "After rising to fame when she starred in the hit NBC sitcom \"The Office,\" Kaling, 45, founded her production company, Kaling International, in 2012. Through Kaling International, Kaling has created and produced a number of successful television series, including \"The Mindy Project,\" \"Never Have I Ever\" and \"The Sex Lives of College Girls.\"",
      "Kaling is the creator and showrunner of her company's most recent project, Netflix's TV show \"Running Point,\" which stars Kate Hudson. The sports comedy premiered on the streaming platform Feb. 27 and debuted at No. 3 on Netflix's Top 10 Shows in the U.S.",
      "The six-time Emmy Award winner joined Markle in the second episode of \"With Love, Meghan\" during which they teamed up to host a children's garden tea party. According to Markle, the two have been \"email pen pals\" since Kaling appeared on her \"Archetypes\" podcast in 2022.",

      "Royal expert Kinsey Schofield suggested Markle should \"elevate\" the guests on the show rather than \"hijacking all the oxygen in the room.\" (Netflix)",
      "\"It\u2019s so funny, too, that you keep saying Meghan Markle,\" Markle said. \"You know I\u2019m Sussex now.\"",
      "Schofield noted how the viral exchange highlighted points that other reviewers made in their criticism of \"With Love, Meghan.\" The show, which Markle chose to film at a rented estate in Montecito, California, instead of her own home nearby, has been critiqued for lacking authenticity.",
      "\"Meghan lacks humility or an ounce of authenticity.\" Schofield said. \"It\u2019s a blatantly obvious PR exercise that does not give us a glimpse of Meghan\u2019s real world. She\u2019s doing random arts and crafts in someone else's house with people she claims are her very best friends but doesn\u2019t know that they\u2019re left-handed or allergic to peanut butter? Your \u2018girl\u2019 Mindy doesn\u2019t know your last name is Sussex?",
      "\"It\u2019s such a painful farce,\" Schofield added. \"Her 'hacks' are common knowledge, and her definition of 'elevating' equals wasting 60 pounds of fruit and tracing lines on your paper menu with a pencil so you can erase them later.\"",
      "Markle and Kaling had an awkward exchange on the show that later went viral. (Netflix)",
      "Royal photographer Helena Chard agreed that Markle's show would have had more resonance with audiences if she had used the opportunity to authentically connect with her guests and showcase her real personality.",
      "\"As far as I see, Meghan lacks charisma and connection with her guests and audience,\" Chard told Fox News Digital. \"Her guests, however, glorify Meghan, putting her on a pedestal.

      "Chard pointed out that audiences in the United Kingdom may not be familiar with some of the guests on \"With Love, Meghan\" and \"to find out more about them would add a special touch.\"",
      "The royal expert described Markle's cooking and hosting tips and tricks as \"unoriginal and basic.\"",
      "\"The production sadly feels bland, staged and stilted,\" Chard added. \"Netflix [has] shot a glossy production focusing on Meghan. The hope is the series will show Meghan in a new light, rehabilitate her image and change public perception.",
      "\"The truth is people want to see more raw fun moments, not staged aspirational content,\" she explained. \"A fun, authentic personality full of heart resonates far more with the public and would give Meghan far more kudos.\"",
      "\"With Love, Meghan\" has been criticized for lacking authenticity. (Netflix)",
      "\"With Love, Meghan\" was originally scheduled to be released in January, but its debut was delayed due to the Los Angeles fires.

Harry and Meghan made brief appearances in the docuseries when the duke competed in a charity polo match.",
      "\"Polo\" was also met with mostly negative reviews after its release. Royal expert Hilary Fordwich drew comparisons between \"Polo\" and \"With Love, Meghan,\" telling Fox News Digital the shows were poorly received for similar reasons.",

      "\"Most unfortunately, just like Harry\u2019s Netflix flop \u2018Polo\u2019, amongst the plethora of reasons why ratings are so low and critics have savaged [Markle]\u2019s is due to lack of authenticity, being a tone-deaf portrayal of privileged self-important people,\" Fordwich said.",
      "\"Neither Netflix show has resonated with audiences. Both have been universally derided,\" she added.",
      "Fordwich cited the shows' low ranking scores from users on IMDb, where \"Polo\" holds an audience score of three out of 10 and \"With Love, Meghan\" notched a score of 2.7 out of 10.",
      "\"Both sets of low ratings are devastating as Netflix doesn\u2019t invest to reap such lackluster ratings,\" Fordwich said.",
      "Fordwich referred to an Instagram post Markle shared to promote \"With Love, Meghan\" ahead of its release. On Tuesday, Markle uploaded a carousel of images taken during the show's production, writing \"Today is the day! A few BTS snaps + food pictures I took on set for \u2018With Love, Meghan.\u2019 Come join the party on @netflix!\"",

After playing the first side of the record, Parton asked if Nash wanted to hear the second side. After Nash agreed, Parton told her, \"Well, before that,\" she said, \"Carl is here \u2014 he\u2019s working outside \u2014 and I want him to come in and fix the fire.

      "Nash recalled that Dean was initially reluctant to join the two, writing that she overheard him tell Parton \"I don\u2019t want to do no interviews.\" After being reassured by Parton, Dean entered the living room and Nash caught her first glimpse of the singer's elusive spouse. Nash described him as appearing \"shy and uncomfortable in the presence of a stranger.\"",
      "\"He loves me good and all, but I\u2019m really not his favorite singer.\"",
      "However, she noted that Dean was \"friendly and polite\" when he was introduced to her. As Dean tended to the fire, Nash observed that he was \"ruggedly handsome\" and \"looked at his wife as if she were the only woman in the world.\"",

      "In Nash's essay, she recalled that Dean excused himself from joining them for dinner since he had a cold. However, he continued to return to the living room from time to time to fix the fire as Parton and Nash talked late into the evening.",

      "She continued, \"With each successive visit, he was more at ease, more likable and charming. At one point, he asked me if I\u2019d gone to school for journalism. I told him I had, in New York City. He then, in an offhand way, began asking me about New York politicians.

      "Previous research published in the International Journal of Epidemiology has shown that vitamin A, in conjunction with the measles vaccine, can be an effective intervention in preventing measles mortality in children.",

They wouldn't see things like your ID number, address or actual date of birth, simplifying the process for you and the worker and preventing your personal info from being copied.",

However, the TSA does accept digital IDs with digital ID readers at\u00a0several airports, and a few concert venues have begun accepting digital IDs.

While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "7. Don\u2019t respond to texts/calls from unknown sources: Whatever you do, don\u2019t respond to texts/calls from unknown sources whatsoever.",

      "What is vishing?",
      "Vishing, short for \"voice phishing,\" is a type of cybercrime that uses phone calls to deceive individuals into revealing personal or financial information. Unlike\u00a0traditional phishing, which relies on emails or text messages, vishing leverages the power of human voice and social engineering to manipulate victims. Scammers often impersonate legitimate organizations, such as banks, tech companies, or government agencies, to gain trust and create a sense of urgency. They may ask for passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive details, which they then use for fraudulent purposes.",

      "Scammers start by identifying potential victims through social media, public transaction records, leaked databases, and more. Once they select a target, they gather personal details (email, phone number, financial holdings) to build credibility. And you could easily be a target. That\u2019s because\u00a0data brokers \u2013 companies that buy and sell your personal information \u2013 are goldmines for scammers.

I strongly suggest you remove your personal info from people search sites online. If you give someone your email or phone number, they might be able to find your home address through a reverse search.\u00a0While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "7. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Install and regularly update strong antivirus software to protect your devices from malware, viruses and other cyber threats. Antivirus software provides real-time protection, scans for malicious files and helps prevent infections by blocking access to harmful websites and downloads.

Protecting ourselves requires constant awareness, skepticism towards unsolicited communications, and proactive measures to safeguard our personal information. While the tactics may evolve, the underlying principle remains the same: scammers rely on deception to exploit our vulnerabilities.

However, the fact that hackers had access for months without detection points to serious gaps in the company\u2019s monitoring systems.

      "2) Enroll in credit monitoring: DISA is offering affected individuals 12 months of free credit monitoring and identity restoration services through Experian. Take advantage of this by enrolling before the June 30 deadline to keep tabs on your credit and detect potential misuse early.",
      "3) Place a fraud alert or credit freeze: Contact one of the major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) to place a fraud alert on your file, which makes it harder for thieves to open accounts in your name. For stronger protection, consider a credit freeze, which restricts access to your credit report entirely.",
      "4) Be wary of phishing attempts and install strong antivirus: With personal details in the hands of cybercriminals, expect an uptick in targeted scams. Avoid clicking links or sharing information in unsolicited emails, texts or calls claiming to be from DISA or related entities.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Invest in data removal services:\u00a0In light of these recurring data breaches, taking proactive steps to protect your personal information is crucial. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The DISA Global Solutions data breach isn\u2019t just an apparent mistake. It seems to be a complete failure. A company that handles sensitive data for millions, including Fortune 500 clients, let hackers lurk in its systems for more than two months. Worse, it took 10 months to tell the public. Now, 3.3 million people are left dealing with the fallout while DISA offers a token year of credit monitoring. The real cost is years of potential identity theft and financial damage.",

      "1) Beware of fake software updates: One of the most common infection methods is through deceptive browser update prompts. Never download updates from pop-ups or random websites. Instead, always update your software directly from official sources, such as the App Store or the application\u2019s official website. If in doubt, check out my\u00a0detailed guide on how to keep your device and software updated.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method, such as a one-time code sent to your phone. Use 2FA for all critical accounts, including email, banking and cloud services.",
      "3) Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "4)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links. Use a strong antivirus: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Your personal information is easy to find online",
      "You may wonder, \"How did they get my number in the first place? And if they have it, who else has?\" You\u2019re right. Anyone can easily find your phone number, name, address or date of birth online. All of this data, and much more, is publicly listed on\u00a0people search sites. People search sites, or public data brokers, display your data to anyone who\u2019s interested, including marketing companies and scammers building their next job scam campaign.",
      "Cybercriminals can also find this information in the databases of private data brokers. Private data brokers harvest personal information too but don\u2019t give access to their databases.",
      "However, many will happily sell a list of potential targets to the highest bidder, and your name is likely on this list already. Data brokers aside, a lot of us voluntarily give up personal information on all sorts of forms, forums, blogs and\u00a0social media accounts. Since the U.S. doesn\u2019t have a comprehensive federal law protecting personal data, anything that you publish online may eventually be shared and sold without your consent.",

      "1. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Consider using data removal services that help remove your personal information from people search sites and data brokers. These services can reduce your online exposure and minimize the risk of scammers finding your information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Be cautious of unsolicited job offers: Ignore unexpected messages about easy online job opportunities. Be wary of vague job descriptions like \"app optimization\" or \"product boosting.\"",
      "3. Verify the legitimacy of online tasks: Research unfamiliar platforms before completing tasks. Be suspicious of requests to use your own money or cryptocurrency. A legitimate potential employer will never ask you to pay for work opportunities.",

      "4. Protect your personal information: Limit sharing personal data on forms, forums and\u00a0social media.",
      "5. Don't click on links, and invest in strong antivirus software: Antivirus software helps protect your devices by monitoring your online activity, blocking access to malicious websites and preventing harmful downloads. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Legitimate employers don\u2019t use WhatsApp or texting for employee sourcing. They also won't ask you to pay for work opportunities. If someone asks you to invest money to earn more, it's likely a scam. Returning to work in retirement can be a fantastic way to boost your income and stay socially connected. Use your years of experience to your advantage, stay safe and best of luck in your job hunt.",

      "A South Carolina death row inmate who gruesomely killed his ex-girlfriend's parents with a baseball bat in 2001 is scheduled to be executed by firing squad on Friday \u2013 the first execution of its kind in the U.S. in 15 years.",
      "Brad Sigmon, 67, who admitted to the killings because his ex-girlfriend refused to get back to him, will be blindfolded and strapped to a chair at around 6 p.m. before three volunteers armed with rifles about 15 feet away will fire bullets into his heart.",
      "Each will be armed with .308-caliber, Winchester 110-grain TAP Urban ammunition often used by police marksmen. The bullet is designed to shatter on impact with something hard, like an inmate's chest bones, sending fragments meant to destroy the heart and cause death almost immediately.",
      "Brad Sigmon will be put to death by firing squad Friday. (Kinard Lisbon/South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP, left, South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP, right.)",

      "Just a few hours before the death sentence, the U.S. Supreme Court denied an emergency motion to suspend the execution.",
      "It is scheduled for 6 p.m. ET at the Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia.",
      "The execution will go ahead if South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster and South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson signed off on it. Sigmon\u2019s lawyers have asked McMaster to commute his death sentence to life in prison, arguing that he is a model prisoner and works every day to atone for the killings he committed after succumbing to severe mental illness. But no South Carolina governor has granted clemency in the 49 years since the death penalty resumed.",
      "Sigmon chose the firing squad method over the electric chair which would \"cook him alive,\" or a lethal injection, whose details are\u00a0kept secret\u00a0in South Carolina, his lawyers said.",
      "South Carolina keeping information secret about how it conducts lethal injections led him to decide on the firing squad, which he acknowledges will be a violent death, his lawyer said. On Thursday, Sigmon\u2019s lawyers asked the Supreme Court to delay his execution because the state doesn't release enough information about the lethal injection drug.",
      "Sigmon said he carried out the brutal slayings because he was angry that victims Gladys and David Larke had been evicted from a trailer they owned. They were in separate rooms of their Greenville County home and Sigmon went back and forth attacking them until they were dead, investigators said.",
      "He then kidnapped his ex-girlfriend, Rebecca Armstrong, in his car but she jumped out of the moving vehicle and was able to escape. Sigmon shot at her as she fled, but missed, prosecutors said.",

      "SOUTH CAROLINA SCHEDULING EXECUTIONS AGAIN AFTER A PAUSE FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "\"My intention was to kill her and then myself,\" Sigmon said in a confession typed out by a detective after his arrest. \"That was my intention all along. If I couldn\u2019t have her, I wasn\u2019t going to let anybody else have her. And I knew it got to the point where I couldn\u2019t have her.\"",
      "He told jurors during his trial that he was obsessed with her. \"Did I love her? More than anything else in the world.\"",
      "Armstrong told USA Today this week that the killings ripped her family apart and that \"he should answer for what he's done.\"",
      "She said that her parents were simple country folk who had five children and were always looking out for everyone and that they've missed the births of some of their eight grandchildren and five great-grand children since they were murdered.",
      "\"They were the glue of the family,\" Armstrong said, adding, \"He took that away.\"",
      "Armstrong said she doesn't believe in the death penalty and won't attend the execution, although her son Ricky Sims will be there.",
      "Sims told the Greenville News that he will be wearing a pair of boots that were the last gift his grandparents ever gave him.",
      "\"He's going to pay for what he\u2019s done,\" Sims told the outlet. \"He took away two people who would have done anything for their family. They were the rock of our family ... They didn't deserve it.\"",

      "Executions in South Carolina resumed in September, when the state \u2013 once one of the busiest for executions \u2013 ended a 13-year pause in carrying out the death penalty.",
      "The pause was caused in part by the state having difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs after their supply expired because of pharmaceutical companies' concerns that they would have to disclose they had sold the drugs to state officials. The state legislature then passed a shield law allowing officials to keep lethal injection drug suppliers private.",
      "Twenty-five executions were carried out in the U.S. last year. Five have already been carried out in 2025, per the Death Penalty Information Center.",

Be wary of sending money, bank account information, personal photos or other sensitive personal information to someone you\u2019ve never met in person.Keep it on the platform.

      "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Friday that his government is working on a plan to prepare large-scale military training for every adult male in response to the changing security situation in Europe.",
      "The military training would create a reserve force that is \"adequate to possible threats,\" Tusk said in a major speech on security to Poland\u2019s lower house of parliament, or Sejm.",
      "He said that there's a need for an army of 500,000 soldiers, which would include reservists.",
      "Last year, the Polish government said that the military was made up of around 200,000 soldiers and was to grow to 220,000 this year with the objective of increasing it to about 300,000.",

      "But security fears have grown far more dramatic in recent weeks, as Russia continues to pound Ukraine with missiles and drones, and as the Trump administration has withdrawn military and intelligence support for Ukraine while putting its commitments to NATO in question.",
      "\"Today we are talking about the need for a half-million army in Poland,\" Tusk said.",
      "After his speech, Tusk explained to reporters that he wasn't considering a return of universal military service, but rather a reserve system based on the model in Switzerland. In that country, every man is obliged to serve in the military or an alternative civilian service, while women can volunteer if they choose.",
      "Poland, with a population of 38 million people, is located along NATO\u2019s eastern flank and is deeply concerned by the war in Ukraine. There are fears that if Ukraine is defeated, Russia will turn its imperial ambitions next to countries like Poland, which Moscow controlled during the 19th century and during the Cold War.",

      "Jaroslaw Kaczy\u0144ski, the head of Poland\u2019s largest opposition party, the conservative Law and Justice, said that a mental shift in society would also be needed in addition to the military training of men.",
      "\"We will have a return to the chivalric ethos and to the fact that men should also be soldiers, that is, be able to expose themselves, even to death,\" Kaczy\u0144ski said.",
      "Concern has grown in Poland and across most of Europe as U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled a dramatically shifting stance in Washington to one that includes support for Russia's position \u2014 even though on Friday he issued a stern warning to Russia after it attacked Ukrainian energy facilities with dozens of missiles and drones.",
      "\"If Ukraine loses the war or if it accepts the terms of peace, armistice, or capitulation in such a way that weakens its sovereignty and makes it easier for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin to gain control over Ukraine, then, without a doubt \u2014 and we can all agree on that \u2014 Poland will find itself in a much more difficult geopolitical situation,\" Tusk said.",
      "President Andrzej Duda said Friday that he was submitting an amendment to the Polish Constitution for consideration which would oblige the country to spend at least 4% of its gross domestic product each year on defense.",
      "Poland is already NATO's top spender on defense as a percentage of its overall economy, spending above 4% of its GDP this year. But Duda said that he wanted to take advantage of the consensus on the political scene in Poland today on the matter to enshrine it in the highest law.",

      "Yoon was arrested and indicted in January over the Dec. 3 martial law decree that plunged the country into political turmoil. The opposition-controlled parliament separately voted to impeach him, leading to his suspension from office.",

      "Investigators have alleged that the martial-law decree amounted to rebellion. If he\u2019s convicted of that offense, he would face the death penalty or life imprisonment.",

The decree lasted only six hours, as enough lawmakers managed to get into an assembly hall and voted to overturn it unanimously.",
      "Yoon later argued his decree was only meant to inform the people of the danger of the opposition Democratic Party, which undermined his agenda and impeached top officials, and said he dispatched troops to the assembly only in order to maintain order. But some top military and police officers sent to the assembly have told Constitutional Court hearings or investigators that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to obstruct a vote on his decree or detain politicians.",
      "If the Constitutional Court upholds Yoon\u2019s impeachment, he will be officially thrown out of office and a national election will be held to choose his successor within two months.

      "The memo was sent to heads of various departments and offices with the subject line \"Managing the 2025 regular budget liquidity crisis.\" According to the memo, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres issued a directive to manage cashflow \"conservatively\" and to suspend hiring. It also contained a warning to the department heads, telling them to prepare to work with 80% of their allocated budgets.",

Additionally, Dugan said the U.N.\u2019s assumption that it can use its power on the world stage as leverage in negotiations with the U.S. has proven to be \"preposterous\" in recent years.",
      "The U.N. may very well have a reason to worry after President Donald Trump\u2019s address to a joint session of Congress in which he listed numerous examples of \"appalling waste\" identified by DOGE. However, the possibility of other countries that provide major funding to the international body reassessing their spending as well could be causing further concern.",

      "Musk told the senators \u2014 nearly all of them former Rubio colleagues \u2014 that his Department of Government Efficiency was not responsible for the cuts, according to two people familiar with a discussion that occurred behind closed doors. Not only was his position at odds with his public posture \u2014 Musk wielded a toy chain saw at a conservative conference last month \u2014\u00a0but it implicitly laid blame at the feet of the Cabinet secretaries who would meet with him and Trump the following day.",
      "After listening to the back-and-forth between his Cabinet secretaries and his biggest political benefactor, Trump publicly clipped Musk\u2019s wings. The Senate-confirmed secretaries will have control over who is fired in their departments for now, the president said, with Musk playing a backup role if necessary.",

      "\u201cElon gets along great with Marco, and they\u2019re both doing a fantastic job,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cThere is no clash.\u201d",

      "Still, the flash point served to highlight a broader battle that has aligned old-guard Trump-world populists and veteran politicians against Musk and a gang of ultrawealthy Trump advisers. And it was the first real sign that Trump might have trepidation about the richest man in the world haphazardly discarding hundreds of thousands of low- and middle-income federal workers and programs that serve MAGA voters.",

      "In addition to Musk, the set of Trump\u2019s closest advisers includes another pair of billionaires working for the administration: Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.",
      "Trump\u2019s immigration agenda has also created a divide between his wealthy advisers and his populist base. While many MAGA voters back the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants and the abolition of birthright citizenship, Trump has sought to open the nation\u2019s doors to certain immigrants. He has called for allowing foreigners to buy citizenship for $5 million and creating an expedited citizenship for white South Africans.",
      "But in a sign of the tension between key segments of the president\u2019s coalition, Semafor reported Friday that tech industry leaders have become less ardent supporters of the H-1B visa program, which brings in high-skilled workers, amid a populist backlash from Trump\u2019s base.",
      "In some cases, MAGA populists have pushed back against Republicans in Congress. Laura Loomer, a leading Trump supporter, railed against the GOP on X earlier this week over the Senate voting to repeal a rule from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which the Trump administration is attempting to abolish.",
      "In a strange-bedfellows moment, Trump\u2019s base joined with liberals to try to protect the rule limiting \u201cdebanking\u201d \u2014 the term for financial institutions refusing service to individuals, companies or other entities based on their political views. At the same time, cryptocurrency heavyweights and tech-industry leaders, who have been among the most vocal critics of debanking, quietly stood aside.",
      "Loomer said her issue is not with Trump, but rather with Senate Republicans.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that Republicans continue their charade of campaign fundraising off of their false claims of fighting to protect free speech and fighting to combat debanking when they just made it easier for payment processors to discriminate against American citizens and specifically Trump supporters,\u201d Loomer said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a violation by the Senate GOP of promises made by President Trump to prevent discriminatory debanking and deplatforming by the big tech companies,\u201d Loomer said.",
      "The silence of Silicon Valley power brokers, including Musk and Trump tech adviser David Sacks, may point to their antipathy toward the CFPB and their preference for a debanking bill introduced by Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., that has heavy backing from the cryptocurrency crowd.",
      "The central role these men play in Trump\u2019s life showed up Thursday when the president signed an executive order creating a strategic bitcoin reserve. Sacks was in the room with Trump for the moment, and before signing it, Trump turned to the billionaire to make sure he had his support.",
      "\u201cThis is something you believe in?\u201d Trump asked.",
      "Sacks replied, \u201c100%.\u201d",

He paused new tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods this week, but also suggested in an address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday that he\u2019s not worried about consumers paying more at the register.",
      "\u201cThere will be a little disturbance, but we\u2019re OK with that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be much.\u201d",
      "But no paradox has been as vivid for Trump backers as the president claiming to strike a blow for the people by giving Musk free rein to cancel grants, contracts and entire agencies. That decision has resulted in economic pain for some Trump voters, many of whom rely on those services or hold government jobs.",
      "During his speech to Congress, Trump proclaimed that \u201cthe days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over.\u201d",
      "Dave Portnoy, a co-founder of Barstool Sports and a big-time Trump supporter, wrote on X that the line was a little hard to take.",
      "\u201cGotta admit this one didn\u2019t quite land since Elon is basically Co-President,\u201d wrote Portnoy, who has grown increasingly critical of Trump.",
      "Trump adviser Alina Habba recently suggested that veterans who have been laid off from their jobs in the federal government may not have been \u201cfit\u201d to work, further saying she had no sympathy for the thousands of people who are now unemployed.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t feel sorry for them,\u201d Habba said.",

      "Trump will be judged most clearly by how voters see his decisions affecting their pocketbooks, said one Republican strategist outside of Washington who works with lawmakers. And that judgment will be felt first by House and Senate incumbents in the midterms next November.",
      "In a recent\u00a0CBS poll, 80% of respondents said addressing inflation should be a top priority \u2014 while just 29% said they believed Trump was prioritizing the issue \u201ca lot.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrump is having fun with Elon and the rest of the rich guys kissing his a-- \u2014 it\u2019s all fun and games with DOGE now \u2014 but if the economy doesn\u2019t improve and inflation doesn\u2019t come down, his voting base will pay the price and Republicans will get destroyed in 2026,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cHe has to deliver on the economy \u2014\u00a0fast.\u201d"

      "TORONTO \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canadian goods, coming on the heels of his taunting threats to make the country the 51st\u00a0U.S. state, are eroding the inherent politeness of Americans\u2019 northern neighbors and rallying them around their own flag.",
      "Canadians are removing\u00a0American liquor and California wines from their store shelves.\u00a0They\u2019re pulling back on future visits to the U.S. They\u2019re pushing \u201cBuy Canadian\u201d to counter higher costs and spite Trump. And they are uncharacteristically brandishing unvarnished anger over what they see as a betrayal of a longtime friend.",
      "\u201cI will never visit America again,\u201d Angela Qin, a university student told NBC News as she exited an ice rink in downtown Toronto.\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t stab the back of your friend.\u201d",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Trump announced 25% tariffs this week on most\u00a0Canadian imports. His decision a couple of days later to exempt from tariffs about 38% of Canadian goods that comply with the North American trade deal negotiated during his first term sparked more confusion and did little to tamp down contempt for him across the country. His suggestion on Friday that\u00a0he might hit Canada with new tariffs on lumber and dairy products only fueled the fury.",
      "\u201cCanada has been ripping us off for years on tariffs for lumber and for dairy products,\u201d Trump told reporters during an event in the Oval Office.

    "published": "Sat, 08 Mar 2025 01:56:36 GMT",
    "summary": "The use of Starlink has been adopted by at least one additional federal agency since Donald Trump began his second presidential term.",
    "story": [
      "Starlink, the satellite internet service controlled by billionaire Elon Musk and his rocket company SpaceX, is expanding its footprint in the federal government weeks after the billionaire began slashing the federal workforce and agency budgets under President Donald Trump\u2019s direction.",
      "Multiple federal agencies are exploring the idea of adopting SpaceX\u2019s Starlink for internet access \u2014 and at least one agency, the General Services Administration (GSA), has done so at the request of Musk\u2019s staff, according to someone who worked at the GSA last month and is familiar with its network operations \u2014 despite a vow by Musk and Trump to slash the overall federal budget.",
      "Starlink\u2019s expansion is sparking outcry among congressional Democrats because of Musk\u2019s dual positions: He is the founder and CEO of SpaceX, which owns Starlink, and a senior adviser to Trump with an expansive portfolio across the government. As a shareholder in SpaceX, he could gain financially if Starlink is granted additional business.",
      "Starlink, which routes internet traffic through low-orbit satellites, has gained popularity in rural areas and disaster zones because it doesn\u2019t require fiber cables or cellular towers. Users say the Starlink terminals have real advantages in terms of how easy they are to set up and how mobile they are. One downside, though, is that Starlink satellites have an expected lifespan of five years, so the company must replenish them.",
      "The growth of Starlink has also given Musk unusual influence in the U.S. and abroad, as he can unilaterally decide to deploy or withhold internet service during moments of disaster, war or other crises.",
      "At least seven federal offices including the Defense and Commerce departments were already established customers of Starlink when Trump took office in January, according to a federal government database of awarded contracts. The database lists $4.1 million in federal contracts in 2022 and $1.9 million in 2023. The existing spending includes a test at sea by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Now, the number of customers appears set to grow.",
      "According to a person who worked at GSA last month and is familiar with its network operations, the agency had installed Starlink by mid-February. The service was being used by staff members of Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, this person said. NBC News also saw internal correspondence confirming it had been installed at the GSA\u2019s offices in Washington at 1800 F Street NW. Starlink was installed within days of the DOGE team\u2019s request, the person said, while a more typical process should take weeks or months for reviews concerning security, procurement, business needs and more. A separate person working at GSA showed NBC News documentation indicating that a Starlink network was available for use at the facility.",
      "The GSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "One of the agencies deliberating a contract with Starlink burst into public debate last week: the Federal Aviation Administration, which for years has been looking to upgrade the infrastructure underlying its communications systems. The FAA awarded a $2.4 billion contract to Verizon in 2023, and although the contract is due to run for 15 years, Musk posted on X that he wants to pivot to a rival Starlink system. He said on X that Starlink was sending terminals at \u201cno cost to the taxpayer.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not clear exactly when the FAA began considering the use of Starlink. Musk approved a shipment of 4,000 Starlink terminals to the FAA last month, Bloomberg News reported.",
      "A second agency is Customs and Border Protection, which has issued internal paperwork to authorize an evaluation of Starlink to help monitor the U.S. border, a spokesperson told FedScoop, a news site that covers the federal government. CBP\u2019s interest in Starlink goes back at least to 2023, before Trump returned to office, according to a Department of Homeland Security document reported by FedScoop. CBP and DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "And officials at a third federal agency are comparing Starlink to Verizon as a tool for communicating during a catastrophe, according to one person involved in the discussions who asked that their agency not be named in order to avoid reprisal. That process was initiated in February and appears to be under consideration as part of a normal process, the person said.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the agencies are coordinating their contract talks, and what dollar value any of the potential contracts may have. None of the three agencies appears to have made a final decision.",
      "The White House, in response to written questions from NBC News, pledged to comply with ethics rules.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and his entire administration is committed to executing a head to toe assessment of every contract the American people are funding with their taxpayer dollars,\u201d White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement.",
      "\u201cAny contracts connected to Elon Musk\u2019s very successful companies will comply with every government ethics rule as it pertains to potential conflicts of interests,\u201d he said.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a follow-up question on whether Starlink was in use at GSA.",
      "Musk has publicly called for other federal agencies to adopt Starlink or award grant money to Starlink, including the Department of Agriculture and the Federal Communications Commission. In January, Musk said he was using Starlink from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.",
      "The possible deals for SpaceX\u2019s Starlink are one of the tangible ways that Musk and his companies could benefit from the turnover in presidential administrations. The Trump administration has also ended at least two investigations into Musk companies that predated Trump\u2019s return to power: a Justice Department probe into SpaceX hiring, and a Labor Department inquiry into alleged workplace discrimination at Tesla.",
      "Musk\u2019s statements about Starlink and the federal government have attracted some scrutiny.",
      "Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., the ranking member on the Senate Commerce Committee, said Musk appeared to be trying to interfere in an already-awarded, 15-year federal contract with his statements about the FAA.",
      "Musk\u2019s posts on X \u201csure seem to raise serious red flags,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Cantwell said federal law requires procurements be competitive and made with public notice.",
      "\u201cWe need answers now about how the Administration will enforce these laws to ensure aviation safety takes precedence over private gain,\u201d she said.",
      "The FAA has been close to canceling its existing Verizon contract, The Washington Post reported.",
      "On Wednesday, SpaceX said media reports were false and that it was not trying to take over existing government contracts at the FAA.",
      "\u201cStarlink is a possible partial fix to an aging system,\u201d SpaceX said in a post on X. The company said it was working with the FAA \u201cto identify instances where Starlink could serve as a long-term infrastructure upgrade for aviation safety.\u201d",
      "Musk did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Verizon has said it\u2019s not backing down from its FAA contract.",
      "\u201cOur Company is working on building the next generation system for the FAA which will support the Agency\u2019s mission for safe and secure air travel,\u201d Verizon said in a statement last week.",
      "\u201cWe are at the beginning of a multi-year contract to replace antiquated, legacy systems. Our teams have been working with the FAA\u2019s technology teams and our solution stands ready to be deployed. We continue to partner with the FAA on achieving its modernization objectives.\u201d",
      "Verizon said it had no further comment beyond the statement.",
      "In a statement, the FAA did not directly address the Verizon contract but said: \u201cTo update our air traffic control system, it will require multiple companies and multiple technologies. That is why we are testing multiple communication technologies, including satellites, fiber and wireless to ensure the safety of the national airspace system. Beyond that, no decisions for other deployments have been made. Those decisions will be made by the FAA Administrator.\u201d",
      "Sales to government agencies are only one part of Starlink\u2019s business. Other customers include United Airlines and the three biggest cruise ship operators. During the Super Bowl, T-Mobile broadcast an ad touting its partnership with Starlink to improve service in rural areas. More than 5 million people are using Starlink globally across 125 countries and territories, according to SpaceX.",
      "For home use, Starlink advertises its service at $120 a month with a one-time $149 setup fee. It also advertises a \u201clow usage\u201d option for $80 a month.",
      "Musk said in an X post in November that Starlink revenue \u201cis how we are paying for humanity to get to Mars,\u201d although SpaceX generally does not disclose the profitability or revenue from its Starlink division. In 2022, Musk said Starlink was losing money.",
      "Starlink\u2019s business with the federal government grew during the Biden administration, despite the sour relationship between Musk and then-President Joe Biden. In 2023, SpaceX won a Pentagon contract to develop a military version of Starlink called Starshield.",
      "The Navy has been testing out Starlink on its warships but hasn\u2019t made a large deployment yet. In 2023, senior crew on one ship broke Navy rules when they acquired a Starlink setup and used it while deployed at sea, leading to the court-martialing of at least one senior crew member, Navy Times reported.",
      "Other satellite companies are racing to develop competitors to Starlink. Eutelsat, a European company, said Tuesday it was in talks with the E.U. to supply internet access to Ukraine with its OneWeb service. Amazon has been developing a low-orbit satellite internet service called Project Kuiper.",
      "The Trump administration is also reviewing a proposed merger of two satellite operators \u2014 SES and Intelsat \u2014 whose combination would create a more powerful competitor to Starlink."

      "The White House hosted its first-ever \u201ccrypto summit\u201d Friday, convening top executives from various digital asset firms to discuss the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to rolling back the aggressive regulatory posture the Biden administration took toward the industry.",
      "However, some in the crypto world were left disappointed that the Trump administration did not signal more active support for the industry, leading the prices of the very assets the summit was supposed to acclaim to sag Friday.",
      "The price of bitcoin was down about 3% in late-afternoon trading and was set to finish the week down approximately 7%, to $87,000.",
      "The groundwork for the lackluster reaction was laid late Thursday, when Trump\u2019s \u201ccrypto czar,\u201d venture capitalist David Sacks, announced that the president had signed an order to create a \u201cstrategic bitcoin reserve.\u201d",
      "While that measure has been aggressively pushed by the crypto community, the order indicated the reserve would only comprise current bitcoin holdings previously seized by federal law enforcement agencies. A separate \u201cdigital asset stockpile\u201d would also be created to hold non-bitcoin digital tokens, like ethereum and ripple, that have also been seized in enforcement proceedings.",
      "However, the executive order gave no explicit guarantee or timetable for the government to begin making new cryptocurrency purchases outright.",
      "If such purchases were to ever occur, it said, they would be undertaken in a budget-neutral way and at no additional cost to taxpayers.",
      "To be sure, the very existence of a White House crypto summit, let alone a strategic reserve, represents a sea change for an industry that has long fought to gain mainstream acceptance. And despite its recent declines, the price of bitcoin remains about 25% higher than its level before Trump secured a second presidential term in early November.",
      "Trump himself has jumped headfirst into the crypto world, launching his own \u201cmeme coin\u201d just prior to his inauguration in January that briefly saw his paper net worth explode by billions. The coin\u2019s value has since plunged.",
      "While Trump on Friday doubled down on his desire to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the world\u201d and a leader in cutting-edge financial technology, some investors were still left wanting more.",
      "\u201cTrump is now officially \u2018off the hook\u2019 for what the Bitcoin community did for him,\u201d Jeff Park, an executive with the Bitwise crypto investment group, said in a post on X Friday before the summit concluded, referring to the creation of the strategic reserve. \u201cIf you want something else later, he\u2019ll want something else from now on.\u201d",
      "Park continued: \u201cWe asked for too little. Having only bitcoin and not the rest of the altcoins in the strategic reserve is not a win. \u2018Exploring\u2019 or \u2018studying\u2019 concepts is not a win. \u2018Not selling\u2019 is not a win. None of these things at the core require an EO at all to do anything.\u201d",
      "On a call with reporters before the summit Friday, White House officials likened the establishment of the reserve to a \u201cdigital Fort Knox\u201d that would ensure the U.S. maintains proper control over its digital holdings. Previously, the officials said, the government had sold off its holdings in an ad hoc manner that, they argued, has resulted in lost value to taxpayers given bitcoin\u2019s steady rise in value.",
      "The officials also dispelled a rumor that had been circulating \u2014 with excitement \u2014 in online crypto spaces that individuals would not have to pay taxes on gains from crypto holdings.",
      "And, the officials said, observers had read too much into the president\u2019s initial social media post announcing the creation of the reserve when he initially mentioned three other non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies would serve as founding tokens for the reserve.",
      "The crypto industry played an outsize role in the 2024 election, with crypto-related political action committees and affiliated groups spending more than $245 million for last year\u2019s cycle, according to Federal Election Commission data.",
      "Nearly half of all corporate dollars that flowed into the election came from the crypto industry, according to the nonprofit watchdog Public Citizen.",
      "For those efforts, even if the industry has not seen the U.S. government jump headfirst into crypto markets, it has nevertheless won a far more encouraging regulatory approach. Trump said Friday his administration would \u201cend the federal bureaucracy\u2019s war on crypto.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe feel like pioneers,\u201d Trump said."

    "story": [
      "CANANDAIGUA, N.Y. \u2014\u00a0Sam Nordquist left home in Minnesota last fall and traveled 1,000 miles to be with a woman he\u2019d fallen in love with online.",
      "He ended up imprisoned in a cut-rate hotel in upstate New York, suffering unspeakable horrors before he was killed.",
      "A gang of seven people \u2014 including the woman for whom he\u2019d trekked across the country\u00a0\u2014 have been charged with murder, accused of torturing and humiliating the 24-year-old transgender Black man in the hotel room for weeks before eventually killing him. The only people who called police were Nordquist\u2019s mother and sister back home, who pleaded for authorities to check in on him when he stopped responding to their messages. But Nordquist\u2019s body had already been dumped, wrapped in plastic bags, in an empty field.",
      "Even though arrests have been made, first-degree murder charges have been filed and the victim laid to rest, this case remains an incomprehensible display of human malice. Online posts told a story of a happy couple, but Nordquist\u2019s friends and family were increasingly concerned when he didn\u2019t return their messages.",
      "His mother feared he was being controlled \u2014 and has accused authorities of ignoring warning signs and failing to protect her child. And LGBTQ activists have said the case is a dark reminder of the risks marginalized people face in America, particularly today.",
      "The seven suspects are all being held without bail. NBC News tried to reach their family and friends, but those who returned calls or answered doors declined to comment. The Ontario County Conflict Defender\u2019s Office, which is representing the defendants, declined to comment. None of the seven has yet entered a plea.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll never know the answer why, because what human being could do what happened to Sam?\u201d Ontario County Assistant District Attorney Kelly Wolford said this week. \u201cWe\u2019ll never make sense of this case.\u201d",
      "\u2018She love-bombed him\u2019",
      "Sam Nordquist fell for a woman named Precious Arzuaga last August. They met online and ended up talking for hours on the phone, day and night, seven days a week, said his mother, Linda Nordquist. Sam seemed smitten, exhilarated for romance with a woman who flooded him with affection.",
      "\u201cSam was vulnerable. He looked like he was 15, young,\u201d Linda Nordquist told NBC News. \u201cShe love-bombed him.\u201d",
      "Arzuaga lived outside Canandaigua, in New York\u2019s Finger Lakes region. She was 38, with several children, some young, others adults \u2014 it\u2019s not clear how many she had. If Sam knew that, he didn\u2019t seem to mind. He began planning a trip to see her in mid-September and expected to stay a week.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to find love and he wanted to be loved. No one can blame him for that. Anyone would want that,\u201d a friend, Jaxon Seeger, recalled. \u201cHe was excited for the trip and the adventure.\u201d",
      "Seeger, who lives in Madison, Wisconsin, had befriended Sam after meeting him in an internet support group for transgender people years earlier. Seeger watched videos Sam posted on TikTok with Arzuaga and thought it all looked normal. Still, Seeger knew it was risky for a transgender man in a new place among unfamiliar people.",
      "At first, things appeared to be going well. Sam sent his mom photographs of the couple together, both smiling, she said. But on Oct. 12, the day he was expected to return home, he\u00a0did not show up. Linda said he did not answer texts and phone calls from the family.",
      "Sam had told Linda that he was staying in Room 22 at Patty\u2019s Lodge, a roadside hotel on the outskirts of Canandaigua, surrounded by farmland. The collection of single-story pale, brown buildings with mismatched curtains stands in contrast to the vibrantly colored Victorian homes that line the city\u2019s Main Street and the mansions, yacht clubs and lavish hotels that border nearby Canandaigua Lake, the city\u2019s glistening namesake.",
      "Patty\u2019s Lodge is not a tourist haunt. It is a destination of last resort. Some rooms are rented for weeks at a time by people on the verge of homelessness or facing other emergencies; in some instances their stays are paid for using vouchers provided by the Ontario County Department of Social Services. Others are registered sex offenders, according to records published by the Ontario County Sheriff\u2019s Office.",
      "It is unclear how Sam and Arzuaga ended up at Patty\u2019s Lodge and if anyone else was staying with them.",
      "On Oct. 13, Linda said she contacted the New York State Police and requested a wellness check at Room 22. Not long after, she said, Sam and Arzuaga called and assured her that everything was fine. Sam told Linda that he wanted to stay indefinitely to pursue his new relationship and to help Arzuaga support her kids, she said.",
      "The state police reached Sam at Patty\u2019s Lodge that same day.",
      "\u201cAt that time, Sam told the trooper he was fine and did not need any medical or law enforcement help,\u201d State Police spokesperson Trooper Lynnea Crane said in an email.",
      "But based on the conversations Linda had with police after the wellness check, she believes law enforcement was misled and didn\u2019t do a thorough enough job looking for signs of distress. She says law enforcement downplayed their ongoing concerns.",
      "\u201cThey said that they talked to Sam and everything appeared to be fine, that everything was good. Well, that\u2019s because that Precious was right there,\u201d Linda said. \u201cI think Sam was scared and intimidated, and that they should have separated them and they didn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Although the family was suspicious of their relationship, Sam and Arzuaga appeared online like a happy couple. Of the more than two dozen videos Sam posted on TikTok between September and November, most of the clips show the pair dancing together and embracing each other affectionately. Sam described Arzuaga as his \u201cride or die,\u201d \u201csoul\u201d and \u201cfamily\u201d throughout several of the posts.",
      "Desiree Tucker, 32, used to make TikToks with Arzuaga, too, when the two dated on and off from 2022 to 2024, she said. But when the cameras were off, things weren\u2019t so great between them. If she declined to do the videos, she risked a beating from Arzuaga, Tucker said in an interview.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s like: \u2018Oh, you look so happy in your TikToks,\u2019\u201d Tucker said. \u201cYeah, I know I did. And I did exactly what she wanted me to do. Because I knew if I didn\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t be good for me.\u201d",
      "On Feb. 18, Tucker\u2019s local police department in Toronto, Ohio, showed up at her house asking about Arzuaga on behalf of New York State Police, she said. She said she told them Arzuaga physically abused her throughout their relationship. She also said Arzuaga refused her access to her phone and social media, and wouldn\u2019t allow her to contact her family at times. Arzuaga is in jail and could not be reached for comment; Toronto police didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Sam\u2019s family had tried to stay in touch with him, but his responses to their calls and texts grew infrequent. When he did answer, they said, it was usually because they threatened to request more welfare checks to Room 22. He downplayed their concerns, which made Linda worry more.",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t sound like himself. It\u2019s like he was being coached on what to say,\u201d she said. \u201cSam lived with me his whole, entire life. We were always together. So I know how Sam talks \u2014\u00a0and this was not Sam.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 4, she said, she got an email from the Ontario County Department of Social Services, which includes the town where Sam was living.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m working with your son Sam. He wanted me to reach you,\u201d the worker wrote, according to a screenshot of the exchange shared by Linda. \u201cIf you can please contact me as soon as you get this email.\u201d",
      "The social services agent later told her in a phone call that Arzuaga was controlling Sam\u2019s cellphone use, that he wanted to come home to Minnesota and that he was concocting an \u201cescape plan,\u201d Linda said. The agent added that Sam was supposed to return to the social services office on Dec. 19, but he never showed up, Linda said.

    "summary": "When Grant Fisher stepped off the track at Boston University on Feb.",
    "story": [
      "When Grant Fisher stepped off the track at Boston University on Feb. 14, it wasn\u2019t entirely a shock that the American distance runner had just broken the world record for the indoor 5,000 meters.",
      "For one thing, he was in great shape. Only six days earlier, Fisher, 27, who was coming off a breakout season in which he earned two silver medals at the Paris Olympics, had also broken the world record at 3,000 meters in New York City. Larger trends were also at play: He was running on one of the fastest tracks in the world, wearing Nike spikes whose carbon plates and advanced foams helped return energy with every stride.",
      "Yet in Boston, when Fisher was asked about the factors that had led to his pair of world records, he acknowledged one so surprisingly simple that it\u2019s probably in your kitchen.",
      "He\u2019d recently begun taking baking soda.",
      "\u201cI think it makes an impact, and if that impact is 1%, that would be massive,\u201d Fisher told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s probably more like 0.1%, if there is one. And if it is just mental, then I\u2019ll take that, too.\u201d",
      "Fisher is among the many professional runners in recent years to embrace baking soda \u2014 known within the sport by its scientific name, sodium bicarbonate, or simply \u201cbicarb\u201d \u2014 as a legal means of running faster times than ever. The use of a bicarbonate \u201csystem\u201d sold by Maurten, a Swedish company, has become so widespread that at track and field\u2019s world championships in 2023, two-thirds of all medalists from 800 to 10,000 meters were using it. At the Olympics last summer, more than two-thirds of all running medalists were using it \u2014 \u201cand in some cases, all the finalists were using it,\u201d the company told NBC News.",
      "In an eight-day span in February, seven of the sport\u2019s world records in races ranging from the 1,500 meters to the road half-marathon were smashed. The rapid-fire rewriting of professional running\u2019s record book can be traced to many reasons, from high-tech advancements leading to faster shoes and tracks, quicker recovery and better coaching.",
      "The combination has convinced Chris Woods, the head track coach at Mississippi State University, that not only \u201ca lot of world records are in jeopardy here in the very near future\u201d but that even times that once appeared unthinkable could now be possible, such as the record of 4:07 in the women\u2019s mile.",
      "\u201cIn my lifetime, in your lifetime, I do believe we\u2019ll see a woman break 4 minutes,\u201d Woods said.",
      "But increasingly, runners such as Marco Arop, the 2023 world champion at 800 meters from Canada, whom Woods coaches, are also turning to \u201cbicarb\u201d for an edge.",
      "Intense periods of exercise create a build-up of hydrogen ions in muscles, leading to acidity that can increase fatigue and create the \u201cburning\u201d sensation felt during hard exercise. As a base, sodium bicarbonate acts as a \u201cbuffer\u201d that counters the acidity. Taking sodium bicarbonate doesn\u2019t run afoul of World Anti-Doping Agency rules; in fact, even World Athletics, track and field\u2019s global governing body, has described it as an \u201cestablished performance supplement.\u201d",
      "The benefits of \u201cbicarb\u201d have been known for decades, said Steve Magness, a coach and former elite runner who has written multiple books about performance. But athletes have been wary of it for just as long for an often unpleasant reason: The odds of a performance boost had to be weighed against the risk of race-wrecking gastrointestinal distress.",
      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t work very well because there was a high percentage of people that just couldn\u2019t even line up for the race or the time trial because it just tore apart your stomach,\u201d Magness said.",
      "Fisher had heard so many \u201chorror stories\u201d of nausea, vomiting or diarrhea from using bicarbonate that he waited until this winter, after the all-important Olympics cycle, to test out a \u201cbicarb\u201d mixture in training. His stomach handled it fine, he said. And that may have been because in recent years, bicarb has hit a turning point.",
      "Maurten, the Swedish company, has found a way to encase small tablets of bicarbonate into a gooey, soup-like hydrogel that guides them through the stomach and into the intestine, where the bicarbonate is dissolved and absorbed with less potential nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, according to the company. Side effects of taking sodium include water retention and weight gain, and regularly increasing sodium intake may lead to an increase in blood pressure, the company says.",
      "Maurten\u2019s credibility was boosted when famed marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge used its products to set multiple world records. Other Maurten users include Keely Hodgkinson, the Olympic champion at 800 meters.",
      "Beyond the hydrogel, however, bicarb may have become more palatable for elite runners recently for another reason. Just as the Paris Olympics began, a study in the European Journal of Applied Physiology upended a long-held belief that sodium bicarbonate was most effective as a buffer in shorter competitions, lasting up to around 10 minutes.",
      "When researchers at Edge Hill University in the United Kingdom gave Maurten\u2019s bicarbonate product to male cyclists during a much longer, 40-kilometer time trial \u2014 nearly the length of a marathon \u2014 they measured a 1.4% boost in the cyclists\u2019 performance, with minimal stomach issues. In practice, it meant cyclists using the bicarbonate were nearly 1 minute faster over about an hour of riding, said Eli Spencer Shannon, a Ph.D. candidate who led the study.",
      "\u201cI would classify that as small but meaningful,\u201d Shannon said.",
      "The findings, Shannon said, should spark more research. Bicarb isn\u2019t \u201cone size fits all,\u201d he said, because each person\u2019s stomach distress can vary and because baking soda\u2019s effectiveness as a buffer depends on how hard an athlete can push; harder exercise produces more hydrogen ions in the muscle that the bicarbonate can then remove.",
      "Still, Shannon was surprised by some of his study\u2019s findings, such as that the riders using bicarbonate also were able to go faster without a change in their heart rate or the maximum amount of oxygen they were able to use during exercise, known as VO\u2082.",
      "\u201cWhat that\u2019s saying is that you\u2019re able to sort of work harder but have less cardiovascular strain and have a better performance improvement in comparison to a placebo, which was really interesting,\u201d Shannon said. \u201cThat suggests increased [muscle] contractility, which has never been seen, at this duration and at this intensity.\u201d",
      "Not all of track\u2019s recent world-record holders incorporate baking soda as a new tool in their training. American Yared Nuguse, who broke the indoor mile record on Feb. 8, only for Norwegian rival Jakob Ingebrigtsen to reset it five days later, has said he doesn\u2019t use bicarbonate because of its taste. But some of the world\u2019s fastest have taken note.",
      "Two days before last summer\u2019s Olympic semifinal in the men\u2019s 800 meters, Arop, a former basketball player who became the world champion at 800 meters for Canada, turned to Woods in France with less a question than a statement. He was set on trying bicarb. The 800 meters was in the middle of one of the fastest years in the sport\u2019s history, and Arop knew several of his competitors had used it with success.",
      "\u201cThis is the pinnacle of our sport, and I don\u2019t think he wanted to leave anything to chance,\u201d Woods said. \u201cAnd if there was a way to give a 1% advantage, that\u2019s what he was going to do. That\u2019s what he believed. And the results we were pretty happy with.\u201d",
      "Woods didn\u2019t know much about bicarb until Arop raised the topic in France, but he said he now believes there are scientific benefits.",
      "\u201cIs there a mental component to it? I would say absolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think this is a placebo.\u201d",
      "Arop went on to earn the silver medal in the fourth-fastest time in 800 meters history, edged from the gold by just one one-hundredth of a second by Kenya\u2019s Emmanuel Wanyonyi \u2014 who also was using Maurten\u2019s bicarbonate in Paris, according to the company. The 800-meter world record, set in 2012, could be the next to go down, with Wanyonyi just two-tenths of a second behind. After the race, Arop said he believed his last-minute addition of sodium bicarbonate had \u201cdefinitely played a factor\u201d in his personal-best time.",
      "\u201cEverybody else is using it, and it\u2019s been working wonders,\u201d Arop said in August.",
      "Not everybody uses it. Bicarbonate is just one factor of many that have sparked what Woods called \u201cthe golden era of track and field when it comes to running fast times,\u201d a boom he likened to the NBA in the 1980s, when the talent of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, coupled with better technology and rules changes, boosted its popularity.",
      "A \u201cshoe war,\u201d as Magness said, has broken out in a race to develop shoes that return the most energy using bulky yet light foams and carbon-fiber plates. Under athletes\u2019 feet, the physics of indoor tracks are also fueling faster times. The indoor track at Boston University, in particular, has become a destination because its wide, banked corners help runners ricochet around turns, and its above-ground frame made of wood and plywood can return energy like a mini-trampoline more than an outdoor track, where a rubber surface is poured over a concrete base.",
      "When Magness was running two decades ago, an information gap left him to wonder how East African competitors were training. Social media and the internet have opened access to other training methods and better coaching that don\u2019t burn out young runners and created a bigger pool of strong runners, Magness said. Those young athletes are watching peers run faster than ever and believing confidently they can, too.",
      "They are powered by cutting-edge advancements Roger Bannister could only have dreamed of when he was chasing the first sub-4-minute mile \u2014 along with a basic household item, too.",
      "\u201cWhat the last couple years have done is kind of shift that mindset of, like, here\u2019s the past and here\u2019s what we were able to do,\u201d Magness said. \u201cBut now the game has changed.\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014\u00a0The Haydee Guesthouse, with its worn-out carpets and grandmotherly Victorian fa\u00e7ade, makes for an unlikely base for Russian-backed high-stakes espionage.",
      "But for years, the guesthouse in Great Yarmouth, a run-down resort town on Britain\u2019s east coast, played host to a freelance spy ring orchestrating cross-continental honeytraps, kidnappings, and murder plots\u00a0targeting high-profile dissidents and sensitive military sites.",
      "The details, which seem pulled straight from a spy novel, unfolded in British courts last week after three Bulgarians were found guilty of conspiracy to spy \u2014 members of a Russian ring operating from their base in the United Kingdom.",
      "Gabriela Gaberova, 30, a beautician tapped to carry out honeytraps; Katrin Ivanova, 33, a lab assistant who was also found guilty of \"possessing identity documents with improper intention;\" and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, a painter-decorator and Gaberova\u2019s former partner, made up the ragtag group of amateur operatives who managed to carry out espionage operations for the Kremlin on what prosecutors described as being on \"an industrial scale.\"",
      "Their handler, a fellow Bulgarian named Biser Dzhambazov, called himself \"Mad Max\" and doubled as a medical courier as well as a knot in the spy ring's tangled romantic subplot.",
      "Dzhambazov lived with Ivanova before ending their long-term relationship after developing feelings for Gaberova. When police raided the beautician\u2019s northwest London flat in February 2023, they found Dzhambazov and Gaberova in bed together.",
      "Their ringleader was a fifth Bulgarian, Orlin Roussev, part spy, part IT specialist, who adopted the name \u201cJackie Chan\u201d in messages to his side-kick, Dzhambazov.",
      "Roussev and Dzhambazov both pled guilty to espionage charges following their arrest in 2023.\u00a0A sixth Bulgarian, a mixed martial arts fighter code name \u201cThe Destroyer,\u201d real name Ivan Stoyanov, also admitted spying for Russia.",
      "Meanwhile, Roussev\u2019s \u2018minions\u2019 \u2014 which he named after the yellow characters from the Despicable Me animated series \u2014 denied the charges.",
      "Instead of being part of the cartoon villain Gru\u2019s scheme, these defendants were real-life operatives working for the Russian intelligence service, also named GRU.",
      "From 2020 to 2023, the gang carried out a series of chaotic and often disorganized covert missions, one of which targeted Christo Grozev, an investigative journalist renowned for exposing Russian involvement in\u00a0the poisoning of MI6 double agent Sergei Skripal with Novichok nerve agent in Salisbury, in southern England, in March 2018.",
      "The group tracked his movements across Austria, Montenegro, and Spain, even considering a honeytrap, with Gaberova potentially involved in the scheme.",
      "In 2022, they surveilled Roman Dobrokhotov, a journalist critical of Russia, with discussions of a possible kidnapping. Telegram messages show the group followed him from Budapest to Berlin before losing him at passport control.",
      "In another bizarre plot, the group planned to spray the Kazakh Embassy in London with what Britain's Crown Prosecution Service described as \"large quantities of fake pig\u2019s blood.\" They also schemed to create a false opposition group to stage a protest outside the embassy, and feed the sham information about the fake group to Kazakh Intelligence, in order to boost Russia\u2019s image.",
      "The group also tracked Kirill Kachur, a former Russian official, in Montenegro, planning a kidnapping. They surveilled a U.S. military base in Stuttgart, focusing on Ukrainian forces. Additionally, they conducted covert operations against former Kazakh politician Bergey Ryskaliyev, attempting to access his residence and gather intelligence.",
      "Investigators uncovered a trove of over 200,000 messages between the operatives, as well as spy equipment worth tens of thousands of dollars, including cameras hidden in pens and ties, and videos showing the group surveilling specific sites of interest.",
      "In addition to espionage, the group was implicated in broader Russian efforts to influence foreign political climates and destabilize rival nations.",
      "The three defendants will be held in custody until sentencing in May.",
      "Commander Dominic Murphy, head of Scotland Yard's SO15 which deals with state threats, said it was one of the U.K.'s largest espionage investigations of the last 15 years.",
      "Prosecutors said\u00a0the group was directed by alleged Russian agent\u00a0Jan Marsalek, an Austrian national,\u00a0who had contact with Russian intelligence agencies.",
      "The shadowy former COO of Wirecard, who is wanted Germany and subject to an Interpol red notice,\u00a0had fled to\u00a0Russia, where he allegedly ran the Bulgarian network.",
      "Marsalek and Roussev discussed the kidnap and murder of both Grozev and Kirill Kachur, who had worked for the Investigative Committee of Russia until falling out with the Kremlin.",
      "Gaberova, Ivanchev, and Ivanova claimed they didn't know who they were working for, or that they were lied to by their superiors.",

    "published": "Sat, 08 Mar 2025 11:30:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Unnecessarily high radiation doses in CT scans have been linked to cancers. Under new federal rules, doctors and imaging centers have to more closely track and report the doses that patients get.",
    "story": [
      "Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a professor at the University of California-San Francisco medical school, has spent well over a decade researching the disquieting risk that one of modern medicine\u2019s most valuable tools, computerized tomography scans, can sometimes cause cancer.",
      "Smith-Bindman and like-minded colleagues have long pushed for federal policies aimed at improving safety for patients undergoing CT scans. Under new Medicare regulations effective this year, hospitals and imaging centers must start collecting and sharing more information about the radiation their scanners emit.",
      "About 93 million CT scans are performed every year in the United States, according to IMV, a medical market research company that tracks imaging. More than half of those scans are for people 60 and older. Yet there is scant regulation of radiation levels as the machines scan organs and structures inside bodies. Dosages are erratic, varying widely from one clinic to another, and are too often unnecessarily high, Smith-Bindman and other critics say.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfathomable,\u201d Smith-Bindman said. \u201cWe keep doing more and more CTs, and the doses keep going up.\u201d",
      "One CT scan can expose a patient to 10 or 15 times as much radiation as another, Smith-Bindman said. \u201cThere is very large variation,\u201d she said, \u201cand the doses vary by an order of magnitude \u2014 tenfold, not 10% different \u2014 for patients seen for the same clinical problem.\u201d In outlier institutions, the variation is even higher, according to research she and a team of international collaborators have published.",
      "She and other researchers estimated in 2009 that high doses could be responsible for 2% of cancers. Ongoing research shows it\u2019s probably higher, since far more scans are performed today.",
      "The cancer risk from CT scans for any individual patient is very low, although it rises for patients who have numerous scans throughout their lives. Radiologists don\u2019t want to scare off patients who can benefit from imaging, which plays a crucial role in identifying life-threatening conditions like cancers and aneurysms and guides doctors through complicated procedures.",
      "But the new data collection rules from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued in the closing months of the Biden administration are aimed at making imaging safer. They also require a more careful assessment of the dosing, quality, and necessity of CT scans.",
      "The requirements, rolled out in January, are being phased in over about three years for hospitals, outpatient settings, and physicians. Under the complicated reporting system, not every radiologist or health care setting is required to comply immediately. Providers could face financial penalties under Medicare if they don\u2019t comply, though those will be phased in, too, starting in 2027.",
      "When the Biden administration issued the new guidelines, a CMS spokesperson said in an email that excessive and unnecessary radiation exposure was a health risk that could be addressed through measurement and feedback to hospitals and physicians. The agency at the time declined to make an official available for an interview. The Trump administration did not respond to a request for comment for this article.",
      "The Leapfrog Group, an organization that tracks hospital safety, welcomed the new rules. \u201cRadiation exposure is a very serious patient safety issue, so we commend CMS for focusing on CT scans,\u201d said Leah Binder, the group\u2019s president and CEO. Leapfrog has set standards for pediatric exposure to imaging radiation, \u201cand we find significant variation among hospitals,\u201d Binder added.",
      "CMS contracted with UCSF in 2019 to research solutions aimed at encouraging better measurement and assessment of CTs, leading to the development of the agency\u2019s new approach.",
      "The American College of Radiology and three other associations involved in medical imaging, however, objected to the draft CMS rules when they were under review, arguing in written comments in 2023 that they were excessively cumbersome, would burden providers, and could add to the cost of scans. The group was also concerned, at that time, that health providers would have to use a single, proprietary tech tool for gathering the dosing and any related scan data.",
      "The single company in question, Alara Imaging, supplies free software that radiologists and radiology programs need to comply with the new regulations. The promise to keep it free is included in the company\u2019s copyright. Smith-Bindman is a co-founder of Alara Imaging, and UCSF also has a stake in the company, which is developing other health tech products unrelated to the CMS imaging rule that it does plan to commercialize.",
      "But the landscape has recently changed. ACR said in a statement from Judy Burleson, ACR vice president for quality management programs, that CMS is allowing in other vendors \u2014 and that ACR itself is \u201cin discussion with Alara\u201d on the data collection and submission. In addition, a company called Medisolv, which works on health care quality, said at least one client is working with another vendor, Imalogix, on the CT dose data.",
      "Several dozen health quality and safety organizations \u2014 including some national leaders in patient safety, like the Institute of Healthcare Improvement \u2014 have supported CMS\u2019 efforts.",
      "Concerns about CT dosing are long-standing. A landmark study published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2009 by a research team that included experts from the National Cancer Institute, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and universities estimated that CT scans were responsible for 29,000 excess cancer cases a year in the United States, about 2% of all cases diagnosed annually.",
      "But the number of CT scans kept climbing. By 2016, it was estimated at 74 million, up 20% in a decade, though radiologists say dosages of radiation per scan have declined. Some researchers have noted that U.S. doctors order far more imaging than physicians in other developed countries, arguing some of it is wasteful and dangerous.",
      "More recent studies, some looking at pediatric patients and some drawing on radiation exposure data from survivors of the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, have also identified CT scan risk.",
      "Older people may face greater cancer risks because of imaging they had earlier in life. And scientists have emphasized the need to be particularly careful with children, who may be more vulnerable to radiation exposure while young and face the consequences of cumulative exposure as they age.",
      "Max Wintermark, a neuroradiologist at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who has been involved in the field\u2019s work on appropriate utilization of imaging, said doctors generally follow dosing protocols for CT scans. In addition, the technology is improving; he expects artificial intelligence to soon help doctors determine optimal imaging use and dosing, delivering \u201cthe minimum amount of radiation dose to get us to the diagnosis that we\u2019re trying to reach.\u201d",
      "But he said he welcomes the new CMS regulations.",
      "\u201cI think the measures will help accelerate the transition towards always lower and lower doses,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are helpful.\u201d"

      "NBC News does not name victims of sexual abuse unless they are willing to be publicly identified. Stephanie and one of the other interviewees agreed to the use of their first names.",
      "Le Scouarnec began abusing her in 1985 when she was just 6, St\u00e9phanie said, adding that it began after she started staying at his family home near Loches, a quaint medieval town around 200 miles east of Vannes.",
      "Le Scouarnec invited St\u00e9phanie to stay at his family home after her father died of a heart attack at age 52. It looked like he was helping out her mother, now 89, who had four older daughters and worked with him as a medical assistant at a private clinic.",
      "Living in the same home as Le Scouarnec, his then-wife Marie-France Lhermitte, now 71, and their three sons, all of whom are younger than St\u00e9phanie, she said the abuse started immediately.",
      "Lhermitte testified that she knew \u201cnothing\u201d of her husband\u2019s 30-year history of abusing children, including members of their family, until his arrest in 2017. Her sons, ages 44, 42 and 38, told the court they did not suspect anything at the time.",
      "St\u00e9phanie said some of her memories, like times and dates of the abuse, are patchy. But like many of his victims, she was able to fill in the blanks because Le Scouarnec carefully chronicled his abuse in digital diaries he kept on hard drives, which were seized by police when they raided his home in May 2017, according to testimony in court. Some of the diary entries have been projected onto a screen in the courtroom.",
      "Dating back to the mid-1980s they show that the majority of his victims \u2014 256 \u2014 were under age 15 at the time they were assaulted. The average age of the alleged victims in the current trial \u2014 158 male and 141 female \u2014 is 11. Most were under the effects of anesthesia or recovering from surgery.",
      "Each time she visited Le Scouarnec\u2019s home, St\u00e9phanie said she knew what was going to happen, \u201cbut I don\u2019t feel I can refuse.\u201d Although she resisted a few times, she said he told her, \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything bad.\u201d",
      "Other victims have also recounted hearing those words.",
      "For years, \u201cthere was a lot of suffering, shame,\u201d she said, adding that the abuse stopped when she was around 12, after she changed schools and declined to sleep at his house. \u201cI got older,\u201d she said. \u201cI am out of the Le Scouarnec prison.\u201d",
      "But St\u00e9phanie said she didn\u2019t have the courage to tell anyone. She credited several years of therapy she sought as an adult with helping her to rebuild her confidence. \u201cBeing freed from this secret buried for so many years was the beginning of my reconstruction,\u201d she said.",
      "While her mother was unaware of the abuse, one of Le Scouarnec\u2019s nieces, Alexandra, 47, said she did speak up, but he was protected by \u201cthe silence of incest.\u201d",
      "Now a nurse, Alexandra said she thought she was her uncle\u2019s first victim, adding that he started abusing her around 1982, when she was 5. Le Scouarnec, she said, would prey on her during piano lessons and sleepovers at his house, often when other family members were present in the home.",
      "Some of the assaults took place in the bathroom, leaving her scared to go, she said, adding that she was also left terrified of medical exams. One one occasion, she said, she screamed \u201cto death like a hysteric\u201d and had to be held down as a doctor approached her.",
      "Alexandra said she was 20 when she told her mother about the abuse after hearing that Le Scouarnec had locked himself and a little girl in a bathroom two years earlier.",
      "But although her mom confronted her sister, Lhermitte, Alexandra said she balked at confronting Le Scouarnec himself.",
      "\u201cThis person was so highly regarded in our family that she [felt she] didn\u2019t have the right to go up to him and say, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019\u201d she added.",
      "Calling Alexandra \u201cdevious,\u201d Lhermitte denied in court that she knew about the abuse until her husband\u2019s arrest. Le Scouarnec\u2019s diaries, however, refer to the \u201ccataclysm\u201d that resulted in 1996 when \u201cshe\u201d learned \u201cI\u2019m a pedophile.\u201d Investigators said the \u201cshe\u201d he was referring to was Lhermitte.",
      "Alexandra\u2019s cousin, 34, whom NBC News has agreed not to name, said she feared the \u201ctsunami\u201d she would trigger if she told police about the things her uncle began doing to her at age 3.",
      "\u201cWe come from a family that doesn\u2019t make waves,\u201d she said, adding that eventually she told her mother and older sister in October 2000, when she was 10.",
      "In emotional court testimony late last month, the cousin\u2019s mother, Annie, 72, said she confronted her brother, who immediately confessed. Asked by Presiding Judge Aude Buresi why she didn\u2019t go to the police, she said she thought her daughter \u201cwas the only victim and it would never happen again.\u201d But in 2017, she said she learned from police that her older daughter, now 39, had also been abused.",
      "St\u00e9phanie and Alexandra, who are due to testify Monday, have disputed Lhermitte\u2019s claim that she was unaware of the abuse, as had Alexandra\u2019s cousin.",
      "Alexandra called her account \u201ca pack of lies.\u201d Le Scouarnec\u2019s brother Patrick Le Scouarnec, 70, told the court by video link last week that Lhermitte knew about her husband\u2019s actions during the same period. \u201cThere\u2019s one person who could have had my brother arrested and that\u2019s his wife, Marie-France,\u201d he said.",
      "In France, defendants may respond to witnesses if the judge allows it, and Le Scouarnec admitted that he carried out \u201chideous\u201d crimes. After Annie\u2019s testimony, he told the court that he could not \u201cmake up for the harm I have done to my niece.\u201d",
      "For the first time he also admitted to abusing his granddaughter and that he used his \u201cstatus as a doctor\u201d to assault kids. His \u201cpedophile activity had no impact on my professional activity,\u201d he told the court in a subsequent declaration.",
      "His lawyer, Maxime Tessier, has said he has not admitted to all of the facts of the case.",
      "If convicted, he faces a maximum of 20 years in prison, which would run concurrently with the\u00a0 15 years he is already serving\u00a0 for the rape\u00a0of two of his nieces, a young patient and a 6-year-old neighbor, whose parents reported the attack to police in 2017.",
      "He was also convicted in 2005 of possessing thousands of images depicting child abuse that he downloaded from an internet site monitored by the FBI. He was given a four-month suspended sentence but was nonetheless allowed to carry on working at\u00a0 numerous public hospitals and private clinics in five regions of France.",
      "When reports \u201cexploded\u201d in the press in the summer of 2019 that Le Scouarnec may have sexually abused scores of children, St\u00e9phanie said she decided tell her mother that the respected doctor she was flattered to call a friend had raped her too.",
      "\u201cI protected my mother,\u201d she said. \u201cWho\u2019d have thought that a little girl who just lost her daddy would accuse a surgeon of raping her.\u201d",
      "Her mother \u201cbelieved me straight away,\u201d she said, adding that her mom felt enormously guilty and told her \u201cshe\u2019d blame herself for the rest of her life.\u201d",
      "The crimes against St\u00e9phanie and Alexandra\u00a0occurred too long ago to be prosecuted under French law. Calling for more support for victims of sexual abuse, both said they hoped France would extend the statute of limitations and toughen penalties for pedophiles.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a real public health issue\u201d that \u201csociety as a whole\u201d must confront, St\u00e9phanie said.",
      "The women said they were inspired by Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, who emerged as an icon of strength in France after she allowed her mass rape trial to be opened to the public last year.",
      "\u201cI had to fight to be the person I am today,\u201d St\u00e9phanie said. \u201cWe need to help victims rebuild their lives.\u201d",
      "If you are a child being abused, or know a child who may be facing abuse, call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at\u00a0(800) 422-4453, or go to\u00a0www.childhelphotline.org. States often have child abuse hotlines, but if you suspect a child\u2019s life is in imminent danger, call 911.",

    "published": "Sat, 08 Mar 2025 12:04:00 GMT",
    "summary": "The decision to end temporary protected status for 500,000 Haitians living in the U.S. may force most of them to return to a country in crisis.",
    "story": [
      "The same day Geslain Luma, a 29-year-old Haitian immigrant, learned he was granted temporary protected status to remain in the United States was the same day President Donald Trump announced plans to cut the program short.",
      "Figuring out his future with \u201cthe end of TPS gives me a headache,\u201d Luma said.",
      "For more than 15 years, TPS has allowed thousands of Haitians to work legally in the U.S. and avoid deportation while their homeland grapples with political instability, gang violence and economic hardship.",
      "Since the assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in 2021, armed gangs have gained control over much of Port-au-Prince, creating a power vacuum that has made governing a challenge and fueled further violence, homelessness and starvation. More than 5,600 people were killed and 1,400 were kidnapped amid gang conflicts last year, according to the United Nations. The violence has rendered 1 million people homeless in Haiti, forcing many into makeshift shelters and exacerbating the country\u2019s economic challenges.",
      "But with the Trump administration\u2019s decision to end TPS by August 2025, an estimated 500,000 Haitian immigrants living in the U.S. face an uncertain future, forced to decide whether to stay and fight for legal status or prepare for a return to a country in crisis.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security responded to a request for comment.",
      "In and around New York City, where at least 160,000 Haitian people live, Brooklyn\u2019s Haitian community has formed deep roots while also sharing fears of deportation. Evangelical Crusade Christian Church in the Flatbush neighborhood has served as a sanctuary for Haitian immigrants for at least five decades, providing a range of services, including food pantries, wellness events and legal assistance.",
      "\u201cThe community is worried,\u201d said the Rev. Samuel Nicolas, the church\u2019s senior pastor. \u201cFor over 15 years, these individuals have built their lives here, believing TPS would eventually lead to permanent residency. Now, they are watching that hope slip away.\u201d",
      "Many fled the country after a devastating earthquake struck Haiti in 2010, killing more than 200,000 people and leaving an estimated 1.3 million people homeless. In the aftermath, people arrived in the U.S. and gained TPS protection, seeking stability that allowed them to rebuild their lives. But the program was never meant to be a permanent solution.",
      "Abigail Desravines, a 35-year-old Haitian immigrant, came to the U.S. following the earthquake.",
      "\u201cThe conditions were getting worse and worse,\u201d Desravines recalled. Family members in the U.S. \u201cwere calling, asking what we were going to do. We told them we wanted to come here for school because I could not stay in Haiti for school. I lost classmates. There was a lot of loss.\u201d",
      "Desravines said TPS allowed her and her sister to build a life in the U.S., and she eventually earned a green card. Despite the protection it offered, Desravines said living under TPS still involved hurdles and instability.",
      "\u201cPeople think TPS is a free pass, but it\u2019s not,\u201d Desravines said. \u201cYou have to keep renewing, pay fees and live with the fear that it could end at any time. It\u2019s not an easy path.\u201d",
      "On top of paying fees, some colleges require TPS holders to pay tuition \u201cout of pocket like international students,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though we lived in the U.S. for years, some colleges did not allow us in-state tuition.\u201d",
      "Desravines\u2019 parents remained in Haiti while she and her sister lived with extended family and continued their education. While adjusting to life in the U.S., the sisters quietly shouldered the burdens of work, studies and immigration uncertainties, without adding further stress to their parents as they dealt with the earthquake\u2019s aftermath.",
      "\u201cMy parents had their own struggles,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had the opportunity to come to the U.S., and we did not want our parents to worry. But it affected us emotionally, and it did affect our grades.\u201d",
      "The end of the program will create a disruption, as many TPS holders have jobs, attend school and are parts of their communities.",
      "For those now facing the threat of deportation, the prospect of returning to Haiti is daunting. The country remains plagued by instability, and Nicolas said he believes sending people back under these conditions is inhumane.",
      "\u201cHaiti is not in a place where people with TPS or those under humanitarian programs can return,\u201d he said. \u201cHaiti is being overrun by armed groups and the infrastructure is barely functioning.\u201d",
      "Luma, the new TPS recipient, said he has also applied for asylum and holds a work permit, which is valid until 2029. However, his legal status is not guaranteed \u2014 in 2027, a judge will decide his asylum claim.",
      "\u201cWhen you appear before a judge, you never know what decision they will make, so TPS would have been an extra layer of security in a difficult situation,\u201d he said. Luma said he was concerned for friends and relatives who rely solely on TPS.",
      "\u201cA person with only TPS works, buys a car, buys a house, and now all their documents will expire,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have no choice but to self-deport because there\u2019s no way to live without legal documents.\u201d",
      "Many immigrants send money for food, education and health care to their families in Haiti, Nicolas said. \u201cIf they are deported, that financial support will disappear, worsening Haiti\u2019s humanitarian crisis.\u201d",
      "Nicolas said the deportations will also have a social and economic impact in the States.",
      "\u201cHaitians are part of the fabric of New York,\u201d he said. \u201cThey fill our churches, they work in jobs others won\u2019t take, they contribute to our economy. If TPS ends, it won\u2019t just be a Haitian problem, it will be a New York problem and a national problem.\u201d",
      "Immigrant advocacy groups are calling for legislative action to protect TPS holders, pushing for a pathway to residency for those who have lived in the U.S. for years. A group of organizations filed a lawsuit Monday seeking to block the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to end TPS for Haitians early. Nicolas said he hopes Congress steps in to provide relief, or that Trump has a change of heart.",
      "\u201cMy hope is that our president will have a compassionate heart and recognize that Haiti is not a place these people can return to,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere would they go? What infrastructure is in place for them? If we call ourselves a nation built on Christian values, then we must act with compassion.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "An Israeli airstrike killed two Palestinians in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on Saturday, medical sources said, as mediators pushed ahead with talks to extend a\u00a0shaky\u00a042-day ceasefire agreed in January between Israel and Hamas.",
      "The Israeli military said its aircraft struck a drone that crossed from Israel into southern Gaza and \u201cseveral suspects\u201d who tried to collect it in what appeared to be a botched smuggling attempt.",
      "The strike comes one day after an Israeli drone strike\u00a0killed two people\u00a0in Gaza on Friday. The Israeli military said it attacked a group of suspected militants operating near its troops in northern Gaza and planting an explosive device in the ground.",
      "The fresh attacks come as a delegation from Hamas engages in ceasefire talks in Cairo with Egyptian mediators who have been helping facilitate the talks along with officials from Qatar, aiming to proceed to the next stage of the deal, which could open the way to ending the war.",
      "Hamas said there are \u201cpositive indicators\u201d over the possible start of negotiations for the second phase of the ceasefire deal, without giving further details.",
      "\u201cWe affirm our readiness to engage in the second-phase negotiations in a way that meets the demands of our people, and we call for intensified efforts to aid the Gaza Strip and lift the blockade on our suffering people,\u201d the group\u2019s spokesman, Abdel-Latif Al-Qanoua, said in a statement.",
      "The Gaza ceasefire deal that took effect in January calls for the remaining 59 hostages in Hamas captivity to be freed in a second phase, during which final plans would be negotiated for an end to the war.",
      "The first phase of the ceasefire ended last week, and Israel has since imposed a total blockade on all goods entering the enclave, demanding that Hamas free remaining hostages without beginning the negotiations to end the Gaza war.",
      "Fighting has been halted since January 19 and Hamas has released 33 Israeli hostages and five Thais for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Israeli authorities believe fewer than half of the remaining 59 hostages are still alive.",
      "Israel\u2019s assault on the enclave has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities. It has also internally displaced nearly Gaza\u2019s entire population and led to accusations of genocide and war crimes that Israel denies.",
      "The assault began after Hamas-led Islamist fighters raided southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages, according to Israeli tallies."

    "story": [
      "After a long winter of short days, it's finally time to spring forward.",
      "Clocks across the U.S. will jump from 1:59 a.m. to 3 a.m. Sunday.",
      "Here's what you need to know about daylight saving time and why we change the clocks twice a year in the U.S.",
      "When does daylight saving time end?",
      "Daylight saving time will start Sunday and last until Nov. 2. Standard time was in effect from Nov. 3, 2024, until Sunday.",
      "The springtime clocks change differs from the fall. Unlike the fall, when we gain an extra hour and the clocks fall back, we lose an hour in the spring.",
      "But that turns into longer days and brighter evenings as the spring and summer months begin. It will remain in effect until we turn the clocks back to standard time, which comes back into effect on Nov. 2 as we ready for winter and usher in an era of shorter days.",
      "Why do we change the clocks?",
      "The U.S. has been observing daylight saving time since 1918, with the establishment of the Standard Time Act, according to the\u00a0U.S. Astronomical Applications Department. It was implemented in an effort to extend summertime daylight hours by pushing off sunset an hour.",
      "Daylight saving time wasn't totally accepted when it was first passed \u2014\u00a0it was quickly repealed in 1919, making the changing of the clocks a local matter. The practice was officially re-instated during the early days of World War II and was observed from 1942-1945, according to the department.",
      "Daylight saving time varied by state following the war and until 1966, when the Uniform Time Act passed, which standardized dates of daylight saving time, but allowed for states and localities to opt out of the practice if they did not want to participate.",
      "Since that act passed, the standardized dates have been changed throughout the years, according to the department.",
      "But the dates have remained the same since 2007. Since then, daylight saving time had started on the second Sunday in March and ended on the first Sunday in November.",
      "Are there any states that don\u2019t observe the time change?",
      "Yes. Residents in Hawaii and most of Arizona won\u2019t lose an hour of sleep Sunday night. The two states do not observe daylight saving time and do not change the clocks twice a year, according to the Astronomical Applications Department.",
      "Is anyone trying to end daylight saving time?",
      "The\u00a0U.S. Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act, which would make daylight saving time permanent year-round and usher out the era of changing our clocks, in March 2022. Under the bill, Hawaii and most of Arizona would continue to observe year-round standard time.",
      "But the bill stalled in the House of Representatives, so the U.S. will continue to flip the clocks every six months until new legislation is passed in the House and Senate and then signed by the sitting president.",
      "President Donald Trump addressed the practice this week when asked by a reporter when he is going to \"get rid of\" daylight saving time.",
      "\"I assume people would like to have more light late, but some people want to have more light earlier because they don't want to take their kids to school in the dark,\" he said, calling the issue \"50-50.\"",
      "\"But a lot of people like it one way, a lot of people like it the other way. It's very even,\" he said. \"And usually, I find when that's the case, what else do we have to do?\"",
      "Shortly after winning the election last year, Trump said he and Republicans would try to \"eliminate\" daylight saving time, calling it inconvenient and costly. It was unclear at the time whether he was referring to eliminating daylight saving time or making it permanent.",
      "Almost all U.S. states have considered legislation to avoid changing the clocks, staying on either standard or daylight saving time year-round.",
      "In the last six years, 20 states have passed bills or resolutions to codify year-round daylight saving time, according to the\u00a0National Conference of State Legislatures. But since federal law does not currently allow year-round daylight saving time, those states are in a holding pattern until Congress passes the bill to make the change.",
      "Is the U.S. the only country that changes the clocks?",
      "No, many other countries observe some version of \u201csummer time,\u201d whether that\u2019s daylight saving time or their own version. Not all do so on the same schedule as the U.S., though.",
      "In the Southern Hemisphere, for example, the seasons are swapped, so the start and end date of \u201csummer time\u201d are reversed from ours, according to the Astronomical Applications Department.",
      "What do health experts say?",
      "Some studies suggest that using daylight saving time year-round could reduce the\u00a0number of traffic accidents\u00a0and the\u00a0amount of crime, but a number of experts are against longer days year-round.",
      "According to some sleep experts, the sun should reach the highest point in the sky at noon, or solar time, which occurs during standard time.",
      "A study from\u00a0June 2022\u00a0found that people whose clock times weren\u2019t closely aligned with the sun had 22% higher road fatality rates than those living within 30 minutes of solar time."

      "\u201cEssentially what you have is DOGE just swooping in and bullying their way into access to millions of Americans private data. They cannot explain why they want this data. They can\u2019t really tell you what data they want. They just want everything. They want the source code, and they want to do it without any restrictions,\u201d she said.",
      "The Social Security Administration did not immediately respond to a request Saturday for comment on the lawsuit, which was originally filed last month.",
      "DOGE\u2019s work during the early stages of the Trump administration has drawn nearly two dozen lawsuits. Judges have raised questions in several cases about DOGE\u2019s sweeping cost-cutting efforts, conducted with little public information about its staffing and operations. But judges have not always agreed that the risks are imminent enough to block DOGE from government systems.",
      "Across-the-board cuts at the Social Security Administration are prompting questions about the possible effects on benefits for tens of millions of recipients.",
      "Among the potential changes at the agency are layoffs for more than 10% of the workforce and the closure of dozens of offices throughout the country. It\u2019s all part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce.",
      "DOGE has accessed other government databases, including at the Treasury and IRS. The Trump administration has said generally that the efforts are aimed at eliminating what it claims is waste and fraud in government.",
      "On Friday, a federal judge in Washington refused to block DOGE employees from accessing Treasury systems containing sensitive personal data for millions of people. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly did acknowledge privacy concerns about that work. DOGE is still limited by a different court order in New York.",
      "In addition, a February agreement between the Office of Personnel Management and the IRS states that a DOGE employee, Gavin Kliger, would be allowed to have access to IRS systems, but not the personal information of taxpayers."

    "story": [
      "North Korea unveiled for the first time a nuclear-powered submarine under construction, a weapons system that can pose a major security threat to South Korea and the U.S.",
      "State media on Saturday released photos showing what it called \u201ca nuclear-powered strategic guided missile submarine,\u201d as it reported leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s visits to major shipyards where warships are built.",
      "The Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, didn\u2019t provide details on the submarine, but said Kim was briefed on its construction.",
      "The naval vessel appears to be a 6,000-ton-class or 7,000-ton-class one which can carry about 10 missiles, said Moon Keun-sik, a South Korean submarine expert who teaches at Seoul\u2019s Hanyang University. He said the use of the term \u201cthe strategic guided missiles\u201d meant it would carry nuclear-capable weapons.",
      "\u201cIt would be absolutely threatening to us and the U.S.,\u201d Moon said.",
      "A nuclear-powered submarine was among a long wishlist of sophisticated weaponry that Kim vowed to introduce during a major political conference in 2021 to cope with what he called escalating U.S.-led military threats. Other weapons were\u00a0solid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missiles,\u00a0hypersonic weapons, spy satellites and\u00a0multi-warhead missiles.\u00a0North Korea has since performed a run of testing activities to acquire them.",
      "North Korea obtaining a greater ability to fire missiles from underwater is a worrying development because it\u2019s difficult for its rivals to detect such launches in advance.",
      "Questions about how North Korea, a heavily sanctioned and impoverished country, could get resources and technology to build nuclear-powered submarines have surfaced.",
      "Moon, the submarine expert, said North Korea may have received\u00a0Russian\u00a0technological assistance to build a nuclear reactor to be used in the submarine in return for supplying conventional weapons and troops to support Russia\u2019s war efforts against Ukraine.",
      "He also said North Korea could launch the submarine in one or two years to test its capability before its actual deployment.",
      "North Korea has an estimated 70-90 diesel-powered submarines in one of the world\u2019s largest fleets. However, they are mostly aging ones capable of launching only torpedoes and mines, not missiles.",
      "In 2023, North Korea said it had launched what it called its first\u00a0\u201ctactical nuclear attack submarine,\u201d\u00a0but foreign experts doubted the North\u2019s announcement and speculated it was likely a diesel-powered submarine disclosed in 2019. Moon said there has been no confirmation that it has been deployed.",
      "North Korea has conducted a slew of\u00a0underwater-launched ballistic missile tests\u00a0since 2016, but all launches were made from the same 2,000-ton-class submarine which has a single launch tube. Many experts call it a test platform, rather than an operational submarine in active service.",
      "In recent days, North Korea has been dialing up its\u00a0fiery rhetoric\u00a0against the U.S. and South Korea ahead of their upcoming\u00a0annual military drills\u00a0set to start Monday.",
      "During his visits to the shipyards, Kim said North Korea aims to modernize water-surface and underwater warships simultaneously. He stressed the need to make \u201cthe incomparably overwhelming warships fulfill their mission\u201d to contain \u201cthe inveterate gunboat diplomacy of the hostile forces,\u201d KCNA reported Saturday."

      "Russian strikes on Ukraine have killed at least 20 people, officials said Saturday, as heavy aerial attacks continued into the second night following a U.S. decision to\u00a0stop sharing satellite images\u00a0with Ukraine.",
      "The decision to withhold intelligence and military aid came on the heels of\u00a0a tempestuous White House visit\u00a0last week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Without U.S. satellite imagery, Ukraine\u2019s ability to strike inside Russia and defend itself from bombardment is\u00a0significantly diminished.",
      "At least 11 people were killed in multiple strikes on a town in Ukraine\u2019s embattled Donetsk region late Friday, regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said. The attack damaged eight apartment blocks in the town of Dobropillya, which is close to the front where Russian troops have been making steady advances. Ukraine\u2019s State Emergency Service said a Russian drone damaged a Ukrainian fire truck while rescuers fought to extinguish the burning buildings.",
      "Another six people were killed in the front-line towns of Pokrovsk, Kostyantynivka, Myrnograd and Ivanopillya, Filashkin said, while emergency services reported that three others died when a Russian drone hit a civilian workshop in the northeastern Kharkiv region.",
      "Filashkin declared Saturday a day of mourning in the region and warned that more victims could still be found in the rubble.",
      "Zelenskyy said at least five children were among the injured in Dobropillya. \u201cLast night, the Russian army fired two ballistic missiles at the center of Dobropillya,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter emergency services arrived at the scene, they launched another strike, deliberately targeting rescuers. It is a vile and inhumane intimidation tactic to which the Russians often resort.\u201d",
      "The wave of attacks took place just 24 hours after Russia hit Ukrainian energy facilities with dozens of missiles and drones, hobbling its ability to deliver heat and light to its citizens and to power weapons factories vital to its defenses.",
      "The barrage came after the U.S.\u00a0suspended military aid and intelligence\u00a0to Ukraine to pressure it into accepting a peace deal being pushed by the Trump administration.",
      "When asked Friday by a reporter during an Oval Office exchange if Russian President Vladimir Putin was taking advantage of the U.S. pause on intelligence-sharing to attack Ukraine, President Donald Trump responded: \u201cI think he\u2019s doing what anybody else would.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy did not reference the intelligence-sharing deal, but did seem to appeal to other statements Trump made Friday related to financial sanctions against Moscow. Writing on social media, the U.S. president\u00a0proposed imposing large-scale\u00a0banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a cease-fire and final peace settlement was reached.",
      "Zelenskyy welcomed the prospect of additional sanctions on Moscow, saying, \u201cEverything that helps Putin finance the war must be broken.\u201d",
      "Ukraine\u2019s air force reported Saturday that Russian troops launched three Iskander missiles and 145 drones over the country overnight. The bombardment contained a mix of attack and decoy drones intended to confuse air defenses. One missile and 79 drones were shot down, while 54 more drones were lost without causing damage, the Ukrainian air force said.",
      "Meanwhile, Russian troops shot down 31 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 26 over the country\u2019s Krasnodar region, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said Saturday.",
      "Falling debris from one drone sparked a blaze at the KINEF oil refinery in Russia\u2019s northern Leningrad region, local Gov. Aleksandr Drozdenko said in a statement. No casualties were reported."

      "But for years, the guesthouse in Great Yarmouth, a run-down resort town on Britain\u2019s east coast, played host to a freelance spy ring orchestrating cross-continental honeytraps, kidnappings, and murder plots\u00a0targeting high-profile dissidents and sensitive military sites.",
      "The details, which seem pulled straight from a spy novel, unfolded in British courts last week after three Bulgarians were found guilty of conspiracy to spy \u2014 members of a Russian ring operating from their base in the United Kingdom.",
      "Gabriela Gaberova, 30, a beautician tapped to carry out honeytraps; Katrin Ivanova, 33, a lab assistant who was also found guilty of \"possessing identity documents with improper intention;\" and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, a painter-decorator and Gaberova\u2019s former partner, made up the ragtag group of amateur operatives who managed to carry out espionage operations for the Kremlin on what prosecutors described as being on \"an industrial scale.\"",
      "Their handler, a fellow Bulgarian named Biser Dzhambazov, called himself \"Mad Max\" and doubled as a medical courier as well as a knot in the spy ring's tangled romantic subplot.",
      "Dzhambazov lived with Ivanova before ending their long-term relationship after developing feelings for Gaberova. When police raided the beautician\u2019s northwest London flat in February 2023, they found Dzhambazov and Gaberova in bed together.",
      "Their ringleader was a fifth Bulgarian, Orlin Roussev, part spy, part IT specialist, who adopted the name \u201cJackie Chan\u201d in messages to his side-kick, Dzhambazov.",
      "Roussev and Dzhambazov both pled guilty to espionage charges following their arrest in 2023.\u00a0A sixth Bulgarian, a mixed martial arts fighter code name \u201cThe Destroyer,\u201d real name Ivan Stoyanov, also admitted spying for Russia.",
      "Meanwhile, Roussev\u2019s \u2018minions\u2019 \u2014 which he named after the yellow characters from the Despicable Me animated series \u2014 denied the charges.",
      "Instead of being part of the cartoon villain Gru\u2019s scheme, these defendants were real-life operatives working for the Russian intelligence service, also named GRU.",
      "From 2020 to 2023, the gang carried out a series of chaotic and often disorganized covert missions, one of which targeted Christo Grozev, an investigative journalist renowned for exposing Russian involvement in\u00a0the poisoning of MI6 double agent Sergei Skripal with Novichok nerve agent in Salisbury, in southern England, in March 2018.",
      "The group tracked his movements across Austria, Montenegro, and Spain, even considering a honeytrap, with Gaberova potentially involved in the scheme.",
      "In 2022, they surveilled Roman Dobrokhotov, a journalist critical of Russia, with discussions of a possible kidnapping. Telegram messages show the group followed him from Budapest to Berlin before losing him at passport control.",
      "In another bizarre plot, the group planned to spray the Kazakh Embassy in London with what Britain's Crown Prosecution Service described as \"large quantities of fake pig\u2019s blood.\" They also schemed to create a false opposition group to stage a protest outside the embassy, and feed the sham information about the fake group to Kazakh Intelligence, in order to boost Russia\u2019s image.",
      "The group also tracked Kirill Kachur, a former Russian official, in Montenegro, planning a kidnapping. They surveilled a U.S. military base in Stuttgart, focusing on Ukrainian forces. Additionally, they conducted covert operations against former Kazakh politician Bergey Ryskaliyev, attempting to access his residence and gather intelligence.",
      "Investigators uncovered a trove of over 200,000 messages between the operatives, as well as spy equipment worth tens of thousands of dollars, including cameras hidden in pens and ties, and videos showing the group surveilling specific sites of interest.",
      "In addition to espionage, the group was implicated in broader Russian efforts to influence foreign political climates and destabilize rival nations.",
      "The three defendants will be held in custody until sentencing in May.",
      "Commander Dominic Murphy, head of Scotland Yard's SO15 which deals with state threats, said it was one of the U.K.'s largest espionage investigations of the last 15 years.",
      "Prosecutors said\u00a0the group was directed by alleged Russian agent\u00a0Jan Marsalek, an Austrian national,\u00a0who had contact with Russian intelligence agencies.",
      "The shadowy former COO of Wirecard, who is wanted Germany and subject to an Interpol red notice,\u00a0had fled to\u00a0Russia, where he allegedly ran the Bulgarian network.",
      "Marsalek and Roussev discussed the kidnap and murder of both Grozev and Kirill Kachur, who had worked for the Investigative Committee of Russia until falling out with the Kremlin.",
      "Gaberova, Ivanchev, and Ivanova claimed they didn't know who they were working for, or that they were lied to by their superiors.",

      "The same day Geslain Luma, a 29-year-old Haitian immigrant, learned he was granted temporary protected status to remain in the United States was the same day President Donald Trump announced plans to cut the program short.",
      "Figuring out his future with \u201cthe end of TPS gives me a headache,\u201d Luma said.",
      "For more than 15 years, TPS has allowed thousands of Haitians to work legally in the U.S. and avoid deportation while their homeland grapples with political instability, gang violence and economic hardship.",
      "Since the assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in 2021, armed gangs have gained control over much of Port-au-Prince, creating a power vacuum that has made governing a challenge and fueled further violence, homelessness and starvation. More than 5,600 people were killed and 1,400 were kidnapped amid gang conflicts last year, according to the United Nations. The violence has rendered 1 million people homeless in Haiti, forcing many into makeshift shelters and exacerbating the country\u2019s economic challenges.",
      "But with the Trump administration\u2019s decision to end TPS by August 2025, an estimated 500,000 Haitian immigrants living in the U.S. face an uncertain future, forced to decide whether to stay and fight for legal status or prepare for a return to a country in crisis.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security responded to a request for comment.",
      "In and around New York City, where at least 160,000 Haitian people live, Brooklyn\u2019s Haitian community has formed deep roots while also sharing fears of deportation. Evangelical Crusade Christian Church in the Flatbush neighborhood has served as a sanctuary for Haitian immigrants for at least five decades, providing a range of services, including food pantries, wellness events and legal assistance.",
      "\u201cThe community is worried,\u201d said the Rev. Samuel Nicolas, the church\u2019s senior pastor. \u201cFor over 15 years, these individuals have built their lives here, believing TPS would eventually lead to permanent residency. Now, they are watching that hope slip away.\u201d",
      "Many fled the country after a devastating earthquake struck Haiti in 2010, killing more than 200,000 people and leaving an estimated 1.3 million people homeless. In the aftermath, people arrived in the U.S. and gained TPS protection, seeking stability that allowed them to rebuild their lives. But the program was never meant to be a permanent solution.",
      "Abigail Desravines, a 35-year-old Haitian immigrant, came to the U.S. following the earthquake.",
      "\u201cThe conditions were getting worse and worse,\u201d Desravines recalled. Family members in the U.S. \u201cwere calling, asking what we were going to do. We told them we wanted to come here for school because I could not stay in Haiti for school. I lost classmates. There was a lot of loss.\u201d",
      "Desravines said TPS allowed her and her sister to build a life in the U.S., and she eventually earned a green card. Despite the protection it offered, Desravines said living under TPS still involved hurdles and instability.",
      "\u201cPeople think TPS is a free pass, but it\u2019s not,\u201d Desravines said. \u201cYou have to keep renewing, pay fees and live with the fear that it could end at any time. It\u2019s not an easy path.\u201d",
      "On top of paying fees, some colleges require TPS holders to pay tuition \u201cout of pocket like international students,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though we lived in the U.S. for years, some colleges did not allow us in-state tuition.\u201d",
      "Desravines\u2019 parents remained in Haiti while she and her sister lived with extended family and continued their education. While adjusting to life in the U.S., the sisters quietly shouldered the burdens of work, studies and immigration uncertainties, without adding further stress to their parents as they dealt with the earthquake\u2019s aftermath.",
      "\u201cMy parents had their own struggles,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had the opportunity to come to the U.S., and we did not want our parents to worry. But it affected us emotionally, and it did affect our grades.\u201d",
      "The end of the program will create a disruption, as many TPS holders have jobs, attend school and are parts of their communities.",
      "For those now facing the threat of deportation, the prospect of returning to Haiti is daunting. The country remains plagued by instability, and Nicolas said he believes sending people back under these conditions is inhumane.",
      "\u201cHaiti is not in a place where people with TPS or those under humanitarian programs can return,\u201d he said. \u201cHaiti is being overrun by armed groups and the infrastructure is barely functioning.\u201d",
      "Luma, the new TPS recipient, said he has also applied for asylum and holds a work permit, which is valid until 2029. However, his legal status is not guaranteed \u2014 in 2027, a judge will decide his asylum claim.",
      "\u201cWhen you appear before a judge, you never know what decision they will make, so TPS would have been an extra layer of security in a difficult situation,\u201d he said. Luma said he was concerned for friends and relatives who rely solely on TPS.",
      "\u201cA person with only TPS works, buys a car, buys a house, and now all their documents will expire,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have no choice but to self-deport because there\u2019s no way to live without legal documents.\u201d",
      "Many immigrants send money for food, education and health care to their families in Haiti, Nicolas said. \u201cIf they are deported, that financial support will disappear, worsening Haiti\u2019s humanitarian crisis.\u201d",
      "Nicolas said the deportations will also have a social and economic impact in the States.",
      "\u201cHaitians are part of the fabric of New York,\u201d he said. \u201cThey fill our churches, they work in jobs others won\u2019t take, they contribute to our economy. If TPS ends, it won\u2019t just be a Haitian problem, it will be a New York problem and a national problem.\u201d",

A group of organizations filed a lawsuit Monday seeking to block the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to end TPS for Haitians early. Nicolas said he hopes Congress steps in to provide relief, or that Trump has a change of heart.",
      "\u201cMy hope is that our president will have a compassionate heart and recognize that Haiti is not a place these people can return to,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere would they go? What infrastructure is in place for them? If we call ourselves a nation built on Christian values, then we must act with compassion.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "When Grant Fisher stepped off the track at Boston University on Feb. 14, it wasn\u2019t entirely a shock that the American distance runner had just broken the world record for the indoor 5,000 meters.",
      "For one thing, he was in great shape. Only six days earlier, Fisher, 27, who was coming off a breakout season in which he earned two silver medals at the Paris Olympics, had also broken the world record at 3,000 meters in New York City. Larger trends were also at play: He was running on one of the fastest tracks in the world, wearing Nike spikes whose carbon plates and advanced foams helped return energy with every stride.",
      "Yet in Boston, when Fisher was asked about the factors that had led to his pair of world records, he acknowledged one so surprisingly simple that it\u2019s probably in your kitchen.",
      "He\u2019d recently begun taking baking soda.",
      "\u201cI think it makes an impact, and if that impact is 1%, that would be massive,\u201d Fisher told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s probably more like 0.1%, if there is one. And if it is just mental, then I\u2019ll take that, too.\u201d",
      "Fisher is among the many professional runners in recent years to embrace baking soda \u2014 known within the sport by its scientific name, sodium bicarbonate, or simply \u201cbicarb\u201d \u2014 as a legal means of running faster times than ever. The use of a bicarbonate \u201csystem\u201d sold by Maurten, a Swedish company, has become so widespread that at track and field\u2019s world championships in 2023, two-thirds of all medalists from 800 to 10,000 meters were using it. At the Olympics last summer, more than two-thirds of all running medalists were using it \u2014 \u201cand in some cases, all the finalists were using it,\u201d the company told NBC News.",
      "In an eight-day span in February, seven of the sport\u2019s world records in races ranging from the 1,500 meters to the road half-marathon were smashed. The rapid-fire rewriting of professional running\u2019s record book can be traced to many reasons, from high-tech advancements leading to faster shoes and tracks, quicker recovery and better coaching.",
      "The combination has convinced Chris Woods, the head track coach at Mississippi State University, that not only \u201ca lot of world records are in jeopardy here in the very near future\u201d but that even times that once appeared unthinkable could now be possible, such as the record of 4:07 in the women\u2019s mile.",
      "\u201cIn my lifetime, in your lifetime, I do believe we\u2019ll see a woman break 4 minutes,\u201d Woods said.",
      "But increasingly, runners such as Marco Arop, the 2023 world champion at 800 meters from Canada, whom Woods coaches, are also turning to \u201cbicarb\u201d for an edge.",
      "Intense periods of exercise create a build-up of hydrogen ions in muscles, leading to acidity that can increase fatigue and create the \u201cburning\u201d sensation felt during hard exercise. As a base, sodium bicarbonate acts as a \u201cbuffer\u201d that counters the acidity. Taking sodium bicarbonate doesn\u2019t run afoul of World Anti-Doping Agency rules; in fact, even World Athletics, track and field\u2019s global governing body, has described it as an \u201cestablished performance supplement.\u201d",
      "The benefits of \u201cbicarb\u201d have been known for decades, said Steve Magness, a coach and former elite runner who has written multiple books about performance. But athletes have been wary of it for just as long for an often unpleasant reason: The odds of a performance boost had to be weighed against the risk of race-wrecking gastrointestinal distress.",
      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t work very well because there was a high percentage of people that just couldn\u2019t even line up for the race or the time trial because it just tore apart your stomach,\u201d Magness said.",
      "Fisher had heard so many \u201chorror stories\u201d of nausea, vomiting or diarrhea from using bicarbonate that he waited until this winter, after the all-important Olympics cycle, to test out a \u201cbicarb\u201d mixture in training. His stomach handled it fine, he said. And that may have been because in recent years, bicarb has hit a turning point.",
      "Maurten, the Swedish company, has found a way to encase small tablets of bicarbonate into a gooey, soup-like hydrogel that guides them through the stomach and into the intestine, where the bicarbonate is dissolved and absorbed with less potential nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, according to the company. Side effects of taking sodium include water retention and weight gain, and regularly increasing sodium intake may lead to an increase in blood pressure, the company says.",
      "Maurten\u2019s credibility was boosted when famed marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge used its products to set multiple world records. Other Maurten users include Keely Hodgkinson, the Olympic champion at 800 meters.",
      "Beyond the hydrogel, however, bicarb may have become more palatable for elite runners recently for another reason. Just as the Paris Olympics began, a study in the European Journal of Applied Physiology upended a long-held belief that sodium bicarbonate was most effective as a buffer in shorter competitions, lasting up to around 10 minutes.",
      "When researchers at Edge Hill University in the United Kingdom gave Maurten\u2019s bicarbonate product to male cyclists during a much longer, 40-kilometer time trial \u2014 nearly the length of a marathon \u2014 they measured a 1.4% boost in the cyclists\u2019 performance, with minimal stomach issues. In practice, it meant cyclists using the bicarbonate were nearly 1 minute faster over about an hour of riding, said Eli Spencer Shannon, a Ph.D. candidate who led the study.",
      "\u201cI would classify that as small but meaningful,\u201d Shannon said.",
      "The findings, Shannon said, should spark more research. Bicarb isn\u2019t \u201cone size fits all,\u201d he said, because each person\u2019s stomach distress can vary and because baking soda\u2019s effectiveness as a buffer depends on how hard an athlete can push; harder exercise produces more hydrogen ions in the muscle that the bicarbonate can then remove.",
      "Still, Shannon was surprised by some of his study\u2019s findings, such as that the riders using bicarbonate also were able to go faster without a change in their heart rate or the maximum amount of oxygen they were able to use during exercise, known as VO\u2082.",
      "\u201cWhat that\u2019s saying is that you\u2019re able to sort of work harder but have less cardiovascular strain and have a better performance improvement in comparison to a placebo, which was really interesting,\u201d Shannon said. \u201cThat suggests increased [muscle] contractility, which has never been seen, at this duration and at this intensity.\u201d",
      "Not all of track\u2019s recent world-record holders incorporate baking soda as a new tool in their training. American Yared Nuguse, who broke the indoor mile record on Feb. 8, only for Norwegian rival Jakob Ingebrigtsen to reset it five days later, has said he doesn\u2019t use bicarbonate because of its taste. But some of the world\u2019s fastest have taken note.",
      "Two days before last summer\u2019s Olympic semifinal in the men\u2019s 800 meters, Arop, a former basketball player who became the world champion at 800 meters for Canada, turned to Woods in France with less a question than a statement. He was set on trying bicarb. The 800 meters was in the middle of one of the fastest years in the sport\u2019s history, and Arop knew several of his competitors had used it with success.",
      "\u201cThis is the pinnacle of our sport, and I don\u2019t think he wanted to leave anything to chance,\u201d Woods said. \u201cAnd if there was a way to give a 1% advantage, that\u2019s what he was going to do. That\u2019s what he believed. And the results we were pretty happy with.\u201d",
      "Woods didn\u2019t know much about bicarb until Arop raised the topic in France, but he said he now believes there are scientific benefits.",
      "\u201cIs there a mental component to it? I would say absolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think this is a placebo.\u201d",
      "Arop went on to earn the silver medal in the fourth-fastest time in 800 meters history, edged from the gold by just one one-hundredth of a second by Kenya\u2019s Emmanuel Wanyonyi \u2014 who also was using Maurten\u2019s bicarbonate in Paris, according to the company. The 800-meter world record, set in 2012, could be the next to go down, with Wanyonyi just two-tenths of a second behind. After the race, Arop said he believed his last-minute addition of sodium bicarbonate had \u201cdefinitely played a factor\u201d in his personal-best time.",
      "\u201cEverybody else is using it, and it\u2019s been working wonders,\u201d Arop said in August.",
      "Not everybody uses it. Bicarbonate is just one factor of many that have sparked what Woods called \u201cthe golden era of track and field when it comes to running fast times,\u201d a boom he likened to the NBA in the 1980s, when the talent of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, coupled with better technology and rules changes, boosted its popularity.",
      "A \u201cshoe war,\u201d as Magness said, has broken out in a race to develop shoes that return the most energy using bulky yet light foams and carbon-fiber plates. Under athletes\u2019 feet, the physics of indoor tracks are also fueling faster times. The indoor track at Boston University, in particular, has become a destination because its wide, banked corners help runners ricochet around turns, and its above-ground frame made of wood and plywood can return energy like a mini-trampoline more than an outdoor track, where a rubber surface is poured over a concrete base.",
      "When Magness was running two decades ago, an information gap left him to wonder how East African competitors were training. Social media and the internet have opened access to other training methods and better coaching that don\u2019t burn out young runners and created a bigger pool of strong runners, Magness said. Those young athletes are watching peers run faster than ever and believing confidently they can, too.",
      "They are powered by cutting-edge advancements Roger Bannister could only have dreamed of when he was chasing the first sub-4-minute mile \u2014 along with a basic household item, too.",
      "\u201cWhat the last couple years have done is kind of shift that mindset of, like, here\u2019s the past and here\u2019s what we were able to do,\u201d Magness said. \u201cBut now the game has changed.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "CANANDAIGUA, N.Y. \u2014\u00a0Sam Nordquist left home in Minnesota last fall and traveled 1,000 miles to be with a woman he\u2019d fallen in love with online.",
      "He ended up imprisoned in a cut-rate hotel in upstate New York, suffering unspeakable horrors before he was killed.",
      "A gang of seven people \u2014 including the woman for whom he\u2019d trekked across the country\u00a0\u2014 have been charged with murder, accused of torturing and humiliating the 24-year-old transgender Black man in the hotel room for weeks before eventually killing him. The only people who called police were Nordquist\u2019s mother and sister back home, who pleaded for authorities to check in on him when he stopped responding to their messages. But Nordquist\u2019s body had already been dumped, wrapped in plastic bags, in an empty field.",
      "Even though arrests have been made, first-degree murder charges have been filed and the victim laid to rest, this case remains an incomprehensible display of human malice. Online posts told a story of a happy couple, but Nordquist\u2019s friends and family were increasingly concerned when he didn\u2019t return their messages.",
      "His mother feared he was being controlled \u2014 and has accused authorities of ignoring warning signs and failing to protect her child. And LGBTQ activists have said the case is a dark reminder of the risks marginalized people face in America, particularly today.",
      "The seven suspects are all being held without bail. NBC News tried to reach their family and friends, but those who returned calls or answered doors declined to comment. The Ontario County Conflict Defender\u2019s Office, which is representing the defendants, declined to comment. None of the seven has yet entered a plea.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll never know the answer why, because what human being could do what happened to Sam?\u201d Ontario County Assistant District Attorney Kelly Wolford said this week. \u201cWe\u2019ll never make sense of this case.\u201d",
      "\u2018She love-bombed him\u2019",
      "Sam Nordquist fell for a woman named Precious Arzuaga last August. They met online and ended up talking for hours on the phone, day and night, seven days a week, said his mother, Linda Nordquist. Sam seemed smitten, exhilarated for romance with a woman who flooded him with affection.",
      "\u201cSam was vulnerable. He looked like he was 15, young,\u201d Linda Nordquist told NBC News. \u201cShe love-bombed him.\u201d",
      "Arzuaga lived outside Canandaigua, in New York\u2019s Finger Lakes region. She was 38, with several children, some young, others adults \u2014 it\u2019s not clear how many she had. If Sam knew that, he didn\u2019t seem to mind. He began planning a trip to see her in mid-September and expected to stay a week.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to find love and he wanted to be loved. No one can blame him for that. Anyone would want that,\u201d a friend, Jaxon Seeger, recalled. \u201cHe was excited for the trip and the adventure.\u201d",
      "Seeger, who lives in Madison, Wisconsin, had befriended Sam after meeting him in an internet support group for transgender people years earlier. Seeger watched videos Sam posted on TikTok with Arzuaga and thought it all looked normal. Still, Seeger knew it was risky for a transgender man in a new place among unfamiliar people.",
      "At first, things appeared to be going well. Sam sent his mom photographs of the couple together, both smiling, she said. But on Oct. 12, the day he was expected to return home, he\u00a0did not show up. Linda said he did not answer texts and phone calls from the family.",
      "Sam had told Linda that he was staying in Room 22 at Patty\u2019s Lodge, a roadside hotel on the outskirts of Canandaigua, surrounded by farmland. The collection of single-story pale, brown buildings with mismatched curtains stands in contrast to the vibrantly colored Victorian homes that line the city\u2019s Main Street and the mansions, yacht clubs and lavish hotels that border nearby Canandaigua Lake, the city\u2019s glistening namesake.",
      "Patty\u2019s Lodge is not a tourist haunt. It is a destination of last resort. Some rooms are rented for weeks at a time by people on the verge of homelessness or facing other emergencies; in some instances their stays are paid for using vouchers provided by the Ontario County Department of Social Services. Others are registered sex offenders, according to records published by the Ontario County Sheriff\u2019s Office.",
      "It is unclear how Sam and Arzuaga ended up at Patty\u2019s Lodge and if anyone else was staying with them.",
      "On Oct. 13, Linda said she contacted the New York State Police and requested a wellness check at Room 22. Not long after, she said, Sam and Arzuaga called and assured her that everything was fine. Sam told Linda that he wanted to stay indefinitely to pursue his new relationship and to help Arzuaga support her kids, she said.",
      "The state police reached Sam at Patty\u2019s Lodge that same day.",
      "\u201cAt that time, Sam told the trooper he was fine and did not need any medical or law enforcement help,\u201d State Police spokesperson Trooper Lynnea Crane said in an email.",
      "But based on the conversations Linda had with police after the wellness check, she believes law enforcement was misled and didn\u2019t do a thorough enough job looking for signs of distress. She says law enforcement downplayed their ongoing concerns.",
      "\u201cThey said that they talked to Sam and everything appeared to be fine, that everything was good. Well, that\u2019s because that Precious was right there,\u201d Linda said. \u201cI think Sam was scared and intimidated, and that they should have separated them and they didn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Although the family was suspicious of their relationship, Sam and Arzuaga appeared online like a happy couple. Of the more than two dozen videos Sam posted on TikTok between September and November, most of the clips show the pair dancing together and embracing each other affectionately. Sam described Arzuaga as his \u201cride or die,\u201d \u201csoul\u201d and \u201cfamily\u201d throughout several of the posts.",
      "Desiree Tucker, 32, used to make TikToks with Arzuaga, too, when the two dated on and off from 2022 to 2024, she said. But when the cameras were off, things weren\u2019t so great between them. If she declined to do the videos, she risked a beating from Arzuaga, Tucker said in an interview.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s like: \u2018Oh, you look so happy in your TikToks,\u2019\u201d Tucker said. \u201cYeah, I know I did. And I did exactly what she wanted me to do. Because I knew if I didn\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t be good for me.\u201d",
      "On Feb. 18, Tucker\u2019s local police department in Toronto, Ohio, showed up at her house asking about Arzuaga on behalf of New York State Police, she said. She said she told them Arzuaga physically abused her throughout their relationship. She also said Arzuaga refused her access to her phone and social media, and wouldn\u2019t allow her to contact her family at times. Arzuaga is in jail and could not be reached for comment; Toronto police didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Sam\u2019s family had tried to stay in touch with him, but his responses to their calls and texts grew infrequent. When he did answer, they said, it was usually because they threatened to request more welfare checks to Room 22. He downplayed their concerns, which made Linda worry more.",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t sound like himself. It\u2019s like he was being coached on what to say,\u201d she said. \u201cSam lived with me his whole, entire life. We were always together. So I know how Sam talks \u2014\u00a0and this was not Sam.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 4, she said, she got an email from the Ontario County Department of Social Services, which includes the town where Sam was living.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m working with your son Sam. He wanted me to reach you,\u201d the worker wrote, according to a screenshot of the exchange shared by Linda. \u201cIf you can please contact me as soon as you get this email.\u201d",
      "The social services agent later told her in a phone call that Arzuaga was controlling Sam\u2019s cellphone use, that he wanted to come home to Minnesota and that he was concocting an \u201cescape plan,\u201d Linda said. The agent added that Sam was supposed to return to the social services office on Dec. 19, but he never showed up, Linda said. The county social services department didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "Sam\u2019s friend Seeger was also sending messages every few days and receiving sporadic responses.",
      "A day or two before New Year\u2019s, Seeger said, Sam texted. He said everything was going well, that he was staying at Patty\u2019s Lodge and that he planned to celebrate the holiday in New York.",
      "On New Year\u2019s Day, Linda spoke with Sam, wishing him a fresh start to 2025.",
      "\u201cHe kept the conversation short and said, \u2018I love you and I\u2019ll call you tomorrow,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "It was the last time she ever spoke to him."

    "published": "Sat, 08 Mar 2025 11:30:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Unnecessarily high radiation doses in CT scans have been linked to cancers. Under new federal rules, doctors and imaging centers have to more closely track and report the doses that patients get.",
    "story": [
      "Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a professor at the University of California-San Francisco medical school, has spent well over a decade researching the disquieting risk that one of modern medicine\u2019s most valuable tools, computerized tomography scans, can sometimes cause cancer.",
      "Smith-Bindman and like-minded colleagues have long pushed for federal policies aimed at improving safety for patients undergoing CT scans. Under new Medicare regulations effective this year, hospitals and imaging centers must start collecting and sharing more information about the radiation their scanners emit.",
      "About 93 million CT scans are performed every year in the United States, according to IMV, a medical market research company that tracks imaging. More than half of those scans are for people 60 and older. Yet there is scant regulation of radiation levels as the machines scan organs and structures inside bodies. Dosages are erratic, varying widely from one clinic to another, and are too often unnecessarily high, Smith-Bindman and other critics say.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfathomable,\u201d Smith-Bindman said. \u201cWe keep doing more and more CTs, and the doses keep going up.\u201d",
      "One CT scan can expose a patient to 10 or 15 times as much radiation as another, Smith-Bindman said. \u201cThere is very large variation,\u201d she said, \u201cand the doses vary by an order of magnitude \u2014 tenfold, not 10% different \u2014 for patients seen for the same clinical problem.\u201d In outlier institutions, the variation is even higher, according to research she and a team of international collaborators have published.",
      "She and other researchers estimated in 2009 that high doses could be responsible for 2% of cancers. Ongoing research shows it\u2019s probably higher, since far more scans are performed today.",
      "The cancer risk from CT scans for any individual patient is very low, although it rises for patients who have numerous scans throughout their lives. Radiologists don\u2019t want to scare off patients who can benefit from imaging, which plays a crucial role in identifying life-threatening conditions like cancers and aneurysms and guides doctors through complicated procedures.",
      "But the new data collection rules from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued in the closing months of the Biden administration are aimed at making imaging safer. They also require a more careful assessment of the dosing, quality, and necessity of CT scans.",
      "The requirements, rolled out in January, are being phased in over about three years for hospitals, outpatient settings, and physicians. Under the complicated reporting system, not every radiologist or health care setting is required to comply immediately. Providers could face financial penalties under Medicare if they don\u2019t comply, though those will be phased in, too, starting in 2027.",
      "When the Biden administration issued the new guidelines, a CMS spokesperson said in an email that excessive and unnecessary radiation exposure was a health risk that could be addressed through measurement and feedback to hospitals and physicians. The agency at the time declined to make an official available for an interview. The Trump administration did not respond to a request for comment for this article.",
      "The Leapfrog Group, an organization that tracks hospital safety, welcomed the new rules. \u201cRadiation exposure is a very serious patient safety issue, so we commend CMS for focusing on CT scans,\u201d said Leah Binder, the group\u2019s president and CEO. Leapfrog has set standards for pediatric exposure to imaging radiation, \u201cand we find significant variation among hospitals,\u201d Binder added.",
      "CMS contracted with UCSF in 2019 to research solutions aimed at encouraging better measurement and assessment of CTs, leading to the development of the agency\u2019s new approach.",
      "The American College of Radiology and three other associations involved in medical imaging, however, objected to the draft CMS rules when they were under review, arguing in written comments in 2023 that they were excessively cumbersome, would burden providers, and could add to the cost of scans. The group was also concerned, at that time, that health providers would have to use a single, proprietary tech tool for gathering the dosing and any related scan data.",
      "The single company in question, Alara Imaging, supplies free software that radiologists and radiology programs need to comply with the new regulations. The promise to keep it free is included in the company\u2019s copyright. Smith-Bindman is a co-founder of Alara Imaging, and UCSF also has a stake in the company, which is developing other health tech products unrelated to the CMS imaging rule that it does plan to commercialize.",
      "But the landscape has recently changed. ACR said in a statement from Judy Burleson, ACR vice president for quality management programs, that CMS is allowing in other vendors \u2014 and that ACR itself is \u201cin discussion with Alara\u201d on the data collection and submission. In addition, a company called Medisolv, which works on health care quality, said at least one client is working with another vendor, Imalogix, on the CT dose data.",
      "Several dozen health quality and safety organizations \u2014 including some national leaders in patient safety, like the Institute of Healthcare Improvement \u2014 have supported CMS\u2019 efforts.",
      "Concerns about CT dosing are long-standing. A landmark study published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2009 by a research team that included experts from the National Cancer Institute, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and universities estimated that CT scans were responsible for 29,000 excess cancer cases a year in the United States, about 2% of all cases diagnosed annually.",
      "But the number of CT scans kept climbing. By 2016, it was estimated at 74 million, up 20% in a decade, though radiologists say dosages of radiation per scan have declined. Some researchers have noted that U.S. doctors order far more imaging than physicians in other developed countries, arguing some of it is wasteful and dangerous.",
      "More recent studies, some looking at pediatric patients and some drawing on radiation exposure data from survivors of the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, have also identified CT scan risk.",
      "Older people may face greater cancer risks because of imaging they had earlier in life. And scientists have emphasized the need to be particularly careful with children, who may be more vulnerable to radiation exposure while young and face the consequences of cumulative exposure as they age.",
      "Max Wintermark, a neuroradiologist at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who has been involved in the field\u2019s work on appropriate utilization of imaging, said doctors generally follow dosing protocols for CT scans. In addition, the technology is improving; he expects artificial intelligence to soon help doctors determine optimal imaging use and dosing, delivering \u201cthe minimum amount of radiation dose to get us to the diagnosis that we\u2019re trying to reach.\u201d",
      "But he said he welcomes the new CMS regulations.",
      "\u201cI think the measures will help accelerate the transition towards always lower and lower doses,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are helpful.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court contest is shaping up to be a battle of billionaires, with each side in the race casting the other\u2019s most prominent donors as boogeymen.",
      "Liberal megadonors like George Soros and outside groups with ties to Elon Musk have spent millions in the first major race in a battleground state since the 2024 election that both parties will look to as a barometer of the political environment in the opening weeks of President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "The technically nonpartisan April 1 election will determine the state Supreme Court\u2019s ideological balance for the second time in two years. Brad Schimel, the conservative candidate and a state judge in Waukesha County who previously served as the state\u2019s Republican attorney general, is facing off against Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate and a state judge in Madison.",
      "Thanks in large part to the involvement of megadonors like Musk and Soros, the race is on track to surpass the state\u2019s 2023 contest as the most expensive state Supreme Court campaign in U.S. history. And like that race, the future of several hot-button issues with both state and national significance \u2014 including abortion rights, unions and congressional maps \u2014 will again be at stake.",
      "Democrats in particular have trained their sights on Musk, the tech billionaire who\u2019s running the controversial Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "This week, the Wisconsin Democratic Party launched what it\u2019s calling a seven-figure investment to link Schimel to Musk. The spending will be geared toward ads, town hall events and canvassing efforts that specifically take aim at Musk.",
      "One digital spot that started running this week lists off a series of actions DOGE has taken or recommended, before slamming Musk as \u201cout of control\u201d and accusing him of \u201cunloading millions to buy the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe knows MAGA politician Brad Schimel is for sale,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says.",
      "Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Ben Wikler said the effort was intended to drive turnout among Democrats and other voters  who are concerned about the impacts Musk and DOGE could have on the state.",
      "\u201cDemocrats are feeling a hair-on-fire sense of emergency around Musk\u2019s power grab and his attacks on their communities. Making sure that they know that Brad Schimel would be Musk\u2019s puppet on the state Supreme Court is a powerful motivator for people to go and cast a ballot,\u201d Wikler said in an interview.",
      "Democrats have had the advantage in ad spending in this race, spending almost $18 million to Republicans\u2019 $12.7 million, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact.",
      "A big chunk of the GOP spending has come from two Musk-aligned groups, Building America\u2019s Future and America PAC, that have spent more than $8 million to boost Schimel.",
      "While Building America\u2019s Future is not required to disclose its donations, Reuters and The Wall Street Journal have both reported that Musk helped to fund the group in the past. The group has spent about $2.4 million on ads in the Supreme Court race so far, according to AdImpact.",
      "One of Building America\u2019s Future\u2019s ads takes aim at a particular case Crawford oversaw as a judge involving a man convicted of sexually assaulting a minor.",
      "America PAC, a Musk-funded super PAC that spent more than $261 million during the 2024 election cycle, has dumped more than $4 million into the race, mostly on canvassing and political mailers.",
      "Representatives for Musk, Building America\u2019s Future and America PAC didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. A White House spokesperson who handles inquiries regarding Musk and DOGE also didn\u2019t respond to questions.",
      "Musk has posted on X about the race, writing in January that it\u2019s \u201cVery important to vote Republican for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to prevent voting fraud!\u201d",
      "Republicans have for years made unfounded claims of voting fraud in Wisconsin, alleging that drop boxes in the state allow people to vote illegally. The issue has appeared before the state Supreme Court multiple times in recent years.",
      "Musk\u2019s electric car company Tesla has challenged a Wisconsin law in state court that bans carmakers from owning dealerships. The case could possibly make its way to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.",
      "Crawford, for her part, has used Musk as a foil at campaign events. At a recent speech in Cambridge, Wisconsin, she said, \u201cYou know, when I was a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I\u2019d be fighting the world\u2019s richest man for justice in Wisconsin.\u201d",
      "And at a Milwaukee Press Club event on Wednesday, Crawford said Musk \u201cseems to be an unelected right-hand man to President Trump right now\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201cvery concerning when somebody like that wades into a state judicial race.\u201d",
      "On the other side, the Wisconsin Republican Party and aligned groups have drawn attention to the cadre of liberal billionaires who have thrown money into the race, including Soros and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.",
      "\u201cSusan Crawford is a vehicle for Democrats, like George Soros and Reid Hoffman, to implement a dangerously unpopular agenda,\u201d Wisconsin GOP spokesperson Anika Rickard said.",
      "House Freedom Action, the political arm of the conservative U.S. House Freedom Caucus, has begun running ads that specifically take aim at Crawford for receiving support from Soros, Hoffman and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.",
      "In one such ad from the group, a narrator slams the trio of \u201cleft-wing billionaires\u201d for \u201cputting millions behind Susan Crawford because Crawford is a leftist ideologue who will turn Wisconsin into Illinois.\u201d",
      "That effort came after Soros gave $1 million to the Wisconsin Democratic Party in January. Pritzker gave $500,000 that month, while Hoffman contributed $250,000. State campaign finance laws allow the state parties to transfer cash to the candidate\u2019s committees.",
      "Representatives for Soros, Hoffman and Pritzker didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "Schimel campaign spokesperson Jacob Fischer slammed Crawford for taking money from \u201cextremists like George Soros and JB Pritzker.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe attempts by Susan Crawford and the Democrats to distract the people of Wisconsin from her extreme views and the radical billionaires funding her are a mockery of hypocrisy,\u201d Fischer said in a statement.",
      "Several other ultrawealthy Americans have also gotten involved in the race, particularly on the conservative side.",
      "For example, Elizabeth Uihlein gave $650,000 to the Wisconsin GOP in January, while Joe Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade, chipped in $500,000. Diane Hendricks, the billionaire businesswoman and film producer who owns ABC Supply, also gave the Wisconsin Republican Party $975,000 that month."

Hey, I said it. And then we stayed in your top 10, top 15 for about six months, nine months, maybe a year. So Netflix, if you're interested in a show that is on autopilot that the world is watching, we'd love to come play.\"",

Days later, CBS decided to reverse the decision and let the show end on what was said to be its seventh and final season. However, the network surprised fans again when it renewed the drama for Season Eight, only to have it be canceled again.",

      "Another said, \"No!!! Netflix come through, we need more seasons!\"",
      "A third added, \"It\u2019s unbelievable. Eight seasons of a show that was action-packed and had good ratings. Now to simply cancel it... no words. This cannot be a final decision. Thank you to the entire crew in front of and behind the camera for the incredible performance.\""

Sara, a 29-year-old oncology nurse, explained to Ben that she grew up in a conservative household but was no longer religious and she shared that her sister, Lisa, was gay. Sara also expressed her opinions on the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, noting that she felt more engaged in social issues during that time given that George Floyd was murdered in Minneapolis, Minnesota.",

Daniel also introduced his parents to Taylor\u2019s mom and dad, who stressed that divorce wasn\u2019t an option in their family.",
      "Season 8 couples who are no longer together",
      "Devin and Virginia",
      "Devin Buckley and Virginia Miller hit it off in the pods after learning that they both attended the same Minnesota high school. But, Devin, a 29-year-old youth director and coach, was a student at the school a few years after Virginia, a 34-year-old healthcare recruiter, graduated and the two had never crossed paths.",
      "While in the pods, Devin also formed a connection with Brittany Dodson, but the relationship fizzled out when she realized he was too \u201crigid\u201d and didn\u2019t seem like the ideal partner. He agreed and continued to pursue Virginia, who had been reserved and skeptical during many of their conversations.",
      "In Episode 6, Devin wrote a sweet letter to Virginia expressing his feelings. \u201cVirginia, you are the most kind, loving and genuine person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he praised. \u201cI know that in your past relationships, they made you feel insecure and undervalued. But I promise to always make you feel valued, loved, and to make you feel like the queen that you are.\u201d",
      "At the end of his letter, he told Virginia he loved her and asked her to marry him. \u201cYes, I will,\u201d she softly replied. She later told the cameras through tears, \u201cI haven\u2019t felt like this ever. I just feel amazing. Today\u2019s a good day.\u201d",
      "In Honduras, Virginia and Devin continued to get along but had a minor disagreement when they moved in together. After the couple visited their separate apartments and spoke about their future, Virginia suggested that they sign a prenup to establish financial boundaries. She explained that they should each be entitled to the assets they had before meeting each other. Devin was caught off guard and seemed hesitant to agree.",
      "When Devin introduced Virginia to his family, he mentioned the possible prenuptial agreement. His family, particularly his sister Kayla, questioned the idea and wondered if Virginia was already doubting if the marriage would work.",
      "On the day of their wedding, Virginia decided not to move forward, shocking Devin completely.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just not ready. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry,\" she said. Virginia and Devin's parents also seemed to be shocked by the move. Virginia\u2019s father hugged Devin and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a very good man. I\u2019m disappointed also, but I think you\u2019re a great guy.\u201d",
      "She explained her decision in a confessional.",
      "\u201cThere were just depths of our relationship that we didn\u2019t get to. We just didn\u2019t get there. And even our sexual relationship, we just didn\u2019t get to it. So I just think that we should be all the way there before we decide to spend the rest of our lives together,\u201d she said.",
      "Joey and Monica",
      "Joey Leveille and Monica Danus\u2019 time in the pods was drama-free. Joey, a 35-year-old physician associate, and Monica, a 28-year-old digital marketer, seemed to only form a bond with each other. They quickly connected thanks to their bubbly and quirky personalities and their love for \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d Joey also supported Monica when she revealed that she was between jobs because she needed to take time off to help her family.",
      "By Episode 2, they already knew that they wanted to get engaged and leave the pods together, making them the first official couple of Season 8.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve had an incredible time falling in love with who you are as a person, your laugh, your voice, and I would love to take the next step with you,\u201d Joey said.",
      "\u201cWould you get engaged with me?\u201d he asked.",
      "She laughed and said \u201cYes!\u201d She said she couldn\u2019t wait to see him in person before running to share the news with her friends.",
      "Joey and Monica spent their time in Honduras learning more about each other and their idiosyncrasies, like her family's shared \"sock bin.\" It appeared the two would have a drama-free path to the finale \u2014 until Joey met Monica's family.",
      "While her parents were welcoming and invited Joey to participate in their family jam session, Monica's older sister, Nicolle, quietly eyed Joey from her seat. When she pulled Monica to have a private conversation outside, Nicolle mentioned that Joey wasn't her sister's usual type. She also said that as the older sister she always felt she would get married first.",
      "At their apartment, Joey shared that he could tell Nicolle didn't warm to him. After Monica revealed what she spoke about with Nicolle, Joey suggested that jealousy might be the cause of Nicolle's disapproval.",
      "Nicolle later takes Joey and Monica's engagement photos and appeared to come around \u2014 but Joey was still doubtful, as he says in Episode 13.",
      "In the finale, Joey and Monica chose not to get married. Monica felt that Joey wasn't completely ready and he agrees at the altar.",
      "\"If Joey had told me with his words, \u2018I am 100% in. It is you. I know it\u2019s you. I\u2019m certain.\u2019 I feel like it could have been a lot different,\u201d\u00a0she said in a confessional.",
      "Ben and Sara",
      "Ben Mezzenga and Sara Carton briefly struggled in the pods when they started discussing their values. In Episode 2, Sara, a 29-year-old oncology nurse, asked Ben, a 28-year-old developer, about growing up in a Christian household. He explained his beliefs before she revealed that she wasn\u2019t religious.",
      "\u201cThe main thing for me that\u2019s really tough about religion is my sister, Lisa. She\u2019s my best friend. She\u2019s gay,\u201d she explained. She asked if Ben would be comfortable around her sister and would go to Pride activities with them.",
      "\u201cYeah, no discomfort around that community at all,\u201d he replied. She felt confident in their connection, but when they met again in Episode 4, she had some more concerns. She mentioned Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency and the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of ignorant towards that stuff. Like, I didn\u2019t vote in the last election. As long as I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not going to do much, so\u2026\u201d Ben said. When she asked directly about BLM, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not one way or the other. I just kind of keep out of it.\u201d",
      "Sara replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s very valuable and important to think about those things.\u201d\u00a0 She later said she didn\u2019t like his responses to her questions. \u201cBasic human rights, equality, I need someone to be on the same page with me about that,\u201d she said.",
      "Ben assured her in Episode 5 that their values aligned. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have any burden or any weight on your shoulder thinking that you have to teach me because I do have that motivation to grow into that and that internal feeling that we do have the same beliefs in these things,\u201d he said before proposing.",
      "\u201cI feel so at peace and accepted by you,\u201d she said after accepting his proposal. \u201cI honestly can\u2019t imagine being with anyone else.\u201d",
      "Ben and Sara landed in Honduras and swiftly decided to build on their emotional connection by exploring a physical relationship. When all the engaged couples reunited, Ben and Sara could not stop gushing about how well they got along.",
      "In Minneapolis, Sara met a few of Ben's friends. Sara shared details about their conversation about values in the pods and his friends confirmed that he was an inclusive person.",
      "Sara and Ben continued to progress until the two had an uncomfortable conversation at the end of Episode 9. She gasped twice after learning that a woman on TikTok posted a video calling out some of the \"s----- men\" on the Season 8 cast, without identifying the male cast members.",
      "Ben, who had already seen the video, said, \"I think she is referencing me.\" He also shared that he blocked the user and she blocked him.",
      "When Sara pressed him to further explain the situation, he said he hadn't spoken to the woman in over four years and that he was \"uncertain\" about what else she would reveal. He added that she was \"overreacting.\" Sara cautioned him that if he wasn't being forthcoming then the trust between them would be broken.",
      "In Episode 10, the couple meets Sara's sister and her partner, who express worry and skepticism over her sister's new relationship.",
      "\u201cI see that you have a strong connection, but this is not real right now,\u201d Lisa, Sara's sister, told her.",
      "Sara appeared to hold firm. \u201cBen is such... like, we are so aligned in so many ways,\" she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose Ben because I felt we were the same person. I chose Ben because he made me feel so special, and I felt energized and loved and important.\u201d",
      "But by the finale, her tune had changed. Sara decided not to marry Ben \u2014 who seemed shocked and, in his words, \"devastated\" by her decision. Sara cited their differing values and political beliefs as one of her reasons.",
      "Ben wanted to continue dating but Sara seemed to balk. \u201cBut you can\u2019t date someone for their potential because they may never reach the potential,\" she said.",
      "David and Lauren",
      "David \u201cDave\u201d Bettenburg and Lauren O\u2019Brien were one of many Season 8 contestants who were involved in a love triangle. Dave, a 33-year-old medical device salesman, couldn\u2019t determine if he had stronger feelings for Lauren or Molly Mulaney. When Lauren, a 31-year-old education saleswoman, realized Dave was undecided, she revealed to him that she didn\u2019t have any other connections.",
      "Meanwhile, Molly anxiously waited for Dave to call it quits with Lauren and solely pursue her. But in Episode 5, Dave cried as he told Molly that he wanted to \u201csee things through\u201d with Lauren instead. Molly was hurt but said she knew if he didn\u2019t want her then it wasn\u2019t meant to be.",
      "Dave then met with Lauren. She said although they had some tough conversations she appreciated that they were open with each other and were able to move past everything.",
      "He agreed and said, \u201cYou easily could have bailed. I just can\u2019t thank you enough for your patience because it helped me come to terms with a lot of other things. And not being afraid to go after the girl that I really want to be with. I\u2019m so in love with you.\u201d",
      "He proposed and she quickly accepted. \u201cI love you so much, too. I\u2019m excited to just start a future with you,\u201d she said.",
      "In the pods, Dave repeatedly mentioned that his sister\u2019s opinions of his partners played a big role in his past relationships. Although fans still haven\u2019t met her, the weight of her apparent disapproval and the mistrust of Dave\u2019s friends negatively impacted his romance with Lauren in the second group of episodes.",
      "As soon as Dave and Lauren returned to Minneapolis, he complained that friends and family members learned about his engagement before he told them. Then, Dave revealed that an acquaintance claimed he had been dating Lauren up until she left to go on \u201cLove Is Blind.\u201d Lauren denied his timeline of events and said that she had ended their casual fling. She said that the acquaintance wanted to create drama.",
      "Despite Lauren\u2019s friends also supporting her, Dave could not fully trust Lauren, creating a strain in their relationship as they approached wedding day.",
      "The couple broke up in Episode 11 of the series in a long conversation that covered her past fling \u2014 which they still didn't share an understanding of \u2014 and Dave's talk with her father.",
      "Speaking to the camera after the breakup, Dave said he felt like he \u201clet her down\u201d because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t get over my own ego.\u201d",
      "\u201cLove is blind but I don\u2019t think marriage is,\u201d he said.",
      "Lauren, meanwhile, was \"really sad\" it didn't work out \u2014 and \"pissed,\" too. The former couple met after a group hangout but did not reconcile.",
      "Alex and Madison",
      "Alex Brown and Madison Errichiello opened up in the pods about their difficult childhoods. Alex, a 29-year-old commercial real estate broker, and Madison, a 28-year-old artist, were both bullied in school and felt like outcasts.",
      "The two seemed headed for an engagement until Madison revealed she had an avoidant attachment style. Alex suddenly became less talkative and their conversation ended abruptly.",
      "When they met again, Alex voiced his concerns that Madison would run if they faced an obstacle. She told him that her still being in the experiment was proof that she was ready to go through challenging times with him. Meanwhile, Madison was also building a connection with Mason Horacen.",
      "Mason told Madison he was \u201ccommitted\u201d to her. But when Madison decided to pursue her relationship with Alex instead, Mason regretted what he said. In Episode 6, Madison explained the situation to Alex.",
      "Alex said he sympathized with Mason and wished him well. Madison didn\u2019t appreciate that Alex wasn\u2019t more comforting toward her.\u00a0 After their tense conversation, Alex said he could see a future with her but he was worried they would struggle with communication and disagreements. \u201cI think at this point, it\u2019s a pretty big jump. We\u2019re not at a point to get engaged,\u201d he said.",
      "Madison tearfully departed the pods and left the experiment.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Alex said he had no regrets over ending the relationship.",
      "\"I was confident in the decision. If we could go back and do things again, I think it would have unfolded the same way. I\u2019m glad that we got all of the issues out on the table the way we did so we could make that decision early on instead of moving forward and proposing and then going on the trip and then living together. I think it would have been a lot messier if that were to happen,\" he said.",
      "His decision came down to attachment style and conflict resolution, as it appeared in the pods. \"I think she has different ways of dealing with conflict than I do, and again, that\u2019s totally fine. There\u2019s nothing right or wrong with either way, but I think we just realized that we are both on very different pages and that communication wasn\u2019t going to be easy,\" he said.",
      "Read the rest of our interview with Alex here.",
      "Mason and Meg",
      "Mason, a 33-year-old cinematographer, gravitated toward Meg Fink, a 31-year-old oncology nurse, in the pods. She shared her conspiracy theories with him and expressed her strong feelings. But she knew that Mason also had a connection with Madison.",
      "After Madison ended things with Mason, she told Meg what happened. Meg confronted Mason in the pods at the end of Episode 5. She questioned if she was only there by \u201cdefault\u201d because Madison rejected him.",
      "He said he validated the \u201cwrong person\u201d because he was \u201cconfused\u201d at the time.",
      "When he said she was always his first choice, Meg replied, \u201cI wasn\u2019t yesterday, just to be fair.\u201d She said he never affirmed his feelings for her until it was too late.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll never know if what you\u2019re saying is true because we don\u2019t get the opportunity for you to pick,\u201d she told him in Episode 6. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to get past that.\u201d",
      "He said he understood her perspective and they said goodbye.",

      "The connection was instantaneous once the duo met and soon realized they attended the same high school. Despite finding themselves in a bit of a love triangle with fellow show contestant Brittany Dodson, Buckley and Miller got engaged sight unseen in the pods.",
      "The newly engaged couple quickly put their relationship to the test in the real world and sought to answer the question: Is love really blind?",
      "As the couple heads to the altar during the final installment of shows from this season, let's take a look back at their \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d journey.",
      "What happened between Virginia and Devin in the pods?",
      "Devin, a 29-year-old youth director and coach, had chemistry with Virginia, a 34-year-old health care recruiter, early on in the dating experiment. The pair quickly discovered that they\u2019d attended the same high school, albeit a few years apart. Luckily, the age difference didn't seem to phase the pair.",
      "Simultaneously, Devin was talking with Brittany Dodson, a 35-year-old partnership executive, and they started to form a connection. Soon enough, Devin and Brittany realized they weren't the best fit for each other and went their separate ways on amicable terms. This left Devin free to pursue his connection with Virginia.",
      "At the same time, Devin was a bit worried that Virginia was too \u201cclosed off\u201d and slow to open up. She began to express herself more freely and noted that she's at first very \u201cshy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't want to keep choosing the wrong guy,\u201d she said, adding that she hasn't had many good examples of healthy relationships in her life.",
      "Virginia called Devin \u201cquite refreshing\u201d and said she'd never dated a \u201cnice guy\u201d before. In a confessional interview, Devin called Virginia a \u201ckind, loving, genuine person.\u201d",
      "In Episode 6, Devin wrote a letter for Virginia to declare his love. At the end, he asked if she would marry him, and the two got engaged.",

      "While talking about financial assets, Virginia said she'd like to get a prenuptial agreement and Devin said he'd \u201cnever really thought about that.\u201d",
      "The topic of a prenup came up yet again when Virginia met Devin\u2019s family. They seemed taken aback by the idea and worried that Virginia might already have one foot out the door. Still, Virginia politely stuck to her belief that a prenup is simply \u201cthe modern way of doing things.\u201d",
      "Eventually, Devin agreed to sign the prenup, noting that it was pretty straightforward.",
      "The couple differed on their political views",
      "Politics were somewhat of a point of contention for Devin and Virginia. In Episode 10, they had a serious conversation about their political views after Virginia encouraged Devin to open up about serious topics that could impact their marriage.",
      "Devin said he wasn't \u201csuper big into politics\u201d and didn't have a \u201cstrong stance on it.\u201d He then explained that his family typically has conservative views.",
      "Virginia was open to differing political opinions, but noted that it would be \u201ckind of alarming\u201d if Devin was \u201cway on the other side of the spectrum\u201d on political issues that matter to her.",
      "Did Virginia and Devin get married?",
      "As she prepared to walk down the aisle on their wedding day, Virginia reflected on her feelings for Devin.",

      "Additionally, Virginia revealed that Devin got a check for a wedding present, but failed to tell her about the gift. Instead, found out from his mother.",
      "\u201cI was just waiting to see if he would bring it up but he didn't. It made me not so trusting of him,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cEven though I didn\u2019t get married today,\u00a0I still do believe that love is blind, because I felt that love for Virginia regardless of everything that happened,\u201d he said."

    "summary": "Do Taylor Haag and Daniel Hastings get married in the Love Is Blind Season 8 finale? Find out if the Christmas-loving couple is still together now.",
    "story": [
      "For \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d Season 8 stars Daniel Hastings and Taylor Haag, sparks flew on their very first date in the pods when Taylor joked \u201cAre you down on one knee?\u201d upon meeting. Daniel played along and promptly knelt down before continuing the date.",
      "Love blossomed, the couple soon got engaged, and after meeting for the first time, Taylor began to wonder if Daniel had previously followed her on Instagram prior to meeting in the pods.",
      "How did their relationship progress from there? And did Taylor and Daniel get married in the end? We're recapping the highs and lows of Taylor and Daniel's journey to the altar.",
      "What happened between Taylor and Daniel in the pods?",
      "When Taylor, a 32-year-old colonoscopy nurse, started talking with Daniel, a 30-year-old Sales Account Executive, they had instant chemistry.",
      "Daniel spoke about his sister, who is blind, and said he hopes to be \u201clike her\u201d and love people for who they are rather than what they look like.",
      "Taylor loved that sentiment and appreciated the fact that Daniel wanted to find the mother of his future children.",
      "Taylor and Daniel's love seemed that much more destined when they discovered their shared love of Christmas. Soon enough, they exchanged Christmas ornaments and stockings during dates.",
      "Taylor opened up about her father, who had been battling cancer recently, and said she was nervous she would get a call saying she had to go home. Daniel reassured her, saying that even if that happened, \u201cI hope that you would feel ok leaving and I would find you.\u201d",
      "During episode 6, Daniel read a letter to Taylor explaining why he loved her: \u201cAll I want to do is make you feel safe and make you happy for the rest of your life,\u201d he said before proposing.",
      "Did Daniel follow Taylor on Instagram?",
      "After meeting Daniel, Taylor expressed a major concern in a confessional interview.",
      "\u201cWhen the doors first opened and I saw Daniel, I thought, \u2018He\u2019s so familiar to me.\u2019 But I couldn\u2019t place it. Is he familiar cause I\u2019ve pictured\u00a0his face through a wall 15 million times? Is he familiar cause I\u2019ve heard his voice? I have this overwhelming feeling that when the doors opened last night, that was not the first time that he saw me,\u201d she explained.",
      "Taylor elaborated on the matter, saying that she had received an Instagram follow request a few months before that might have been Daniel. If that was true, it's possible that Daniel knew what Taylor looked like all along.",
      "Taylor confronted Daniel about the matter in person, but he denied following her on social media. Producers allowed her to go through her phone and consult a followers app that tells you who has followed you. She was unable to find a follow request from Daniel and admitted that she felt bad bringing it up.",
      "Daniel reassured Taylor that it was ok, saying, \u201cI\u2019d love to go to Honduras with you. If you have reservations about that, I\u2019d love to go back home with you. Either way, wherever you go, I\u2019m in,\u201d he said.",
      "The couple eventually reconciled and joined the rest of the couples in a group vacation in Honduras.",
      "What happened when Taylor and Daniel moved in together?",
      "After they returned home, Daniel took Taylor to meet his family. Things went smoothly and Daniel's parents said they loved the concept of the \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d experiment, especially since their own daughter is blind.",
      "Taylor explained that her mother was taking a bit longer to warm up to the idea of her getting engaged so quickly. Her father, on the other hand, was more open to it, especially since he'd been battling cancer and wanted his daughter to find happiness.",
      "When Daniel met Taylor's parents, he asked them for permission to marry their daughter. Tossing all initial hesitation aside, her mother agreed, as did her father.",
      "Did Taylor and Daniel get married?",
      "On the morning of her wedding day, Taylor reflected on her \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d journey.",
      "\u201cThe last six weeks have been such a whirlwind, but the most incredible whirlwind. I would do it a million times over to find Daniel,\u201d she said.",
      "Taylor acknowledged that she was \u201cnervous\u201d the prior night, but said, \u201cI have never in any relationship felt this loved and secure.\u201d",
      "Daniel was also \u201cnervous\u201d about making such a big decision, but said \u201cit feels like it's been years that I've known Taylor.\u201d",
      "At the altar, Taylor and Daniel both wrote their own vows and read them aloud in front of family and friends.",
      "Daniel went first, followed by Taylor who read aloud from a 2020 journal entry. In the excerpt, she described the man she was praying for, calling him, \u201ckind, generous and giving.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlthough on paper I have only known you for six weeks, my soul has known your soul for a lifetime.\u201d",
      "When it came time to make their decision, both Taylor and Daniel said \u201cI do,\u201d becoming husband and wife.",
      "What have Taylor and Daniel said about their wedding?",
      "After tying the knot, Taylor and Daniel reflected on their new life as husband and wife in a confessional interview.",
      "\u201cSitting here married to a girl that I fell in love with without knowing what she looked like, I do believe that love is blind,\u201d Daniel said.",
      "Taylor agreed, saying, \u201cI believe love is blind because I fell in love with someone through a wall. It was the most effortless love I've ever felt without even meeting him.\u201d"

      "\u201cI never spoke up when I was a child,\u201d she said, adding that she hoped sharing her experience would help other victims of abuse to find \u201cthe strength to break free and speak out.\u201d",
      "The closest she came to telling her family about her abuse was in January 2017, after her sister Christine died in a car crash at age 56. But she stayed silent for the same reason she always had \u2014 to protect her mother.",
      "Instead, she said, she wrote a long letter detailing how Le Scouarnec, once a close family friend, had repeatedly raped her, and slipped it into Christine\u2019s coffin.",

      "NBC News does not name victims of sexual abuse unless they are willing to be publicly identified. Stephanie and one of the other interviewees agreed to the use of their first names.",
      "Le Scouarnec began abusing her in 1985 when she was just 6, St\u00e9phanie said, adding that it began after she started staying at his family home near Loches, a quaint medieval town around 200 miles east of Vannes.",
      "Le Scouarnec invited St\u00e9phanie to stay at his family home after her father died of a heart attack at age 52. It looked like he was helping out her mother, now 89, who had four older daughters and worked with him as a medical assistant at a private clinic.",
      "Living in the same home as Le Scouarnec, his then-wife Marie-France Lhermitte, now 71, and their three sons, all of whom are younger than St\u00e9phanie, she said the abuse started immediately.",
      "Lhermitte testified that she knew \u201cnothing\u201d of her husband\u2019s 30-year history of abusing children, including members of their family, until his arrest in 2017. Her sons, ages 44, 42 and 38, told the court they did not suspect anything at the time.",
      "St\u00e9phanie said some of her memories, like times and dates of the abuse, are patchy. But like many of his victims, she was able to fill in the blanks because Le Scouarnec carefully chronicled his abuse in digital diaries he kept on hard drives, which were seized by police when they raided his home in May 2017, according to testimony in court. Some of the diary entries have been projected onto a screen in the courtroom.",
      "Dating back to the mid-1980s they show that the majority of his victims \u2014 256 \u2014 were under age 15 at the time they were assaulted. The average age of the alleged victims in the current trial \u2014 158 male and 141 female \u2014 is 11. Most were under the effects of anesthesia or recovering from surgery.",
      "Each time she visited Le Scouarnec\u2019s home, St\u00e9phanie said she knew what was going to happen, \u201cbut I don\u2019t feel I can refuse.\u201d Although she resisted a few times, she said he told her, \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything bad.\u201d",
      "Other victims have also recounted hearing those words.",
      "For years, \u201cthere was a lot of suffering, shame,\u201d she said, adding that the abuse stopped when she was around 12, after she changed schools and declined to sleep at his house. \u201cI got older,\u201d she said. \u201cI am out of the Le Scouarnec prison.\u201d",
      "But St\u00e9phanie said she didn\u2019t have the courage to tell anyone. She credited several years of therapy she sought as an adult with helping her to rebuild her confidence. \u201cBeing freed from this secret buried for so many years was the beginning of my reconstruction,\u201d she said.",
      "While her mother was unaware of the abuse, one of Le Scouarnec\u2019s nieces, Alexandra, 47, said she did speak up, but he was protected by \u201cthe silence of incest.\u201d",
      "Now a nurse, Alexandra said she thought she was her uncle\u2019s first victim, adding that he started abusing her around 1982, when she was 5. Le Scouarnec, she said, would prey on her during piano lessons and sleepovers at his house, often when other family members were present in the home.",
      "Some of the assaults took place in the bathroom, leaving her scared to go, she said, adding that she was also left terrified of medical exams. One one occasion, she said, she screamed \u201cto death like a hysteric\u201d and had to be held down as a doctor approached her.",
      "Alexandra said she was 20 when she told her mother about the abuse after hearing that Le Scouarnec had locked himself and a little girl in a bathroom two years earlier.",
      "But although her mom confronted her sister, Lhermitte, Alexandra said she balked at confronting Le Scouarnec himself.",

      "Calling Alexandra \u201cdevious,\u201d Lhermitte denied in court that she knew about the abuse until her husband\u2019s arrest. Le Scouarnec\u2019s diaries, however, refer to the \u201ccataclysm\u201d that resulted in 1996 when \u201cshe\u201d learned \u201cI\u2019m a pedophile.\u201d Investigators said the \u201cshe\u201d he was referring to was Lhermitte.",
      "Alexandra\u2019s cousin, 34, whom NBC News has agreed not to name, said she feared the \u201ctsunami\u201d she would trigger if she told police about the things her uncle began doing to her at age 3.",
      "\u201cWe come from a family that doesn\u2019t make waves,\u201d she said, adding that eventually she told her mother and older sister in October 2000, when she was 10.",
      "In emotional court testimony late last month, the cousin\u2019s mother, Annie, 72, said she confronted her brother, who immediately confessed. Asked by Presiding Judge Aude Buresi why she didn\u2019t go to the police, she said she thought her daughter \u201cwas the only victim and it would never happen again.\u201d But in 2017, she said she learned from police that her older daughter, now 39, had also been abused.",
      "St\u00e9phanie and Alexandra, who are due to testify Monday, have disputed Lhermitte\u2019s claim that she was unaware of the abuse, as had Alexandra\u2019s cousin.",
      "Alexandra called her account \u201ca pack of lies.\u201d Le Scouarnec\u2019s brother Patrick Le Scouarnec, 70, told the court by video link last week that Lhermitte knew about her husband\u2019s actions during the same period. \u201cThere\u2019s one person who could have had my brother arrested and that\u2019s his wife, Marie-France,\u201d he said.",
      "In France, defendants may respond to witnesses if the judge allows it, and Le Scouarnec admitted that he carried out \u201chideous\u201d crimes. After Annie\u2019s testimony, he told the court that he could not \u201cmake up for the harm I have done to my niece.\u201d",
      "For the first time he also admitted to abusing his granddaughter and that he used his \u201cstatus as a doctor\u201d to assault kids. His \u201cpedophile activity had no impact on my professional activity,\u201d he told the court in a subsequent declaration.",
      "His lawyer, Maxime Tessier, has said he has not admitted to all of the facts of the case.",
      "If convicted, he faces a maximum of 20 years in prison, which would run concurrently with the\u00a0 15 years he is already serving\u00a0 for the rape\u00a0of two of his nieces, a young patient and a 6-year-old neighbor, whose parents reported the attack to police in 2017.",
      "He was also convicted in 2005 of possessing thousands of images depicting child abuse that he downloaded from an internet site monitored by the FBI. He was given a four-month suspended sentence but was nonetheless allowed to carry on working at\u00a0 numerous public hospitals and private clinics in five regions of France.",
      "When reports \u201cexploded\u201d in the press in the summer of 2019 that Le Scouarnec may have sexually abused scores of children, St\u00e9phanie said she decided tell her mother that the respected doctor she was flattered to call a friend had raped her too.",
      "\u201cI protected my mother,\u201d she said. \u201cWho\u2019d have thought that a little girl who just lost her daddy would accuse a surgeon of raping her.\u201d",
      "Her mother \u201cbelieved me straight away,\u201d she said, adding that her mom felt enormously guilty and told her \u201cshe\u2019d blame herself for the rest of her life.\u201d",
      "The crimes against St\u00e9phanie and Alexandra\u00a0occurred too long ago to be prosecuted under French law. Calling for more support for victims of sexual abuse, both said they hoped France would extend the statute of limitations and toughen penalties for pedophiles.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a real public health issue\u201d that \u201csociety as a whole\u201d must confront, St\u00e9phanie said.",
      "The women said they were inspired by Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, who emerged as an icon of strength in France after she allowed her mass rape trial to be opened to the public last year.",
      "\u201cI had to fight to be the person I am today,\u201d St\u00e9phanie said. \u201cWe need to help victims rebuild their lives.\u201d",
      "If you are a child being abused, or know a child who may be facing abuse, call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at\u00a0(800) 422-4453, or go to\u00a0www.childhelphotline.org. States often have child abuse hotlines, but if you suspect a child\u2019s life is in imminent danger, call 911.",
      "If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, call the\u00a0National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline\u00a0at\u00a01-800-656-4673.

      "Syrian security forces and affiliated gunmen killed more than 340 civilians over the last two days, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a London-based war monitoring group said Saturday.",
      "The SOHR compared the bloodshed to operations carried out under Assad's brutal regime, and framed the killings as a collective act of revenge, adding that women and children were executed by firing squad in the countryside near Tartus, an Assad stronghold. NBC News has not independently verified the death toll or methods of execution.",
      "In addition, SOHR said that some 50 government troops and 45 Assad loyalists have been killed in the fighting.",
      "Video posted on social media and verified by NBC News showed the bodies of dozens of men piled on a blood-soaked street in a small town in the countryside Latakia, another Assad stronghold on Syria's Mediterranean coast.",
      "Women gathered around the bloodied corpses, wailing and clutching the dead. One can be heard sobbing, \u201cMy dad, my brother, oh God.\u201d",
      "The victims are reportedly from the Alawite community, the small Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs. Under Assad, Alawites were appointed to key positions in the military and security forces.",
      "NBC News is unable to confirm that the bodies in the video are members of the Alawite community. The SOHR said the vast majority of people killed during the current clashes are from the minority Islamic sect.",
      "The clashes erupted last week near the coastal city of Jableh when government forces attempted to detain a wanted person but were ambushed by Assad loyalists, triggering a wave of retaliatory attacks and two days of intense fighting.",
      "The coastal stronghold of Assad\u2019s Alawite sect has become a major security flashpoint for interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa as he struggles to assert control three months after his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group led the overthrow of Assad.",
      "Tensions are especially high in the mountainous coastal region, where government forces are heavily deployed.",
      "In a video statement, Sharaa urged armed groups still loyal to the former government to surrender their weapons. He also called on pro-government forces to avoid harming civilians or mistreating prisoners.",
      "Despite this appeal, the Syrian Observatory reported Friday that Jableh, the coastal town of Baniyas, and several nearby Alawite villages \u2014 including Assad\u2019s hometown of Qardaha in the mountains overlooking Latakia \u2014 remain under the control of Assad loyalists.",

      "Western nations continue to watch al-Sharaa\u2019s rise cautiously, weighing his past ties to jihadist groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda against his efforts to present himself as a reformed leader advocating for an inclusive Syria that represents its diverse religious and ethnic communities."

      "Just over two weeks ago, it was his turn. Early on Feb. 18, Hathleen, 25, was still asleep at his family home in the village of Umm Al-Kheir on the outskirts of Masafer Yatta in the Israeli-occupied West Bank when his mother raced into the room, terrified. Israeli soldiers and excavators were outside, she yelled.",
      "Less than half an hour later, they were standing outside their home, watching in horror as an excavator tore through the building, crushing its walls to rubble and snapping its metal roof in half.",
      "Asked to comment on the incident on Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces were unable to provide a response as of Friday afternoon local time.",
      "Masafer Yatta\u2019s landscape of rolling hills and small hamlets gained renewed international attention when \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a documentary by Basel Adra, a Palestinian activist, and Yuval Abraham, an Israeli investigative journalist, won an Oscar on Sunday.",
      "The film highlighted the violence and abuses committed by Israeli forces and settlers against Palestinians in Masafer Yatta \u2014 but Hathleen said he feared it could \u201copen the gates of hell\u201d for those who lived there, worried that Israeli settlers and forces might increase their attacks in angry retaliation for the film.",
      "Hathleen said he believed it was important to highlight the reality Palestinians face in the occupied West Bank, but in the weeks since the documentary was announced as an Academy Award nominee, he said there had been fresh violence in the area, with Amnesty International warning last week that another village nearby was under \u201cimminent threat of forcible transfer.\u201d",
      "Hathleen, a physical therapist and activist, now sleeps in a large tent outside his brother\u2019s house with other relatives. They feared rebuilding their home only to have it torn down again by Israeli forces, while the threat of a violent settler attack hangs over him and his family.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so hard, but what should we do?\u201d he said in a phone interview on Thursday. \u201cThis is what they want\u00a0\u2014 to kick us out of our land.\u201d",
      "Like Hathleen, Mohammad Hureini, the son of prominent activist Hafez Hureini, who has made headlines for his fight to remain in At-Tuwani in Masafer Yatta, said he was glad the documentary was bringing \u201cgood attention to the situation.\u201d But, Hureini, 20, an activist and university student studying English literature, added:  \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to stop what Israel is committing.\u201d",
      "Violence against Palestinians by Israeli settlers and forces has soared since the start of the war in Gaza. According to OCHA, the United Nations\u2019 humanitarian aid agency, at least 895 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem between Oct. 7, 2023, and March 4 of this year. So far this year, 89 Palestinians in the territory have been killed, with 17 of them children under the age of 19.",

      "Masafar Yatta has been a focus of Israeli demolitions since the 1980s, after the Israeli military declared the area a restricted military zone, dubbing it \u201cFiring Zone 918.\u201d A decadeslong legal battle saw the displacement and return of Palestinian families to the area, but that ended in May 2022, when Israel\u2019s High Court of Justice authorized the state to demolish villages in the area and expel its residents.",
      "OCHA has called forced evictions resulting from demolitions a  \u201cgross violation of human rights,\u201d while human rights organizations including Israel-based Peace Now and B\u2019Tselem have condemned Israel\u2019s mounting destruction of Palestinian homes in the area.",

      "Initially, the idea for a second phase of a ceasefire included Hamas\u2019 releasing more hostages in return for Israel's withdrawing from the Palestinian territory, with the aim of ending the war.",
      "But with no talks continuing, Israel reinstated a halt in the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza after the initial phase of the ceasefire ended. Hamas then accused Israel of violating their agreement by \u201cevading the commitment to end the war and withdraw completely from Gaza.\u201d",
      "Israel recently approved a plan from the\u00a0U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff,\u00a0that would have continued the first stage of the ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover instead of proceeding to the second phase of peace talks.",

      "White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement Sunday that Israel has \"negotiated in good faith since the beginning of this administration to ensure the release of hostages held captive by Hamas terrorists.\"",

      "LONDON \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin has for years unsuccessfully tried to oust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Now, those efforts are being entertained by senior officials in Ukraine\u2019s single most important backer, the United States.",
      "Either Zelenskyy \u201cneeds to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. Two days after the Ukrainian president was publicly berated by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, and asked to leave the White House without signing an important deal, Johnson said it was \u201cup to the Ukrainians to figure that out.\u201d",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz said Washington needed \u201ca leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war.\u201d He told CNN that \u201cif it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy\u2019s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in this country, then I think we have a real issue.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wasn\u2019t sure if the U.S. \u201ccan ever do business with Zelenskyy again.\u201d He said that Ukraine\u2019s leader \u201ceither needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\u201d",
      "Critics say this plays into the hands of Russia, aiding Moscow\u2019s yearslong bid to oust Ukraine\u2019s pro-Western leader, while fanning Kyiv\u2019s domestic political divisions during wartime.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov on Monday called the White House clash an \u201cunprecedented event\u201d that showed \u201cZelenskyy largely demonstrated a complete lack of diplomatic skills.\u201d The exchange was part of Ukraine\u2019s \u201crefusal to acknowledge the real situation on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly a blind person could fail to see this, and only a deaf person would refuse to hear it.\u201d",
      "Still, the Ukrainian leader has remained defiant and popular among European leaders. There is also evidence that last week\u2019s clash in the Oval Office may have even boosted his domestic support.",
      "\u201cIf they replace me, given what is going on, given the support, simply replacing me will not be simple,\u201d Zelenskyy told British media. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just hold an election. You need to also not let me run. This will be a bit more difficult. Looks like you will have to negotiate with me.\u201d",
      "Trump and his advisers such as Elon Musk have criticized Ukraine\u2019s indefinite postponement of elections scheduled for 2024, delayed because the country is under martial law following its invasion by Russia. That led to Trump calling democratically elected Zelenskyy  \u201ca dictator without elections.\u201d",
      "More and more Ukrainians are in favor of this pause, with support\u00a0 up to 58% from 52% last week, Ukrainian pollster Gradus found in data published Sunday.",
      "Other polling suggests that, while certainly more politically fallible than he was during the early days of the war, Zelenskyy remains widely popular and could well win a democratic ballot. In fact, another Gradus survey suggested that the Oval Office bust-up has coincided with a boost in Zelenskyy\u2019s domestic approval rising to 49% as of Saturday.",
      "Meanwhile, trust in Zelenskyy appears to be increasing, up to 65% from 57% in January, a poll by\u00a0the Ukrainian research organization Rating Group found.",
      "Zelenskyy \u201cwas elected in 2019 with the large margin,\u201d said Yevhen Mahda, director of the Kyiv think tank Institute of World Policy, adding that there isn\u2019t a serious risk to his leadership inside the country. Although Zelenskyy has offered to resign if Ukraine gets NATO membership, these statements are \u201ca bit populistic\u201d because of how unlikely that is, Mahda said.",
      "One man possibly more popular than him is Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine\u2019s former top military commander \u2014 known as the Iron General \u2014 whom Zelenskyy fired in a February 2024 shakeup. Zaluzhniy, since posted to the United Kingdom as ambassador, was trusted by 76% of respondents in the Rating Group survey \u2014 higher than his boss, the president.",
      "But in informal conversations over the weekend, political, military and diplomatic figures in Kyiv, even those who did not personally support the Ukrainian leader, unanimously told NBC News that replacing Zelenskyy now would only benefit Russia. Rather than seeing a humiliation of their leader, they saw it as an example of Ukraine standing up to the U.S. and saying \u201cno.\u201d",
      "Still, many in Ukraine are under no illusions at the leverage Washington still holds over them.",
      "One soldier in Kramatorsk, Volodymyr Chystyi, whose nickname is clean guy, laid it out in stark terms: \u201cThe only international pressure that could possibly force Zelenslyi to resign is a pressure from America.\u201d",
      "Yevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party, said her leader has \u201cmade it clear he\u2019s not in politics for power. His aim is to ensure real, lasting peace to Ukraine and to achieve some security guarantees.\u201d",
      "\u201cHonestly, I do not understand calls for President Zelenskyy to resign in the middle of an existential genocidal war,\u201d she added. \u201cOur defense heavily depends on President Zelenskyy\u2019s leadership. Even the critics in Ukraine acknowledge that the discussion about replacing him is absurd and premature.\u201d",
      "Trump has wrongly claimed that Zelenskyy\u2019s approval rating is 4%, and Musk said the Ukrainian leader was avoiding a vote because he would \u201close in a landslide.\u201d",
      "There doesn\u2019t appear to be much evidence for either of these assertions. Trump appears to have gotten his statistic from an unscientific poll on the Telegram messaging service by one of Zelenskyy\u2019s political rivals.",
      "Alexander Smith reported from London, and Victor Sema and Daryna Meyer from Kyiv."

      "The Israeli military said its aircraft struck a drone that crossed from Israel into southern Gaza and \u201cseveral suspects\u201d who tried to collect it in what appeared to be a botched smuggling attempt.",
      "The strike comes one day after an Israeli drone strike\u00a0killed two people\u00a0in Gaza on Friday. The Israeli military said it attacked a group of suspected militants operating near its troops in northern Gaza and planting an explosive device in the ground.",
      "The fresh attacks come as a delegation from Hamas engages in ceasefire talks in Cairo with Egyptian mediators who have been helping facilitate the talks along with officials from Qatar, aiming to proceed to the next stage of the deal, which could open the way to ending the war.",
      "Hamas said there are \u201cpositive indicators\u201d over the possible start of negotiations for the second phase of the ceasefire deal, without giving further details.",
      "\u201cWe affirm our readiness to engage in the second-phase negotiations in a way that meets the demands of our people, and we call for intensified efforts to aid the Gaza Strip and lift the blockade on our suffering people,\u201d the group\u2019s spokesman, Abdel-Latif Al-Qanoua, said in a statement.",

      "The first phase of the ceasefire ended last week, and Israel has since imposed a total blockade on all goods entering the enclave, demanding that Hamas free remaining hostages without beginning the negotiations to end the Gaza war.",
      "Fighting has been halted since January 19 and Hamas has released 33 Israeli hostages and five Thais for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Israeli authorities believe fewer than half of the remaining 59 hostages are still alive.",
      "Israel\u2019s assault on the enclave has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities. It has also internally displaced nearly Gaza\u2019s entire population and led to accusations of genocide and war crimes that Israel denies.",
      "The assault began after Hamas-led Islamist fighters raided southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages, according to Israeli tallies."

    "story": [
      "North Korea unveiled for the first time a nuclear-powered submarine under construction, a weapons system that can pose a major security threat to South Korea and the U.S.",
      "State media on Saturday released photos showing what it called \u201ca nuclear-powered strategic guided missile submarine,\u201d as it reported leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s visits to major shipyards where warships are built.",
      "The Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, didn\u2019t provide details on the submarine, but said Kim was briefed on its construction.",
      "The naval vessel appears to be a 6,000-ton-class or 7,000-ton-class one which can carry about 10 missiles, said Moon Keun-sik, a South Korean submarine expert who teaches at Seoul\u2019s Hanyang University. He said the use of the term \u201cthe strategic guided missiles\u201d meant it would carry nuclear-capable weapons.",
      "\u201cIt would be absolutely threatening to us and the U.S.,\u201d Moon said.",
      "A nuclear-powered submarine was among a long wishlist of sophisticated weaponry that Kim vowed to introduce during a major political conference in 2021 to cope with what he called escalating U.S.-led military threats. Other weapons were\u00a0solid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missiles,\u00a0hypersonic weapons, spy satellites and\u00a0multi-warhead missiles.\u00a0North Korea has since performed a run of testing activities to acquire them.",
      "North Korea obtaining a greater ability to fire missiles from underwater is a worrying development because it\u2019s difficult for its rivals to detect such launches in advance.",
      "Questions about how North Korea, a heavily sanctioned and impoverished country, could get resources and technology to build nuclear-powered submarines have surfaced.",
      "Moon, the submarine expert, said North Korea may have received\u00a0Russian\u00a0technological assistance to build a nuclear reactor to be used in the submarine in return for supplying conventional weapons and troops to support Russia\u2019s war efforts against Ukraine.",
      "He also said North Korea could launch the submarine in one or two years to test its capability before its actual deployment.",
      "North Korea has an estimated 70-90 diesel-powered submarines in one of the world\u2019s largest fleets. However, they are mostly aging ones capable of launching only torpedoes and mines, not missiles.",
      "In 2023, North Korea said it had launched what it called its first\u00a0\u201ctactical nuclear attack submarine,\u201d\u00a0but foreign experts doubted the North\u2019s announcement and speculated it was likely a diesel-powered submarine disclosed in 2019. Moon said there has been no confirmation that it has been deployed.",
      "North Korea has conducted a slew of\u00a0underwater-launched ballistic missile tests\u00a0since 2016, but all launches were made from the same 2,000-ton-class submarine which has a single launch tube. Many experts call it a test platform, rather than an operational submarine in active service.",
      "In recent days, North Korea has been dialing up its\u00a0fiery rhetoric\u00a0against the U.S. and South Korea ahead of their upcoming\u00a0annual military drills\u00a0set to start Monday.",
      "During his visits to the shipyards, Kim said North Korea aims to modernize water-surface and underwater warships simultaneously. He stressed the need to make \u201cthe incomparably overwhelming warships fulfill their mission\u201d to contain \u201cthe inveterate gunboat diplomacy of the hostile forces,\u201d KCNA reported Saturday."

      "Russian strikes on Ukraine have killed at least 20 people, officials said Saturday, as heavy aerial attacks continued into the second night following a U.S. decision to\u00a0stop sharing satellite images\u00a0with Ukraine.",
      "The decision to withhold intelligence and military aid came on the heels of\u00a0a tempestuous White House visit\u00a0last week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Without U.S. satellite imagery, Ukraine\u2019s ability to strike inside Russia and defend itself from bombardment is\u00a0significantly diminished.",
      "At least 11 people were killed in multiple strikes on a town in Ukraine\u2019s embattled Donetsk region late Friday, regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said. The attack damaged eight apartment blocks in the town of Dobropillya, which is close to the front where Russian troops have been making steady advances. Ukraine\u2019s State Emergency Service said a Russian drone damaged a Ukrainian fire truck while rescuers fought to extinguish the burning buildings.",
      "Another six people were killed in the front-line towns of Pokrovsk, Kostyantynivka, Myrnograd and Ivanopillya, Filashkin said, while emergency services reported that three others died when a Russian drone hit a civilian workshop in the northeastern Kharkiv region.",
      "Filashkin declared Saturday a day of mourning in the region and warned that more victims could still be found in the rubble.",
      "Zelenskyy said at least five children were among the injured in Dobropillya. \u201cLast night, the Russian army fired two ballistic missiles at the center of Dobropillya,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter emergency services arrived at the scene, they launched another strike, deliberately targeting rescuers. It is a vile and inhumane intimidation tactic to which the Russians often resort.\u201d",
      "The wave of attacks took place just 24 hours after Russia hit Ukrainian energy facilities with dozens of missiles and drones, hobbling its ability to deliver heat and light to its citizens and to power weapons factories vital to its defenses.",
      "The barrage came after the U.S.\u00a0suspended military aid and intelligence\u00a0to Ukraine to pressure it into accepting a peace deal being pushed by the Trump administration.",
      "When asked Friday by a reporter during an Oval Office exchange if Russian President Vladimir Putin was taking advantage of the U.S. pause on intelligence-sharing to attack Ukraine, President Donald Trump responded: \u201cI think he\u2019s doing what anybody else would.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy did not reference the intelligence-sharing deal, but did seem to appeal to other statements Trump made Friday related to financial sanctions against Moscow. Writing on social media, the U.S. president\u00a0proposed imposing large-scale\u00a0banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a cease-fire and final peace settlement was reached.",
      "Zelenskyy welcomed the prospect of additional sanctions on Moscow, saying, \u201cEverything that helps Putin finance the war must be broken.\u201d",
      "Ukraine\u2019s air force reported Saturday that Russian troops launched three Iskander missiles and 145 drones over the country overnight. The bombardment contained a mix of attack and decoy drones intended to confuse air defenses. One missile and 79 drones were shot down, while 54 more drones were lost without causing damage, the Ukrainian air force said.",
      "Meanwhile, Russian troops shot down 31 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 26 over the country\u2019s Krasnodar region, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said Saturday.",
      "Falling debris from one drone sparked a blaze at the KINEF oil refinery in Russia\u2019s northern Leningrad region, local Gov. Aleksandr Drozdenko said in a statement. No casualties were reported."

      "But for years, the guesthouse in Great Yarmouth, a run-down resort town on Britain\u2019s east coast, played host to a freelance spy ring orchestrating cross-continental honeytraps, kidnappings, and murder plots\u00a0targeting high-profile dissidents and sensitive military sites.",
      "The details, which seem pulled straight from a spy novel, unfolded in British courts last week after three Bulgarians were found guilty of conspiracy to spy \u2014 members of a Russian ring operating from their base in the United Kingdom.",
      "Gabriela Gaberova, 30, a beautician tapped to carry out honeytraps; Katrin Ivanova, 33, a lab assistant who was also found guilty of \"possessing identity documents with improper intention;\" and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, a painter-decorator and Gaberova\u2019s former partner, made up the ragtag group of amateur operatives who managed to carry out espionage operations for the Kremlin on what prosecutors described as being on \"an industrial scale.\"",
      "Their handler, a fellow Bulgarian named Biser Dzhambazov, called himself \"Mad Max\" and doubled as a medical courier as well as a knot in the spy ring's tangled romantic subplot.",
      "Dzhambazov lived with Ivanova before ending their long-term relationship after developing feelings for Gaberova. When police raided the beautician\u2019s northwest London flat in February 2023, they found Dzhambazov and Gaberova in bed together.",
      "Their ringleader was a fifth Bulgarian, Orlin Roussev, part spy, part IT specialist, who adopted the name \u201cJackie Chan\u201d in messages to his side-kick, Dzhambazov.",
      "Roussev and Dzhambazov both pled guilty to espionage charges following their arrest in 2023.\u00a0A sixth Bulgarian, a mixed martial arts fighter code name \u201cThe Destroyer,\u201d real name Ivan Stoyanov, also admitted spying for Russia.",
      "Meanwhile, Roussev\u2019s \u2018minions\u2019 \u2014 which he named after the yellow characters from the Despicable Me animated series \u2014 denied the charges.",
      "Instead of being part of the cartoon villain Gru\u2019s scheme, these defendants were real-life operatives working for the Russian intelligence service, also named GRU.",
      "From 2020 to 2023, the gang carried out a series of chaotic and often disorganized covert missions, one of which targeted Christo Grozev, an investigative journalist renowned for exposing Russian involvement in\u00a0the poisoning of MI6 double agent Sergei Skripal with Novichok nerve agent in Salisbury, in southern England, in March 2018.",
      "The group tracked his movements across Austria, Montenegro, and Spain, even considering a honeytrap, with Gaberova potentially involved in the scheme.",
      "In 2022, they surveilled Roman Dobrokhotov, a journalist critical of Russia, with discussions of a possible kidnapping. Telegram messages show the group followed him from Budapest to Berlin before losing him at passport control.",
      "In another bizarre plot, the group planned to spray the Kazakh Embassy in London with what Britain's Crown Prosecution Service described as \"large quantities of fake pig\u2019s blood.\" They also schemed to create a false opposition group to stage a protest outside the embassy, and feed the sham information about the fake group to Kazakh Intelligence, in order to boost Russia\u2019s image.",
      "The group also tracked Kirill Kachur, a former Russian official, in Montenegro, planning a kidnapping. They surveilled a U.S. military base in Stuttgart, focusing on Ukrainian forces. Additionally, they conducted covert operations against former Kazakh politician Bergey Ryskaliyev, attempting to access his residence and gather intelligence.",
      "Investigators uncovered a trove of over 200,000 messages between the operatives, as well as spy equipment worth tens of thousands of dollars, including cameras hidden in pens and ties, and videos showing the group surveilling specific sites of interest.",
      "In addition to espionage, the group was implicated in broader Russian efforts to influence foreign political climates and destabilize rival nations.",
      "The three defendants will be held in custody until sentencing in May.",
      "Commander Dominic Murphy, head of Scotland Yard's SO15 which deals with state threats, said it was one of the U.K.'s largest espionage investigations of the last 15 years.",
      "Prosecutors said\u00a0the group was directed by alleged Russian agent\u00a0Jan Marsalek, an Austrian national,\u00a0who had contact with Russian intelligence agencies.",
      "The shadowy former COO of Wirecard, who is wanted Germany and subject to an Interpol red notice,\u00a0had fled to\u00a0Russia, where he allegedly ran the Bulgarian network.",
      "Marsalek and Roussev discussed the kidnap and murder of both Grozev and Kirill Kachur, who had worked for the Investigative Committee of Russia until falling out with the Kremlin.",

      "The same day Geslain Luma, a 29-year-old Haitian immigrant, learned he was granted temporary protected status to remain in the United States was the same day President Donald Trump announced plans to cut the program short.",
      "Figuring out his future with \u201cthe end of TPS gives me a headache,\u201d Luma said.",
      "For more than 15 years, TPS has allowed thousands of Haitians to work legally in the U.S. and avoid deportation while their homeland grapples with political instability, gang violence and economic hardship.",
      "Since the assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in 2021, armed gangs have gained control over much of Port-au-Prince, creating a power vacuum that has made governing a challenge and fueled further violence, homelessness and starvation. More than 5,600 people were killed and 1,400 were kidnapped amid gang conflicts last year, according to the United Nations. The violence has rendered 1 million people homeless in Haiti, forcing many into makeshift shelters and exacerbating the country\u2019s economic challenges.",
      "But with the Trump administration\u2019s decision to end TPS by August 2025, an estimated 500,000 Haitian immigrants living in the U.S. face an uncertain future, forced to decide whether to stay and fight for legal status or prepare for a return to a country in crisis.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security responded to a request for comment.",
      "In and around New York City, where at least 160,000 Haitian people live, Brooklyn\u2019s Haitian community has formed deep roots while also sharing fears of deportation. Evangelical Crusade Christian Church in the Flatbush neighborhood has served as a sanctuary for Haitian immigrants for at least five decades, providing a range of services, including food pantries, wellness events and legal assistance.",
      "\u201cThe community is worried,\u201d said the Rev. Samuel Nicolas, the church\u2019s senior pastor. \u201cFor over 15 years, these individuals have built their lives here, believing TPS would eventually lead to permanent residency. Now, they are watching that hope slip away.\u201d",
      "Many fled the country after a devastating earthquake struck Haiti in 2010, killing more than 200,000 people and leaving an estimated 1.3 million people homeless. In the aftermath, people arrived in the U.S. and gained TPS protection, seeking stability that allowed them to rebuild their lives. But the program was never meant to be a permanent solution.",
      "Abigail Desravines, a 35-year-old Haitian immigrant, came to the U.S. following the earthquake.",
      "\u201cThe conditions were getting worse and worse,\u201d Desravines recalled. Family members in the U.S. \u201cwere calling, asking what we were going to do. We told them we wanted to come here for school because I could not stay in Haiti for school. I lost classmates. There was a lot of loss.\u201d",
      "Desravines said TPS allowed her and her sister to build a life in the U.S., and she eventually earned a green card. Despite the protection it offered, Desravines said living under TPS still involved hurdles and instability.",
      "\u201cPeople think TPS is a free pass, but it\u2019s not,\u201d Desravines said. \u201cYou have to keep renewing, pay fees and live with the fear that it could end at any time. It\u2019s not an easy path.\u201d",
      "On top of paying fees, some colleges require TPS holders to pay tuition \u201cout of pocket like international students,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though we lived in the U.S. for years, some colleges did not allow us in-state tuition.\u201d",
      "Desravines\u2019 parents remained in Haiti while she and her sister lived with extended family and continued their education. While adjusting to life in the U.S., the sisters quietly shouldered the burdens of work, studies and immigration uncertainties, without adding further stress to their parents as they dealt with the earthquake\u2019s aftermath.",
      "\u201cMy parents had their own struggles,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had the opportunity to come to the U.S., and we did not want our parents to worry. But it affected us emotionally, and it did affect our grades.\u201d",
      "The end of the program will create a disruption, as many TPS holders have jobs, attend school and are parts of their communities.",
      "For those now facing the threat of deportation, the prospect of returning to Haiti is daunting. The country remains plagued by instability, and Nicolas said he believes sending people back under these conditions is inhumane.",
      "\u201cHaiti is not in a place where people with TPS or those under humanitarian programs can return,\u201d he said. \u201cHaiti is being overrun by armed groups and the infrastructure is barely functioning.\u201d",
      "Luma, the new TPS recipient, said he has also applied for asylum and holds a work permit, which is valid until 2029. However, his legal status is not guaranteed \u2014 in 2027, a judge will decide his asylum claim.",
      "\u201cWhen you appear before a judge, you never know what decision they will make, so TPS would have been an extra layer of security in a difficult situation,\u201d he said. Luma said he was concerned for friends and relatives who rely solely on TPS.",
      "\u201cA person with only TPS works, buys a car, buys a house, and now all their documents will expire,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have no choice but to self-deport because there\u2019s no way to live without legal documents.\u201d",
      "Many immigrants send money for food, education and health care to their families in Haiti, Nicolas said. \u201cIf they are deported, that financial support will disappear, worsening Haiti\u2019s humanitarian crisis.\u201d",
      "Nicolas said the deportations will also have a social and economic impact in the States.",
      "\u201cHaitians are part of the fabric of New York,\u201d he said. \u201cThey fill our churches, they work in jobs others won\u2019t take, they contribute to our economy. If TPS ends, it won\u2019t just be a Haitian problem, it will be a New York problem and a national problem.\u201d",
      "Immigrant advocacy groups are calling for legislative action to protect TPS holders, pushing for a pathway to residency for those who have lived in the U.S. for years. A group of organizations filed a lawsuit Monday seeking to block the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to end TPS for Haitians early. Nicolas said he hopes Congress steps in to provide relief, or that Trump has a change of heart.",
      "\u201cMy hope is that our president will have a compassionate heart and recognize that Haiti is not a place these people can return to,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere would they go? What infrastructure is in place for them? If we call ourselves a nation built on Christian values, then we must act with compassion.\u201d"

      "Television footage showed Yoon, 64, waving, clenching his fist and bowing to supporters waving South Korean and American flags as he walked out of the detention center in Seoul, before a convoy of black police vehicles returned him to his presidential residence.",
      "\u201cI would like to express my gratitude for the courage and determination of the Seoul Central District Court judges in rectifying this injustice,\u201d he said in a statement as he was released.",

      "The Polish prime minister announced Friday that his government is preparing to require every adult male to undergo \"large-scale military training\" to more than double the size of the army in the event of a war with Russia.",
      "Donald Tusk added that Poland would also drastically expand its arsenal, saying the country \u201cmust pursue the most advanced capabilities, including nuclear and modern unconventional weapons.\"",
      "Tusk unveiled the plans in a speech to the Polish Parliament on the same day that President Donald Trump, after weeks of weakening U.S. support for Ukraine and traditional European allies, threatened to impose expanded \u201clarge scale\u201d sanctions and tariffs on Russia until it reaches a peace agreement with Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWe will try to have a model ready by the end of this year so that every adult male in Poland is trained in the event of war, so that this reserve is comparable and adequate to the potential threats,\" Tusk said.",
      "Many of Poland's leaders were shocked when Russia invaded Ukraine three years ago. Once behind the so-called Iron Curtain under Communism and controlled by the Soviet Union, Poland is a longtime enemy of Russia.",

      "But the Polish government has become increasingly worried about the country\u2019s security since Trump made the false claim that the Ukrainians had started the war with Russia and then halted U.S. military aid\u00a0and\u00a0intelligence help\u00a0to Ukraine.",
      "Trump also has a history of questioning the U.S.'s traditional responsibilities as a member of the U.S.-led alliance.",
