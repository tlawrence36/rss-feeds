    "story": [
      "Parliament will be recalled for a rare Saturday sitting to pass an emergency law aimed at saving British Steel's Scunthorpe plant from imminent closure.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said the legislation would allow ministers to \"take control\" of the Lincolnshire site and stop its Chinese owner from closing its blast furnaces.",
      "The move opens the door to a full nationalisation of the company at a later stage, with the prime minister saying \"all options\" remained on the table.",
      "Talks have been taking place this week to keep production going at the firm, after owners Jingye said its blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable\".",
      "British Steel talks still deadlocked, source says",
      "Government considers nationalising British Steel",
      "MPs and peers are currently on their Easter break and were not due to return until 22 April, but both will now go back to Westminster for the hastily convened sitting.",
      "It will be only the fifth time since World War Two that Parliament has sat on a Saturday, showing the importance the government is placing on the law.",
      "Sir Keir said the government wanted to pass the legislation in a single day, adding the future of the company \"hangs in the balance\".",
      "He said steelmaking was \"essential for our future\" and that he would always \"act in the national interest to protect British jobs and British workers\".",
      "\"Jobs, investment, growth, our economic and national security are all on the line,\" the prime minister said.",
      "The BBC understands from a senior government source the emergency legislation being voted on in Parliament on Saturday would not give ministers the power to nationalise British Steel, another bill would be needed to do that.",
      "Chinese company Jingye, which bought British Steel in 2020, says it has invested more than \u00a31.2bn in the company to maintain operations, but has been suffering financial losses of around \u00a3700,000 a day.",
      "The business department said the new law would give the government powers to order raw materials to keep the site's two running blast furnaces going, with supplies otherwise due to run out in the coming weeks.",
      "It added it would also allow ministers to direct the company's board and workforce, and ensure anyone at the plant \"who takes steps to keep it running, against the orders of the Chinese ownership\" can be reinstated if they are sacked.",
      "'Foundation industry'",
      "The company announced plans last month to shed jobs at the Scunthorpe site, which employs 2,700 people, blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with lower-carbon production techniques.",
      "The government has offered \u00a3500m of support to partly fund a switch from blast furnaces to more energy efficient electric arc furnaces. But the offer has been rejected by the company.",
      "Earlier this week, the government offered to buy the coking coal to keep the blast furnaces running until a longer-term solution to saving the plant could be found, but was unable to get the company to agree to this in tense negotiations.",
      "The business secretary is thought to have lost confidence in the company's Chinese owners, with a government source saying they are \"no longer trustworthy partners\".",
      "The move to take control of the company has been welcomed by unions representing employees at the site, with Unite saying it would grant workers a \"reprieve\" while a longer-term solution is worked out.",
      "\"Ministers could not have allowed a foundation industry to go under,\" added general secretary Sharon Graham.",
      "The GMB union said the government's move looked like the \"first step\" towards nationalisation, which it supported as the \"only way to save the UK steel industry\".",
      "Steelworkers' union Community said the government could not allow the UK to become the only country in the G7 group of advanced economies \"without primary steelmaking capacity\".",
      "'Sticking plaster'",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused the government of having \"bungled\" the negotiations with British Steel.",
      "\"They must have seen this coming for a while,\" she added.",
      "\"Instead of addressing it earlier in the week when Parliament was sitting, their incompetence has led to a last-minute recall of Parliament.\"",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the government's plan was just a \"short-term sticking plaster\".",
      "He added that his party would try to amend the emergency legislation to nationalise British Steel immediately, calling public ownership \"the only option we have to save this vital strategic asset\".",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said \"nothing should be off the table in this matter of national security\" and added that the recall of Parliament should be seen as \"an opportunity to come forward with a serious plan for the sustainable future of domestic steel production\".",
      "The Green Party of England and Wales said it backed nationalisation as the \"only sure way to secure this strategically important sector\".",
      "Parliament was last recalled from a scheduled break in August 2021 to discuss the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.",
      "The Falkland Islands invasion in 1982 and the proposed Brexit deal in 2019 are two other occasions that have merited recalls.",

    "summary": "MPs are having an emergency debate on the future of the UK's only remaining plant making virgin steel.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government is poised to take control of a major British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, which is at risk of imminent closure.",
      "MPs have been called back from their Easter break to pass an emergency law which would keep the Chinese-owned site operating.",
      "What is British Steel and how many people work there?",
      "British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, employs 2,700 people, about three-quarters of the company's entire workforce.",
      "It is the last plant in the UK capable of producing virgin steel, which is used in major construction projects like new buildings and railways.",
      "Two huge blast furnaces are used to produce the steel, which has fewer imperfections than the recycled steel made elsewhere in the country.",
      "Were the plant to cease producing virgin steel, then the UK would become the only member of the G7 group of leading economies without the ability to make it - a prospect the government views as a risk to the country's long-term economic security.",
      "Who owns British Steel and why is it losing money?",
      "Following a period of financial instability, British Steel was taken over by the government's insolvency service in 2019 and then acquired by Chinese steel-making firm Jingye the following year.",
      "The company says the plant continues to lose \u00a3700,000 a day despite \u00a31.2bn of investment. It has begun a 45-day consultation on job cuts.",
      "Jingye says the blast furnaces are no longer sustainable, blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with transitioning to lower-carbon production techniques.",
      "The blast furnaces generate the extreme heat needed to produce virgin steel and are fuelled by coking coal and iron pellets - but supplies of those raw materials at the Scunthorpe plant are running low.",
      "That adds a time pressure to the British Steel talks because once a blast furnace shuts down, it is a costly and complex process to restart it again.",
      "Last month, the company was accused by one of its customers of failing to order the raw materials needed to keep the site going, a claim which Jingye rejected.",
      "UK steel production has been falling for several decades and the financial pressures facing the industry were heightened in March when the US imposed a 25% tariff on any steel it imports.",
      "Global over-production of steel has created \"a glut of steel on the international market\", according to a UK government briefing on the industry, which has pushed prices down. British manufacturers also face higher costs, particularly on electricity, than elsewhere.",
      "Could the UK government take control?",
      "The government has ordered MPs to return from their Easter breaks for an unusual weekend sitting in the Commons, as it weighs up options to protect the site.",
      "On Friday, Sir Keir Starmer announced plans to fast-track a law through Parliament which would give the government the power to assume control of some of the site's operations.",
      "That would include the ability to order raw materials to keep the furnaces running and to direct the company's workforce and board.",
      "The government has told the company's UK management to keep the site operational, and the emergency law will ensure that any employees who are sacked by the Chinese owners can be reinstated.",
      "This intervention stops short of nationalisation - when a government takes ownership and control of a company - but Sir Keir said the government would do \"everything possible\" to \"protect\" the UK's steel industry.",
      "The prime minister's decision to announce emergency legislation follows tense talks between the government and Jingye earlier this week, which appear to have largely broken down.",
      "The government offered to buy the raw materials needed to keep the furnaces going but Jingye did not agree to that proposal.",
      "Unions have said the situation is on a \"cliff-edge\", while the Community Union described the lack of supplies needed to keep the furnaces operational as an \"extreme emergency\".",
      "Linda McCulloch from the Unite union said they would like the government to nationalise the site \"to keep steelmaking alive in the UK\".",
      "The GMB trade union has raised concerns to the BBC about the way Jingye is operating the plant.",
      "Who else produces steel in the UK?",
      "There are 1,160 businesses in the UK steel industry, directly supporting 40,000 other firms across the country, according to government figures.",
      "Tata Steel at Port Talbot in Wales was once the UK's largest virgin steel producer but it turned off its blast furnace in September 2024, saying it was losing \u00a31.7m a day.",
      "An agreement with the UK government was reached which saw it commit \u00a3500m to help the company move to greener forms of steelmaking.",
      "Other steelmakers in the UK include Liberty Steel, Celsa, Marcegaglia and Outokumpu.",
      "Liberty Steel also has a plant in Scunthorpe which is facing closure. More than 120 jobs are at risk, with bosses blaming high energy costs.",
      "In 2023 the UK steel industry contributed \u00a32.3 billion to the UK economy -  equivalent to 0.1% of total UK economic output and 1.0% of manufacturing output.",
      "In the same year, the UK produced 5.6 million tonnes of crude steel, or 0.3% of the world's total. In comparison, China produced more than 1,000 million tonnes, 54% of global production.",
      "The EU produced 126 million tonnes of steel in 2023, 7% of the world's total. Compared with EU countries, the UK ranked as the eighth largest steel producer, after Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Austria, Poland and Belgium.",

    "story": [
      "In response to why Beijing is not backing down to Donald Trump on tariffs, the answer is that it doesn't have to.",
      "China's leaders would say that they are not inclined to cave in to a bully \u2013 something its government has repeatedly labelled the Trump administration as \u2013 but it also has a capacity to do this way beyond any other country on Earth.",
      "Before the tariff war kicked in, China did have a massive volume of sales to the US but, to put it into context, this only amounted to 2% of its GDP.",
      "That said, the Communist Party would clearly prefer not to be locked in a trade war with the US at a time when it has been struggling to fix its own considerable economic headaches, after years of a real estate crisis, overblown regional debt and persistent youth unemployment.",
      "However, despite this, the government has told its people that it is in a strong position to resist the attacks from the US.",
      "It also knows its own tariffs are clearly going to hurt US exporters as well.",
      "Trump has been bragging to his supporters that it would be easy to force China into submission by simply hitting the country with tariffs, but this has proven to be misleading in the extreme.",
      "Beijing is not going to surrender.",
      "China's leader Xi Jinping told the visiting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Friday that his country and the European Union should \"jointly resist the unilateral bullying practices\" of the Trump administration.",
      "Sanchez, in turn, said that China's trade tensions with the US should not impede its cooperation with Europe.",
      "Their meeting took place in the Chinese capital in the hours before Beijing again increased its tariffs on goods from the US - though it has said it will not respond to further US tariff increases.",
      "Next week Xi will visit Malaysia, Vietnam and Cambodia. These are all countries which have been hit hard by Trump's tariffs.",
      "His ministers have been meeting counterparts from South Africa, Saudi Arabia and India, talking up greater trade co-operation.",
      "In addition, China and the EU are reportedly in talks about potentially removing European tariffs on Chinese cars, to be replaced by a minimum price instead, to rein in a new round of dumping.",
      "In short, wherever you look, you can see that China has options.",
      "And analysts have said that these mutual tariff increases by the two superpowers are now becoming almost meaningless, as they've already passed the point of cutting out much of the trade between them.",
      "So, the tit-for-tat tariff increases in both directions have become more like symbolism.",
      "China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning has, over the past two days, posted images of Chairman Mao on social media, including a clip during the Korean War when he told the US that \"no matter how long this war lasts we will never yield\".",

      "The economy expanded by 0.5%, with the services sector having a strong month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.",
      "The better-than-expected figures come as the UK economy braces itself for the impact of tariffs imposed on goods imported to the US, with analysts warning that growth could prove short-lived.",
      "Tariffs on steel and aluminium came into effect on 12 March, while a 10% tariff on other goods came into effect this week.",
      "Goods exports from the UK to the US increased for the third consecutive month and are now at the highest level since November 2022, the ONS said.",
      "\"There are clear signs that UK firms increased goods exports to the US ahead of the introduction of tariffs,\" said William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).",
      "\"Data for the past three months shows a 23% increase in the value of goods flowing from the UK across the Atlantic,\" Mr Bain said.",
      "Economists had predicted UK growth of just 0.1% in February, but the ONS said several factors contributed to the surprise rise which was driven by a boost in manufacturing and production.",
      "The government has made growing the UK economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards.",
      "Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said February's surprise growth was due to computer programming, telecoms and car dealerships in the services sector all having \"strong months\".",
      "She added that manufacturing, electronics and pharmaceutical businesses performed well, and the car making industry also picked up after \"its recent poor performance\".",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the latest growth figures an \"encouraging sign\", but added the government was \"not complacent\".",
      "\"We must go further and faster to kickstart economic growth, provide security for working people and put more money in their pockets,\" she added.",
      "The UK is subject to the blanket 10% tariff on nearly all of its goods being brought into the US, which is expected to hit British exporters and also affect economic growth.",
      "Mr Bain from the BCC said securing a deal with the US and removing trade barriers with the EU would be \"key to cushioning the negative impacts of the sweeping new US tariffs\".",
      "Speaking to reporters, Reeves said: \"We continue to engage with our counterparts in the United States and of course we want to secure the best deal possible for British jobs and British industry and we are absolutely committed and resolved to do everything we can,\" she told reporters.",
      "How fast is the UK's economy growing?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Alongside the better-than-expected growth, the ONS revised up its figure for January from a contraction of 0.1% to no growth.",
      "Monthly figures alone can be volatile so should be taken in context. The more stable three-month average to February shows growth is up 0.6%.",
      "This would have been considered normal growth a decade ago, but has been elusive in recent years.",
      "However, it suggests that recent talk of a recession has been way off the mark.",
      "But February's figure comes ahead of the impact of tax rises on businesses and household energy and water bill increases on the economy, along with US tariffs.",
      "Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist, said the UK's \"surprisingly strong growth will prove short lived, as rises in tariffs and taxes bite\".",
      "\"The big picture is that the economy has grown in only four of the last nine months and it's hard to see the economy strengthening much from here,\" she said.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said: \"Since coming to office, Labour's choices have killed growth stone dead and there is still a long way to go to recover.\"",
      "While there is an acknowledgement that the uncertainty from US tariffs poses threats to the economy, some experts believe it may also create opportunities for a the UK as a stable, growing trade-friendly economy.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 23:07:36 GMT",
    "summary": "Cocoa prices are soaring so new chocolate firms are looking at an alternative ingredient.",
    "story": [
      "The first thing I notice is the lack of a strong aroma. There's no familiar, powerful waft of cocoa when opening this bag of sweets, the packet of biscuits, or the caramel-filled truffles.",
      "And as I taste each one as part of my solemn commitment to inform the public, I don't get quite the same burst of chocolate flavour that you might expect from treats with that familiar, waxy, light brown chocolate-like coating. The thing is, this isn't chocolate. It's made with sunflower seeds. Or fava (also called broad) beans.",
      "The selection before me is just a smattering of the non-cocoa containing alternatives to chocolate that are creeping into the European retail market right now. Their makers have spied an opportunity, partly because real chocolate prices are soaring.",
      "\"The average increase in price for chocolate was 9% over 2024,\" says Richard Caines, principal analyst in UK food and drink research at market research firm Mintel. \"In January just gone, it's shot up by 14%.\"",
      "That's the retail price of chocolate. The wholesale price of the key ingredient, cocoa \u2013 which is made from fermented, roasted and ground cacao beans \u2013 has increased by an astonishing 300% in 2024.",
      "\"I have been looking at this chocolate market for quite a few years now \u2013 I don't remember a big story like this on costs going up,\" adds Mr Caines.",
      "A key reason for this increase is climate change-related weather impacts on cacao farms, particularly in West Africa.",
      "Plus, some farmers in Ghana are turning away from cacao production in favour of illegal gold-mining, according to reports.",
      "It means that there was a deficit of roughly 500,000 tonnes of cocoa in the global market last year.",
      "Real chocolate could become a \"luxury\" item in the future says Massimo Sabatini, co-founder and chief executive of Italian firm Foreverland, which makes a cocoa powder alternative called Choruba.",
      "The company opened its production facility in March, where staff process not cacao beans but carob husks.",
      "Carob trees produce small, brown, banana-shaped pods containing seeds. It's possible to process the pods to create a cocoa-like powder. This chocolate alternative has a long history, however \u2013 and not a very happy one.",
      "A New Yorker article claims a generation was \"traumatized\" by carob-based confectionary during the 1970s. It didn't taste as good as real chocolate, and it didn't melt in your mouth in the same way, apparently.",
      "But Mr Sabatini insists that he and his colleagues have come up with a worthy product. He acknowledges that carob \"really doesn't taste like chocolate\" but adds that Foreverland's fermentation and roasting process removes some of the carob flavour to get it closer to cocoa.",
      "Their carob-based dark chocolate alternative is sweeter and more caramel-like than real dark chocolate, he explains.",
      "There could be health benefits to this. \"We can reduce drastically the sugar content,\" says Mr Sabatini. Carob is also higher in fibre and lower in fat than cocoa.",
      "German food manufacturer Planet A Foods has developed a different chocolate alternative. Sara Marquart, co-founder and chief technology officer, says her goal is not to replace chocolate but to help fill the gap in the market caused by volatility in cocoa availability and prices.",
      "Unlike Foreverland, Planet A Foods have chosen sunflower seeds as the key ingredient in their cocoa powder alternative, ChoViva.",
      "\"We process sunflower seeds like cocoa beans,\" explains Dr Marquart. \"It's a highly abundant ingredient, there's millions and millions of tonnes on the market.\"",
      "ChoViva is now present in roughly 35 different retail products, mostly on the market in Germany and France \u2013 though it also appears in mini egg-shaped sweets sold by Aldi in the UK. The sweets are made with peanuts and have a chocolate-like coating containing ChoViva.",
      "When I try them, the flavour is overwhelmingly dominated by the salty peanut at the egg's core. But the chocolatey texture of the coating is impressive. The same applies to ChoViva-covered biscuits made by the firm.",
      "I note that the chocolate-like coating is rather thin and not overly flavourful. But again, the texture is pretty much what you'd expect from real chocolate, though not quite as melty.",
      "The company's ChoViva-covered popcorn is probably the most chocolatey item I try \u2013 the popcorn doesn't usurp its coating.",
      "Overall, there's nothing here that would perturb a consumer. Especially one unaware that these products don't actually contain chocolate.",
      "A UK start-up also keen to compete in this space is Nukoko. Two of its founders previously ran a real chocolate business and teamed up with a food scientist to form their new venture.",
      "\"We saw first-hand the issues with the chocolate supply chain,\" says Ross Newton, co-founder. Like Foreverland and Planet A Foods, Nukoko has opted for a key ingredient that the firm can source and process locally \u2013 to reduce food miles and insulate against supply chain risks. But in Nukoko's case the raw material of choice is not carob or sunflower seeds but fava beans.",
      "\"There's around a million tonnes harvested in the UK every year,\" says Mr Newton.",
      "It's early days for the company but he adds that he hopes to begin selling their cocoa powder alternative to food firms later this year.",
      "Mr Newton says imitating the flavour of real chocolate is very hard but that, out of 25 crucial flavour compounds in real chocolate, his company's product manages to include 24 of them \u2013 though in some cases at slightly different concentrations.",
      "The company sends me four caramel-filled truffles to try. The caramel totally dominates and the truffles are very sweet. But the chocolate alternative is as smooth and glossy as you'd expect, and very satisfying to chew.",
      "\"Anything new that comes out has got to meet equal taste expectations,\" says Mr Caines, noting how discerning consumers are when it comes to their favourite chocolate-containing products. Getting them to embrace alternatives devoid of cocoa will be no mean feat.",
      "He adds that alternatives might fare best when used in bakery products \u2013 such as the chips in chocolate chip cookies: \"The chocolate is not so much the star of the show there so it might actually be more acceptable.\"",
      "Should chocolate alternatives meet with success, there is some risk that this could negatively impact cacao farmers, says Tonya Lander, a lecturer in biology at Oxford University.",
      "\"It's something that should be worked through with farmers or farmer collectives,\" she says. Cacao farmers are among the poorest agricultural workers in the world.",
      "Nukoko, Planet A Foods and Foreverland all say they don't aim to replace chocolate, rather, the goal is to fill the gap left by cocoa production shortfalls.",
      "Dr Lander and colleagues have studied environmental factors that influence yield from cacao trees.",
      "Poor pollination and high temperatures negatively affect how much cacao the trees produce, the researchers report in a study published in February.",
      "By shading cacao trees on plantations, for example, it might be possible to improve harvests and potentially reduce the volatility of cocoa supplies. Such interventions, besides switching to cocoa alternatives, could help satisfy confectionary-obsessed consumers in the coming years.",

      "Yateley Industries is part of a nationwide forum of dozens of supported businesses -   companies specialising in employing disabled people.",
      "Mr McMullan says many others are affected by the backlog.",
      "\"The annoying thing is that it's money that's been granted to us,\" he adds.  \"We have the paperwork saying this is what each person's been awarded, but the claim system is not set up for us to draw down the money effectively.\"",
      "Businesses say that as well as poor internal processes at the Department for Work and Pensions, there has also been a large increase in the bureaucracy associated with Access to Work in recent months, with many more forms having to be filled in and then posted \u2013 not uploaded or emailed \u2013 to the DWP.",

      "Sarah Thorp, who set up the No Limits cafe, said the scheme had in recent months started to refuse funding for people who wanted to get some work experience.",
      "The decision came despite the local Job Centre recommending the individuals to the cafe.  The change left the business with a shortfall of \u00a3800 a week.",
      "\"In the last 18 months, we've got 20 people into paid employment, all with disabilities,\" she says.",
      "\"When the issues around work experience changed in the last few months, we had to turn people down because we could not fund the support. It just seems really counter-intuitive when all the rhetoric is around getting disabled adults into work.\"",
      "When the government unveiled cuts and restrictions to disability benefits last month, the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, name-checked the Access to Work scheme as a programme that could help those who will lose out to get a job.",
      "As well as businesses being able to claim, disabled people themselves can apply for help under the scheme.",
      "They are also suffering delays and backlogs; in October, there were 55,000 outstanding applications, according to the DWP.",

      "She has various disabilities and conditions, including agonising pain in her feet that means she needs to use a wheelchair.",

      "\"They're saying that the benefits are being cut so we can push more people into work, but then also Access to Work is having all these problems.\"",
      "Steve Darling MP, the Lib Dem Work and Pensions spokesperson, says that while the principles behind Access to Work are excellent, \"individuals and businesses are often covering significant sums from their own savings while waiting for payments from Access to Work, which risks pushing people into debt, or businesses even closing down. This is unacceptable.\"",
      "Minister for Social Security and Disability, Sir Stephen Timms, said in February that Access to Work, established in 1994, \"was not in a good shape at the moment.\"",

    "summary": "Countries break ten-year deadlock to agree measures to reduce commercial shipping emissions.",
    "story": [
      "Countries have agreed a global deal to tackle shipping emissions, after nearly ten years of negotiations.",
      "The agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.",
      "The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London \u2013 but it eventually passed on Friday.",
      "Small island states and environmental groups were angry that a blanket tax was not  agreed to and called the deal \"unfit for purpose\".",
      "Shipping agrees net-zero goal but critics unmoved",
      "Clean energy's share of world's electricity reaches 40%, report says",
      "Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.",
      "But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.",
      "The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.",
      "It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.",
      "Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.",
      "The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.",
      "Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.",
      "There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships.",
      "The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.",
      "\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment.",
      "\"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said.",
      "In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water atoms to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.",
      "Figures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce.",
      "\"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, program manager for sustainable transport at the Port of Rotterdam.",
      "Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped.",
      "\"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5\u00b0C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.",
      "Their disappointment was shared by environmental groups.",
      "\"This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach\", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition.",
      "It is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.",
      "But China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal.",
      "Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said that the deal was a compromise.",

      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Fahnestock added it was unclear if the penalties were enough to close the cost gap between the fuel types.",
      "\"You may have incentivised shipowners to prepare a bit for the future fuels but whether the signal is strong enough to get the billions of dollars of investment into the production facilities for these fuels - I don't think these regulations will overcome that. I think more will need to be done,\" he said.",
      "Any money raised from the penalties will be put into a \"Net Zero\" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries.",
      "It is this \"redistribution\" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then \"reciprocal measures\" would be taken.",
      "Although the US move was at odds with its long-held position at the IMO, it was in keeping with President Trump's push back on climate action seen over the last few months - such as withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement.",
      "But industry and country delegates appeared unperturbed when speaking to the BBC on Wednesday and continued with negotiations.",
      "The US only flags 178 cargo ships that represent 0.57% of worldwide commercial shipping tonnage. So if it took the decision not to implement the new proposals it is unlikely to make a significant difference to the funds raised.",

But even accounting for the President's roll back, the US has still erected a massive protectionist tariff wall, not seen since the 1930s.",

      "There is now no difference between the EU, which clearly does have a massive trade deficit in goods and was preparing to retaliate, and the UK.",
      "There is also an anxious wait to find out what comes next. One of the questions is whether President Trump pushes ahead with tariffs on medicines, the UK's second biggest goods export.",
      "Plus there is potential logistical chaos on the cards from a little-noticed multi-million dollar port tax for every cargo vessel docking in the US that was \"made in China\". That is more than half of the global merchant fleet - and it is due next week.",

      "Tariffs at these sky-high rates are massively hitting business between two nations which together account for around 3% of the entire world's trade. The main motorway of the global economy is effectively shut.",
      "The visible tangible consequences of all this will become very real very quickly: Chinese factories will close, workers will stroll from plant to plant looking for work.",

      "Meanwhile the US will see consumer prices surge. President Trump might try to order these US companies not to raise prices, but the effect will come through soon enough.",
      "In theory this will be in sharp contrast to what is happening in other countries in the world. Across the border in Canada, or in Europe, not only will there not be such China-sourced price rises, there could be price cuts.",
      "From trade wars to currency wars",
      "Trade wars on this scale do not stay confined to the flow of goods. They tend to become currency wars.",
      "What we saw this week was the trade turmoil spread to credit markets, especially the US bond market, having already hit share prices.",
      "Indeed there was an invaluable reveal for the game theory of this conflict. The Trump administration revealed a key pressure point with its concern about the \"yippy\" - as Trump called it - bond market.",
      "As trading in US government debt continued overnight in Asia, the effective interest rate on these bonds rose to 5%.",
      "This sort of borrowing should not move in such an erratic fashion.",
      "The last time this happened was in the \"Dash for Cash\", the key moment of financial fragility at the very beginning of the pandemic. The world was focussed on life or death in March 2020, but this potential further crisis was alleviated only by emergency action.",
      "Effectively, the President's row back was a form of emergency policy change.",
      "Was the Chinese government behind this rash of US government bond sales in Asia? Probably not. However, what happened on Wednesday highlighted a vulnerability for Trump.",
      "China is the second biggest holder of US government debt in the world and if it chose to, dumping all that debt would be catastrophic for America. But doing so would be a form of mutually assured economic destruction - the losses for China would be huge.",
      "More importantly, what the bond markets were telling Trump is that they are deeply sceptical about his tariff policy.",
      "The US does have the Federal Reserve, which does have some power to tranquillise bond markets. But right now it does not look like its chairman Jerome Powell will ride to the rescue.",
      "The bond market scepticism echoes the sentiment of the ascendant Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. He is now pushing for Trump to reach trade deals with their allies because the US needs them to take on China.",
      "Given the US was previously calling these same close allies cheaters, looters and pillagers, there is no way this was the strategy all along.",
      "This does matter. The US needs the EU, UK, the rest of the G7 on side in terms of China. China probably needs those countries just to stay neutral, and carry on soaking up its exports.",
      "The rest of the world has seen Trump's team struggle to explain tariffing penguin islands or poor African economies and the President himself recirculating the suggestion he was crashing stock markets on purpose. And they've witnessed the fact that the tariff rates were changed after they came into effect and also the absurd nature of the equation used to calculate them.",
      "It's in this context that Trump's handling of the situation has handed leverage back to the rest of the world, because neither friend nor foe will know quite what they are negotiating  with this America.",

    "story": [
      "The world's most popular gadgets - phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches - could be about to get a lot more expensive in the US.",
      "Many of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy.",
      "The effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
      "And if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops.",
      "Ben Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched.",
      "\"It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,\" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US.",
      "Though others say they believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK.",
      "And there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device.",
      "While a phone contract may typically last two years, Mr Wood said some firms already offer four year deals, and he believed \"we might see five-year contracts\" in 2025.",
      "\"One could argue it is almost like having a mortgage for your smartphone,\" he said.",
      "Where are iPhones made?",
      "The US is a major market for iPhones and Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research.",
      "It says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India.",
      "Along with fellow smartphone giants such as Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China in recent years.",

      "As tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days.",
      "Reuters reported on Thursday that Apple chartered cargo flights to ship more than 600 tons of iPhones from India to the US.",
      "Amid Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs, including those levied on India, the country may be set to benefit from an iPhone manufacturing boost.",
      "The BBC has approached Apple for comment on the impact of tariffs on their operations and prices, but has not had any response yet.",
      "How exposed is Apple to tariffs?",
      "Trump and his advisors have said the aim of its tariffs are to encourage more US manufacturing.",
      "However, the tech industry relies on a global network of suppliers for product components and assembly.",
      "This, and finding skilled workers to match the fast pace and low cost of production in Asia, means relocating supply chains is no simple feat.",

      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Will iPhone prices go up?",
      "Apple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices.",
      "Some analysts believe Apple is in a more fortunate position than others, having reaped more money from its products than it has spent on making them.",

      "But he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash.",
      "\"The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors.\"",
      "Some estimates suggest iPhone prices in the US could as much as triple if costs were passed to consumers.",
      "Following Trump's tariff increase on China to 125%, the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage would have surged from $1,199 to $1,999, according to estimates by investment banking firm UBS.",
      "They estimate a less significant increase on the iPhone 16 Pro 128GB storage - which is made in India - by five percent from $999 to $1046.",
      "While some analysts such as Dan Ives have suggested that the cost of a \"Made in USA\" iPhone could soar to as much as $3500.",
      "What can consumers do about it?",
      "There's still plenty of uncertainty about what happens next, and how companies like Apple will respond to tariffs remains to be seen.",
      "This hasn't stopped some US customers reportedly rushing to Apple stores to buy its smartphones.",
      "The BBC spoke to shoppers outside an Apple Store in New York who had bought products in fear of a potential price hike.",
      "Anthony Cacioppo, a 53-year-old DJ and security technician, purchased the new iPhone.",

      "But if it looks like costs incurred by tariffs will result in higher price tags, some may look to rival handsets or second-hand devices.",
      "CCS Insight estimates that 5.5m second-hand smartphones will be sold in the UK in 2025, representing 29.7% of the total market.",
      "The iPhone remains one of the most expensive smartphones on the market - and brands such as Google and Samsung offer phones with similar features at a lower cost.",
      "The other option, and perhaps the most cost-effective, could be for people to skip upgrades to newer iPhone models and look to slightly older, cheaper versions.",

      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds met with the CEOs of Jingye and British Steel on Wednesday.",
      "In a joint statement, they said ''Both sides welcomed continued cooperation in talks to find a way forward. The UK government thanked Jingye for their respect for the workforce during this process, and work continues at pace to find a resolution.\"",
      "Ministers are thought to prefer a commercial solution to secure the long-term future of the plant.",
      "But due to the urgent need to acquire new raw materials, talks about the longer-term future of steelmaking in Scunthorpe are now largely on hold.",
      "The immediate issue is who will pay for shipments of iron pellets and coke.",
      "One option being discussed is whether the government can directly buy the materials using taxpayers' money.",

      "Government representatives are said to be frustrated with Jingye, at what they see as an effective shutting down of British Steel, with the consultation period still ongoing.",
      "One source involved in the negotiations, who two weeks ago was optimistic about the future relationship between Jingye and the UK government, said they could no longer foresee long-term Chinese involvement in British steelmaking.",

      "But the abrupt climbdown still caught many off-guard.",
      "Almost at the same time as Trump posted his move on social media, Goldman Sachs issued a report predicting a recession in the US economy triggered by the steep duties.",

      "The US already appears set on a collision course with China -  its third biggest supplier of imports last year.",
      "Tensions intensified after the White House confirmed it was going ahead with its plan to increase the tax rates on products coming from China to 104%.",
      "Beijing hit back early Wednesday, saying it would also tax goods imported from the US at a new rate of 84%.",
      "In a statement before the new tariff rate was unveiled, a spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington called Trump's moves \"bullying\" and warned that \"intimidation, threat and blackmail are not the right way to engage with China\".",
      "The rapid change has shaken US businesses with decades of ties to China, which now find themselves paralysed and unsure how this escalating trade fight might end.",
      "\"You would laugh if you weren't crying,\" said US businessman Jay Foreman, whose toy company Basic Fun! is known for classics such as Tonka Trucks and Care Bears, the vast majority of which are made in China.",
      "He put out notice to his suppliers to halt any shipments to the US earlier this week, as the US announced it would hit goods from China with duties starting at 104%.",
      "\"We just have to hold our shipments until this thing gets sorted out,\" he said. \"And if it doesn't get sorted out, them I'm going to sell down the inventory that I have in my warehouse and pray.\"",
      "Speaking to Congress on Tuesday, Jamieson Greer, who leads the office of the US Trade Representative, declined to set a timeline for how quickly talks might progress.",
      "\"The president is fixed in his purpose. This trade deficit and offshoring and the loss of jobs has persisted for too long,\" he said, while acknowledging the measures might lead to a \"challenging\" economic adjustment.",
      "\"It is a moment of drastic, overdue change, but I am confident the American people will rise to the occasion as they have done before,\" he said.",
      "US share prices have been on a downward slide for days. The S&P 500  is now trading at its lowest level in more than a year, after seeing roughly 12% of its value wiped out since the announcement last week.",
      "Stock markets from Japan to Germany have also been shaken, as investors assess the wider repercussions of the actions.  In the UK, the FTSE 100 has dropped about 10%.",
      "\"What I'm really seeing is trepidation, uncertainty, a lot of questions, a lot of people wanting us to predict what will happen next,\" said Amy Magnus, director of compliance and customs affairs for Deringer, a Vermont-based firm that is one of America's top five customs brokers. \"But I have entered into a world that I cannot predict.\"",
      "Erin Williamson, vice-president of US customs brokerage at GEODIS, a global supply chain operator, said on Tuesday afternoon that the uncertainty had prompted some of her firm's clients to simply put shipments on pause.",
      "\"One of the top ways that you can confirm that you're not putting your business at risk is really holding off until maybe the dust settles,\" she said.",
      "The uncertainty is raising the risks to the economy, said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics of the Budget Lab at Yale, which is not predicting a recession in the US, but still expects tariffs announced so far this year will cost the US 600,000 jobs and lead to a roughly $3,800 hit to purchasing power for the average household.",
      "\"A lot of the market turmoil we've seen is not about the substance of the economic damage of tariffs on their own. A lot of it is about the uncertainty,\" he said.",
      "\"Businesses and consumers don't know what the tariff rate is going to be an hour from now... How can you invest or make plans for the future in that environment?\"",
      "Mr Tedeschi said he saw no clear end to the trade war in sight.",
      "\"Even if the administration wanted to step back, how does it save face in a way that is mutually acceptable to all the relevant players?\" he said. \"That's becoming harder by the day.\"",

      "Christine Bailey, 68, from Bolton, pictured above said like many people she had seen a lot about tariffs in the news but was not sure what it was all about.",
      "Tariffs are taxes on stuff that is imported from other countries.",
      "Donald Trump has said he wants US citizens to buy more American-made products and he's hoping to do that by making the price of things brought in from other countries more expensive.",
      "While we don't know what impact this will have, there are some worries it could affect jobs here, especially for people working in car manufacturing and machinery.",

    "summary": "US exports have driven the economic success of countries like Vietnam and Cambodia.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs targeting most of the world are now in effect \u2013 and outside China, no other region has been hit as hard as South East Asia.",
      "Near the top of the list are Vietnam and Cambodia which have been hit by some of the highest tariffs: 46% and 49%.  Further down are Thailand (36%), Indonesia (32%) and Malaysia (24%). The Philippines gets a tariff of 17%, and Singapore of 10%.",
      "This is a huge blow for a region highly dependent on exports. Its widely admired economic development over the past three decades has largely been driven by its success in selling its products to the rest of the world, in particular to the US.",
      "Exports to the US contribute around 30% of Vietnam's GDP, and 25% of Cambodia's.",
      "That growth story is now imperilled by the punitive measures being imposed in Washington.",
      "The longer-term impact of these tariffs, assuming they stay in place, will vary, but will certainly pose big challenges to the governments of Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia in particular.",
      "As Trump hikes tariffs again, nervous businesses weigh what comes next",
      "China is not backing down from Trump's tariff war. What next?",
      "Vietnam's \"bamboo diplomacy\", where it attempts to be friends with everyone and balance ties with both China and the US, will now be tested.",
      "Under the leadership of the new Communist Party Secretary-General To Lam, Vietnam has embarked on an ambitious plan to build an upper-income, knowledge-and-tech-based economy by the year 2045. It has been aiming for annual growth rates in excess of 8%.",
      "Exporting more to the US, already its biggest market, was central to that plan.",
      "It was also the main reason why Vietnam agreed to elevate their relationship to that of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2023.",
      "The Communist Party, which tolerates little dissent and has no formal political opposition, depends on its economic pledges for its legitimacy. Already viewed by many economists as too ambitious, these will now be even harder to meet.",
      "Thailand depends on US exports less than Vietnam \u2013 under 10% of GDP \u2013 but the Thai economy is in much worse shape, having underperformed for the past decade. The Thai government is trying to find ways to lift economic growth, most recently attempting but failing to legalise gambling, and these tariffs are another economic blow it cannot afford.",
      "For Cambodia, the tariffs pose perhaps the greatest political threat in the region.",
      "The government of Hun Manet has proved just as authoritarian as that of his father Hun Sen, whom he succeeded two years ago, but it is vulnerable.",
      "Keeping the Hun family's hold on power has required offering rival clans in Cambodia economic privileges like monopolies or land concessions, but this has helped create a glut of property developments, which are no longer selling, and a mass of grievances over land expropriations.",
      "The garment sector, which employs 750,000 people, has been a crucial social safety valve, giving steady incomes to Cambodia's poorest. Thousands of those jobs are now likely to be lost as a result of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "Unlike China, which has hit back with its own levies, the official message from governments in South East Asia is don't panic, don't retaliate, but negotiate.",
      "Vietnam has dispatched deputy prime minister Ho Duc Phoc to Washington to plead his country's case, and has offered to eliminate all tariffs on US imports. Thailand plans to send its finance minister to make a similar appeal, and has offered to reduce its tariffs and buy more American products, like food and aircraft.",
      "Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is also heading to Washington, though with  exports to the US making up only 11% of Malaysia's total, his country is less affected than some of its neighbours.",
      "However, the Trump administration appears to be in no mood to compromise.",
      "Peter Navarro, President Trump's senior counsellor on trade and manufacturing and one of the main thinkers behind the new policy, said in interviews on Monday that Vietnam's offer of zero tariffs was meaningless, because it would not address the deficit in trade where Vietnam sells $15 worth of goods to the US for every $1 it buys.",
      "He accused Vietnam of keeping multiple non-tariff barriers to US imports, and said that one-third of all Vietnamese exports to the US were actually Chinese products, trans-shipped through Vietnam.",
      "The proportion of Vietnamese exports which are being made or trans-shipped there to avoid US tariffs on China is difficult to assess, but detailed trade studies put it at between 7% and 16%, not one-third.",
      "Like Vietnam, the government of Cambodia has appealed to the US to postpone the tariffs while it attempts to negotiate.",
      "The local American Chamber of Commerce has called for the 49% tariffs to be dropped, making the point that the Cambodian garment industry, the country's biggest employer, will be badly affected, but that no tariff level, however high, will see clothing and footwear manufacturing return to the US.",
      "Perhaps the most perverse tariff rate is the 44% applied to Myanmar, a country mired in a civil war, which has no capacity to buy more US goods.",
      "US exports make up only a small proportion of Myanmar's GDP, less than 1%.",
      "But as in Cambodia, that sector, mainly garments, is one of the few that provides a steady income to poor families in Myanmar's cities.",
      "In a supreme irony,  Trump has until now been a popular figure in this region.",
      "He has been widely admired in Vietnam for his tough, transactional approach to foreign policy, and Cambodia's former strongman Hun Sen, still the main power behind the scenes, has long sought a close personal relationship with the US president, proudly posting selfies with him at their first meeting in 2017.",
      "Only last month Cambodia was praising  Trump for shutting down the US media networks Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, which often carried the views of Cambodian dissidents.",

    "story": [
      "It sounds like something from a science fiction movie, but Stephen Eisele is confident that one day his company will open a data centre on the Moon.",
      "\"The way we see it is that by putting the data centre in space, you're really offering unparalleled security,\" says the president of Lonestar Data Holdings.",
      "Last month, the Florida-based firm claimed to have successfully tested a tiny data centre the size of a hardback book that hitched a ride to the Moon on the Athena Lunar Lander from US space exploration firm Intuitive Machines. This, in turn, had been launched by a rocket from Elon Musk's SpaceX.",
      "Data centres are the vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Lonestar says that putting them on the Moon will offer customers secure, reliable data processing, while taking advantage of unlimited solar energy to power them.",
      "The environmental campaigners fighting against data centres",
      "Data centre power use 'to surge six-fold in 10 years'",
      "Concern UK's AI ambitions could lead to water shortages",
      "And while space-based data centres may sound far-fetched, it's an idea that's really starting to take off.",
      "Part of the reason is rocketing demand and the difficulty of finding suitable sites on Earth.",
      "The ever-expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) computing has seen a massive increase in the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed around the world.",
      "As a result, the need for data centres has shot up too, with annual demand set to rise between 19% and 22% by 2030, according to global management consultants McKinsey.",
      "New facilities are springing up all the time - but it's getting hard to find places to put them. Data centres are large and sprawling, and use enormous amounts of power and water for cooling.",
      "And increasingly local people don't want them built nearby.",
      "Putting data centres in space \u2013 either in orbit around Earth, or on the Moon - the theory goes, means they can't do quite so much harm. There's more-or-less unlimited energy available from the sun, for example, and no neighbours to complain about the environmental impacts.",
      "Not only that, space-based data centres could specialise in services for spacecraft and other space facilities, with space-to-space data transfers quicker than from the ground.",
      "Last summer, a European Commission-funded feasibility study into orbiting data centres published its results.",
      "The Ascend report by carried out by Thales Alenia Space - a joint venture between French and Italian aerospace groups Thales and Leonardo - published its results.",
      "It determined that deploying data centres in space \"could transform the European digital landscape\", and be \"more eco-friendly\".",
      "Thales Alenia Space envisages building a constellation of 13 satellites measuring  a combined 200m-by-80m, and with a total data processing power of around 10 megawatts (MW). That's equivalent to a current medium-sized, ground-based data centre, with some 5,000 servers.",
      "Based on technologies that already exist or are under development, the satellites would be assembled in orbit.",
      "Damien Dumestier, Ascend project architect at Thales Alenia Space, says that for space-based data centres to be more environmentally friendly than existing ground-based ones it will be necessary to make the rocket launchers 10 times less emissive over their lifecycles. He says this looks possible.",
      "\"But in order to cover the new technology's developments and the production capacity ramp-up to benefit from scale, we have to consider larger system capacity, around 200MW, meaning 200 of our envisaged large space infrastructures and 200 launches,\" he says.",
      "\"The main question is when an adapted launcher will be ready. Depending on the investment and decisions to be taken, this could be done for 2030 or 2035, meaning commercial viability before 2037.\"",
      "However, despite this optimism from firms aiming to develop the technology, Dr Domenico Vicinanza, associate professor of intelligent systems and data science at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, says there are numerous big hurdles before space-based data centres can be a viable proposition.",
      "\"Even with the contribution and advancements of companies like SpaceX, launching hardware into orbit remains extremely expensive,\" he says. \"Each kilogram sent into space costs thousands of dollars.",
      "\"Space-based data centres would require not only the data equipment but also the infrastructure to protect, power, and cool them. All of which add up in weight and complexity.\"",
      "Cooling the equipment will be a particular problem,  because even though space is cold, conventional cooling systems don't work well without gravity.",
      "Meanwhile, space weather can damage electronics, while the ever-increasing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk.",
      "Dr Vicinanza adds: \"And fixing problems in orbit is far from straightforward. Even with robotics and automation, there are limits to what can be repaired remotely.",
      "\"A big hardware failure might necessitate a costly human mission, potentially making downtime stretch for weeks or months.\"",
      "Yet firms like Lonestar are supremely confident, and say that they are responding to demand. \"We wouldn't be doing this if the customers weren't asking us to,\" says Mr Scott.",
      "Its next target is to put a small data centre in orbit around the moon in 2027. Meanwhile, other companies are hoping to get there a bit faster, such as Washington state-based Starcloud, which is due to launch a satellite-based data centre next month, and start commercial operations in mid-2026.",
      "Lonestar's Mr Eidele says that space-based facilities offer more security for governments and businesses because their data does not need to be routed through terrestrial networks. Instead the information can be beamed directly from space to a dedicated ground station.",
      "\"It's like having the vaults at the back of the bank,\" he says. \"You don't have to open it every day, but it's there to provide an extra measure of security, and the distance from the Earth to the moon offers that - it's that much harder to hack, that much harder to access.\"",
      "The distance to the Moon means that data takes about a second and a half to reach the ground - this doesn't matter for some applications, like longer-term data storage and backups.",
      "And meanwhile, says Lonestar founder and chief executive Chris Stott, space-based data centres can help organisations meet regulations about data sovereignty - the need to hold peoples' data in the country of origin.",
      "\"Under space law, that box of electronics is literally under the law of the licensing or launching state - it is an actual embassy in space,\" he says.",

    "story": [
      "It's likely that you have not heard of Taiwan's Hong Fu Industrial Group, but look down on a busy street and you may well see its products.",
      "Hong Fu is the world's second-biggest maker of trainers (sneakers) supplying shoes to Nike, Converse, Adidas, Puma and many others. It makes around 200 million pairs of sports shoes a year.",
      "So when it made a big investment in India's market, the footwear industry took note.",
      "Hong Fu is currently building a giant plant in Panapakkam, in the state of Tamil Nadu in south eastern India. When fully operational, some time in the next three to five years, it will make 25 million pairs of shoes a year, employing as many as 25,000 workers.",
      "The project has Indian partners, including Aqeel Panaruna, the chairman of Florence Shoe Company: \"The international market is saturated and they [Hong Fu] were looking for a new market,\" he explains.",
      "\"There is a drastic increase in non-leather footwear in India. It has huge potential,\" Mr Panaruna added.",
      "The Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports.",
      "To spur the industry, last August the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced new quality rules for all shoes sold in India.",
      "Under those standards, for example, materials will have to pass tests of strength and flexibility.",
      "\"These BIS standards are really about cleaning up the market. We've had too many low-quality products flooding in, and consumers deserve better,\" says Sandeep Sharma a journalist and footwear industry expert.",
      "But many in India can't afford shoes from well-known brands.",
      "Serving them is a huge and intricate network of small shoe makers, known as the unorganised sector.",
      "Their affordable products are estimated to account for two-thirds of the total footwear market.",
      "Ashok (he withheld his full name) counts himself as part of that sector, with shoe making units all across the district of Agra in northern India. He estimates that 200,0000 pairs of shoes are made everyday by operations like his across Agra.",
      "\"Many consumers, especially in rural and lower-income urban areas, opt for cheaper local footwear instead of branded options,\" he says.",
      "\"Many organised brands struggle to expand their retail footprint in semi-urban and rural areas because we cater to them.\"",
      "So how will the new government standards affect makers like Ashok?",
      "\"It's complicated,\" says Mr Sharma.",
      "\"I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can't just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide.",
      "\"What I'm seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They're pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It's not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold.\"",
      "Making the situation more complicated is that the unorganised sector is well-known for making counterfeit shoes of big brands.",
      "While popular among Indian shoppers looking for a stylish bargain, other countries have long-complained about the losses caused.",
      "Meanwhile, a host of new Indian trainer-makers are springing up, to serve India's growing middle class.",
      "Sabhib Agrawal is trying to get those buyers interested in barefoot footwear - shoes which, their makers say, are healthy for the foot as they encourage natural, or barefoot, movement.",
      "Mr Agrawal says his company, Zen Barefoot, is unusual as much of the Indian footwear industry is not very innovative.",
      "\"There are very few people who are ready to take time and invest in new technologies here. Indian manufacturing is a very profit- first market, ROI [return on investment] driven.",
      "\"And in a lot of cases, even the government is not ready to enable these industries through grants or tax relief, which makes it quite difficult.\"",
      "Comet is one Indian firm looking to innovate.",

      "\"This level of control allows us to experiment with materials, introduce innovative silhouettes, and continuously refine comfort and fit based on real feedback,\" says founder Utkarsh Gupta.",
      "He says the Comet shoes are adapted to India's climate and roads.",
      "\"Most homegrown brands rely on off-the-shelf soles from the market, but when we started Comet, we realized that these were lacking in quality, durability, and grip,\" he says.",
      "Change is coming to the footwear sector he says. \"The shift to high value is now happening.\"",
      "\"Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,\" he adds.",
      "Back in Agra, Ashok hopes that the unorganised sector is not neglected amid the growth of India's footwear industry.",
      "\"The government should give us accreditation and certificates so our factories don't close down. Once we too are included in the organised sector no one can beat India in the shoe manufacturing industry.\"",
      "But Mr Sharma says change is inevitable.",

    "summary": "What impact will the introduction of hefty tariffs on countries in Asia have on Nike's iconic US trainer?",
    "story": [
      "The Nike Air Jordan 1 is, in some ways, the iconic US trainer. It's a popular line by a large American brand, created four decades ago for homegrown basketball legend Michael Jordan.",
      "But although Nike sells most of its products in the US, almost all of its trainers are made in Asia \u2013 a region targeted by President Donald Trump's tariffs salvo against foreign countries he accuses of \"ripping off\" Americans.",
      "Nike's shares fell 14% the day after the tariffs announcement, on fears over the impact they could have on the company's supply chain.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "So what will all this mean for the price of Nike's trainer?",
      "It depends on how much of the cost increase Nike decides to pass on to customers, if any, and how long they think the tariffs will actually be in place for.",
      "'Competitive industry'",
      "Goods from Vietnam, Indonesia and China face some of the heaviest US import taxes - between 32% to 54%.",
      "Hopes remain that Trump might be willing to negotiate those rates lower. On Friday, he said he had had a \"very productive\" call with the leader of Vietnam, helping Nike shares to recover some ground after their steep Thursday falls.",
      "But most analysts think the firm's prices will have to go up.",
      "Swiss bank UBS estimates that there will be a 10% to 12% increase in the prices of goods that come from Vietnam - where Nike produces half of its shoes.",
      "Meanwhile, Indonesia and China account for almost all of the balance of its trainer production.",
      "\"Our view is that, given how extensive the list of tariffs is, the industry will realise there are few ways to mitigate the impact in the medium term other than by raising prices,\" UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a note.",
      "David Swartz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, agrees that price rises are likely but says any large price increase would reduce demand.",
      "\"This is a very competitive industry. My guess is that it would be difficult for Nike to raise prices by much more than 10-15%. I don't think it could offset most of the tariff,\" he says.",
      "Many other western brands such as H&M, Adidas, Gap and Lululemon will be facing the same predicament.",
      "Nike is already facing a tight bottom line.",
      "It had around $51bn (\u00a339.6bn) in sales in its most recent fiscal year. The cost of making products, including shipping, third-party profits and warehouse fees, consumed only about 55% of revenue, giving it a healthy gross profit margin of more than 40%.",
      "But that profit gets whittled away once you add in the cost of other business operations. A third of its revenue, for example, is consumed by selling and administrative expense.",
      "By the time you factor in interest and taxes, Nike's profit margin has shrunk to about 11%.",
      "That is across all its products, as they don't break down costs separately for its different items.",
      "Rahul Cee, who set up the trainer review website Sole Review, says there are other ways Nike could keep retail prices low.",
      "Mr Cee, who trained as a footwear designer and worked for Nike and Vans in India, says one way could be to downgrade the level of tech in the trainer.",
      "\"So instead of using high-performance midsole foams and construction, stick to injection moulded EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate),\" he says.",
      "Another option would be instead of bringing out a new design every one to two years, to refresh the design cycle every three to four years.",
      "Things could change fast",
      "Simeon Siegel, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, says most companies were looking at Wednesday's announcement as \"still far from the final conclusion\".",
      "\"I don't think that many people believe that those numbers are etched in stone just yet,\" he says.",
      "Theoretically, Nike is such a big brand that it should be able to put up prices without it hitting their sales, he says, but adds: \"Do they have it right now is the question and do they have it across their product offering is another?\"",
      "Even before the announcement, Nike was facing a slump in sales that had curbed its ability to command full price for its shoes.",
      "Finance chief Matthew Friend has also cited tariffs as an example of developments that were affecting consumer confidence.",
      "And Nike relies heavily on US sales, with the market contributing to roughly $21.5bn of its sales - almost everything it sells in its largest market of North America.",
      "Sentiment in the US is a \"significant concern\" for Nike as it directly affects demand for its footwear, says Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.",

      "Nintendo pulls Switch 2 pre-orders in US over Trump tariffs",

      "He adds: \"How US trading partners react against the reciprocal tariff policy will also have a major impact.\"",
      "China has already hit back with a 34% tariff of its own.",
      "Part of the rationale behind Trump's tariff policy is because he wants more companies to manufacture their goods in the US.",
      "However, Prof Lu does not see Nike, or other companies, significantly reshaping its supply chain any time soon \"due to the complexity involved in footwear manufacturing\".",

      "The idea is to encourage people to spend less and reduce demand.",
      "Once inflation is at or near the target, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them.",
      "What has happened to UK interest rates and will they go down further?",
      "It is difficult to predict exactly what will happen to interest rates. The Bank has to consider whether inflation remains at or below its target, and how the UK economy is doing more generally.",
      "It also pays close attention to the performance of the global economy, which has been thrown into chaos by US tariffs.",
      "The main inflation measure, CPI, was 2.8% in the 12 months to February 2025, down slightly from the previous month.",
      "Although that is far below the peak of 11.1% reached in October 2022, it remains above the 2% target.",
      "After many months of keeping interest rates at a 16-year high of 5.25%, the Bank of England cut them to 5% in August 2024, and again to 4.75% in November. Rates fell again to 4.5% in February, where they stayed in March.",
      "When the Bank cut rates in February, it also cut its growth forecast for the UK economy in 2025.",
      "It said it expected the UK to only narrowly avoid falling into recession - where the economy shrinks for two three-month periods in a row - and predicted that inflation would rise towards 4% later in 2025.",
      "Announcing the decision to hold rates in March, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned about global economic uncertainty but said that he still believed interest rates were on a \"gradually declining path\".",
      "The Bank was concerned about the possible impacts of increases to the amount of National Insurance paid by employers and the minimum wage, both of which took effect at the start of April.",
      "There are growing fears that the US tariffs could spark a full-blown international trade war, push up prices and fuel inflation around the world - including in the UK.",
      "If that happens and the economy suffers, the Bank may may feel it has to cut rates further than it had planned to do at the start of the year.",
      "Most economists were already expecting a rate cut in May, and now many expect four this year, which would take rates down to 3.5% or below.",

    "published": "Sat, 05 Apr 2025 23:59:04 GMT",
    "summary": "What made the US step back from the system that it profited handsomely from for decades?",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has built another wall, and he thinks everyone else is going to pay for it. But his decision to impose sweeping tariffs of at least 10% on almost every product that enters the US is essentially a wall designed to keep work and jobs within it, rather than immigrants out.",
      "The height of this wall needs to be put in historical context. It takes the US back a century in terms of protectionism. It catapults the US way above the G7 and G20 nations into levels of customs revenue, associated with Senegal, Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan.",
      "What occurred this week was not just the US starting a global trade war, or sparking a rout in stock markets. It was the world's hyper power firmly turning its back on the globalisation process it had championed, and from which it handsomely profited in recent decades.",
      "And in so doing, using the equation that underpinned his grand tariff reveal on the Rose Garden's lawns, the White House also turned its back on some fundamentals of both conventional economics and diplomacy.",
      "The great free trade debate",
      "Trump talked a lot about 1913 in his announcement. This was a turning point when the US both created federal income tax and significantly lowered its tariffs.",
      "Before this point, from its inception, the US government was funded mainly by tariffs, and was unapologetically protectionist, based on the strategy of its first Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton.",
      "The basic lesson the White House has taken from this is that high tariffs made America, made it \"great\" the first time, and also meant that there was no need for a federal income tax.",
      "On this side of the Atlantic, underpinning globalisation and free trade are the theories of 19th-Century British economist David Ricardo. In particular, the 1817 Theory of Comparative Advantage.",
      "There are equations, but the basics are pretty easy to understand: Individual countries are good at making different things, based on their own natural resources and the ingenuity of their populations.",
      "Broadly speaking, the whole world, and the countries within it, are better off, if everyone specialises in what they are best at, and then trades freely.",
      "Here in Britain this remains a cornerstone of the junction between politics and economics. Most of the world still believes in comparative advantage. It is the intellectual core of globalisation.",
      "But the US was never a full convert at the time. The underlying reluctance of the US never disappeared. And this week's manifestation of that was the imaginative equation created by the US Trade Representative to generate the numbers on Trump's big board.",
      "The rationale behind 'reciprocal' tariffs",
      "It is worth unpacking the rationale for these so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs. The numbers bear little resemblance to the published tariff rates in those countries.",
      "The White House said adjustments had been made to account for red tape and currency manipulation. A closer look at the, at-first, complicated looking equation revealed it was simply a measure of the size of that country's goods trade surplus with the US. They took the size of the trade deficit and divided it by the imports.",
      "In the hour before the press conference a senior White House official explained it quite openly. \"These tariffs are customised to each country, calculated by the Council of Economic Advisers\u2026 The model they use is based on the concept the trade deficit that we have is the sum of all the unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating.\"",
      "This is really important. According to the White House, the act of selling more goods to the US than the US sells to you, is by definition \"cheating\" and is deserving of a tariff that is calculated to correct that imbalance.",
      "This is why the surreal stories about the US tariffing rarely visited islands only inhabited by penguins matter. It reveals the actual method.",
      "The long-term aim, and the target of the policy, is to get the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit and the largest country deficits within that down to zero. The equation was simplistically designed to target those countries with surpluses, not those with recognisable quantifiable trade barriers. It targeted poor countries, emerging economies and tiny irrelevant islets based on that data.",
      "While these two different factors overlap, they are not the same thing.",
      "There are many reasons why some countries have surpluses, and some have deficits. There is no inherent reason why these numbers should be zero. Different countries are better at making different products, and have different natural and human resources. This is the very basis of trade.",
      "The US appears no longer to believe in this. Indeed if the same argument was applied solely to trade in services, the US has a $280bn (\u00a3216bn) surplus in areas such as financial services and social media tech.",
      "Yet services trade was excluded from all the White House calculations.",
      "'China shock' and the ripple effect",
      "There is something bigger here. As the US Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that \"rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things\".",
      "That has not panned out, especially in the case of China, so the US is moving decisively away from this world.",
      "For the US, it is not David Ricardo who matters, it is David Autor, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist and the coiner of the term \"China shock\".",
      "In 2001, as the world was distracted by the aftermath of 9/11, China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), having relatively free access to US markets, and so transforming the global economy.",
      "Living standards, growth, profits and stock markets boomed in the US as China's workforce migrated from the rural fields to the coastal factories to produce exports more cheaply for US consumers. It was a classic example of the functioning of \"comparative advantage\". China generated trillions of dollars, much of which was reinvested in the US, in the form of its government bonds, helping keep interest rates down.",
      "Everyone was a winner. Well, not quite. Essentially US consumers en masse got richer with cheaper goods, but the quid pro quo was a profound loss of manufacturing to East Asia.",
      "Autor's calculation was that by 2011, this \"China shock\" saw the loss of one million US manufacturing jobs, and 2.4 million jobs overall. These hits were geographically concentrated in the Rust Belt and the south.",
      "The trade shock impact on lost jobs and wages was remarkably persistent.",
      "Autor further updated his analysis last year and found that while the Trump administration's first term dabble with tariff protection had little net economic impact, it did loosen Democrat support in affected areas, and boosted support for Trump in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Marine Le Pen's ban outraged France's far right - and they may well take revenge",
      "The influencers who want the world to have more babies - and say the White House is on their side",
      "Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling",
      "Fast forward to this week, and the array of union car workers and oil and gas workers celebrating the tariffs in the White House.",
      "So the promise is that these jobs will return, not just to the Rust Belt, but across the US. This is indeed likely to some degree. The president's clear message to foreign companies is to avoid the tariffs by moving your factories. The carrots offered by Biden followed by the stick from Trump could well lead to material progress on this.",
      "But the president's characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having \"raped and pillaged\" the US obviously doesn't reflect the overall picture, even if it has not worked for specific regions, sectors or demographics.",
      "The US service sector thrived, dominating the world from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. US consumer brands used hyper-efficient supply chains stretching into China and East Asia to make incredible profits selling their aspirational American products everywhere.",
      "The US economy did very well indeed. The problem, simply, was that it was not evenly distributed among sectors. And what the US lacked was levels of redistribution and adaptation to spread that wealth across the country. This reflects America's political choices.",
      "The first social media trade war",
      "Now, as the US chooses to reshore its manufacturing with a sudden jolt of protectionism, other countries also have choices as to whether to support the flows of capital and trade that have made the US rich.",
      "The world's consumers have choices.",
      "It is little wonder major blue chip American companies, which have built cash machines on hyper-efficient East Asian supply chains producing cheaply and then selling to the whole world based on their attractive aspirational brands, have a big problem.",
      "Their share prices are particularly badly affected because the president has both decimated their supply chain strategies, and also risks greatly impairing their brand image amongst global consumers.",
      "Ultimately, this is the first social media trade war. The experience of Tesla's sale slump and Canada's backlash against US goods may prove contagious. That would be as powerful as any counter-tariff.",
      "These countries that bet on being the workshops for US consumers have choices over trade too. New alliances will form and intensify that seek to cut out an erratic US.",
      "The president's sensitivity to this was apparent when he threatened to increase tariffs if the EU and Canada joined forces over retaliation. This would be the nightmare scenario.",
      "In the game theory of trade wars, credibility does matter. The US has unrivalled military and technological might, which helps. But to transform the global trading system using an arbitrary formula, that throws up transparent absurdities, even without the penguins, is likely to encourage the other side to resist.",
      "This is especially the case when the rest of the world thinks that the loaded gun that the president is holding is being aimed at his own foot. The stock market fell most in the US. Inflation will go up most in the US. It is Wall Street now calculating a more-than-evens chance of a recession in the US.",
      "Perhaps there is some substance to the theory that the real objective here is to weaken the dollar and lower US borrowing costs.",
      "For now, the US is checking out of the global trade system it created. It can continue without it. But the transition is going to be very messy indeed.",

    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer watched in his flat. Chancellor Rachel Reeves saw it in her study. The Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, accompanied by staff and pizza, took in President Donald Trump's big tariffs reveal on Wednesday from his office in Old Admiralty Arch, from where the British Navy was directed to protect and control trade on the high seas in days gone by.",
      "Ministers can only dream of having that kind of power now, as the UK watches on in growing horror at the bust-up between the US and China.",
      "\"Sometimes people don't realise they are living through a moment of history,\" a cabinet minister notes, as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping square up to each other, and stock markets plunge. Trump has slapped a 10% tariff on all nations \u2013 including the UK \u2013 for imports into the US, and much higher rates on some countries, including China, which has responded with fresh tariffs of its own.",
      "So what's happening in Whitehall right now to try to limit the harm to the UK, perhaps by making a deal with the US, and make the most of any opportunities?",
      "Tariffs have shaken the markets - how worried should we be?",
      "China and US are at each other's throats on tariffs, and neither is backing down",
      "The PM is spending another dramatic weekend working the phones from the peace of his country pad, Chequers. So far, the other calls that could really matter, from US negotiators, have not yet resumed.",
      "Trump dangled a possible trade deal that might exempt the UK from some of the costs from tariffs during the pair's chummy White House press conference in February. There have been significant negotiations since then by a team of around 20, led out of No 10 by Michael Ellam, the Treasury and banking veteran, and the PM's business adviser Varun Chandra alongside the business secretary.",
      "Those talks included ideas about the UK watering down rules on electric vehicles, possible changes to a tax on tech companies (\"space to talk about it\", one minister says) and changes to online safety rules (\"not happening\", says a government source).",
      "But as the US government prepared for its announcements on Wednesday, talks about a deal ground to a halt. Now, after the announcement, the \"ball is in their court\", said one government source involved, waiting to hear if, in the chaos of Trump's new tariff world, the White House can find time and energy to push a deal with the UK.",
      "\"We're expecting to hear from them any moment,\" one of those involved hopes. The risk, in the visible turmoil, is that any economic agreement could become a case of: don't call us, we'll call you. We'll be asking Darren Jones, the Treasury Minister, about it when he join us in the studio tomorrow.",
      "If a deal is done, however, do not expect an all-singing all-dancing arrangement. Instead, \"it would be a basic agreement on principles \u2013 rather than a super detailed trade agreement\", says a government source, contrasting these \"quick and dirty\" moves to long-running negotiations with India (\"we're on our 15th chapter with them!\").",
      "Uncertainty around the talks, and the limited nature of what a deal could achieve in any case, means No 10 is \"not sitting here waiting for it \u2013 it's not the basket where all our eggs are\".",
      "For weeks the government told us they were preparing for all kinds of scenarios. A secret cabinet committee was considering how the UK might react if Trump's tariffs materialised.",
      "But now they are here, the actual response is\u2026 not to respond, and to spend four weeks asking businesses if they would like the government to respond later on. That is not just Whitehall dither: at this stage, there seems to be almost zero appetite among ministers to join in with the rounds of tariffs between the US, China, and perhaps the EU in coming days.",
      "One Whitehall figure working with business says \"there has not been a single voice in business, big or small, saying this is the wrong strategy\".",
      "Ministers' approach to get businesses on board, like when Sir Keir invited dozens of big wigs to No 10 the morning after Trump's tariff announcement, is in part because of the anger when the government increased National Insurance contributions. \"The really calm reaction,\" one source says, \"is because we got people into the headspace where tariffs were going to happen \u2013 one of the businesses said they were being borderline stalked, we've been trying to persuade business to trust the process.\"",
      "The government is in no rush, and has no enthusiasm to introduce its own new tariffs, and for now at least, demands on them to do so are muted. According to a minister: \"Most people have considerable numbers of jobs in their constituencies on the line \u2013 even in cabinet there might have been some question marks but there weren't this week.\"",
      "And they joke that the Lib Dems, who are calling for tariffs in retaliation, \"keep demanding a trade war but I don't think they'll lead the nation\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who also does not want extra tariffs, will be on tomorrow's show too.",
      "But just as the government is going slow on hitting back, they are cracking heads to crack on with their existing plans faster.",
      "This isn't all about Trump. I understand the chancellor is looking at whether any of the money announced in the government's vital Spending Review can be brought forward from June. If government departments are able to finalise their deals, can that be sorted and made public as soon as possible?",
      "There are discussions too about whether it's possible to speed up the long waited-for Industrial Strategy \u2013 a plan to get investment into the UK pencilled in for June, but could it be brought forward? A decision hasn't been made but the prime minister is again, his team indicate, trying to use the jeopardy around the world as an impetus to push the government machine harder. \"We have to run quickly towards this,\" a government source says \u2013 and the chancellor is looking at it this weekend.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "You might feel, haven't I heard this before? You'd be right. Since the start of the year, the prime minister and the chancellor have both repeatedly said the government has to go faster, work harder. So why after years in opposition weren't Starmer's team ready to go with all of these changes when they got into office? For a government that promised to be radical, its plans have not always been forthcoming.",
      "You may not fancy the kind of radicalism we're seeing out of the White House, but radical it certainly is. To compete, the UK may need to be that too.",
      "It is ludicrous to imagine the PM is \"very happy\" that the UK has been hit with tariffs as Trump suggested \u2013 \"artistic licence\", a government source remarked. No British action can completely insulate our economy from disruption abroad. But the government's own actions do matter, and this could be a defining moment.",
      "While there's been no lack of trying to soften the blows for the UK, the government's hopes have been dashed already. First, ministers believed the UK could escape tariffs, then they said they were prepared in case, then disappointed when they arrived.",
      "As Sir Keir spends another weekend on the phone, and his officials wait for their phone to ring, the government doesn't know what it will be able to say next.",

    "summary": "The way the boy was held on the floor in a special school was unlawful, a use-of-force expert tells BBC.",
    "story": [
      "CCTV of an autistic pupil being restrained by staff in a seclusion room at a special school is \"brutal\" and \"unlawful\", a restraint expert has told the BBC.",
      "The footage shows the 12-year-old being held face-down on the floor in a prone restraint involving five members of staff.",
      "His mother, who gave it to the BBC, said she was \"horrified\" when she watched it.",
      "The management of the school, in Leeds, said multiple investigations found staff had no case to answer and the expert views were a \"difference of opinion\".",
      "The BBC has also spoken to an autistic pupil who was aged five when he was detained for prolonged periods at a different school.",
      "The BBC's investigation into seclusion - facilities known variously as calming, quiet or safe rooms - began last year when we uncovered CCTV of non-verbal pupils being abused and neglected at Whitefield School in north London.",
      "A spokesperson for the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer described those failings as \"horrendous\" and said they \"must never happen again\".",
      "Now, we have separately learned of concerns about the use of such rooms elsewhere, including footage recorded in October 2023 at Springwell Leeds Academy North site - a school for pupils with social, emotional and mental health special needs.",
      "The CCTV includes one 50-minute video in which an 12-year-old autistic pupil is repeatedly restrained by staff and shown trying to kick them.",
      "Near the end of the footage, the child swings his arm at staff and is then manoeuvred to the floor. He is then held in a prone restraint for three minutes.",
      "Eric Baskind, an expert on the use of force in institutional settings who has reviewed the footage, said the restraint is \"too brutal, unnecessary and, in my view, unlawful\" - an opinion endorsed by a second expert asked to review the footage by the BBC.",
      "Mr Baskind said the force was unreasonable as staff members already had control of the boy and could have moved him into a sitting position on the bench instead.",
      "\"They just dragged him [into the prone position],\" he said. \"That would have been really traumatic, and it would have escalated the hostility in the situation, which is the exact opposite of what they ought to have been trying to do.\"",
      "A third expert, education consultant Elizabeth Swan, said the use of force was \"unreasonable, excessive and unnecessarily prolonged\".",
      "She also said the room resembled a \"holding cell\" and many autistic children find being deprived of sensory stimulation traumatising.",
      "The boy's mother, Zoe, requested the footage from the school through an application for his personal information known as a subject access request, and later shared it with the BBC.",
      "\"This is a child and these are five grown adults in a school where he's supposed to be safe,\" she said.",
      "\"A calming room should be a room for children to calm down with blankets, teddies and soft lighting. Not a padded cell. You wouldn't put an animal in there.\"",
      "In response, Wellspring Academy Trust's chief executive, Mark Wilson, told the BBC that it had conducted three investigations into the footage and found no case to answer against staff.",
      "He also said that an investigation by Leeds City Council's local authority designated officer - responsible for managing allegations against adults who work with children - had found that malpractice was unsubstantiated.",
      "In a further statement, Mr Wilson said the incident was typical of those that happen in schools \"from time to time\" and this \"difference of opinion\" concerned footage which was \"selective\", lacking context and sound, and misrepresentative of staff care. He also said the school was rated \"good\" by Ofsted.\u00ad",
      "Although the door to the room at the Leeds school was open, the BBC's investigation into seclusion has revealed that pupils are also sometimes locked in rooms elsewhere. Zip up tents have also been used - and even, in one instance, a cage.",
      "We have spoken to an eight-year-old autistic pupil who was repeatedly locked inside seclusion rooms at a different school while aged five.",
      "The boy - whose identity we have protected - told the BBC that being sent there was \"horrible\" and left him feeling angry and worried.",
      "\"It was just very scary because they can put me in there for as long as they want,\" he said.",
      "Our initial investigation into Whitefield School in London showed pupils being pushed into rooms with Rhino pads - that are often used in rugby training - and also being thrown to the floor and left sitting in vomit, before its calming rooms were shut in 2017.",
      "However, no rules have been changed and schools in the UK are not legally required to tell parents when they place their child in seclusion.",
      "In 2021, 550 hours of CCTV were handed to the Metropolitan Police after it had been discovered by new leadership at Whitefield School - but the force's investigation into staff concluded last year without anyone being charged.",
      "Now the BBC has learned that the local authority where the school is based, Waltham Forest, was warned that calming rooms were being over-used at Whitefield the year before they were shut down following an Ofsted inspection - but it failed to act.",
      "A charity, the British Institute of Learning Disabilities, visited the school and warned of the harms of seclusion. Waltham Forest did not comment when approached by the BBC.",
      "The Education Secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has repeatedly declined to be interviewed about the lack of regulation of calming rooms.",
      "In response to our latest findings, the government said a consultation is under way about use of force and restrictive interventions - and it is awaiting the findings of a Waltham Forest investigation.",
      "Draft guidance asks schools to have a policy on seclusion but this will not be a legal requirement.",
      "Meanwhile, the families of Whitefield pupils have now formed a campaign group that is calling on the government to act.",
      "Maria - the parent of one of the 39 affected Whitefield pupils - said ministers \"have seen the footage and said 'this can't happen again' - and yet there's no change.\"",
      "\"Anything that happens to any other child or young person since they said that is on them - as their inaction makes them culpable.\"",
      "Maria said footage of her son in the Whitefield calming rooms was the \"most degrading, dehumanising and undignified video\" she had ever seen.",
      "Gemma Grant, of the Challenging Behaviour Foundation charity, said school staff face enormous challenges but seclusion rooms are \"outdated and inhumane\" and should be banned.",
      "While schools will legally be required to report use of force to parents in England from September, there will still be no statutory requirement to tell them about the use of seclusion, despite it being \"really clear it's causing harm to children\", according to Mrs Grant.",
      "In Scotland, guidance already advises that schools report seclusion to parents as soon as possible, but it is not a legal requirement. In Northern Ireland, statutory guidance on seclusion is being developed, while in Wales schools are asked to obtain parental consent.",

      "\"These children are not spending these hours on their phones while sat in school,\" Dame Rachel said in a new report.",
      "She said schools should educate young people about online risks - but parents and carers needed more help to manage their children's online habits and technology companies must \"take responsibility for making the online world safe\".",
      "She added that she would back any head teacher's decision to ban phones, but added: \"It should always be their choice, based on their knowledge of what's best for the children in their own classrooms, not a direction imposed nationally by the government.\"",

      "And the government has said there is already guidance on how schools can restrict the use of phones, which head teachers can decide how to put into practice.",

      "Two-year-old Henry is completely transfixed by the iPad in front of him. Every time a smiley face appears he taps the screen - and his tap transforms the face into a cartoon of a dancing animal.",
      "It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.",
      "It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.",
      "Scientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain.",
      "The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.",
      "But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.",
      "A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.",
      "For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.",
      "\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"",
      "Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains.",
      "\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"",
      "During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.",
      "Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.",
      "\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"",
      "This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school.",
      "\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"",
      "In another room, Jackson, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.",
      "A research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jackson can keep all the stickers he finds.",
      "\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.",

      "The project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.",
      "One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.",
      "Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.",
      "And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.",
      "In this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.",

    "story": [
      "The young cast of Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza\u2019s film Warfare had to bond pretty quickly, to play a US military unit whose lives depended on each other, during the Iraq war in 2006.",
      "Familiarity was crucial, so before filming began, the cast were sent on a three-week military bootcamp.",
      "They lived together, learning military jargon and gun safety and were pushed beyond their limits - all of which brought them closer together.",
      "First off though, they agreed to shave each other's heads to look the part, boosting trust and familiarity.",
      "\"We shaved our heads on day one, and got tattoos at the end of the process, so it bookended the experience,\" Poulter tells the BBC.",
      "The actor, who recently appeared in The Bear and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, plays Captain Eric, who was part of a group of US soldiers and Iraqi scouts on a surveillance mission.",
      "We see how it goes wrong, with devastating consequences.",
      "Heartstopper star Connor plays newcomer Tommy, hitting home how young the soldiers were - he's just turned 21, the same age Tommy was at the time.",
      "The actor says the decision to get a shared tattoo with his castmates after filming wrapped was a \"no-brainer\". The casts of The Avengers and The Lord of the Rings did the same thing after their final films.",
      "Warfare's actors decided their tattoo would say \"Call On Me\", to reflect their brotherhood, while referencing Erik Prydz's 2004 dance hit, which kicks the film off.",
      "The cast features some other big names, including Reservation Dogs' D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Sh\u014dgun's Cosmo Jarvis, Stranger Things and the forthcoming Beatles biopic's Joseph Quinn, and Riverdale's Charles Melton.",
      "\"It was really formative for me,\" Connor says about his time  on the film. \"I've made friends I really do believe I will know for a long time.",
      "\"We all wanted to commemorate it - we are so proud of the work we've done together.\"",
      "The movie is based entirely on a real-life mission that took place during the Iraq war, and is built on the memories of the US soldiers who were there.",
      "The group was embedded in the home of an ordinary Iraqi family, who we briefly see in the film, in Ramadi - an area controlled by Al-Qaeda forces.",
      "The military's goal had been to slip into and observe the area under the cover of darkness, to ensure the safe passage of ground forces there the next day.",
      "What they didn't know what that they were next door to an insurgent house, making them the target of an attack.",
      "Shot in real-time, Warfare has no music or flashbacks, so there's no let-up for the audience. You're dropped into the thick of the action for the whole film.",
      "The soldiers in command have to make split-second decisions amid the pain and chaos, with the Iraqi family caught in the crossfire.",
      "Oscar nominee Garland, whose back catalogue includes the 28 Days film franchise and Ex Machina, got the idea for Warfare when he was making last year's film Civil War.",
      "He was working on the battle scenes with Hollywood stunt man and gunfight co-ordinator Ray Mendoza.",
      "\"During the edit process of Civil War, I was able to really focus on some of the work Ray had done, and how sophisticated and how nuanced it was,\" Garland recalls.",
      "They got chatting about Mendoza's previous life as a US Navy Seal, and about the Ramadi operation, where he was its communications officer.",
      "Mendoza said he'd always wanted to make a film about that mission.",
      "The veteran had a very big reason for wanting to recreate what happened that day - to help replace the lost memories of his colleague Elliott Miller.",
      "Miller, a former Navy Seal, was so badly injured in Ramadi that he suffered traumatic brain injury and memory loss, and had to have a leg amputated.",
      "During the mission, Mendoza carried the unconscious soldier to the rescue tank that ultimately saved his life.",
      "\"Elliott doesn't remember it, and when he woke up, he had a lot of questions,\" Mendoza says.",
      "\"No matter how many maps we drew, or how many times we wrote it out - without that core memory, I think he's had a hard time.",
      "\"It just raised more questions than answers. So I wanted to recreate this one.\"",
      "So Garland and Mendoza decided to make Warfare together, sharing writing and directing credits, and dedicating the film to Miller.",
      "The crucial question is whether seeing the film helped Miller piece things together.",
      "\"It did, yeah - he was a sponge,\" Mendoza says.",
      "\"We walked him through it - he had a lot of questions, he's got kids that have questions.",
      "\"It's now a film memory, but it's as close as he's gonna have \u2013 he's super grateful.\"",
      "Miller was played by Jarvis, who calls him \"a funny guy... he's great - a living embodiment of perseverance\".",
      "It was a \"unique situation to be in when you're entrusted with portraying somebody that's sitting right across from you\", Jarvis said, about having the person he was playing actually on set.",
      "\"But because he didn't remember [what happened], a lot of my references had to come from his colleagues.\"",
      "The soldiers' casting has caused some excitement online, with some publications breathily calling the actors \"all of the internet's boyfriends\" and \"red hot rising stars\".",
      "Garland arches an eyebrow at this, and Mendoza jumps in to talk about why those actors were chosen.",
      "\"I've said this to them, so I'm not trying to offend them, but we weren't looking for the best actors. They're all great actors. We were looking for the right actors,\" he says.",
      "\"So what that means is their willingness to push their bodies past a comfort level that they're maybe not used to. 'You're gonna be exhausted. You're gonna be required to rely on other people. It's not about you, it's about the team'.",
      "\"And the ones that jump at that opportunity, you're like, 'Yep, that's the attitude that we need'.\"",
      "Collating and cross-checking the soldiers' memories was a big job, largely undertaken by Garland.",
      "\"I think there's an inherent value in attempting to be honest and truthful about something as serious and significant as war,\" he says.",
      "He shot the film in a studio in a suburb north of London, on a former World War Two airfield, making it in real-time to recreate \"a real incident of combat... as honestly, forensically and accurately as possible\".",
      "Not surprisingly, while sharing credits with Garland, former US Navy Seal Mendoza ran the actors' bootcamp.",
      "He was played by Woon-A-Tai, who calls him \"a brilliant instructor who instilled a lot of confidence in us\", while also making gun safety a top priority.",
      "The actor was also fascinated by the narrative not being \"dramatised or Hollywoodised\".",
      "\"To see these guys not obey orders - and do what they needed to save their platoon was interesting to me,\" he says, talking about the soldiers' evacuation process.",
      "Mendoza thinks the film may also help veterans who are struggling to express what warfare can be like.",
      "\"Some of these things are harder to explain in words,\" he says. \"So art imagery is how I'm able to communicate that.\"",
      "Connor echoes this, saying: \"A lot of these men are very much less inclined to talk about themselves in these situations, whether it be to be due to humility, or a difficulty in really articulating it.",
      "\"A lot of them just don't really enjoy talking about their involvement.\"",
      "The film has been called \"the most harrowing \u2013 and honest \u2013 depiction of modern combat ever made\" by the Telegraph, while the New Yorker said it offers a \"hyperrealist rebuke of the American war movie\".",
      "The Guardian said the \"film-makers' message gets lost in the deafening blizzard of battle\", while Empire added: \"It may well be cinema's most effective, purest anti-war film: there is no sentimentality, no hand-wringing, but most significantly not a second of it makes war look cool, or attractive.\"",
      "Poulter says he admires the film-makers' determination to make Warfare purely factual.",
      "\"Hopefully this film contributes to a better understanding of just how negative, and how the consequences of war are characterised by a lot of loss...",
      "\"I think this is as much an anti-war film as you can possibly hope to see.\"",

    "story": [
      "Indie icons Pulp have announced a new album, More, and shared their first single in almost 24 years, called Spike Island.",
      "Speaking on BBC 6 Music, frontman Jarvis Cocker said the band had been tempted back into the studio by the overwhelming response to their 2023 reunion tour.",
      "\"We did play one new song towards the end of the tour, and nobody threw things at us, or left to go to the bar,\" he said. \"So we just thought we'd carry on and see what we could conjure up.\"",
      "The Sheffield band were one of the biggest acts of the 1990s Britpop era - although their music never quite fit into the backward-looking musical revisionism of that movement - with songs like Babies, Disco 2000 and Common People.",
      "Formed in Sheffield in 1978, they sold more than 10 million records after taking a (very) long road to success.",
      "After 2001's We Love Life, the band went on a decade-long hiatus. They reformed in 2011 for a number of festival dates, including a surprise performance Glastonbury, and reunited again in 2023.",
      "The new single was inspired by the infamous Stone Roses concert at Spike Island, Widnes, in 1990 - a show that has been variously described as a milestone for British indie music, and a disappointing shambles with dodgy sound.",
      "Pulp guitarist Mark Webber told 6 Music's Lauren Laverne the show had been \"a slight anticlimax, to be honest\".",
      "\"I think everyone felt that way,\" he said. \"There was a lot of anticipation but it didn't sound very good, it was very windy and the vibe wasn't there.\"",
      "Cocker said he hadn't been at the show, but had written the lyrics after speaking to various attendees, including musician Jason Buckle, from the band All Seeing I, who co-wrote Pulp's single.",
      "\"All he could remember was a DJ who between every song said, 'Spike Island come alive, Spike Island come alive',\" he said.",
      "\"That phrase stuck with me. I've got a very short attention span I think.\"",
      "Cocker said the track was a sister song to 1995's Sorted for E's and Whizz, which was also based on a fan's experience of the Stone Roses' gig.",
      "The inspiration for that track was \"a girl that I was speaking to at The Leadmill in Sheffield one night,\" he recalled.",
      "\"She said all that she could remember were people going round saying, 'Is everyone sorted for E's and whizz?'. So that phrase stuck in my mind.\"",
      "More will be released on 6 June, and is dedicated to Pulp's former bassist Steve Mackey, who died in 2023, at the age of 56.",
      "Cocker said that recording without the musician was \"weird at first\" but that there were \"two songs on the record which date from when Steve was around\", which made him feel part of the project.",
      "\"It was not the nicest thing,\" the singer continued, \"but people who you're close to, you never forget them, and you can do things to remember them by\".",
      "The album was recorded over three weeks in 2024, and Cocker said there were \"no over-riding themes, except feelings, maybe, which sounds very wafty and not very precise\".",
      "He said the absence of an overarching idea had given the band a sense of freedom, compared to more conceptual Pulp albums such as This Is Hardcore.",
      "\"We [recorded] it quite quickly, and we were trying to not think about it too much, because that's what kind of made the last couple of Pulp albums a bit of a pain,\" he said.",
      "\"It was mainly my fault,\" he added, \"because I'd never got the lyrics together, so I was always changing them and messing around.",
      "\"This time, they were all written before we went into the studio, and I realised it was a lot less stressful.",
      "\"You know, I would always be a bit stressed in the studio, because I knew once the music was done, then I had to write the words. I don't know why I put myself through that,\" he said.",
      "Artificial intelligence video",
      "In a press release announcing the record, Cocker added: \"We hope you enjoy the music. It was written and performed by four human beings from the North of England, aided and abetted by five other human beings from various locations in the British Isles.",
      "\"No AI was involved during the process.\"",
      "However, he did employ artificial intelligence to create the video for Spike Island, which animates the infamous \"cardboard cut-out\" figures who appear on the cover of Pulp's biggest album, Different Class.",
      "\"All the moving images featured in the video are the result of me feeding in a still image and then typing in a 'prompt' such as: 'The black & white figure remains still whilst the bus in the background drives off', which led to [a] sequence where the coach weirdly slides towards the cut-out of me,\" said Cocker.",
      "\"The weekend I began work on the video was a strange time: I went out of the house and kept expecting weird transformations of the surrounding environment due to the images the computer had been generating.",
      "\"The experience had marked me. I don't know whether I've recovered yet.\"",
      "After completing the video, the musician said he'd landed firmly on the side of \"human intelligence\" over AI.",
      "The band will kick off a UK tour the day after the album is released in June but, in response to a 6 Music listener, said they had \"no plans\" to play Glastonbury.",
      "However, the band do have a gap in their diary for the weekend the festival takes place, before resuming their tour in Spain in July.",

      "A share of the revenue streaming services make from subscription fees should be paid into a fund to support British high-end TV production, an influential group of MPs has said.",
      "In a new report, the Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) committee urged the government to improve support measures for producers while safeguarding the creation of distinctly British content.",
      "It follows an inquiry into the UK TV and film industry which examined the effects of the rise of streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon and Apple TV.",
      "The report noted how \"vital\" dramas such as Adolescence are to the country's \"identity, national conversations and talent pipeline\", which they say is now \"under threat\".",
      "It is \"time for streamers to put their money where their mouth is\", the report read, suggesting that streaming companies should pay \"5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund to help finance drama with a specific interest to British audiences\".",
      "Chair of the CMS committee, MP Dame Caroline Dinenage, noted how recent \"big box-office blockbusters made in Britain have showcased the UK's world-class film and high-end television industry like never before\".",
      "\"But the boom in inward investment of recent years now risks crowding out our many talented independent British producers,\" she said.",
      "She added: \"While streamers like Netflix and Amazon have proved a valuable addition for the industry and economy, unless the government urgently intervenes to rebalance the playing field, for every Adolescence adding to the national conversation, there will be countless distinctly British stories that never make it to our screens.\"",
      "Adolescence, created by Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham, tells the story of a 13-year-old boy who is charged with killing a female classmate.",
      "This week, it became fourth most popular English-language series in Netflix's history with 114 million views.",
      "A Netflix spokeswoman said: \"The UK is Netflix's biggest production hub outside of North America - and we want it to stay that way.",
      "\"But in an increasingly competitive global market, it's key to create a business environment that incentivises rather than penalises investment, risk taking and success. Levies diminish competitiveness and penalise audiences who ultimately bear the increased costs.\"",
      "The Association for Commercial Broadcasters and On-Demand Services (COBA) said a levy risks damaging streamers' investment in the UK.",
      "Coba executive director Adam Minns said: \"Especially in this economic climate, a levy risks impacting existing content budgets for UK shows, jobs, and growth, along with raising costs for businesses.",
      "\"Ironically, it could actually damage public service broadcaster dramas by reducing co-production budgets at streamers.\"",
      "He added pressure on domestic production stemmed from the real terms decline in the TV licence fee.",
      "A BBC spokesman said the corporation \"continues to invest\" in British content but faced \"significant financial challenges due to pressure on the licence fee and rising industry costs\".",
      "\"It is therefore integral that the BBC and the wider UK creative industries have the support in place to drive growth in the creative economy and support homegrown content and storytelling.\"",
      "The report released on Thursday noted how last year there was a 27% decrease in the number of domestic high-end TV productions made in the UK and a 25% fall in spend.",
      "The calls for greater help come after Wolf Hall director Peter Kosminsky told BBC News last month that the industry was in crisis, and that public service broadcasters including the BBC and ITV could no longer afford to make high-end British drama.",
      "Fair levy or unfair tariff?",
      "The arrival of the streamers into the UK market \"drove up the price of everything\", Kosminsky told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, to the point where the public service broadcasters \"couldn't afford to make their programs anymore, so we need a new pot of money.\"",
      "He underlined how 17 other countries in Europe have imposed a similar levy \"so that public service broadcasters can stay in the game.\"",
      "Speaking on the same programme, former BBC One controller Peter Fincham replied saying he did not agree.",
      "\"I think this sounds to me a little bit like a tariff - to use a more fashionable word - and indeed a form of protectionism.\"",

      "\"We thank the committee for its report which we will respond to in due course.\"",
      "'Support freelancers'",
      "The report also noted while the introduction of tax breaks for independent British films, and for film and TV studios in England may have helped, it was not a \"silver bullet\" for solving many of the issues facing British producers.",
      "As well as providing greater support and resources for UK TV production workforces, it also suggested that lawmakers should consider cutting VAT on cinema tickets as well as doing more to meet the challenges posed by AI.",
      "Commenting on the report, Paul W Fleming, general secretary of Equity, which represents British performers, said the government should \"heed the call\" for the licensing of creative works in all cases where they are used to train artificial intelligence models.",
      "\"AI is being built illegally by stealing Equity members' life's works,\" he said.",
      "Big tech firms \"must be held to account\", he added, \"brought to the table and made to pay creators what they owe.\"",
      "The cross-party committee recommended the government and British Film Institute (BFI) should launch a national awareness campaign, highlighting the employment opportunities offered by film and high-end TV, and \"the range of skills the industry requires\".",
      "It stressed how the industry \"benefits hugely from the flexibility afforded by a predominantly freelance workforce\" and therefore more should be done to \"support freelancers when they are out of work\"; such as the introduction of a minimum hourly wage or guaranteed basic income.",
      "Head of industry union Bectu, Philippa Childs, said: \"We welcome this timely and incisive report from the committee which identifies many of the urgent challenges currently facing the industry and its workforce.\"",

      "\"People would mock my accent,\" he says. But it didn't faze him. Hockney knew his worth even then. \"I'd look at their artworks and I'd think, well, if I drew like that, I'd keep my mouth shut.\"",
      "What would the young boy growing up in Bradford think about the life he'd go on to have and the work he'd create?",
      "\"He'd have thought it was pretty daft.\"",
      "For decades, Hockney has been among the world's greatest living artists, and he is now opening his biggest ever show.",
      "As we sit together in a vast gallery at the Louis Vuitton Foundation, a stunning museum designed in reflective glass on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, I ask him what he thinks of the exhibition.",
      "He says it's his best ever, and bursts into laughter again.",
      "It's an expression of pure delight at the 11 rooms filled across four floors with his art - and at being alive to see it. \"I'm just laughing, I mean we made it!\"",
      "Two years ago, when they started planning the exhibition, \"I just thought I probably wouldn't be here\", he says. \"I'm still a smoker, a happy smoker fed up of bossy people telling you what to do... but I didn't know.\"",
      "Hockney is sporting a badge that says \"End Bossiness Soon\" in a gallery dedicated to his love of spring. During the pandemic in 2020, Hockney, who was living in Normandy, used his iPad to paint the trees and flowers blooming as spring arrived.",
      "Those 220 iPad works adorn this gallery, floor to ceiling, the walls bursting with blossom and pure joy, made at a time when the world wasn't feeling very hopeful.",
      "Visitors to the show are greeted at the entrance by Hockney's message from that time: \"Do remember they can't cancel the spring.\"",
      "Hockney has been in poor health. He now has two full-time carers, who have accompanied him to Paris from London, where he now lives. Portraits of both, sitting in their dark blue nurses' uniforms, are the most recent works in the exhibition, made earlier this year.",
      "A self-portrait of Hockney, painting and smoking a cigarette (his two great loves) is also very new.",
      "He still paints for four to six hours every day, he tells me.",
      "He believes you can't judge a painter until their last work is done - but looking at his own work gathered together in Paris, \"I can see what I was always trying to do, really\".",
      "And he promises that \"anybody who has just a little visual sensibility will really enjoy this show\".",
      "His great-nephew Richard Hockney, who has regularly sat for him for 28 years, since he was four years old, including for this exhibition, tells me everyone was determined the artist would make it to Paris.",
      "The night before, Hockney got into a car with his dachshund Tess to be driven across the Channel. And on the morning before they left, they were playing him variations of the jazz classic April in Paris.",
      "Having arrived, \"he is glowing\", Richard says. \"I think this will keep him going for a long, long time, to be honest.\"",
      "And with spring unfolding in the French capital, it's entirely appropriate that the artist known for chronicling spring would open his exhibition, David Hockney 25, now.",
      "This is a man who would fly back from his home in Los Angeles when he heard the hawthorn had begun to blossom in his native Yorkshire, just so he could paint the dazzling spectacle.",
      "Some of his earliest works, including probably his most famous, A Bigger Splash, are also on show in Paris.",
      "That painting, capturing the moment of a swimmer diving into a Santa Monica pool, is on the wall next to Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), the south of France pool painting that broke records when it sold at auction in 2018 for \u00a370m.",
      "Next to those are Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy, another of Hockney's most recognisable works, which depicts his good friend Celia Birtwell and her husband Ossie Clark, with their white cat on his knee.  Seeing them brought together in one room is spectacular.",
      "But the show's main focus is the last 25 years because \"it's 2025\", he says. \"People think it's miserable, but in 1925 they'd had the First World War.\"",
      "It's a visual feast, full of the bright colours and optimism for which Hockney has become known.",
      "\"I've always had it. I've always thought it was an absurd world.\"",
      "A world to laugh at, to look at closely, as Hockney does, and to paint vibrantly.",
      "Some of the iPad paintings are huge. He's \"amazed they could be blown up so big\" when they were created on something so small.",
      "One room is almost pitch dark to show off paintings he did of the Moon, made possible by advances in iPad technology.",
      "There's also a floor devoted to his portraits (about 60), including a 2022 painting of singer Harry Styles in a striped cardigan with a set of pearls around his neck.",
      "But the rest are the friends and family Hockney knows well - Birtwell, her children and grandchildren, the show's curator Sir Norman Rosenthal wearing full regalia, Hockney's partner JP, sometimes with Tess the dog - and two of Richard.",
      "Even though they're related, when he's having a portrait done \"it's very surreal looking at him and then realising you're being painted by David Hockney\", he tells me. \"You know he's always going to create a masterpiece.\"",
      "His great uncle chooses to paint people he loves because \"he sees the truer representation of yourself than you do\". In one of the portraits, Richard is grinning, in a green and white striped T-shirt.",
      "Because Hockney likes Richard's cheeky grin, \"he will sit there and grin at me because he knows it's going to make me grin... after six hours, it aches a bit\".",
      "King Charles went to visit Hockney at home in London before he travelled. \"He's a very nice man, thoughtful, I thought,\" the artist says. \"He does watercolours himself.\"",
      "But he doesn't fancy painting the King. \"The problem there is the majesty, isn't it really? I would find that a bit difficult, I think.\"",
      "He does, though, have a work on the go, a new painting of his great-nephew.",
      "Richard tells me Hockney \"says he's still got a lot of work to do, which is good\", adding: \"As long as that's in his head, then he'll keep going.\"",
      "The artist says he'll finish his painting of his great nephew and then \"I will paint somebody else. And I just carry on.\"",
      "Watch Katie Razzall's full interview - David Hockney: A Life in Art - on BBC iPlayer.",

      "In these games, if the ball goes behind off the opposition three times, a penalty is awarded to the attacking team.",

      "It's another possible treatment option for those with this cancer - but a charity said breast cancer drugs should be approved more quickly.",

      "In trials, in 708 women, when combined with hormone therapy, the drug doubled the time the cancer took to grow, from 3.6 months to 7.3 months, and shrank tumours in 23% of patients.",

      "If the cancer returns and spreads to other parts of the body, treatments aim to control it, reduce the symptoms and improve quality of life.",
      "Possible treatments include chemotherapy, radiotherapy and drugs that help to stop the cancer growing - either by blocking hormones, boosting the body's immune system or targeting what makes cancer cells grow.",
      "This new drug capivasertib is a targeted therapy. It works in a new way, blocking the activity of a protein molecule called AKT which drives cancer growth.",
      "Scientists started working on the drug's development 20 years ago and say it's the most effective cancer drug they've seen for advanced cancer. AstraZeneca is the manufacturer of capivasertib.",
      "Genetic testing",
      "The drug is suitable for those with certain gene mutations that affect up to half of people with hormone receptor positive secondary breast cancer - the most common type, which grows in the presence of oestrogen.",
      "Prof Peter Johnson, clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said it offered \"an additional option\" for some whose cancer has progressed despite previous hormone therapy - but it wouldn't be suitable for everyone.",
      "Claire Rowney, chief executive at charity Breast Cancer Now, said she was \"delighted\" that the drug would offer some people \"the hope of more precious time to do what matters most to them\".",

      "Targeting them for prostate biopsies and MRI scans discovered some aggressive cancers that would otherwise have gone unnoticed.",
      "However, the test has not yet been proven to save lives and experts say it will be  \"years\" before such tests could be used routinely.",
      "Around 12,000 men in the UK die from prostate cancer every year.",
      "Calls for the routine testing of healthy men - known as screening - have grown louder since Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy announced he had terminal prostate cancer.",

      "Two-year-old Henry is completely transfixed by the iPad in front of him. Every time a smiley face appears he taps the screen - and his tap transforms the face into a cartoon of a dancing animal.",
      "It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.",
      "It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.",
      "Scientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain.",
      "The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.",
      "But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.",
      "A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.",
      "For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.",
      "\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"",
      "Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains.",
      "\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"",
      "During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.",
      "Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.",
      "\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"",
      "This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school.",
      "\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"",
      "In another room, Jackson, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.",
      "A research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jackson can keep all the stickers he finds.",
      "\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.",
      "\"These are what I call 'building blocks' of really important skills.\"",

      "The Children of the 90s project is now 35 years old. Focused primarily on health, by tracking 14,500 children born between 1991 and 1992, it has revealed insights into obesity, autism and, more recently, the effect of the pandemic on mental health.",
      "The project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.",
      "One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.",
      "Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.",
      "And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.",
      "In this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.",
      "Emily, who was studied as a child of the 90s, is Henry's mum. Today, her young son sits on her lap as he works on one of the research team's carefully designed puzzles.",
      "\"We've both been a part of this since birth,\" Emily says. \"It wasn't a choice for me at the start - my mum signed me up. But it is now, and I just think it's fascinating.\"",
      "Helping children to thrive in the future is the aim, Dr Holmboe says. Because when children start school, she explains \"a lot of things are already set.",

      "For years, most countries, including the US, have imposed few or no tariffs on finished drugs, thanks in part to a 1995 World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement aimed at keeping medicines affordable.",
      "This shift comes after Trump introduced a blanket 10% tariff on other imports last week, as part of a broader effort to bring manufacturing back to the US.",
      "His new \"reciprocal\" tariffs - including a duty of 104% on goods arriving from China - came into force on Wednesday, intensifying a global trade war and further shaking markets.",
      "Pharmaceutical buyers, so far spared from such measures, are now preparing for what may come next.",
      "The US has typically imported vast quantities of finished medicines from India, Europe and China without buyers paying tariffs - although active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), used to make drugs, do face some duties.",
      "Speaking at a fundraiser dinner for his Republican Party on Tuesday, Trump said: \"We're going to be announcing very shortly a major tariff on pharmaceuticals. And when they hear that, they will leave China.\"",
      "He also told reporters on board his Air Force One plane last week that \"pharma\" tariffs would arrive \"at a level that you haven't really seen before\", saying these would be announced \"in the near future\".",

      "European drugmakers are also on alert. After a high-level meeting between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and top pharma firms on Tuesday, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) warned that tariffs could shift production away from Europe, and to the US.",
      "The EFPIA, whose members include major pharmaceutical companies such as Bayer, Novartis, and Novo Nordisk - the maker of the star diabetes type 2 drug Ozempic - expressed concerns that rising tariffs could disrupt Europe's role as a key player in global pharmaceutical production.",

      "Two years after that pioneering operation, Grace gave birth to her first child in February. She and her husband, Angus, 37, have named their daughter Amy after Grace's sister, who donated her womb.",
      "Holding baby Amy - who weighed just over two kilos (four and a half pounds) - for the first time was \"incredible\" and \"surreal\", new mum Grace says.",

      "The couple initially wished to remain anonymous, but following the safe arrival of baby Amy are now speaking to the BBC about their \"little miracle\".",
      "The surgical team told the BBC they have carried out three further womb transplants using deceased donors since Grace's transplant. They aim to carry out a total of 15 as part of a clinical trial.",
      "Grace was born with a rare condition, Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, where the womb is missing or underdeveloped, but with functioning ovaries. When the BBC first spoke to her in 2018, she was hoping her mother could donate her uterus to allow her to have children - but it proved to be unsuitable.",

      "Isabel Quiroga, the surgeon who led the transplant team at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford, says although the procedure carried risks for both sisters, it was \"life-enhancing and life-creating - and you can't have better than that.\"",
      "Amy says she did not feel the sense of loss some women experience after a hysterectomy, because of the \"dramatic\" and immediate benefits to her sister. Grace had her first ever period within two weeks of the transplant and became pregnant on the first attempt at IVF.",
      "It was \"incredible\" to feel her baby's first kick, she says, adding the entire pregnancy had been \"really special\".",
      "Baby Amy was born by Caesarean section at Queen Charlotte's hospital in west London on 27 February.",
      "\"It was an incredible moment, full of joy,\" says surgeon Isabel Quiroga.",
      "Grace and Angus say they hope to have a second child - as soon as the medical team say the time is right.",
      "The donated womb will be removed after the birth of a second child. This will allow Grace to stop taking the daily immunosuppressants she is currently on to ensure her body does not reject her sister's womb. Taking these drugs can increase the risks of developing some cancers, especially if taken over many years - but surgeon Isabel Quiroga says these risks should return to baseline once the womb is removed.",
      "Prof Richard Smith, a gynaecological surgeon at Imperial College Healthcare, who led the organ retrieval team, has been researching womb transplantation for more than two decades.",
      "He says his team is thrilled about the birth of baby Amy.",
      "\"I'm not often short of words but when the baby came out I was speechless - there were a lot of tears in the theatre that day.",
      "\"The whole thing is astonishing and incredibly moving,\" Prof Smith adds.",
      "He says Amy's birth will give hope to many of the 15,000 women in the UK of childbearing age who do not have a functioning uterus, of whom around 5,000 were born without a womb.",
      "Mr Smith heads a charity called Womb Transplant UK, which paid the NHS costs for Grace's transplant operation. All the medical staff gave their time for free.",
      "He told the BBC around 10 women have embryos in storage or are undergoing fertility treatment, a requirement for being considered for womb transplantation. Each transplant costs around \u00a330,000, he says, and the charity has sufficient funds to do two more.",
      "The surgical team has permission to perform 15 womb transplants as part of a clinical trial, five with living and 10 with deceased donors. No details have been made public about the three women who have so far received wombs from deceased donor organs. NHS Blood and Transplant told the BBC extra consent is sought from families for such rare donations.",
      "Baby Amy's father, Angus, says he and Grace will never be able to thank his wife's sister enough for enabling them to become parents. It was an \"absolute no brainer\" that they would name Amy after her aunt, Angus says.",
      "The baby's middle name is Isabel, after the surgeon who led the womb transplantation team.",
      "For Grace, having baby Amy has brought her even closer to her sister.",
      "\"It was incredibly difficult to let her do that for me,\" she says, \"it's a huge act of sisterly love.\"",

    "story": [
      "This month the government in England will launch a consultation for its men's health strategy. The move is long overdue, experts say, with men much more likely to die prematurely than women. But why are they in such poor health \u2013 and what can be done about it?",
      "Andrew Harrison was running a men's health clinic from a youth centre in Bradford when he heard a knock. He turned to the door, but no-one was there. Then he heard his name being called. He looked around to see a young man at the window asking for condoms.",
      "\"I was on the first floor,\" he says, recounting the story from a few years ago. \"The lad had shimmied up a drainpipe on the outside of the building because he didn't want to go through the reception and ask.\"",
      "The anecdote, in many ways, encapsulates the challenges over men's health \u2013 a combination of risk-taking behaviour and a lack of confidence and skills to engage with health services.",
      "Early deaths",
      "In the UK men are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs and have high cholesterol and blood pressure.",
      "These are major contributors to the fact men have a lower life expectancy than women - by four years - and are nearly 60% more likely to die prematurely before the age of 75 with heart disease, lung cancer, liver disease and in accidents.",
      "Prof Alan White, who co-founded the Men's Health Forum charity and set up a dedicated men's health centre at Leeds Beckett University, says the issue needs to be taken more seriously.",
      "He cites the pandemic as an example, pointing out that 19,000 more men than women died from Covid. \"Where was the outrage? Where was the attention?\"",
      "He says it is too easy to blame men's poor health on their lifestyles, arguing \"it's much more complex than that.\"",
      "He says there are biological reasons \u2013 the male immune system is less able to fight off infection. But, as the story of the young man seeking condoms above demonstrates, they can also lack the skills to access health services.",
      "Prof White says: \"Men are less health-literate, that is to say they don't develop the skills to talk about their health and recognise and act on the signs. Men's health is very static from their teenage years right through into their 40s generally \u2013 many go years without seeing a health professional.",
      "\"It is different for women. Getting contraception, having cervical screening and then childbirth means many women have regular contact with health services in a way men do not.\"",
      "Stark differences",
      "Machismo is also a factor, says Mark Brooks, the policy adviser for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Men's and Boy's Issues, which has played a key role in influencing the government to draw up a men's health strategy.",
      "\"In society we have different expectations in regards to men. They are expected to man up and get on with things, to be strong and resilient.\"",
      "But he says when it comes to men's health it is important to pay particular attention to the impact of deprivation. Life expectancy in the poorest 10% of areas is 10 years less than in the wealthiest \u2013 a larger gap than is seen for women \u2013 and in the most deprived areas a man is 3.5 times more likely to die before the age of 75.",
      "\"You cannot ignore the stark differences when it comes to left-behind communities and those working in blue-collar jobs like construction and manufacturing,\" he says. \"The way health services are designed isn't working for men.\"",
      "NHS health checks, which are offered every five years to those aged 40 to 74, are considered a crucial intervention when it comes to many of the diseases which are claiming the lives of men early. But fewer than four in 10 men take up the offer.",
      "\"Someone working in construction or on an industrial estate will find it very difficult to take time off whether that's for a health check or to go and see their GP.\"",
      "Mr Brooks says he would like to see employees given a right to two hours' paid time off to go for health checks as well as seeing them delivered in places where blue-collar workers are employed, such as industrial estates.",
      "But he says this is also an issue about employment - with some men in these roles scared to face up to health problems that develop in their 40s and 50s - ignoring early warning signs or hiding illnesses from bosses altogether because of what it may mean for their work.",
      "He adds that job worries and financial concerns, along with relationship problems,  are a big driver in the high suicide rates seen among men. Three-quarters of people who take their own lives are men.",
      "Despite this, just a third of people sent for talking therapies are men, which may suggest that services are not doing enough to consider men's needs.",
      "\"How services are set up to recognise signs of depression and anxiety is not how men express them \u2013 they are more likely to display signs of anger, abuse alcohol or become withdrawn and push people away,\" says Prof White.",
      "Ethnic differences are also important to recognise, he says. For example, black men in England are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, while men from Indian or Bangladeshi backgrounds are at particularly high risk of diabetes.",
      "Wake-up call",
      "But none of this means men are not interested in their own health, says Prof Paul Galdas, a men's health expert at York University. \"Men will open up and want to be engaged, but to do that you have to base it around actions and activities.\"",
      "He has helped develop a six-week mental fitness programme in partnership with the Movember men's health movement that has been trialled on NHS front-line workers following Covid. Now it is being used by Leeds United football club for its youth players.",
      "Men are provided with support to understand how behaviour affects moods, they are encouraged to track their habits and set goals for healthy activities.",
      "\"It can be about going for a walk, seeing friends, playing golf and developing problem-solving skills to protect mental health. Good mental health leads to good physical health.\"",
      "Similar activity-based initiatives can be found in a number of local areas where charities, councils and local men's groups have worked together to set up schemes.",
      "The Men's Sheds movement is perhaps the most well-known where men are encouraged to come together and bond and support each other while doing practical projects.",
      "Prof White says now is the time to build on these foundations \u2013 something a national men's health strategy is vital for. He says it will help \"shine a spotlight\" on the issue in a similar way to the women's health strategy did back in 2022 \u2013 that led to the creation of a network of women's health hubs and women's health champions at the heart of government.",
      "But he also wants it to act as a \"wake-up call\" for men themselves. He says there are some simple steps every man should consider.",
      "\"Look at your waist size \u2013 if you are carrying weight, if your tummy is too big try to do something. Get moving, get out and about and talk to people.",
      "\"Take every opportunity to get a health check or screened. And, if you notice changes to body or the way you are managing problems, seek help.\"",

      "The 33-year-old went to a private doctor in November 2023 and was told it was \"very likely to be long Covid\", before extreme toothache days later prompted an emergency hospital visit and a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).",
      "She said after a series of relapses and months of treatment over the course of last year, she had received a stem cell transplant in December and had been declared cancer-free.",
      "However, just a week later, in early March this year, Ms Knowles was given the \"bitter\" news the leukaemia had returned.",
      "The hair salon owner, whose \"typical weekend\" before her diagnosis involved 100-mile bike rides and 15-mile runs, walked 20 miles around Fairhaven Lake on 16 March to raise funds for clinical research at King's College Hospital.",
      "She said she hoped any donations would improve research on AML, a particularly aggressive cancer which, she said, had not seen any \"solid advancements\" in treatment for 50 years.",

      "Sir Keir Starmer said the legislation would allow ministers to \"take control\" of the Lincolnshire site and stop its Chinese owner from closing its blast furnaces.",
      "The move opens the door to a full nationalisation of the company at a later stage, with the prime minister saying \"all options\" remained on the table.",

      "It will be only the fifth time since World War Two that Parliament has sat on a Saturday, showing the importance the government is placing on the law.",
      "Sir Keir said the government wanted to pass the legislation in a single day, adding the future of the company \"hangs in the balance\".",
      "He said steelmaking was \"essential for our future\" and that he would always \"act in the national interest to protect British jobs and British workers\".",
      "\"Jobs, investment, growth, our economic and national security are all on the line,\" the prime minister said.",
      "The BBC understands from a senior government source the emergency legislation being voted on in Parliament on Saturday would not give ministers the power to nationalise British Steel, another bill would be needed to do that.",
      "Chinese company Jingye, which bought British Steel in 2020, says it has invested more than \u00a31.2bn in the company to maintain operations, but has been suffering financial losses of around \u00a3700,000 a day.",
      "The business department said the new law would give the government powers to order raw materials to keep the site's two running blast furnaces going, with supplies otherwise due to run out in the coming weeks.",

      "The company announced plans last month to shed jobs at the Scunthorpe site, which employs 2,700 people, blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with lower-carbon production techniques.",
      "The government has offered \u00a3500m of support to partly fund a switch from blast furnaces to more energy efficient electric arc furnaces. But the offer has been rejected by the company.",
      "Earlier this week, the government offered to buy the coking coal to keep the blast furnaces running until a longer-term solution to saving the plant could be found, but was unable to get the company to agree to this in tense negotiations.",
      "The business secretary is thought to have lost confidence in the company's Chinese owners, with a government source saying they are \"no longer trustworthy partners\".",
      "The move to take control of the company has been welcomed by unions representing employees at the site, with Unite saying it would grant workers a \"reprieve\" while a longer-term solution is worked out.",

      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said \"nothing should be off the table in this matter of national security\" and added that the recall of Parliament should be seen as \"an opportunity to come forward with a serious plan for the sustainable future of domestic steel production\".",
      "The Green Party of England and Wales said it backed nationalisation as the \"only sure way to secure this strategically important sector\".",
      "Parliament was last recalled from a scheduled break in August 2021 to discuss the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.",
      "The Falkland Islands invasion in 1982 and the proposed Brexit deal in 2019 are two other occasions that have merited recalls.",

      "The government has made growing the UK economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards.",
      "Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said February's surprise growth was due to computer programming, telecoms and car dealerships in the services sector all having \"strong months\".",

      "Officials at the Cabinet Office - headed by Pat McFadden - are being told today that 2,100 of their 6,500 jobs will be cut or moved to other parts of government over the next two years. Along with other reforms, the Cabinet Office says the cuts will save \u00a3110m a year by 2028.",

      "Of the jobs to go, some 1,200 posts will be lost through voluntary and \"mutually-agreed\" redundancies or people not being replaced if they leave. A further 900 are being transferred to other government departments in an attempt to avoid duplication of work.",

      "A source said he was \"leading by example\" with the cuts to his own department.",

      "Labour backed the proposals, and since coming into government has reintroduced a similar bill to Parliament.",
      "Mordaunt is not the first politician to work for British American Tobacco. After losing the 1997 Tory leadership election, former chancellor Ken Clarke took up a deputy chairmanship with the company.",
      "During her time in government, Mordaunt served as a minister in several departments, including the Treasury and the Ministry of Defence.",

      "But Farage later said Reform had \"no intention in forming coalitions with the Tories\" as they \"broke Britain nationally for 14 years\".",
      "'Pragmatic and sensible'",
      "However, the Reform UK leader has not ruled out more informal routes to share power with other parties.",
      "Speaking to BBC East Midlands on Wednesday, he said Reform had a \"responsibility to work with the most pragmatic and sensible people to get things done\".",
      "\"We're not saying that at a local level, there are not groups of independents, for argument's sake, that we might be able to work with.\"",

      "He underlined how 17 other countries in Europe have imposed a similar levy \"so that public service broadcasters can stay in the game.\"",
      "Speaking on the same programme, former BBC One controller Peter Fincham replied saying he did not agree.",

    "story": [
      "A court has rejected businessman Sir Philip Green's complaint about being named in Parliament in relation to misconduct allegations reported by a newspaper.",
      "The former Topshop boss launched the case after a Labour peer said in the House of Lords that the tycoon had used a court order to stop the Telegraph publishing a story about the allegations.",
      "Parliamentary privilege gives MPs and peers absolute free speech and their comments can be reported without the threat of legal action.",
      "On Tuesday, European Court of Human Rights ruled Sir Philip's human rights were not breached when he was named in the House of Lords in 2018.",
      "Sir Philip's court injunction prevented the Telegraph from publishing misconduct allegations, including sexual and racial abuse and bullying, against five employees.",
      "The ex-employees agreed to keep the details of their complaints confidential under non-disclosure agreements.",
      "But the allegations were eventually reported after Labour peer Lord Hain revealed Sir Philip was behind the injunction in October 2018, using parliamentary privilege.",
      "In a statement at the time, Sir Philip \"categorically and wholly\" denied being guilty of any \"unlawful sexual or racist behaviour\".",
      "Sir Philip has previously accused the Telegraph of \"pursuing a vendetta\" against him and his staff.",
      "In a complaint lodged in April 2019, Sir Philip's lawyers told justices in Strasbourg that Lord Hain's statement made his breach of confidence claim against the Telegraph futile, violating his right to a fair trial and breaching his right to privacy.",
      "Lawyers for the businessman challenged the absence of controls on the power of parliamentary privilege to reveal information covered by an injunction.",
      "On Tuesday, a panel of eight judges ruled against Sir Philip, finding his right to privacy under Article 8 of the convention had not been violated.",
      "A majority of the judges also found that his complaints brought under Article 6, the right to a fair hearing, and Article 13, the right to an effective remedy, were \"inadmissible\".",
      "The justices said national parliaments \"are better placed than the international judge to assess the need to restrict conduct by a member\".",
      "They added \"the court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of Parliament\".",
      "Following the ruling, Lord Hain said: \"I'm really pleased that the Strasbourg Court defended parliamentary privilege and my right to have named Sir Philip.\"",
      "He also accused the businessman of \"resorting to all sorts of specious legal twists\" and claimed he should \"start behaving respectfully\".",
      "Downing Street defended the principle of parliamentary privilege following the court's ruling.",
      "The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"Parliamentary privilege is a fundamental and established principle of our constitutional arrangements and it is right that it protects the freedom of speech in Parliament, and, more generally, the right of each House to regulate its own affairs.\"",

    "story": [
      "More than 40 Labour MPs are urging ministers to introduce a new form of digital ID to help control the migration system and improve public services.",
      "In an open letter, Labour MPs from three groups said a \"gear shift\" was needed to reap the benefits of digital identification.",
      "The idea of digital ID for all has long been backed by former Labour Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair and former Conservative leader William Hague.",
      "But the BBC understands the government has no plans to introduce mandatory digital ID.",
      "The letter said while the government had made \"great strides\" on digitising identification, \"the time has come for a more comprehensive programme\".",
      "\"The truth is we are moving to an era of digital ID,\" Jake Richards, one of the Labour MPs who signed the letter, told the BBC.",
      "\"The government knows this - and is bringing forward new developments with digital driving licences and passports, but we want them to move faster, to ensure the project is comprehensive and joined-up and, critically, bring the public with them.\"",
      "The group argues digital ID could help tackle \"illegal off-the-books employment\".",
      "The proposal falls short of the compulsory identity cards Sir Tony brought in when he was prime minister.",
      "The last Labour government started issuing the first ID cards to UK citizens and 15,000 were in circulation when the scheme was scrapped by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in 2011 and the database destroyed.",
      "Sir Tony has since suggested using digital ID to help control immigration so \"we know precisely who has a right to be here\".",
      "The government has focused on targeting people-smuggling gangs to bring down illegal migration, which is one of Labour's biggest challenges.",
      "The latest Home Office data show more than 5,000 migrants have crossed the English Channel in small boats so far this year.",
      "In the open letter, the Labour MPs said \"this government will only succeed if it is able to get a grip on illegal migration\".",
      "A key part of this, the letter said, \"must be tackling illegal off-the-books employment, which is a major draw for migrants entering our country unlawfully\".",
      "\"Digital ID would help counter these practices,\" the MPs said.",
      "Richards - the MP for Rother Valley - said the system for managing and tracking people who enter the country illegally was \"fraught with inefficiencies\".",
      "He added: \"Digital processing and some form of digital ID for those that arrive would help us control the system much more effectively.\"",
      "The letter also said digital ID could \"transform public services\" by making it easier to access the NHS, tailoring education and cracking down on benefits fraud.",
      "But the letter said any digital ID programme \"must be developed with care, respecting an individual's privacy\".",
      "The letter was signed by MPs from the Labour Growth Group, the Red Wall Group representing seats in the Midlands and north of England, and the socially conservative Blue Labour group. Many of them were elected for the first time last year.",
      "Polling by YouGov suggests there is strong support for the introduction of a system of national identity cards in the UK.",
      "Bur critics of such forms of ID have raised concerns about privacy, civil liberties and the collection of data by the state.",
      "An online wallet already allows users to store government-issued documents on their phones, and a digital driving licence is being launched this year.",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"We are committed to using technology to improve lives and transform public services.",
      "\"Digital identities offer a secure, efficient way for people to prove who they are without physical documents, reducing fraud and saving time.",
      "\"Trusted providers following government rules are already conducting hundreds of thousands of digital checks monthly, helping people access employment, housing, and vital services more quickly and easily, while boosting productivity, driving economic efficiency, and supporting long-term growth as part of our plan for change.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 13:27:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Countries break ten-year deadlock to agree measures to reduce commercial shipping emissions.",
    "story": [
      "Countries have agreed a global deal to tackle shipping emissions, after nearly ten years of negotiations.",
      "The agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.",
      "The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London \u2013 but it eventually passed on Friday.",
      "Small island states and environmental groups were angry that a blanket tax was not  agreed to and called the deal \"unfit for purpose\".",
      "Shipping agrees net-zero goal but critics unmoved",
      "Clean energy's share of world's electricity reaches 40%, report says",
      "Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.",
      "But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.",
      "The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.",
      "It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.",
      "Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.",
      "The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.",
      "Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.",
      "There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships.",
      "The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.",
      "\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment.",
      "\"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said.",
      "In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water atoms to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.",
      "Figures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce.",
      "\"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, program manager for sustainable transport at the Port of Rotterdam.",
      "Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped.",
      "\"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5\u00b0C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.",
      "Their disappointment was shared by environmental groups.",
      "\"This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach\", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition.",
      "It is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.",
      "But China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal.",
      "Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said that the deal was a compromise.",
      "\"It is a difficult set of decisions, but it is the first regulation of its kind and that is to be celebrated,\" he said.",
      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Fahnestock added it was unclear if the penalties were enough to close the cost gap between the fuel types.",
      "\"You may have incentivised shipowners to prepare a bit for the future fuels but whether the signal is strong enough to get the billions of dollars of investment into the production facilities for these fuels - I don't think these regulations will overcome that. I think more will need to be done,\" he said.",
      "Any money raised from the penalties will be put into a \"Net Zero\" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries.",
      "It is this \"redistribution\" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then \"reciprocal measures\" would be taken.",
      "Although the US move was at odds with its long-held position at the IMO, it was in keeping with President Trump's push back on climate action seen over the last few months - such as withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement.",
      "But industry and country delegates appeared unperturbed when speaking to the BBC on Wednesday and continued with negotiations.",
      "The US only flags 178 cargo ships that represent 0.57% of worldwide commercial shipping tonnage. So if it took the decision not to implement the new proposals it is unlikely to make a significant difference to the funds raised.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 23:13:02 GMT",
    "summary": "A unique study is tracking the development of hundreds of babies whose parents have also been studied since birth.",
    "story": [
      "Two-year-old Henry is completely transfixed by the iPad in front of him. Every time a smiley face appears he taps the screen - and his tap transforms the face into a cartoon of a dancing animal.",
      "It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.",
      "It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.",
      "Scientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain.",
      "The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.",
      "But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.",
      "A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.",
      "For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.",
      "\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"",
      "Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains.",
      "\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"",
      "During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.",
      "Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.",
      "\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"",
      "This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school.",
      "\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"",
      "In another room, Jackson, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.",
      "A research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jackson can keep all the stickers he finds.",
      "\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.",
      "\"These are what I call 'building blocks' of really important skills.\"",
      "The study will also assess language development and processing speed - a measure of how quickly children pick up new information.",
      "The Children of the 90s project is now 35 years old. Focused primarily on health, by tracking 14,500 children born between 1991 and 1992, it has revealed insights into obesity, autism and, more recently, the effect of the pandemic on mental health.",
      "The project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.",
      "One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.",
      "Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.",
      "And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.",
      "In this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.",
      "Emily, who was studied as a child of the 90s, is Henry's mum. Today, her young son sits on her lap as he works on one of the research team's carefully designed puzzles.",
      "\"We've both been a part of this since birth,\" Emily says. \"It wasn't a choice for me at the start - my mum signed me up. But it is now, and I just think it's fascinating.\"",
      "Helping children to thrive in the future is the aim, Dr Holmboe says. Because when children start school, she explains \"a lot of things are already set.",
      "\"This is the groundwork that will help us support children at the right time.\"",
      "Henry and Jackson finish their puzzles and games and take off their brain-scanning hats.",
      "\"My boys just love coming here,\" says Emily. \"They love all the toys - they get free snacks. So I'll continue coming just as long as they want to.",

    "summary": "The BBC finds evidence of fraud in the production of a \"green\" diesel meant to cut emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government is investigating a fast-growing \"green fuel\" called HVO diesel amid claims of significant fraud, the BBC has learned.",
      "HVO is increasingly popular as a transport fuel and for powering music festivals and its backers say it can curb carbon emissions by up to 90% as it can be made from waste materials like used cooking oil.",
      "But industry whistleblowers told the BBC they believe large amounts of these materials are not waste but instead are virgin palm oil, which is being fraudulently relabelled.",
      "And data analysed by the BBC and shared with the UK's Department for Transport casts further doubt on one of the key ingredients in HVO, a material called palm sludge waste.",
      "Europe used more of this waste in HVO and other biofuels in 2023 than it is thought possible for the world to produce.",
      "In response to the BBC's findings, the Department for Transport said they \"take the concerns raised seriously and are working with stakeholders and international partners to gather further information\".",
      "HVO, or hydrotreated vegetable oil, has been called something of a wonder-fuel in recent years as it can be used as 100% substitute for diesel reducing planet warming emissions.",
      "UK consumption rocketed from 8 million litres in 2019 to about 699 million litres in 2024, according to provisional government figures.",
      "Its green credentials rely heavily on the assumption that it is made from waste sources, particularly used cooking oil or the waste sludge from palm oil production.",
      "But industry whistle-blowers have told the BBC that they believe virgin palm oil and other non-waste materials are often being used instead.",
      "That would be bad news for the planet, as virgin palm oil is linked to increased tropical deforestation, which adds to climate change and threatening endangered species like orang-utans.",
      "This palm oil \"floods the market like cancer,\" one large European biofuel manufacturer told the BBC.",
      "They said that to stay in business they have to go along with the pretence that they are using waste materials.",
      "Another whistle-blower, a former trader of these biofuels, also speaking anonymously, gave the BBC his account of one recent case dealing with supposedly waste products.",
      "\"I believe that what I bought was multiple cargos of virgin palm oil that has been wrongly classified as palm oil sludge,\" they said.",
      "\"I called one of the board members and told them about the situation, and then I was told that they didn't want to do anything about it, because the evidence would be burned.\"",
      "As well as this testimony, data compiled by campaign group Transport & Environment and analysed by the BBC suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is probably able to produce.",
      "The figures show that the UK and EU used about two million tonnes of palm sludge waste for HVO and other biofuels in 2023, based on Eurostat and UK Department for Transport figures.",
      "EU imports of this sludge appear to have risen further in 2024, according to preliminary UN trade data, although the UK appears to have bucked this trend.",
      "But the data analysed by the BBC, which is based on well-established UN and industry statistics, suggests the world can only produce just over one million tonnes of palm sludge waste a year.",
      "This mismatch further suggests non-waste fuels such as  virgin palm oil are being used to meet Europe's rapid growth in biofuels, according to researchers and industry figures.",
      "\"It's a very easy game,\" said Dr Christian Bickert, a German farmer and editor with experience in biofuels, who believes that much of the HVO made with these waste products is \"fake\".",
      "\"Chemically, the sludge and the pure palm oil are absolutely the same because they come from the same plant, and also from the same production facilities in Indonesia,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"There's no paper which proves [the fraud], no paper at all, but the figures tell a clear story.\"",
      "Underpinning the sustainability claims of biofuels is an independent system of certification where producers have to show exactly where they get their raw materials from.",
      "It is mainly administered by a company called ISCC, and in Europe it has a long-standing reputation for ensuring that waste materials turned into fuel really do come from waste, by working with national authorities.",
      "But in Indonesia, Malaysia and China, three of the main sources of the raw ingredients claimed to be waste for HVO, supervision is much more difficult.",
      "\"ISCC is simply not allowed to send anybody to China,\" said Dr Christian Bickert.",
      "\"They have to rely on certification companies in China to check that everything is OK, but China doesn't allow any inspectors in from outside.\"",
      "This concern is echoed by several other groups contacted by the BBC.",
      "Construction giant Balfour Beatty, for example, has a policy of not using the fuel, citing sustainability concerns.",
      "\"We just are not able to get any level of visibility over the supply chain of HVO that would give us that level of assurance that this is truly a sustainable product,\" Balfour Beatty's Jo Gilroy told BBC News.",
      "The European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association represents the major biofuel manufacturers in the EU and UK.",
      "In a statement they said \"there is a major certification verification issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority\", adding that the \"ISCC should do much more to ensure that non-EU Biodiesel is really what it claims to be\".",
      "In the light of growing fraud allegations, the Irish authorities have recently restricted incentives for fuels made from palm waste.",
      "The BBC also understands that the EU is about to propose a ban on ISCC certification of waste biofuels for two-and-a-half years, although it is expected to say it is not aware of direct breaches of renewable goals.",
      "It would then be up to individual member countries to decide whether to accept certifications.",

      "The scan provides a new view of a boiler room, confirming eye-witness accounts that engineers worked right to the end to keep the ship's lights on.",
      "And a computer simulation also suggests that punctures in the hull the size of A4 pieces of paper led to the ship's demise.",

      "More than 700,000 images, taken from every angle, were used to create the \"digital twin\", which was revealed exclusively to the world by BBC News in 2023.",
      "Because the wreck is so large and lies in the gloom of the deep, exploring it with submersibles only shows tantalising snapshots. The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.",
      "The immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.",
      "But sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.",

      "\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"",
      "The scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.",
      "Experts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.",
      "Passengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.",
      "The digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.",
      "Lying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.",
      "This would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on.",
      "All died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson.",

      "A new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.",
      "It takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.",
      "\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.",
      "The simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.",
      "Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded.",
      "But the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.",
      "\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.",
      "\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"",

      "The agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.",
      "The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London \u2013 but it eventually passed on Friday.",

      "Shipping agrees net-zero goal but critics unmoved",
      "Clean energy's share of world's electricity reaches 40%, report says",
      "Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.",
      "But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.",
      "The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.",
      "It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.",
      "Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.",
      "The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.",
      "Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.",
      "There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships.",
      "The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.",
      "\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment.",
      "\"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said.",
      "In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water atoms to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.",
      "Figures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce.",
      "\"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, program manager for sustainable transport at the Port of Rotterdam.",
      "Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped.",
      "\"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5\u00b0C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.",
      "Their disappointment was shared by environmental groups.",
      "\"This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach\", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition.",
      "It is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.",
      "But China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal.",

I think more will need to be done,\" he said.",
      "Any money raised from the penalties will be put into a \"Net Zero\" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries.",
      "It is this \"redistribution\" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then \"reciprocal measures\" would be taken.",

      "The UK government is investigating a fast-growing \"green fuel\" called HVO diesel amid claims of significant fraud, the BBC has learned.",
      "HVO is increasingly popular as a transport fuel and for powering music festivals and its backers say it can curb carbon emissions by up to 90% as it can be made from waste materials like used cooking oil.",
      "But industry whistleblowers told the BBC they believe large amounts of these materials are not waste but instead are virgin palm oil, which is being fraudulently relabelled.",
      "And data analysed by the BBC and shared with the UK's Department for Transport casts further doubt on one of the key ingredients in HVO, a material called palm sludge waste.",
      "Europe used more of this waste in HVO and other biofuels in 2023 than it is thought possible for the world to produce.",
      "In response to the BBC's findings, the Department for Transport said they \"take the concerns raised seriously and are working with stakeholders and international partners to gather further information\".",
      "HVO, or hydrotreated vegetable oil, has been called something of a wonder-fuel in recent years as it can be used as 100% substitute for diesel reducing planet warming emissions.",
      "UK consumption rocketed from 8 million litres in 2019 to about 699 million litres in 2024, according to provisional government figures.",
      "Its green credentials rely heavily on the assumption that it is made from waste sources, particularly used cooking oil or the waste sludge from palm oil production.",
      "But industry whistle-blowers have told the BBC that they believe virgin palm oil and other non-waste materials are often being used instead.",
      "That would be bad news for the planet, as virgin palm oil is linked to increased tropical deforestation, which adds to climate change and threatening endangered species like orang-utans.",
      "This palm oil \"floods the market like cancer,\" one large European biofuel manufacturer told the BBC.",
      "They said that to stay in business they have to go along with the pretence that they are using waste materials.",
      "Another whistle-blower, a former trader of these biofuels, also speaking anonymously, gave the BBC his account of one recent case dealing with supposedly waste products.",
      "\"I believe that what I bought was multiple cargos of virgin palm oil that has been wrongly classified as palm oil sludge,\" they said.",
      "\"I called one of the board members and told them about the situation, and then I was told that they didn't want to do anything about it, because the evidence would be burned.\"",
      "As well as this testimony, data compiled by campaign group Transport & Environment and analysed by the BBC suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is probably able to produce.",
      "The figures show that the UK and EU used about two million tonnes of palm sludge waste for HVO and other biofuels in 2023, based on Eurostat and UK Department for Transport figures.",
      "EU imports of this sludge appear to have risen further in 2024, according to preliminary UN trade data, although the UK appears to have bucked this trend.",
      "But the data analysed by the BBC, which is based on well-established UN and industry statistics, suggests the world can only produce just over one million tonnes of palm sludge waste a year.",
      "This mismatch further suggests non-waste fuels such as  virgin palm oil are being used to meet Europe's rapid growth in biofuels, according to researchers and industry figures.",
      "\"It's a very easy game,\" said Dr Christian Bickert, a German farmer and editor with experience in biofuels, who believes that much of the HVO made with these waste products is \"fake\".",
      "\"Chemically, the sludge and the pure palm oil are absolutely the same because they come from the same plant, and also from the same production facilities in Indonesia,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"There's no paper which proves [the fraud], no paper at all, but the figures tell a clear story.\"",
      "Underpinning the sustainability claims of biofuels is an independent system of certification where producers have to show exactly where they get their raw materials from.",
      "It is mainly administered by a company called ISCC, and in Europe it has a long-standing reputation for ensuring that waste materials turned into fuel really do come from waste, by working with national authorities.",
      "But in Indonesia, Malaysia and China, three of the main sources of the raw ingredients claimed to be waste for HVO, supervision is much more difficult.",
      "\"ISCC is simply not allowed to send anybody to China,\" said Dr Christian Bickert.",
      "\"They have to rely on certification companies in China to check that everything is OK, but China doesn't allow any inspectors in from outside.\"",
      "This concern is echoed by several other groups contacted by the BBC.",
      "Construction giant Balfour Beatty, for example, has a policy of not using the fuel, citing sustainability concerns.",
      "\"We just are not able to get any level of visibility over the supply chain of HVO that would give us that level of assurance that this is truly a sustainable product,\" Balfour Beatty's Jo Gilroy told BBC News.",
      "The European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association represents the major biofuel manufacturers in the EU and UK.",
      "In a statement they said \"there is a major certification verification issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority\", adding that the \"ISCC should do much more to ensure that non-EU Biodiesel is really what it claims to be\".",
      "In the light of growing fraud allegations, the Irish authorities have recently restricted incentives for fuels made from palm waste.",
      "The BBC also understands that the EU is about to propose a ban on ISCC certification of waste biofuels for two-and-a-half years, although it is expected to say it is not aware of direct breaches of renewable goals.",
      "It would then be up to individual member countries to decide whether to accept certifications.",
      "In response, the ISCC said it was \"more than surprised\" by the EU's move, adding that it had been \"a frontrunner in implementing the most strict and effective measures to ensure integrity and fraud prevention in the market for years\".",

    "story": [
      "A detailed analysis of a full-sized digital scan of the Titanic has revealed new insight into the doomed liner's final hours.",
      "The exact 3D replica shows the violence of how the ship ripped in two as it sank after hitting an iceberg in 1912 - 1,500 people lost their lives in the disaster.",
      "The scan provides a new view of a boiler room, confirming eye-witness accounts that engineers worked right to the end to keep the ship's lights on.",
      "And a computer simulation also suggests that punctures in the hull the size of A4 pieces of paper led to the ship's demise.",
      "\"Titanic is the last surviving eyewitness to the disaster, and she still has stories to tell,\" said Parks Stephenson, a Titanic analyst.",
      "The scan has been studied for a new documentary by National Geographic and Atlantic Productions called Titanic: The Digital Resurrection.",
      "Rarely seen Titanic artefacts kept in secret warehouse",
      "Scans of Titanic reveal wreck as never seen before",
      "The wreck, which lies 3,800m down in the icy waters of the Atlantic, was mapped using underwater robots.",
      "More than 700,000 images, taken from every angle, were used to create the \"digital twin\", which was revealed exclusively to the world by BBC News in 2023.",
      "Because the wreck is so large and lies in the gloom of the deep, exploring it with submersibles only shows tantalising snapshots. The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.",
      "The immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.",
      "But sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.",
      "The new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.",
      "\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"",
      "The scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.",
      "Experts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.",
      "Passengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.",
      "The digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.",
      "Lying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.",
      "This would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on.",
      "All died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"They kept the lights and the power working to the end, to give the crew time to launch the lifeboats safely with some light instead of in absolute darkness,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern.\"",
      "A new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.",
      "It takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.",
      "\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.",
      "The simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.",
      "Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded.",
      "But the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.",
      "\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.",
      "\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"",
      "Unfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.",
      "The human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.",
      "Personal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.",
      "The scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.",
      "\"She's only giving her stories to us a little bit at a time,\" said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"Every time, she leaves us wanting for more.\""

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 16:37:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Some analysts say that if costs incurred by tariffs pass to consumers, US iPhone prices could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
    "story": [
      "The world's most popular gadgets - phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches - could be about to get a lot more expensive in the US.",
      "Many of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy.",
      "The effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
      "And if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops.",
      "Ben Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched.",
      "\"It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,\" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US.",
      "Though others say they believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK.",
      "And there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device.",
      "While a phone contract may typically last two years, Mr Wood said some firms already offer four year deals, and he believed \"we might see five-year contracts\" in 2025.",
      "\"One could argue it is almost like having a mortgage for your smartphone,\" he said.",
      "Where are iPhones made?",
      "The US is a major market for iPhones and Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research.",
      "It says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India.",
      "Along with fellow smartphone giants such as Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China in recent years.",
      "India and Vietnam emerged as frontrunners for additional manufacturing hubs.",
      "As tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days.",
      "Reuters reported on Thursday that Apple chartered cargo flights to ship more than 600 tons of iPhones from India to the US.",
      "Amid Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs, including those levied on India, the country may be set to benefit from an iPhone manufacturing boost.",
      "The BBC has approached Apple for comment on the impact of tariffs on their operations and prices, but has not had any response yet.",
      "How exposed is Apple to tariffs?",
      "Trump and his advisors have said the aim of its tariffs are to encourage more US manufacturing.",
      "However, the tech industry relies on a global network of suppliers for product components and assembly.",
      "This, and finding skilled workers to match the fast pace and low cost of production in Asia, means relocating supply chains is no simple feat.",
      "Apple committed a $500bn (\u00a3385bn) investment in the US in February - which the Trump administration believes will result in more homegrown manufacturing.",
      "But Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said shifting parts of its supply chain from cheaper manufacturing hubs in Asia to the US will take a lot of time, and money.",

      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Will iPhone prices go up?",
      "Apple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices.",
      "Some analysts believe Apple is in a more fortunate position than others, having reaped more money from its products than it has spent on making them.",
      "\"As a company with lucrative margins on its devices, Apple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\" says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.",
      "But he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash.",
      "\"The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors.\"",
      "Some estimates suggest iPhone prices in the US could as much as triple if costs were passed to consumers.",
      "Following Trump's tariff increase on China to 125%, the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage would have surged from $1,199 to $1,999, according to estimates by investment banking firm UBS.",
      "They estimate a less significant increase on the iPhone 16 Pro 128GB storage - which is made in India - by five percent from $999 to $1046.",

      "What can consumers do about it?",
      "There's still plenty of uncertainty about what happens next, and how companies like Apple will respond to tariffs remains to be seen.",

      "The iPhone remains one of the most expensive smartphones on the market - and brands such as Google and Samsung offer phones with similar features at a lower cost.",
      "The other option, and perhaps the most cost-effective, could be for people to skip upgrades to newer iPhone models and look to slightly older, cheaper versions.",

      "So when it made a big investment in India's market, the footwear industry took note.",
      "Hong Fu is currently building a giant plant in Panapakkam, in the state of Tamil Nadu in south eastern India. When fully operational, some time in the next three to five years, it will make 25 million pairs of shoes a year, employing as many as 25,000 workers.",
      "The project has Indian partners, including Aqeel Panaruna, the chairman of Florence Shoe Company: \"The international market is saturated and they [Hong Fu] were looking for a new market,\" he explains.",
      "\"There is a drastic increase in non-leather footwear in India. It has huge potential,\" Mr Panaruna added.",
      "The Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports.",
      "To spur the industry, last August the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced new quality rules for all shoes sold in India.",
      "Under those standards, for example, materials will have to pass tests of strength and flexibility.",
      "\"These BIS standards are really about cleaning up the market. We've had too many low-quality products flooding in, and consumers deserve better,\" says Sandeep Sharma a journalist and footwear industry expert.",

      "\"Many consumers, especially in rural and lower-income urban areas, opt for cheaper local footwear instead of branded options,\" he says.",
      "\"Many organised brands struggle to expand their retail footprint in semi-urban and rural areas because we cater to them.\"",
      "So how will the new government standards affect makers like Ashok?",
      "\"It's complicated,\" says Mr Sharma.",
      "\"I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can't just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide.",
      "\"What I'm seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They're pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It's not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold.\"",
      "Making the situation more complicated is that the unorganised sector is well-known for making counterfeit shoes of big brands.",
      "While popular among Indian shoppers looking for a stylish bargain, other countries have long-complained about the losses caused.",

      "Change is coming to the footwear sector he says. \"The shift to high value is now happening.\"",
      "\"Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,\" he adds.",
      "Back in Agra, Ashok hopes that the unorganised sector is not neglected amid the growth of India's footwear industry.",
      "\"The government should give us accreditation and certificates so our factories don't close down. Once we too are included in the organised sector no one can beat India in the shoe manufacturing industry.\"",
      "But Mr Sharma says change is inevitable.",

    "summary": "The Israeli defence minister says the military is leaving Gaza \"smaller\" and \"more isolated\" to press Hamas into releasing hostages.",
    "story": [
      "Israel's defence minister has said it will expand its so-called \"security zones\" in Gaza to include the southern city of Rafah.",
      "During a visit to the area, Israel Katz said the military was leaving Gaza \"smaller\" and \"more isolated\" to pressure Hamas into releasing the hostages it is still holding.",
      "The military has already seized land running along the entirety of the Palestinian territory's borders, which it has characterised as a buffer zone to prevent attacks.",
      "The expansion to cover Rafah and its surrounding areas - which make up almost one fifth of Gaza - comes after the military ordered civilians to evacuate and established a new corridor separating them from nearby Khan Younis.",
      "Two-thirds of Gaza has been designated as \"no-go\" zones or placed under evacuation orders since Israel resumed its offensive against Hamas on 18 March following the collapse of a two-month ceasefire, according to the UN.",
      "It says 390,000 Palestinians \u2013 almost a fifth of the 2.1 million population - have been displaced once again, with no safe place to go.",
      "The UN is also warning that supplies of food, medicine and fuel have run out because Israel blocked deliveries of humanitarian aid to Gaza since 2 March.",
      "Israel's PM rejects criticism of Gaza war by air force reservists",
      "'Part of us is still in Gaza': Freed Israeli hostages fight for a new ceasefire",
      "Israeli army fired more than 100 shots in Gaza medics' killing, audio suggests",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a ground offensive in Rafah - home to about 280,000 people before the war - last May, leaving large parts of the city in ruins.",
      "It also seized a strategically important strip of land running along the nearby border with Egypt, known as the \"Philadelphi Corridor\", which it said was necessary to prevent weapons being smuggled into Gaza and Hamas rearming.",
      "During the ceasefire that began in January, about 100,000 residents returned to what was left of their homes in the city after troops pulled back to border areas.",
      "On 31 March, almost two weeks after the resumption of the war, the IDF issued a new sweeping evacuation order that the UN said covered 97% of Rafah and its surrounding governorate, spanning 64 sq km (25 sq miles).",
      "Displaced people were told to head to tent camps in the coastal al-Mawasi area, which the IDF previously designated as a \"humanitarian zone\".",
      "The Rafah area was reported to be almost completely empty when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced three days later that troops were \"seizing the Morag Corridor\" - a reference to a former Jewish settlement located between Rafah and Khan Younis.",
      "He said it would be \"the second Philadelphi\" and would increase pressure on Hamas to hand over the remaining 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "On Wednesday, Defence Minister Israel Katz visited troops deployed in the new corridor with senior Israeli commanders and journalists.",
      "\"The IDF is eliminating terrorists, locating and thwarting terrorist infrastructure, and dismembering the Gaza Strip, even in places like the Morag corridor, where we have not operated to date,\" he said in a video later released by his office.",
      "\"The population of Gaza is being evacuated from the fighting zones, and many areas are being seized and added to the security zones of the State of Israel, leaving Gaza smaller and isolated.\"",
      "Katz also warned that \"if Hamas continues to refuse and does not release the hostages soon, the IDF will carry out intense military operations across all of Gaza\".",
      "His spokesman confirmed to the BBC that Katz had told the Israeli website Ynet that \"all of Rafah will be evacuated and turned into a security area\".",
      "The BBC has also asked the IDF for comment.",
      "On Thursday morning, it said troops were continuing to operate \"in the area of Rafah and along the Morag corridor\", and that they had \"eliminated several terrorists, located and dismantled terrorist infrastructure sites\" while working to \"establish operational control\".",
      "Israeli military analysts suggest there is a plan to push Palestinian civilians towards the coast so that Israeli forces can focus on eliminating Hamas in urban areas.",
      "According to local media, this strategy would also allow the IDF to take control of the delivery of aid to the coast - bypassing both Hamas and international aid agencies.",
      "On Tuesday, the UN said the IDF had issued 15 evacuation orders over the past three weeks, covering almost 131 sq km (51 sq miles), or 36% of Gaza.",
      "Another 30% of the territory was covered by the Israeli-designated \"no-go\" zone along Gaza's borders, and along the Wadi Gaza river valley that separates the north and south of the territory, it added.",
      "The UN human rights office warned last month that the evacuation orders failed to comply with the requirements of international law, accusing Israel of not taking any measures to provide accommodation for those affected or ensuring satisfactory hygiene, health, safety and nutrition conditions.",
      "Israel's government said it was evacuating civilians to protect them from harm and from being used by Hamas as \"human shields\" in violation of international law.",
      "The UN has also said that Israel's five-week blockade of Gaza violates international law, which requires it to ensure the basic needs of the civilian population under its control are met and allow the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian assistance.",
      "In a separate development on Thursday, the IDF announced that an strike in eastern Gaza City on Wednesday had killed the commander of Hamas's Shejaiya battalion, whom it identified as Haitham Sheikh Khalil and said had been planning attacks from the area.",
      "A local hospital said the attack, which destroyed a four-storey building, killed at least 29 people, including children.",
      "The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",
      "More than 50,912 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

    "story": [
      "Zimbabwe's government has announced an initial pay-out of US$3m (\u00a32.3m) to white farmers whose farms were seized under a controversial government programme more than two decades ago.",
      "It is the first payment to be made under the 2020 compensation agreement signed between the state and the local white farmers in which Zimbabwe committed to pay $3.5bn (\u00a32.6bn) for seized farmland.",
      "Thousands of white farmers were forced from their land, often violently, between 2000 and 2001.",
      "The seizures were meant to redress colonial-era land grabs but contributed to the country's economic decline and ruined relations with the West.",
      "The payment announced on Wednesday will\u00a0cover the first 378 farms, out of a total of 740, for which compensation had been approved.",
      "It represents 1% of the total $311m allocated for the first batch of payments.",
      "The remainder will be paid through US-dollar denominated Treasury bonds, said Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube.",
      "\"One of our commitments as we try to reform the Zimbabwe economy, to clear our arrears, is really to compensate the former farm owners who lost their farms during the land reform programme,\" he said.",

      "The government has only agreed to compensate former farm owners for \"improvements\" made on the land and refused to pay for the land itself, arguing it was unfairly seized by colonialists.",

      "In 1980, Zimbabwe gained independence, ending decades of white-minority rule. At that time, most of the country's most fertile land was owned by some 4,000 white farmers.",
      "Land reform was focused on redistributing white-owned land to black farmers, following colonial-era policies when thousands of black farmers were forced from their land and the country's most fertile areas were reserved for white people.",

      "A tattoo belonging to a man from Derbyshire has appeared in a US government document used to identify members of a notorious Venezuelan gang - despite the man having no connection to the group.",
      "Pete Belton, 44, from Ilkeston says he was shocked to find his forearm featured in a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) document used to help identify alleged members of Tren de Aragua (TdA), a transnational criminal organisation.",
      "\"I'm just an average middle-aged man from Derbyshire,\" he told BBC Verify.",
      "Mr Belton said it was a \"bit strange, bit funny at first\" but is now worried the family trip he booked to Miami with his wife and daughter in August might end up \"being a six month all-inclusive holiday to Guantanamo\".",
      "The Trump administration has already deported hundreds of alleged gang members to a high-security jail in El Salvador. Lawyers for some of those deportees say they have been incorrectly identified as TdA members based on their tattoos.",
      "Mr Belton's tattoo - a clock face with the date and time of his daughter's birth - was included in a set of nine images for \"detecting and identifying\" TdA members. Other tattoos featured stars, crowns and a Michael Jordan \"jumpman\" logo.",
      "\"Open source material has depicted TdA members with a combination of the below tattoos,\" states the document which appeared in court filings.",
      "But reverse image searches show that several of the pictures first appeared on tattoo websites with no obvious links to Venezuela or TdA.",

      "The tattoo image in the DHS document is worse quality than the Instagram post, which was shared in 2016, but it is clearly the same arm and features the same clock face tattoo.",
      "The same image of Mr Belton's tattoo also appeared in a September 2024 report by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) about TdA activity.",
      "BBC Verify contacted both the US DHS and the Texas DPS about the source of the images, but did not receive a response.",
      "But in an email the DHS said it was confident in its law enforcement's intelligence and that its \"assessments go well beyond just gang affiliate tattoos and social media.\"",
      "It's unclear exactly how Mr Belton's tattoo ended up in the US documents, but he's worried about being linked to the gang.",
      "\"In my head I'm thinking if I'm working in border force and I saw me walking through I'd think 'hey up we've got one, he's the one in the document'.\"",
      "He provided multiple images of the tattoo to prove that it's his - and he says that he has no association to the Venezuelan group.",
      "The US government hasn't deported anyone based on their tattoos alone, according to comments from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official in a court filing last month.",
      "However, court documents show immigration officials are employing a points-based system known as the \"Alien Enemy Validation Guide\" to determine if someone is linked to the Venezuelan gang.",
      "It includes a scorecard, and according to the document, eight points across a number of categories could be grounds for arrest or deportation.",
      "Half of these points can be given if a \"subject has tattoos denoting membership or loyalty to TdA\".",
      "The document says if all eight points come from the symbolism category, which includes tattoos, then further consultation should be taken before designating someone as a member of TdA.",
      "Venezuelan investigative journalist Ronna Risquez, who wrote a book on TdA's origins, said tattoos alone are not evidence of membership.",
      "\"TdA does not have tattoos that identifies the gang,\" she said.",
      "\"To confirm whether a person is a member of TdA, authorities must conduct a police investigation to determine whether they have a criminal record. A tattoo, their clothing, or their nationality are not proof.\"",
      "However, there have been cases where lawyers have argued that people have been wrongfully identified based on their tattoos and were subsequently deported.",
      "US media have reported on a man whose lawyers say was deported because of a crown tattoo which was inspired by the Real Madrid football club logo.",
      "Another case saw a makeup artist sent to El Salvador after his a crown tattoo with the words \"mum\" and \"dad\" was used by US officials as evidence for gang membership, according to his attorneys.",
      "Back in Derbyshire, Mr Belton says his family have considered cancelling their trip to the US due to the potential risks, but they are going to monitor how the story develops.",
      "\"Hopefully now they'd realise I'm not a Venezuelan gangster but I've seen crazier things happen in the news recently, so we're just going to wait and see.\"",

      "Among those backing it was Ruth Richardson, a former finance minister for the centre-right National Party, who told the select committee that the proposed legislation was \"a bill of consequence whose time has come\".",

      "She added that the bill \"polluted\" the idea of all New Zealanders having a future together.",
      "\"We will continue to show our opposition to this,\" she said.",
      "Key issues identified by members of the public who made submissions to the select committee included that it was inconsistent with the values of the Treaty, and that it had promoted equality with equity - not taking into account social disparities, such as those created by the legacy of colonisation.",
      "There were also concerns about the extent to which the bill complied with international law, and whether it would negatively impact New Zealand's reputation internationally.",
      "Submitters who supported the bill, meanwhile, referred to a current lack of clarity and certainty about the principles of the Treaty, and of the importance of equality for all.",
      "They also said that it was important to hold a referendum to facilitate a national conversation around the Treaty - something David Seymour believes is still needed.",
      "The Treaty Principles Bill passed its first reading in November, with support from National - the dominant party in New Zealand's ruling coalition - who had promised to back it as part of a coalition agreement with Act, but not any further.",
      "Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who is also leader of the National Party, previously said there was nothing in the bill that he liked. He was not in parliament for its second reading, but remarked earlier in the day that it was time to move on from it.",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 04:01:05 GMT",
    "summary": "The president made a partial reversal this week - here's a look at where it leaves five of his key ambitions.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump announced a massive tariff plan last week that would have upended the global economic order as well as long-established trading relationships with America's allies.",
      "But that plan - or at least a significant part of it - is on ice after the president suspended higher tariffs on most countries for 90 days while leaning into a trade war with China.",
      "So with this partial reversal, is Trump any closer to realising his goals on trade? Here's a quick look at five of his key ambitions and where they now stand.",
      "1) Better trade deals",
      "WHAT TRUMP SAID: For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike",
      "Trump's original trade plan packed a big punch that landed around the world, with a flat 10% baseline tariff on everyone (including some uninhabited islands) and additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on the 60 countries that he said were the worst offenders.",
      "It sent allies and adversaries scrambling, as they stared down the prospect of a debilitating blow to their economies.",
      "The White House has been quick to boast about all the world leaders who have reached out to the president to make deals and offer trade concessions \u2013 \"more than 75\", according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "Although the administration hasn't released a list of all the countries that Trump said on Tuesday were \"kissing my ass\" and promising to do anything, the US has announced it is in negotiations with South Korea and Japan, among others.",
      "THE TAKEAWAY: America's trading partners have 90 days to strike some sort of agreement with Trump, and the clock is ticking. But the fact that talks are happening indicates that the president has a good chance of getting something for his efforts.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?What does the tariff pause mean for global trade?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What does the tariff pause mean for global trade?",
      "2) Boosting American industry",
      "WHAT TRUMP SAID: Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country\u2026We will supercharge our domestic industrial base.",
      "Trump has said for decades that tariffs are an effective way of rebuilding America's manufacturing base by shielding it from unfair foreign competition. While some factories may be able to increase production in current facilities, more substantive efforts take time. And for business leaders to pull the trigger on \"reshoring\" their production lines and investing in new US factories, they will want to know that the rules of the game are relatively stable.",
      "The president's on-again, off-again tariff moves over the past week are inherently unstable, however. For the moment, it's difficult to predict where the final tariff levels will land and which industries will receive the greatest protections. It could be car manufacturers and steel producers today, and high-tech electronics companies tomorrow.",
      "THE TAKEAWAY: When tariffs are applied and removed seemingly at the president's whim, it's much more likely that companies \u2013 both in the US and abroad \u2013 will hunker down and wait for the dust to settle before making any big commitments.",
      "3) Facing off with China",
      "WHAT TRUMP SAID: I have great respect for President Xi of China, great respect for China, but they were taking tremendous advantage of us.",
      "After Trump's tariff about-face on Wednesday, several White House officials \u2013 including Treasury Secretary Bessent - were quick to say that Trump's goal was to drop the hammer on the real villain, China.",
      "\"They are the biggest source of the US trade problems,\" Bessent told reporters, \"and indeed they are the problem for the rest of the world.",
      "If Trump wanted a battle of wills with China, testing each side's tolerance for economic and political pain, he got one \u2013 even if the president and his aides have hinted that they are looking for an exit ramp.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump said that he blamed past US leaders, not China, for the current trade dispute. The prior day, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president would be \"incredibly gracious\" if China reaches out to make a deal.",
      "THE TAKEAWAY: Even if this showdown is one Trump wants, picking a fight with the second-largest economy in the world, with military power to match, comes at enormous risk. And along the way America may have alienated the allies it needs most in such a confrontation.",
      "Why Trump is hitting China - and what might happen next",
      "Why Trump is hitting China - and what might happen next",
      "4) Raising revenue",
      "WHAT TRUMP SAID: Now it's our turn to prosper, and in so doing, use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt, and it'll all happen very quickly.",
      "During last year's presidential campaign, Trump regularly touted that his proposed tariffs would bring in vast sums in new revenue, which the US could then use to shrink its budget deficit, fund tax cuts and pay for new government programmes.",
      "A study last year by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimated that a 10% universal tariff \u2013 which is what Trump has landed on for at least the next 90 days \u2013 would generate $2tn in new revenue over the next 10 years.",
      "To put that in context, the tax cuts Congress recently included in its non-binding budget blueprint would cost approximately $5tn over the next 10 years, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.",
      "THE TAKEAWAY: Trump wanted more tariff revenue, and if he sticks with his baseline tariffs, plus the additional levies on certain imports and larger ones on China, he's going to get it \u2013 at least until Americans switch to more domestic production, when the tariff money gusher could turn to a trickle.",
      "Is the US making $2bn a day from tariffs?",
      "Is the US making $2bn a day from tariffs?",
      "5) Lower prices for US consumers",
      "WHAT TRUMP SAID: Ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers. This will be indeed the golden age of America.",
      "Analysts and experts have offered a grab bag of other explanations about why Trump made such an aggressive move on trade last week. Was he trying to drive down interest rates, or devalue the US dollar or bring the world to the table for a new, global agreement on trade? The president himself hasn't spoken much about those kinds of elaborate schemes.",
      "One thing he has talked about relentlessly, however, is his desire to lower costs for American consumers - and he has promised that his trade policy will help address this. While energy prices dipped in the week since Trump announced his tariff plan, that may have been a result of fears that the trade wars could trigger a global recession.",
      "The consensus among economists is that new tariffs will drive up consumer prices, as tariffs are tacked on to the price of imports and, eventually, when there is less competition for US-made products. Last year, the Tax Foundation estimated that a 10% universal tariff would increase costs for American households by an average of $1,253 in its first year. Economists also warn that lower-income Americans will be hardest hit.",
      "THE TAKEAWAY: An increase in prices is an arrow moving in the wrong direction \u2013 and it represents an enormous potential liability for both Trump's political standing and his party's future electoral prospects.",

    "summary": "Australia's housing crisis has hit its worst point in decades, becoming a key issue in the upcoming election.",
    "story": [
      "Buying or renting a home has become unaffordable for the average Australian, driven by a perfect storm of astronomical house prices, relentless rental increases and a lack of social housing.",
      "With less than a month until the federal election, housing remains among the top issues for voters, and the country's two major parties \u2013 the Labor Party and the Liberal-National Coalition - have both pledged to tackle the crisis in a range of ways.",
      "Australians are already struggling under cost-of-living pressures and bracing for the effects of Donald Trump's global tariff war. And it remains to be seen whether either party will sway voters with their promise of restoring the Australian dream.",
      "Why are house prices in Australia so high?",
      "Simply put, Australia has not been building enough homes to meet the demands of its rapidly growing population, creating a scarcity that makes any available home more expensive to buy or rent.",
      "Compounding the issue are Australia's restrictive planning laws, which prevent homes being built where most people want to live, such as in major cities.",
      "Red tape means that popular metropolitan areas like Melbourne and Sydney are far less dense than comparably sized cities around the world.",
      "The steady decline of public housing and ballooning waitlists have made matters worse, tipping people into homelessness or overcrowded living conditions.",
      "Climate change has also made many areas increasingly unliveable, with natural disasters such as bushfires and severe storms destroying large swathes of properties.",
      "Meanwhile, decades of government policies have commercialised property ownership. So the ideal of owning a home, once seen as a right in Australia, has turned into an investment opportunity.",
      "How much do I need to buy or rent a home in Australia?",
      "In short: it depends where you live.",
      "Sydney is currently the second least affordable city in the world to buy a property, according to a 2023 Demographia International Housing Affordability survey.",
      "The latest data from property analytics company CoreLogic shows the average Sydney home costs almost A$1.2m (\u00a3570,294, $742,026).",
      "Across the nation's capital cities, the combined average house price sits at just over A$900,000.",
      "House prices in Australia overall have also jumped 39.1% in the last five years - and wages have failed to keep up.",
      "It now takes the average prospective homeowner around 10 years to save the 20% deposit usually required to buy an average home, according to a 2024 State of the Housing System report.",
      "The rental market has provided little relief, with rents increasing by 36.1% nationally since the onset of Covid - an equivalent rise of A$171 per week.",
      "Sydney topped the charts with a median weekly rent of A$773, according to CoreLogic's latest rental review. Perth came in second with average rents at A$695 per week, followed by Canberra at A$667 per week.",
      "Are immigration and foreign buyers causing housing strain?",
      "Immigration and foreign property purchases are often cited as causes for Australia's housing crisis. But experts say that they are not significant contributors  statistically.",
      "Many people who move to Australia are temporary migrants, such as international students who live in dedicated student accommodation rather than entering the housing market, according to Michael Fotheringham, head of the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute.",
      "\"The impact [of migrants] on the housing market is not as profound as some commentators have suggested,\" Mr Fotheringham tells the BBC.",

      "The year the Australian Dream died",
      "How Australia is becoming more unliveable",
      "The latest data released by the Australian Taxation Office supports this, with homes purchased by foreign buyers in 2022-23 representing less than one percent of all sales.",
      "\"It's already very difficult for foreigners to purchase homes under existing foreign investment rules. They are subject to a wide range of taxes, particularly in some states,\" Mr Coates explains.",
      "What have Australia's major parties promised?",
      "Labor and the Coalition have both promised to invest in building more homes \u2013 with Labor offering 1.2 million by 2029, and the Coalition vowing to unlock 500,000.",
      "Labor announced a A$33bn housing investment plan in their latest budget, which pledges to help first-time homebuyers purchase properties with smaller deposits through shared-equity loans.",
      "They have also promised to create more social housing and subsidies to help low-to-moderate-income earners own and rent more affordably.",
      "Central to the Coalition's housing affordability policy is cutting migration, reducing the number of international students and implementing a two-year ban on foreign investment in existing properties.",
      "Additionally, they have promised a A$5bn boost to infrastructure to support local councils by paying for water, power and sewerage at housing development sites.",
      "The Greens' policies, meanwhile, have focused on alleviating pressures on renters by calling for national rent freezes and caps.",
      "They have also said that in the event of a minority government, they will be pushing to reform tax incentives for investors.",
      "What are the experts saying about each party's policies?",
      "In short, experts say that while both Labor and the Coalition's policies are steps in the right direction, neither are sufficient to solve the housing problem.",
      "\"A combination of both parties' platforms would be better than what we're seeing from either side individually,\" Mr Coates tells the BBC.",
      "A 2025 State of the Land report by the Urban Development Institute of Australia says the federal government will fail to meet its target of 1.2 million new homes by 2029 \u2013 falling short by almost 400,000.",
      "The Coalition's focus on reducing immigration, meanwhile, will only make housing marginally cheaper while making Australia poorer in the long-term, according to Mr Coates.",
      "The cuts to migration will mean fewer skilled migrants, he explains, and the loss of revenue from those migrants will result in higher taxes for Australians.",
      "Decades of underinvestment in social housing also means demand in that area is massively outstripping supply - which at 4% of housing stock is significantly lower than many other countries, according to Mr Fotheringham.",
      "There's also concern about grants for first homebuyers, which drive prices up further.",
      "While commending the fact that these issues are finally being treated seriously, Mr Fotheringham believes it will take years to drag Australia out of a housing crisis that has been building for decades.",

      "Hezbollah, which is banned as a terrorist organisation in many countries but in Lebanon is a political and social movement as well as a paramilitary force, has given those who lost their homes $12,000 for a year's rent and has offered to cover the costs of repairs to apartments. However, schools and other institutions have not received any aid.",

    "story": [
      "When F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote \"The Great Gatsby\" at the height of the roaring '20s, he couldn't possibly realize that the book would emerge as one of the very top contenders for \"the great American novel.\"",
      "In fact, when Fitzgerald \u2013 a St. Paul, Minnesota native whose debut novel \"This Side of Paradise\" launched him into national prominence at the age of 24 \u2013 died in 1940 at the early age of 44, the book was already in danger of falling into obscurity.",
      "Now, 100 years after the book's first publication on April 10, 1925, it endures as one of the country's foremost tales of American hubris, modern yearning and class consciousness. And its clear-eyed assessment of the attainability of the American dream remains incisive with each passing decade.",
      "Fitzgerald's book, long a staple in high school literature classes, tells the story of Nick Carraway, a Midwesterner (and veiled Fitzgerald stand-in) who becomes enamored with the bon vivant, Jazz Age lifestyle on Long Island, specifically the effects of mutli-millioniare Jay Gatsby.",
      "Like Carraway, Gatsby is a Midwesterner who has trekked to the East Coast to make a name for himself. It's Carraway's cousin Daisy Buchanan who serves as the catalyst for Gatsby's downfall, and ultimately Carraway's own disillusionment. All the while, a symbolic green light beckons from the distance.",
      "When the book was first published, reviews were largely positive, though not unanimous. Fitzgerald, who originally wanted to title the book \"Trimalchio in West Egg\" before being persuaded to go with a title he thought far more generic, watched as the book languished on the vine commercially, selling fewer than 25,000 copies in the initial push.",
      "He would only complete one further novel in his lifetime: 1934's \"Tender is the Night,\" a thinly-veiled roman \u00e0 clef of Fitzgerald's own marriage to socialite Zelda Sayre, detailing their mutual descent into alcoholism and mental illness. Fitzgerald's early death from a heart attack was likely fuelled by years and years of alcohol abuse. Ironically, he'd gone sober just ahead of the cardiac event.",
      "If \"The Great Gatsby\" never achieved the level of esteem it now enjoys during the author's own life, it wasn't long after his death that Fitgerald's literary reputation took off.",
      "When the Modern Library asked authors, historians, critics and publishers on the eve of Y2K to rank their picks for the world's best novels of the 20th century, it was \"The Great Gatsby\" that\u00a0stood above all other U.S. contenders near the top of the poll. (The novel landed in second place, bookended by Irish author James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" and \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" in the top three.)",
      "The novel has since launched multiple film adaptations, has been transposed to the stage, and since going into the public domain in 2021, has been the subject of an endless array of reimaginings, remixes and mashups. It's even cleared space around itself as a modern-day meme, in the form of an animated .GIF depicting Leonardo Dicaprio (playing Gatsby in Baz Luhrmann's 2013 film adaptation) smirking as he offers a champagne toast flanked by ostentatious fireworks.",
      "Host of \"Gatsby\" centennial events planned in New York, Minnesota",
      "A host of \"Gatsby\"-themed events are planned to mark the novel's centennial anniversary. In New York, the Empire State Building announced plans to light up in green in a nod to the novel's symbolic green light at the end of Tom and Daisy's dock.",
      "There was also a rowdy \"Roaring Twenties\" party at the Empire Steak House in New York, which was an opulent opera house in Fitzgerald's era. Billed as the \"nation's most extravagant celebration,\" the event featured live jazz, period dancing, and speeches from officials with the New York Public Library.",
      "In honor of the legendary stage play, Broadway has marked the occasion with a release of new block tickets for the show. Tickets are on sale now and will run through Jan. 4, 2026.",
      "The iconic Victorian-themed New York bar, Oscar Wilde, is also hosting a Gatsby-inspired soir\u00e9e on Saturday. The event information markets the celebration as \"an all-day affair of music, opulence and mischief.\" Events kick off at 2 p.m. and continue into the evening until 11 p.m.",
      "Additionally, multiple restaurants are offering exclusive discounts on cocktails, and even a free drink at some places. Gatsby's Landing, Nothing Really Matters, Angelina Bakery and The Plaza are all listed as participants. All events and discounts are ongoing throughout the month of April.",
      "In Fitzgerald's hometown of St. Paul, the events include a new exhibit of the author's life and times at the Minnesota History Center, as well as various, less-than-sober events leaning into the novel's party-friendly Prohibition-era setting.",
      "If you managed to get through high school without having been assigned to read the book, there are a number of live readings of the book scheduled this month, including at St. Paul's Gale Family Library.",

      "\"The first thing my dad said is, 'This is an accurate portrayal of what it was to love and fear this woman.' Once I knew that I had gotten her right, everything else flowed,\" she said during an appearance on \"CBS Mornings\" on Wednesday.",
      "The book details Hanks' six-month journey along Interstate 10 from California to Florida, during which she sought to better understand Susan Dillingham \u2014 who died in 2002 \u2014 and reflect on her own difficult childhood.",
      "\"I'm just another girl trying to make sense of her dead, crazy mother,\" Hanks said.",
      "Hanks revealed that while growing up, she had language to understand addiction \u2014 her mother hosted 12-step programs in their home \u2014 but lacked vocabulary for mental illness.",
      "\"My mom \u2014 I had language for addiction because we used to host 12-step programs in our house, and my mom would have sponsees stay with us. I had a language even from 8 years old about addiction, but there was no language for mental health and what was sort of wrong in the house,\" Hanks explained. \"A lot of the book is me trying to create that language and share it.\"",
      "The author described her mother's \"fluid\" relationship with reality, saying in the book that \"mom's relationship with reality was fluid. Truth was fed through the meat grinder of mental illness.\"",
      "She detailed both emotional and physical abuse in her childhood home. Hanks explained that in California during the late 1980s, family law typically required evidence of physical abuse before a child could be removed from a situation.",
      "\"Family law in California in the late '80s wasn't enough room for it. At that time, you kind of had to have the receipts of physical abuse to get pulled out of a situation. And once we crossed that rubicon is when I moved to Los Angeles,\" she said.",

      "\"At the time, my mom kind of had this stance like a thoroughbred who had been put out to pasture too soon, and she didn't get her chance as an artist because of my dad's, as I describe it, catastrophic fame,\" Hanks said. \"I think including her poetry in the book is a way of treating her seriously as an artist and getting back into conversation with her. And anybody who's buried a parent knows that a two-way conversation suddenly becomes a one-way conversation.\"",
      "When asked about the truth she now understands, Hanks reflected, \"The truth is, my mother had good days and bad days. And I was lucky to experience the good days, and I was shaped by the bad days. All of the care and protection I had for the child that I was doesn't diminish what happened between us. But it means that as I get older, there's more wiggle room and acceptance for her flaws and mine.\"",
      "The memoir also explores themes of place and identity. As a journalist accustomed to interviewing others, Hanks discovered, \"When you're talking to stone-cold strangers, you can't start with, 'Tell me about your mom,' but you can start with, 'Tell me where you're from.' If someone wants to talk about their hometown, it's an elevator to their deepest self.\"",

      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "\"Hey, Mr. Wilson!\"\u00a0\u00a0Jay North (Aug. 3, 1951-April 6, 2025), who began appearing on kids' TV shows when he was 5, had already played small roles on \"77 Sunset Strip\" and \"Wanted: Dead or Alive\" when he was cast, at age 6, as the bright-eyed troublemaker in the TV adaptation of Hank Ketcham's comic strip \"Dennis the Menace.\" The series ran on CBS for four years beginning in 1959, but Dennis continued to strike terror in the heart of his elderly neighbor, George Wilson, for years after in syndication.",
      "The stardom came at a cost to the child. He told the Los Angeles Daily News in 1993 that he had been abused by his aunt and uncle, who would be with him on set while North's single mom was at work. \"If it took me more than one or two takes, I would be threatened and then whacked,\" North said.",
      "His other TV and film credits in the 1960s and early '70s included \"Wagon Train,\" \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,\" \"Maya,\" and voice work for \"The Banana Splits Adventure Hour\" and \"The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show.\"",
      "After appearing on stage in \"Butterflies Are Free,\" North had a brief stint in the Navy in the 1970s, and tried to return to show business with more mature, darker roles. Aside from a 1985 Yugoslavian World War II film, \"Wild Wind,\" North's appearances were mostly playing off his child actor past. He satirized his Dennis the Menace role on HBO's \"Not Necessarily the News,\" and played himself in a 1999 episode of \"The Simpsons\" and the David Spade comedy \"Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star.\"",
      "He also helped counsel other child and former child actors through the nonprofit organization A Minor Consideration."

      "Commit to What Matters",
      "I had come from a world of higher-end restaurants, of finesse and creativity. So a tapas restaurant was not exactly what I was looking for. But my new partners in Washington, DC, had a clear idea: they wanted to open a Spanish restaurant that was fun. They called it Jaleo, which means \"merrymaking, a joyful celebration,\" inspired by the John Singer Sargent painting of a Spanish woman dancing to guitars. It lives in Boston, but it had traveled on loan to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and they had seen it there. They even painted a reproduction of it on a wall of the new restaurant.",
      "I understood that sense of joy. I'm the kind of guy who doesn't like tables. I prefer standing up at bars. If I can, I like to hop around to five different bars and eat good food at each one. Jaleo was a chance to show how I like to enjoy life. These little plates of tapas were also a chance to give people more access to different bites of Spanish food, different tastes of the various regions of Spain. Maybe people didn't know what they wanted to eat, and the small plates would be a way to move a little bit further out of their comfort zones. Of course, it was an opportunity to make a mark for myself. And I could do that while being a kind of ambassador for my country, in the capital of the United States, not too far from the White House and the US Capitol. It felt like an extension of my military service, going from port to port on a historic tall-mast ship, showing the best of Spain to the world.",
      "I knew there were immigrants before me who had brought Spanish food to every corner of America. They opened restaurants, maybe some of them played guitar or danced flamenco. They were mythical places. Tio Pepe in Baltimore. Caf\u00e9 San Martin in New York. Montse Guill\u00e9n's El Internacional in Tribeca, which was short-lived but put Spanish food and drink on the map. There was already a high-end Spanish restaurant in Washington called Taberna del Alabardero, and the more informal Churreria Madrid in Adams Morgan.",
      "Washington at that time was not seen as a culinary mecca, even by the people of DC, and Jaleo opened in a downtown neighborhood, known as Penn Quarter, that was empty at night. But it would not stay that way. It would become a very important part of the city, not too far away from where all the big decisions were made that affected the country and the world. It was a part of the city where senators, congressmen, lobbyists, and business executives would gather. It was the home of new businesses like America Online, and so many other amazing new companies. Slowly but surely, Jaleo became a huge success.",
      "That's not to say it was easy. I was young, just twenty-three years old, and I was still learning how to run a kitchen. The movie in my head cast me as the creative guy, but now I needed to learn how to run the place. Fortunately, I had a wonderful, patient teacher: Ann Cashion, who was the first executive chef of Jaleo, showed me how to do the job properly, even though I preferred the creative side of things.",
      "We didn't really know whether American diners would accept these little plates, or the idea of sharing plates at all. What happened if people didn't want to share? Our waiters were concerned and would often tell me how some people said they weren't comfortable with sharing. I had a simple answer. If they didn't want to share, they could move the plate ten inches closer to them and use their knife and fork to protect the dish for themselves. I wasn't going to Americanize tapas for them. It's what we did in the south of Spain and in Catalonia. They would adapt because it was a fun way to be with friends. Who doesn't want to dig a fork into the plate of the person across the table?",
      "My heart was full of the joy that comes from introducing Spanish food to new people. That joy translated into happy guests eating the dishes I knew. Jaleo was a place where I could share what I knew about Spanish food: croquetas, gazpacho, gambas al ajillo, sangria. But it was also a way to learn more about what I didn't know about Spanish food. I had not traveled all across Spain at the age of twenty-three, nor did I know about all of Spanish gastronomy. Far from it. The reality is that you need to keep learning in any line of work. People say I'm one of the biggest experts in Spanish cooking, but I still feel clueless sometimes. Every time I go back to Spain and discover a new ingredient or a new dish, it feels to me the same as looking at the stars. You can see a few, but how many more are out there that you cannot see? You can read books, and you can travel, but learning is a lifetime of curiosity and discovery.",
      "Sometimes that work can feel less joyful and more of struggle. In particular, in those early days, it was a struggle to buy the right ingredients. Believe it or not, I'm a pragmatic guy. You can support the local economy, buying local fruit and vegetables for instance. But there are some ingredients that cannot be replaced. I observed the success of Italy, where they have been amazingly successful in supporting the small towns where their unique food products are made. I believed we could do the same for the small towns and food producers of Spain. Manchego cheese is like no other. Sweet roasted piquillo peppers are unique. Our olive oil is the envy of Europe, and even gets repackaged under Italian names. Our sherry vinegar is unmatched. And nothing compares to our pure-bred Ib\u00e9rico ham, the very best ham in the world. You can't have Spanish cooking without some of the staples. It was a symbiotic relationship.",
      "Still, importing food is not always easy. There are regulations and policies, rules to protect consumers and businesses. The US Department of Agriculture insists that slaughterhouses operate according to American standards, not European ones, if they want to sell their meat in the United States. They need to be inspected, even though Europeans have been eating these foods for centuries without any problems. It was crazy but also fascinating. Of course, it wasn't just a question of safety; there were concerns that ham from Spain would hurt ham in America. So one day I met a bearded man visiting Washington, and he happened to be a great Ib\u00e9rico ham producer who was investing to comply with US regulations at his slaughterhouse: Santiago Mart\u00edn, the owner of Embutidos Ferm\u00edn. I helped producers like Santiago navigate these challenges with Congress and the administration, finding a lawyer who assisted the Italians in bringing Parma ham to America. Because in reality these European hams were much more expensive than the American hams, and they helped elevate the perception of all pork products in America. It was a win-win for America and Spain.",
      "That's the world of work. Your commitment to your values, to what's important, can turn a seemingly small decision\u2014like buying a type of roasted pepper or a slice of ham\u2014into something as big as international relations.",
      "Your sense of responsibility is what matters. How was I going to be a Spanish chef without all these ingredients? I had to do the work, just like other chefs and importers who made Spanish food available in the United States. People like Tim Harris, who created the incredible Spanish food store La Tienda, and Juana Gimeno Faraone, who started La Espa\u00f1ola Meats. Or Almudena de Llaguno and Steve Metzler bringing Spanish wines to America; and Jorge Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, who would walk the streets of Manhattan with a big bag filled with wine bottles, trying to get his wines into a few restaurants. The whole ecosystem of Spanish food people kept me going, and I needed to play my part, too.",
      "So Jaleo became much more than a restaurant; it was a way to build bridges between these two countries, to inspire American chefs to buy and cook with Spanish ingredients, to spread the culture that made me who I am. Something like 80 percent of all restaurants close before they reach their five-year anniversary. Jaleo has now been open for thirty years, and we have new Jaleos in Orlando, Las Vegas, and even Dubai. Because we committed from the first year to what we value\u2014to what matters\u2014even when we didn't yet have all the expertise to make it happen.",
      "I feel a sense of joy when I see Ib\u00e9rico ham, or Spanish anchovies, or wines from the Bierzo region in restaurants and shops. I know that nothing would have happened without the persistence and vision of so many people who may now be forgotten. They built the bridges that will last forever\u2014because they cared so deeply.",
      "Follow what you feel is your purpose\u2014not what others tell you to do. Otherwise you lose your soul and become a commodity. Don't be a commodity. Be true to yourself.",

      "Ninety-one cases of measles were reported with rashes that began the week of March 23, with Arkansas, Hawaii and Indiana joining the list of two dozen states with confirmed measles cases.",
      "For the week of March 30, 81 cases were reported, and another 21 cases were reported for the following week. But those figures are expected to rise as more cases are confirmed.",
      "So far this year, at least 712 measles cases have been confirmed in the U.S. \u2013 the second-highest number of cases reported in a single year since the 1990s. Nearly 30,000 measles cases were reported in 1990, largely due to gaps in vaccination.",
      "In 2019, there were 1,274 confirmed measles cases.",
      "The CDC said Friday there have been seven local outbreaks of the virus in the U.S., up from six last week. The outbreak in Texas and neighboring New Mexico remains the country's largest, with nearly 600 cases between the two states.",
      "A CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment, asked about the new outbreaks. The agency previously said outbreaks had been reported in Texas and New Mexico, New Jersey, Georgia, Ohio and Kansas.",
      "This week's update came a day after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. described his strategy for handling the current outbreak as a success, even after a third death of an unvaccinated American was linked to it.",
      "\"Our numbers in this country have now plateaued. And I want to thank CDC for that,\" Kennedy said Thursday at a White House Cabinet meeting.",
      "Kennedy compared the nation's measles figures to those in Europe, which has seen thousands more measles cases and several more deaths. Health officials there have been grappling with record measles cases in recent years due to steep gaps in vaccination rates in several countries.",
      "Unlike in Europe, prolonged local outbreaks of measles had been declared eliminated in the Americas. Officials have warned that this year's outbreaks in the region are now threatening that public health achievement.",
      "Kennedy also told President Trump at the Cabinet meeting, \"We're trying to refocus the press. We've had three measles deaths in this country over 20 years, and we're trying to refocus the press to get them to pay attention to the chronic disease epidemic.\"",
      "One CDC official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, warned that any apparent slowdown in recent measles cases should be treated with caution. Challenges in quickly identifying and reporting cases from the outbreaks can distort figures.",
      "During outbreaks, weekly measles cases almost always appear to be lower in more recent weeks due to reporting delays, they said.",
      "Some travelers to Texas and Kansas are also now being advised to get a second or early dose of the measles vaccine, the CDC said in a letter to health departments this week, marking the first time in years that the CDC has published these kinds of vaccination recommendations for domestic travel within the country.",
      "\"The current increase in measles cases in the United States is due to people returning to the United States from international trips with measles and an expanding outbreak among communities with low vaccination coverage in Texas and other states,\" the CDC wrote in its letter.",

      "The nation's 988 hotline works like 911, bringing critical access to care for those battling mental health emergencies. Counselor Alejandra takes calls at the nation's largest suicide prevention center \u2014 Los Angeles' Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services. That one center receives 20,000 calls and texts a month.",

      "\"When someone calls prevention, they're already breaking through a lot of barriers and a lot of stigma,\" Alejandra said. \"So there is vulnerability and courage in those first few of moments. I breathe deeply because those are the moments where you show someone, 'I'm glad you called.'\"",

      "\"Since 2022, 12 million people have contacted 988 for help. So what that tells us is that people want the help,\" said Didi Hirsch CEO Lyn Morris, noting that these calls are oftentimes literal life or death situations.",
      "\"We have dealt with people calling our line who have either taken measures to end their life or are sitting at home with a gun in their lap,\" she said.",
      "A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association outlines that, while calls have gone up, access to care after those initial calls has not increased. The study's authors are pushing for more awareness and funding to make 988 more effective for those in need.",
      "\"We want them to have a full crisis continuum of care,\" Morris said. \"We need more resources, we need more therapists, we need technology. We want to be able to answer those calls in the most efficient way possible.\"",
      "One in four adults in the U.S. lives with a diagnosable mental illness, according to the National Institutes of Health. But many more could be struggling without a diagnosis, and the numbers are expected to go up.",
      "Meanwhile, public health services nationwide could face further federal cuts.",
      "More than 10% of the staff working for the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA, which oversees the 988 hotline, were fired last month amid cuts by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. One SAMHSA employee said about a quarter of the agency's communication team, who work to raise awareness about the hotline, were let go.",
      "\"The ultimate goal is for all Americans to have access to crisis care for mental health and substance use issues, in the way that 911 provides rapid response for physical health emergencies,\" SAMHSA told CBS News in a statement. \"The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is working diligently to support the development and sustainability of local treatment and support connected to 988, including the expansion of mobile crisis services and 24/7 walk-in crisis care clinics across the country. Transformation of this scale and building a cohesive crisis care system takes time, and there is more work needed to be able to deliver these critical services to the American public.\"",
      "Morris said additional cuts could lead to \"a very dire situation.\"",
      "\"If there was any funding cut to 988 or other mental health services, there would be more hospitalizations, more death, and more mental health issues,\" she said.",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also\u00a0chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline here.",

There have been cases in at least 21 states, including Texas, California, Florida, Georgia, New Mexico and New York. The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as state health departments and the CDC continue to release data. This map is updated with new data from the CDC on Fridays.",

Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has delivered a tepid message on the importance of vaccination against measles, saying it should be encouraged while also sowing doubt in the vaccine's safety.

    "summary": "Consumers fraudulently enrolled in Affordable Care Act coverage could receive unexpected tax bills \u2014 possibly their only clue they've been victimized.",
    "story": [
      "Because of past fraud by rogue brokers, some Affordable Care Act policyholders may get an unexpected tax bill this season.",
      "But that isn't the only potential shock. Other changes coming soon - stemming from proposals by the administration of President Donald Trump - could affect their coverage and its cost. And sorting out related problems and challenges may take longer as federal workers are laid off and funding for assistance programs is cut.",
      "First up: taxes",
      "Tax season is when some consumers learn they were fraudulently enrolled in an ACA plan or switched to a different one without their knowledge.",
      "Those unauthorized enrollments or changes took off in late 2023 and continued through last year, drawing more than 274,000 complaints in the first eight months of 2024 to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, mostly about rogue agents or call centers.",
      "Tax problems can arise if those enrollments resulted in premium tax credits exceeding the amount the consumer should have received. In those cases, consumers may have to pay all or part of those credits back. The amount owed could range from a few hundred dollars to thousands, with some caps based on income.",
      "The first clue some people have is when they get a 1095-A form in the mail.",
      "Those documents are sent out by the state and federal marketplaces to the IRS and ACA enrollees, showing any tax credit payments made to health insurers on a taxpayer's behalf. Taxpayers use the premium tax credit information from the 1095-A when completing their return.",
      "Returns can be held up if the IRS has information indicating the taxpayer has ACA coverage that they failed to report on their return, or if there are other discrepancies.",
      "The Biden administration last year took steps to slow the fraudulent switching, including requiring a three-way call between the broker, client, and marketplace for some enrollment issues.",
      "\"While we may be seeing less [fraud], we're still dealing with 2024 taxes,\" said Erin Kinard, director of systems and intake for the Health and Economic Opportunity Program at Pisgah Legal Services, a nonprofit serving western North Carolina that offers both legal help and assistance with ACA problems.",
      "Consumers who suspect they were fraudulently enrolled should immediately call their federal or state ACA marketplace, experts say. Some consumers will be referred to special federal caseworkers throught he marketplaces. But some of those caseworkers are now part of the broad reduction in force by theTrump administration.",
      "In recent days, \"they laid off two divisions on the Affordable Care Act side,\" said Jeffrey Grant, who oversaw ACA issues as CMS' deputy director for operations in the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight before leaving in February.",
      "With fewer caseworkers, \"it will take longer to get problems taken care of,\" said Grant, who is now president of Schedule F Healthcare Strategies, a consulting group that aims to help laid-off federal workers find new jobs. \"The marketplace is twice as big as it was the last time the Trump administration was here, and now they are cutting caseworkers to less than were around then.\"",

      "And these cases are difficult because the rogue brokers who enrolled consumers sometimes misstated their income so they would qualify for the largest tax credits possible. Other consumers have found they were enrolled even though they had affordable employer coverage, making them ineligible for ACA subsidies.",
      "That's what happened to Anthony Akra and his wife, Ashley Zukoski, in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were enrolled in a plan without their knowledge in 2023, by a broker in Florida with whom they had never spoken. The couple had health insurance through Zukoski's employer. The broker listed an income that qualified the household for a large subsidy that fully offset the monthly premium cost, so the couple never received a bill. One day, a 1095-A form showed up in their mailbox.",
      "\"I didn't know what the hell it was,\" said Akra, who said the form showed that he had been receiving hundreds of dollars a month in premium tax credits.",
      "He would owe a big chunk of that back unless he could get the plan retroactively canceled. Because their pharmacy, part of a national chain, had switched them to the new plan, also without telling them, they had used the new coverage every time they filled a prescription. That inadvertent use of the policy complicated their efforts to get the fraudulent coverage revoked.",
      "Meanwhile, the IRS withheld more than $4,000 from their tax refund based on the information sent through that 1095-A form.\u00a0 Months passed, but with assistance from a \"navigator\" program \u2014 a government-fundednonprofit that helps people deal with insurance problems \u2014 they were able to get the incorrectinsurance canceled and a refund at the end of October.",
      "It is not unusual for people to spend weeks or even months trying to sort out the mess, said Kinard, whose organization is similar to the one that helped Akra.",
      "While navigator programs nationwide are still operating to help people sign up for health coverage or address issues, the Trump administration has targeted their funding for a 90% cut. Meanwhile, ACA enrollees may face a range of other surprises due to policy and budget steps proposed by the Trump administration.",
      "More Potential Changes",
      "Congress must decide whether to extend premium tax credits that were enhanced during the covid pandemic, which expanded eligibility for the credits and made them larger for many enrollees. Keeping them in place would be expensive, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation estimating it would add $335 billion to the deficit through 2034.",
      "That debate will come amid another deficit-affecting decision: whether to extend tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration, which would add trillions to the budget deficit through 2034.",
      "If the enhanced subsidies are not renewed, monthly premium costs would rise by an average of over 75%, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Premiums could more than double in some states, including many GOP-led ones, such as Texas, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, and West Virginia.",
      "That could spark a political backlash. Additionally, the enhanced subsidies are seen as a main reason for strong enrollment growth, leading to more than 24 million people signing up for ACA plans for this year.",
      "A recent KFF study found the 15 states with the most enrollment growth since 2020 were all won by Trump in 2024.",
      "A proposed rule released last month by the Trump administration includes provisions to shorten the annual enrollment period, get rid of a special open enrollment period that allows low-income people to sign up year-round, and require stricter verification of income and other information when people apply for coverage. The administration says most of these steps are needed to reduce fraud in the system.",
      "The administration estimates that 750,000 to 2 million fewer people would enroll in coverage as a result of the changes.",
      "The new rule, if finalized, will make it harder for people to enroll, said Xonjenese Jacobs, director of Florida Covering Kids & Families at the University of South Florida College of Public Health. Losing the year-round enrollment for very low-income people, for example, would affect people short on cash who move often to stay with relatives or friends, and those who have unsteady employment, making it hard to know when or where to enroll and what their income might be in the coming year.",
      "\"They don't have the same ability to plan,\" Jacobs said. \"It's definitely going to make a difference for a lot of the individuals that we service.\""

      "While dozens of measles cases are reported every year, usually linked to undervaccinated travelers returning from trips outside the country, health authorities have warned that ongoing community spread of the virus this year is now threatening America's status of having eliminated endemic spread of the virus.",
      "There have been six measles outbreaks so far this year, a CDC spokesperson told CBS News on Friday. The outbreak in Texas and neighboring states makes up the majority of cases. Smaller outbreaks are also ongoing in New Jersey, Georgia, Ohio and Kansas.",

      "Kennedy calls vaccine \"most effective way\" to stop measles spread",
      "While in Texas, Kennedy also posted on X that the \"most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.\" The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella, and is normally given in two doses in early childhood.",
      "Kennedy's range of statements about the measles vaccine in recent weeks have drawn scrutiny from health experts, including after a Fox News interview in which he falsely inflated the shot's risks.",
      "In a later post, Kennedy also said he had met with \"two extraordinary healers\" who he said have \"healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children using aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.\"",
      "Budesonide can sometimes help to treat respiratory illnesses, reducing inflammation in the lungs, said pediatrics professor Dr. James Campbell of the University of Maryland in an email in March. CBS News reached out to Campbell after Kennedy previously hailed \"miraculous and instantaneous recovery\" from use of these treatments.",
      "\"In 2025, we should not have to treat measles in the US because it is completely preventable, but of course, like all preventable diseases, we do,\" said Campbell.",
      "Campbell is vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee that develops recommendations for treating measles and other infectious diseases.",
      "Clarithromycin, an antibacterial drug, has no effect on viruses like measles but can be used by doctors to treat coinfections from some bacterial pneumonias that sometimes develop in infected children, Campbell said. However, it does not work for all bacteria.",
      "\"These choices should be made on an individual basis by the doctors, not as sweeping recommendations for all children with measles,\" said Campbell. He said that the drugs don't have evidence proving they should be used as routine treatments for measles and cautioned against \"sweeping statements about how those singular choices related to treatment of measles in general.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's firings at the Department of Health and Human Services included the entire office that sets federal poverty guidelines, which determine whether tens of millions of Americans are eligible for health programs such as Medicaid, food assistance, child care, and other services, former staff said.",
      "The small team, with technical data expertise, worked out of HHS' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, or ASPE. Their dismissal mirrored others across HHS, which came without warning and left officials puzzled as to why they were \"RIF'ed\" \u2014 as in \"reduction in force,\" the bureaucratic language used to describe the firings.",
      "\"I suspect they RIF'ed offices that had the word 'data' or 'statistics' in them,\" said one of the laid-off employees, a social scientist whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because the person feared further recrimination. \"It was random, as far as we can tell.\"",
      "Among those fired was Kendall Swenson, who had led development of the poverty guidelines for many years and was considered the repository of knowledge on the issue, according to the social scientist and two academics who have worked with the HHS team.",
      "The sacking of the office could lead to cuts in assistance to low-income families next year unless the Trump administration restores the positions or moves its duties elsewhere, said Robin Ghertner, the fired director of the Division of Data and Technical Analysis, which had overseen the guidelines.",
      "The poverty guidelines are \"needed by many people and programs,\" said Timothy Smeeding, a professor emeritus of economics at the La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin. \"If you're thinking of someone you fired who should be rehired, Swenson would be a no-brainer,\" he added.",
      "Under a 1981 appropriations bill, HHS is required annually to take Census Bureau poverty-line figures, adjust them for inflation, and create guidelines that agencies and states use to determine who is eligible for various types of help.",
      "There's a special sauce for creating the guidelines that includes adjustments and calculations, Ghertner said. Swenson and three other staff members would independently prepare the numbers and quality-check them together before they were issued each January.",
      "Everyone in Ghertner's office was told last week, without warning, that they were being put on administrative leave until June 1, when their employment would officially end, he said.",
      "\"There's literally no one in the government who knows how to calculate the guidelines,\" he said. \"And because we're all locked out of our computers, we can't teach anyone how to calculate them.\"",
      "ASPE had about 140 staff members and now has about 40, according to a former staffer. The HHS shake-up merged the office with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, whose staff has shrunk from 275 to about 80, according to a former AHRQ official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "HHS has said it laid off about 10,000 employees and that, combined with other moves, including a program to encourage early retirements, its workforce has been reduced by about 20,000. But the agency has not detailed where it made the cuts or identified specific employees it fired.",
      "\"These workers were told they couldn't come into their offices so there's no transfer of knowledge,\" said Wendell Primus, who worked at ASPE during the Bill Clinton administration. \"They had no time to train anyone, transfer data, etc.\"",
      "HHS defended the firings. The department merged AHRQ and ASPE \"as part of Secretary Kennedy's vision to streamline HHS to better serve Americans,\"\u00a0 spokesperson Emily Hilliard said. \"Critical programs within ASPE will continue in this new office\" and \"HHS will continue to comply with statutory requirements,\" she said in a written response to KFF Health News.",
      "After this article published, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon called KFF Health News to say others at HHS could do the work of the RIF'ed data analysis team, which had nine members. \"The idea that this will come to a halt is totally incorrect,\" he said. \"Eighty million people will not be affected.\"",
      "Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has so far declined to testify about the staff reductions before congressional committees that oversee much of his agency. On April 9, a delegation of 10 Democratic members of Congress waited fruitlessly for a meeting in the agency's lobby.",
      "The group was led by House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee ranking member Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), who told reporters afterward that Kennedy must appear before the committee \"and tell us what his plan is for keeping America healthy and for stopping these devastating cuts.\"",
      "Matt VanHyfte, a spokesperson for the Republican committee leadership, said HHS officials would meet with bipartisan committee staff on April 11 to discuss the firings and other policy issues.",
      "ASPE serves as a think tank for the HHS secretary, said Primus, who later was Rep. Nancy Pelosi's senior health policy adviser for 18 years. In addition to the poverty guidelines, the office maps out how much Medicaid money goes to each state and reviews all regulations developed by HHS agencies.",
      "\"These HHS staffing cuts \u2014 20,000 \u2014 obviously they are completely nuts,\" Primus said. \"These were not decisions made by Kennedy or staff at HHS. They are being made at the White House. There's no rhyme or reasons to what they're doing.\"",
      "HHS leaders may be unaware of their legal duty to issue the poverty guidelines, Ghertner said. If each state and federal government agency instead sets guidelines on its own, it could create inequities and lead to lawsuits, he said.",
      "And sticking with the 2025 standard next year could put benefits for hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk, Ghertner said. The current poverty level is $15,650 for a single person and $32,150 for a family of four.",
      "\"If you make $30,000 and have three kids, say, and next year you make $31,000 but prices have gone up 7%, suddenly your $31,000 doesn't buy you the same,\" he said, \"but if the guidelines haven't increased, you might be no longer eligible for Medicaid.\"",
      "The 2025 poverty level for a family of five is $37,650.",
      "As of October, about 79 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children's Health Insurance Program, both of which are means-tested and thus depend on the poverty guidelines to determine eligibility.",
      "Eligibility for premium subsidies for insurance plans sold in Affordable Care Act marketplaces is also tied to the official poverty level.",
      "One in eight Americans rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, and 40% of newborns and their mothers receive food through the Women, Infants, and Children program, both of which also use the federal poverty level to determine eligibility.",
      "Former employees in the office said they were not disloyal to the president. They knew their jobs required them to follow the administration's objectives. \"We were trying to support the MAHA agenda,\" the social scientist said, referring to Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" rubric. \"Even if it didn't align with our personal worldviews, we wanted to be useful.\"",

      "The 125% tax will make it much more costly for Chinese companies to purchase and bring U.S.-made goods into the country, and could cut U.S. producers off from an important trade market.",
      "President Trump on Wednesday afternoon said he's increasing the tariff rate on Chinese imports to 125%, while also moving to pause reciprocal tariffs on other countries for 90 days and lowering that rate to 10% for most nations. China also faces a 20% fentanyl-related tariff, bringing the total rate at which its goods are taxed to 145%.",

      "China's top imports from the U.S. in 2023 were oilseeds and grains, followed by oil and gas. Oilseeds and grain exports fell by $7 billion from 2022 to 2023, and could fall even more substantially under the current tit-for-tat tariff spat between the U.S. and China. Grains include crops such as soybeans, wheat and corn.",

    "summary": "A new breed of veterinary clinic is changing how pets \u2014 and their owners \u2014 are treated. \"I'd rather see four pets a day,\" one vet said.",
    "story": [
      "When Kathleen Whitman's daughter's Bernadoodle, Cody, swallowed a Kong toy, the family faced a veterinary emergency requiring immediate surgery.",
      "X-rays at their local suburban clinic suggested what looked like a hair tie tangled in Cody's intestines. When referred to a corporate emergency hospital, the family was quoted $10,000 for the procedure.",
      "\"They literally told me in the waiting room with a clipboard, thinking I was just coming in and we were doing $10,000,\" Whitman said. \"I said, 'No, I'm just coming in to hear the price.\"",
      "Desperate for an alternative, Whitman reached out to Vetique, a boutique veterinary clinic in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. There, Dr. Jessica Trice and Dr. Jennifer Remnes performed the surgery for what Whitman called \"an appropriate fee\" that was significantly less than $10,000.",
      "During the surgery, she and her daughter waited in the clinic's lobby with glasses of Prosecco while receiving regular updates.",
      "\"The humans were taken care of just as much as the puppy in distress was,\" Whitman said.",
      "This experience mirrors what many pet owners report when comparing corporate-owned emergency animal hospitals to independent practices. Kara Adams, whose 16-year-old rescue dog Shadow needed emergency eye surgery, also chose Vetique over corporate alternatives.",
      "When Adams called Vetique explaining she had only $1,000 available, staff accommodated her financial constraints.",
      "\"The planning manager came out with a payment plan for me,\" Adams said. \"I was crying because otherwise, what would I do? I didn't have any other options.\"",
      "\"You literally burn people out\"",
      "Drs. Trice and Remnes founded Vetique after witnessing firsthand how corporate consolidation was transforming veterinary medicine \u2014 often for the worse.",
      "\"Just coming from a corporation for many years, the whole thing is about quantity, getting all those pets,\" Trice explained after spending 10 years at Banfield Pet Hospital, followed by five years as a medical director at VCA Animal Hospitals. \"We feel the best way is not pushing about the number of quantity, because it gets very sloppy and you lose that interaction and relationship with the clients.\"",
      "Remnes' experience echoed her partner's concerns. At Banfield as a new graduate, she found herself overwhelmed by volume demands.",
      "\"As a new grad, you're still learning and trying to break into this brand-new world. I was seeing like 30 pets a day,\" Remnes said.",
      "She later moved to VCA before its Mars acquisition, initially enjoying the autonomy because \"each hospital was able to operate as they liked to.\" After the corporate takeover, however, the pressure intensified.",
      "\"It was like, 'Oh, you need to see this number of pets, or we're decreasing your salary.' That's what's burning out the industry,\" Remnes said. \"You literally burn people out doing that. You can't possibly offer your best when you're crammed with all of these patients.\"",
      "These pressures contribute to a profession in crisis. A 2024 study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that U.S. veterinarians are more likely to experience serious mental health struggles than most people.",
      "\"We have forums on Facebook where our industry has one of the highest suicide rates,\" Remnes noted. \"It's because of things like this, when you're given spreadsheets and quotas rather than focusing on patient care.\"",
      "Their solution was to create a different business model. Instead of maximizing patient volume, Vetique prioritizes extended appointment times and a calming environment with luxury touches like sparkling epoxy floors, examination tables with faux fur coverings and exam rooms named after the founders' pets.",
      "\"I'd rather see four pets a day. That meant that family was getting my full attention, that pet was getting everything that I do,\" Remnes explained.",
      "Alongside traditional veterinary medicine, Trice offers acupuncture, herbal remedies and chiropractic treatments \u2014 holistic approaches she had wanted to pursue at corporate practices but was discouraged from using.",
      "Surging pet care prices",
      "Setting prices at Vetique involves balancing fair market rates with the clinic's added value. What Remnes found surprising was how significantly corporate prices have increased in recent years. \"Prices are so drastically different from when I was at VCA seven years ago. They're charging actually close to what we're charging as a general practice for an exam,\" she noted.",
      "This observation led her to reconsider Vetique's own pricing strategy.",
      "\"It's like, 'Well, we can actually probably charge more, because we offer all these experiences along with it.' It's trying to find a happy medium, trying to be fair, but also knowing our value.\"",
      "Despite the appeal of the boutique model, both Remnes and Trice acknowledge significant business challenges. The clinic is in its third year of operation, still within the typical three-to-five-year window before seeing substantial returns. Unlike corporate-backed veterinary chains, Vetique is entirely funded through a bank loan.",
      "Vetique's founders see their clinic not as a competitor to corporate chains but as an alternative model for the industry. \"We're not competing,\" Trice said. \"We're creating a new veterinary culture.\"",
      "Corporate giants reshape vet landscape",
      "John Volk, senior consultant with Brakke Consulting, said veterinary practices historically grow 4-5% annually and carry minimal accounts receivable, making them attractive to investors.",
      "\"Pet care in general is very attractive to the financial community,\" Volk said. \"It's a very steady growth industry, and it's a cash business, so they carry very little accounts receivable because pet owners pay for their services at time of service.\"",
      "Mars Inc., best known for candy brands like M&M's and Snickers, has quietly become the largest owner of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. through a series of major acquisitions.",
      "The privately held company owns three of the nation's largest veterinary chains: Banfield Pet Hospital, VCA Animal Hospitals, and BluePearl Specialty and Emergency Pet Hospital \u2014 giving it control of more than 2,000 clinics across North America.",
      "Mars entered the pet care industry in 2007 by acquiring Banfield, which primarily operates inside PetSmart locations. In 2017, it significantly expanded its footprint by purchasing VCA for $9.1 billion \u2014 one of the largest acquisitions in veterinary history,\u00a0according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.",
      "VCA operates more than 900 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, while Banfield has over 1,000 clinics nationwide. Unlike VCA, which grew by acquiring independent practices, Banfield has mostly launched new locations within retail stores.",
      "Mars's scale allows for standardized protocols, shared technology platforms and subscription-based wellness plans across its network. According to the company website, Mars Veterinary Health serves more than 25 million pets annually.",
      "While private equity firms have been acquiring veterinary practices since the late 1980s, the trend has accelerated significantly over the past 15 years. Volk estimates approximately 30% of veterinary practices are now corporate-owned.",
      "Despite the growth in corporate ownership, Volk sees no evidence that care quality differs significantly between corporate and independent practices.",
      "\"I've not seen any data to suggest that the services provided by corporately owned practices are materially different than services provided by independently owned practices,\" he said.",
      "However, some policymakers have raised concerns about the impact of consolidation on pricing. In January 2023, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, specifically called out Mars Veterinary Health and other large veterinary corporations in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission. Warren cited \"troubling reports of anti-competitive consolidation\" and suggested these corporate entities were using market power to \"raise prices for consumers and lower wages for veterinarians.\"",
      "Even as consolidation continues, Volk finds that independent practices remain viable. \"If you have a DVM degree and don't have a bad personal history, you can get money to buy or start a practice,\" he said. \"Veterinarians are one of the lowest-risk borrowers of any category.\"",
      "For new veterinarians, the industry offers growing opportunities. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports the average starting salary in companion animal medicine reached approximately $137,000 in 2024.",
      "Design, investment, and a human touch",
      "When clients walk into a Bond Vet clinic, they won't find the sterile environment or cluttered waiting rooms traditionally associated with veterinary offices. Instead, they'll encounter soft pastel colors, comfortable seating and an atmosphere deliberately designed to feel more like a high-end hospitality experience than a medical facility.",
      "\"The industry has two categories of clinics historically \u2014 many designed very clinical, cold and sterile, and then others called mom and pop, which could be cluttered or dirty,\" said Garrett Lewis, CEO of Bond Vet. \"The question is how to solve both problems.\"",
      "That solution \u2013 creating premium veterinary experiences with transparent pricing and greater accessibility \u2013 has attracted significant private equity investment.",
      "While these premium services might suggest significantly higher costs, Lewis emphasizes transparency in Bond Vet's pricing model. \"When someone comes in, you can look at the laptop and see exactly what the pricing is,\" he said. \"Our prices are just a little bit above average, but the experience is what differentiates us.\"",
      "This transparency extends to digital platforms, where clients can check prices online or via text before visiting. During appointments, veterinarians show pricing information directly to clients on laptops, allowing for discussion about options.",
      "Bond Vet, backed by a $170 million investment from Warburg Pincus, has expanded to 57 locations across the Northeast and Midwest since its founding in 2019. The company was inspired by human-focused healthcare models like One Medical, focusing on convenience, design, and a better experience for both pets and owners.",
      "\"They saw the same issue, which was that the industry wasn't serving clients and pets at a much higher level,\" Lewis said of Bond Vet's founders, who included a veterinarian and her husband. \"They quickly found it was very different to change culture and design in existing practices, so they rebooted from the ground up.\"",
      "Bond Vet's approach represents a broader trend in veterinary medicine, where traditional practices are being reinvented with a focus on client experience alongside medical care.",
      "Bond Vet's model bridges the gap between traditional veterinary practices and emergency hospitals, offering urgent care alongside preventative services \u2013 all with a hospitality-focused approach.",
      "\"In the 90s, if you needed sick care, your veterinarian would say, 'Come on in.' If you needed preventive care, they'd say, 'Come on in,'\" Lewis explained. \"What happened in the 2000s is a lot of specialization occurred where practices became just preventative and started referring out anything that looked urgent or sick.\"",
      "Bond Vet handles non-emergency urgent cases that might otherwise end up in expensive emergency rooms. \"ER practices see about 40% of their volume as urgent rather than emergent cases. Clients go to ER and spend twice as much, often having to wait longer,\" Lewis noted.",
      "These clinics feature design elements specifically created to reduce stress for pets \u2014 an approach that appears to be working. \"I always see dogs dragging their owners into the clinic, which is not a common thing,\" Lewis said.",
      "The \"no walls\" philosophy breaking ground",
      "Imagine walking into a veterinary emergency room and instead of being separated from your pet during a crisis, you're welcomed directly onto the treatment floor. At  VEG ER for Pets, this isn't just possible \u2014 it's mandatory.",
      "\"We built an entire business around it,\" said Dr. David Bessler, founder and CEO of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's much easier doing something 100% of the time than trying to do it 90% of the time.\"",
      "With 102 locations across 28 states, VEG ER for Pets represents an approach to emergency veterinary medicine that stands apart from both traditional practices and newer primary care models.",
      "Unlike other veterinary innovators that blend primary and urgent care, VEG ER for Pets focuses exclusively on emergency medicine \u2013 a deliberate strategy that Bessler calls \"a bit of a crazy bet.\"",
      "\"We took the hardest part of an industry, emergency, and created an entire business around that,\" said David Glattstein, co-founder and president of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's hard to make money, it's hard to get the team, it's hard to recruit, it's hard to train.\"",
      "VEG ER for Pets' most distinctive feature is its commitment to keeping pets with their owners throughout the entire treatment process, even during emergencies \u2014 an approach not found in traditional emergency hospitals, where pets are typically treated in back rooms away from owners.",
      "This transparency extends to the physical design of newer hospitals, which have eliminated traditional waiting rooms entirely. \"Our newer hospitals don't even have a lobby,\" Glattstein explained. \"You literally walk in and you're in the middle of the treatment floor.\"",
      "In a notable departure from many veterinary innovators, VEG ER for Pets has achieved financial independence from its initial investors and now funds its expansion through its own operations.",
      "\"VEG ER for Pets is now independently able to do that,\" Glattstein stated. \"We don't need anyone else to advocate for us or to pay for us. We're not beholden to anybody. We're beholden to our customers, and we're beholden to our veggies.\"",
      "This independence allows the company to maintain its distinctive approach while continuing to open 25-30 new locations annually.",
      "The company's exclusive focus on emergency care, while limiting in some ways, has allowed it to \"crack the code\" on veterinary emergencies according to Glattstein. \"We've kind of cracked the code on one way of doing things in emergency that results in a better experience for all of the souls that are there experiencing that at the same time.\"",

      "Lululemon, Dell Computer, Amazon, the parent of Restoration Hardware and a few others hit hard by President Trump's tariff threats were down 40% on average late last week when the Georgia Republican pounced.",
      "Data from a required three-page financial holdings document doesn't disclose exactly how much she paid for the stocks, only ranges and dates.",
      "But however much she spent, some of her bets are working out so far, at least as of Wednesday's close, after markets soared on Mr. Trump's decision to pause most of his \"reciprocal tariffs\" on nations other than China for 90 days. Markets fell again Thursday, but remain above Wednesday morning's levels.",
      "RH, formerly called Restoration Hardware, is Greene's clear winner. It jumped more than a third since Friday's close, when she bought it after a stunning collapse in price that shook even the head of the furniture retailer.",
      "\"Oh, sh\u2026!,\" said RH CEO Gary Friedman in a conference call last week as the stock plunged.",
      "Dell has jumped 9% since Greene bought the stock last week after it had lost more than half its value.",

      "U.S. stocks surrendered a chunk of their historic gains from the day before as President Donald Trump's trade war continues to threaten the economy.",
      "The S&P 500 fell 189 points, or 3.5%, Thursday to close at 5,268. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,015 points, or 2.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite sank 4.3%.",
      "China this week announced more countermeasures against the U.S., and market losses accelerated after the White House clarified that it will tax Chinese imports at 145%, not 125% as initially announced by Mr. Trump on social media. The swings also hit the bond market despite a better-than-expected report on inflation. U.S. crude oil prices fell more than 3%.",
      "It's been a wild couple of weeks on Wall Street with Mr. Trump's tariff announcements,\u00a0reversals and retaliation from U.S. trading partners. That volatility seems unlikely to change in the coming weeks with the U.S. and China still locked in a tit-for-tat tariff battle and earnings season kicking off on Friday with the latest results from some of the nation's biggest banks.",
      "\"Despite Wednesday's announcements to lower the reciprocal tariff rate for most countries to 10%, the escalation between the U.S. and China could dramatically impact trade between the world's two largest economies,\" said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer for wealth management at UBS, in a research note.",
      "Taking into account Mr. Trump's 145% levy on Chinese imports, UBS currently estimates the overall U.S.\u00a0effective tariff rate at 27%, versus 9% prior to April 2. \"Excluding trade with China, the effective tariff rate is 11%,\" Haefele added.",
      "\"Everything is still very volatile, because with Donald Trump, you don't know what to expect,\" said Francis Lun, chief executive of Geo Securities. \"This is really big uncertainty in the market. The threat of recession has not faded.\"",
      "Markets had been sinking earlier Wednesday on worries that Mr. Trump's trade war could drag the global economy into a recession. But then came the posting on social media that investors worldwide had been waiting and wishing for.",
      "\"I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE,\" Mr. Trump said, saying more than 75 countries are negotiating on trade and not retaliating against his latest increases in tariffs. China was a huge exception, with the president raising tariffs\u00a0 on its products to 145%.",
      "Investors went \"from fear to euphoria,\" Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said in a commentary. On Wednesday, following Mr. Trump's tariff-pause announcement, the S&P 500 surged 9.5%, its third-best day since 1940. The index is still below where it was when Trump announced his sweeping set of tariffs last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shot to a gain of nearly 3,000 points, or 7.9%. The Nasdaq composite leaped 12.2%.",
      "\"It's now a manageable risk, especially as global recession tail bets get unwound, and most of Asia's exporters breathe a massive sigh of relief,\" Innes said. Analysts had expected the global comeback given that U.S. stocks had one of their best days in history on Wednesday as investors registered their relief over Trump's decision.",
      "The trade war isn't over, and an escalating battle between the world's two largest economies can create plenty of damage. U.S. stocks are also still below where they were just a week ago. Technology stocks were the biggest drag on markets in early trading Thursday, followed by the industrial and the financial sectors.",
      "CPI report brings good news",
      "On a positive note, the U.S. government's latest consumer inflation data revealed inflation in March\u00a0rose\u00a02.4% on an annual basis, a sign of progress in the Federal Reserve's battle to\u00a0bring down inflation\u00a0to a 2% rate.",
      "\"This month's inflation report showed that CPI dropped across the board in March, which is welcome news for the Federal Reserve, which would like to cut rates if significant damage is done to the economy through increased tariffs, but otherwise would be reluctant to cut rates in the face of an inflation threat,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management.",
      "March \"saw a fairly big cooling in inflation (both headline and core) and this, coupled w/the healthy job adds from last week, point to robust underlying economic fundamentals. The downtick in inflation gives breathing room for the Fed to be more forceful in responding to market turmoil,\" said equity analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, in a report.",
      "From bear investors' perspective, however, \"inflation is still running above the Fed's target and regardless, Mar and Q1 numbers are irrelevant given how much the world has changed. Trump's tariffs are only hitting the economy now, and it will take months before they fully show up in the data,\" Crisafulli added.",
      "In other words, according to most analysts, the situation is still too uncertain to call.",
      "\"It's much too soon to blow the all clear \u2014 both on tariffs or on inflation \u2014 since the tariff damage has only been postponed as of now, and will only be relieved if tariff deals can be struck across the board,\" Zaccarelli said.",
      "\"Inflation still remains a concern because the full impact of tariffs is yet to be felt, however, at least the underlying trends (e.g. non-tariff related inflation) seems benign at this time. We will be keeping a close eye on PPI tomorrow in order to determine whether or not future inflation is already in the pipeline,\" he added.",
      "In report Thursday, TD Securities analysts echoed that sentiment, saying, \"Indeed, uncertainty remains in the air as the outlook for consumer price inflation remains blurred by ongoing trade policy developments.\"",

      "The Consumer Price Index in March rose 2.4% on an annual basis, showing progress in the Federal Reserve's battle to bring down inflation to a 2% rate.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was forecast to rise 2.6% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "March's report comes after\u00a0inflation rose 2.8% on an annual basis in February.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices actually fell 0.1% in March, the first monthly drop in nearly five years.",
      "Inflation eased last month due partly to lower fuel prices, with gasoline tumbling 9.8% on an annual basis, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said.",
      "Another reason prices fell was sharp drops in travel-related costs, including airfares, which decreased 5.3% just from February to March. Hotel room prices dropped 3.5%.",
      "Economists said those declines in part reflected much slower international demand as the number of tourists visiting the United States has fallen sharply amid Trump's aggressive trade policy.",
      "Visits to the United States from overseas fell nearly 12% last month, according to government data.",
      "What experts say",
      "Easing inflation combined with President Trump's announcement yesterday of a 90-day pause in his reciprocal tariffs should help alleviate some concerns for the Federal Reserve when it meets on May 7 to make its next interest rate decision, said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank.",
      "But because other tariffs orchestrated by Mr. Trump have recently gone into effect \u2014 such as auto tariffs \u2013 inflation nevertheless could pick up later this year, experts say.",
      "Yet March's data is \"backward looking\" and doesn't reflect the trade policy changes orchestrated by the Trump administration, noted Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are still expected to lift inflation later in the year as the impact of the import duties trickle through the economy. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. importers like Walmart when they accept shipments of foreign goods, they typically pass off all or some of the tariff cost onto consumers through higher prices.",
      "The president's 90-day pause excludes China, a major exporter to the U.S., which will continue to face tariffs of 125% on its goods. And Mr. Trump's 10% universal duty will also likely to push up prices in the coming months, economists say. The higher import taxes will likely weigh on the economy's growth as well.",
      "What the CPI shows about egg prices",
      "Although consumer prices cooled in March, the CPI data showed egg prices continued to inch higher last month. According to the CPI figures, egg prices increased in March to reach a new record-high of $6.23 despite a drop in wholesale prices and no egg farms having bird flu outbreaks.",
      "More recently, grocers have told CBS News that egg prices are\u00a0showing signs of easing.",
      "Bird flu outbreaks were cited as the major cause of price spikes in January and February after more than 30 million egg-laying chickens were killed to prevent the spread of the disease.",
      "Since the current bird flu outbreak began, more than 168 million birds have been slaughtered, most of them egg-laying chickens. Any time a bird gets sick, the entire flock is killed to help keep bird flu from spreading. That can have an effect on the egg supply because massive egg farms may have millions of birds.",
      "What the CPI means for your money",
      "Despite today's cooler-than-expected CPI numbers, inflationary risks are still a threat to the U.S. economy, especially as some of Mr. Trump's tariffs are still in place while others are merely delayed, experts say.",
      "\"Going forward, the Fed is likely to face a difficult trade-off as tariff-driven price increases start to feed through to the inflation data and activity remains soft,\" Haigh said. \"We expect the Fed's initial reaction to be cautious, but the risks remain that a sharper than expected slowdown in the economy could result in a resumption of the Fed's easing cycle.\"",
      "Three of four economists polled by FactSet expect the Fed will hold rates steady at its next meeting on May 7. The current federal funds \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 now stands in a range 4.5% to 4.75%.",
      "That means consumers and businesses are unlikely to see any relief on loan rates in the near term, although economists are penciling in cuts later in the year, with the majority forecasting a reduction at the Fed's June 18 meeting.",

      "Sony, which produces the two iconic game shows, filed a complaint in October 2024 alleging that CBS entered into unauthorized licensing agreements. Specifically, the entertainment company claimed CBS licensed the shows at below-market rates and failed to maximize advertising revenue, among other alleged contract violations (CBS News and CBS are owned by Paramount Global.)",

    "summary": "President Trump had brushed off the stock market's plunge, but turmoil in the bond market got his administration's attention.",
    "story": [
      "Even as stocks plunged in reaction to his administration's sweeping tariffs, President Trump expressed\u00a0confidence in his trade policies, saying last week that \"markets are going to boom.\" But by Wednesday, a collective thumb's down to the tariffs by bond investors had given Mr. Trump pause.",
      "With U.S. and global financial market tumbling, he abruptly suspended his administration's \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of other countries for 90 days, acknowledging that the bond market was \"getting a little queasy.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's about-face was by no means the first time a sitting American president had blinked in the face of bond investors expressing alarm over U.S. policies they viewed as fiscally reckless and harmful to their portfolios. In their first terms, both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also found themselves knocked back when the bond market rebelled at the cost of some of their strategic priorities.",
      "The \"bond vigilantes\" ride again",
      "Americans might think of bonds as a less risky asset class they turn to in their 401(k)s to offset more volatile investments, such as stock. But the $2.8 trillion Treasury market is also a bedrock of the U.S. government. The federal government finances the country's debt by selling Treasury bills to investors, who prize the asset because of the country's sterling credit rating and its guarantee of making good on interest payments.",
      "As the Trump administration's reciprocal tariffs went into effect on Wednesday, the bond prices slid and the yield on 2-year Treasury notes rose by as much as 0.3 percentage points, marking the biggest intraday move since 2009, according to financial data firm FactSet. (Bond prices move in inverse relation to their interest rates, or yields.)",
      "Such sudden moves can signal that investors are dumping their bonds. That pushes bond prices lower but boosts yields, which are the returns that bond holders pay to investors.",
      "\"Why is this happening? Fixed-income investors may be starting to worry that the Chinese and other foreigners might start selling their U.S. Treasuries,\" economist Ed Yardeni said in an April 8 research note.",
      "Yardeni, who coined the term \"bond vigilantes\" in the 1980s to describe fixed-income investors who express their disapproval of government policies by dumping Treasuries, added that the bond market was cautioning that \"the Trump administration may be playing with liquid nitro.\"",
      "In another report after Mr. Trump announced the tariff pause, Yardeni noted, \"The Bond Vigilantes have struck again. As far as we can tell, at least with respect to U.S. financial markets, they are the only 1.000 hitters in history.\"",
      "Some Trump administration officials acknowledged that the bond market's hostile reaction to the tariffs influenced the decision to pause the tariffs.",
      "\"[The] bond market was telling us, 'Hey, it is probably time to move,'\" White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett\u00a0said\u00a0on CNBC on Thursday.",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump announced his April 2 tariffs, economists raised concerns\u00a0about the potential impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The president claimed the tariffs, which he called \"reciprocal\" because they were aimed at equalizing the trade barriers between the U.S. and its trading partners, would help revive manufacturing to the U.S. and raise revenue for the federal government.",
      "But experts warned that the tariffs, which ranged from a baseline 10% for most nations up to more than 100% for Chinese imports, raised the risks of a recession and would likely reignite inflation. Investors dumped stocks and bonds as they digested the economic risks of Mr. Trump's tariff barrage.",
      "While the stock market plunge hurt millions of Americans' retirement savings, the turmoil in the bond market creates very real pressures on the nation's finances. Because the Treasury Department pays interest to debt holders, any increase in yields puts more financial strain on the nation's coffers.",
      "\"Developments in the last 24 hours suggest we may be headed for serious financial crisis wholly induced by U.S. government tariff policy,\" Harvard University economist and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers\u00a0said\u00a0in an April 9 thread on social media.",
      "He added, \"Long-term interest rates are gapping up, even as the stock market moves sharply downwards. This highly unusual pattern suggests a generalized aversion to U.S. assets in global financial markets.  We are being treated by global financial markets like a problematic emerging market.\"",
      "An expensive problem",
      "Given the size of the Treasury market, the surging bond yields and broader market turmoil could create an expensive problem for the federal government. For Mr. Trump, the timing was especially poor as he pushes Congress to pass an extension of his 2017 tax cuts, which are forecast to cost trillions over the next decade.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. spent more than $1 trillion to service its debt, more than double its roughly $500 billion in 2020, according to Treasury data. That's largely due to higher interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve to battle the post-pandemic surge in inflation.",
      "An increase in bond yields could add to that expense, putting even more pressure on the federal budget.",
      "\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market selloff, once the bond market began to weaken, too, it was only a matter of time before he folded on his eye-wateringly high tariffs,\" noted economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics in an April 9 research note.",

U.S. stocks are also still below where they were just a week ago, when Trump announced worldwide tariffs on what he called \"Liberation Day.\"",

The index is now down 11.2% from its record.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 08:42:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's aggressive use of tariffs has fueled concerns about the economy and roiled the stock market.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's barrage of \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries around the world this year has rattled consumers, businesses and investors. Although President Trump on Wednesday announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, he upped import duties on Chinese goods to 125% \u2014 escalating a conflict between the world's two largest economies.",
      "We asked you what questions you had about tariffs and answered some of those in a CBS News 24/7 special. Read on for some answers to your questions below.",
      "Are global tariffs legal, and have U.S. levies on other countries risen or fallen over the years?",
      "CBS MoneyWatch: Tariffs are legal under World Trade Organization rules, although participating countries must comply with certain restrictions and levies are generally capped.",
      "As a result, nations have long had the right to impose multilateral tariffs, although those costs vary widely based on trade agreements, product type and many other factors.",
      "In the 19th century, average U.S. tariff rates on trading partners routinely exceeded 30%. The government sharply reduced those levies after the Great Depression, cutting them to single digits. After resuming power in 2025, President Trump raised the effective U.S. tariff to 22% \u2014 the highest since 1909.",
      "For the Trump administration, are these massive tariffs intended to pressure other nations into more favorable trade deals, or is the goal to push American businesses to invest more in domestic manufacturing? Or both?",
      "Both, correct. These historically large tariffs have several main objectives. In the short term, the tariffs are intended to pressure countries to come to the table to negotiate what Mr. Trump sees as more favorable trade deals.",
      "Over the long term, Trump administration officials say that sharply raising U.S. tariffs will spur both domestic and foreign companies eager to avoid the added costs to expand here at home, creating jobs, reinvigorating manufacturers and boosting economic growth.",
      "President Trump has also long argued that global trade rules, enshrined in entities like the World Trade Organization, disdvantage the U.S. by, for example, permitting countries like China, Germany and Japan to subsidize key industries. He blames those rules for fueling large global trade imbalances that have saddled the U.S. with a large, and growing, trade deficit.",
      "Another goal of tariffs is to generate federal revenue \u2014 funds that Mr. Trump will likely need to offset additional tax cuts he has promised to Americans and to corporations.",
      "Why do some people oppose deploying tariffs against countries that impose tariffs on the U.S.?",
      "Most mainstream economists think the kind of sweeping tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump on nearly all U.S. imports act as a tax on businesses and consumers. Such levies raise the cost of many essential items, leading to higher prices for American households; depress economic growth; and could even trigger a recession.",
      "Under this view, a trade war in which countries jack up tariffs on their economic partners effectively makes them all poorer.",
      "By contrast, trade experts also say that targeted tariffs \u2014 implemented as but one element in a larger industrial strategy \u2014 can help protect critical U.S. industries and workers from unfair foreign competition.",
      "How do these tariffs impact consumers, especially when it comes to prices on everyday items like groceries or housewares?",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers such as Walmart, which must pay the fees to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass on most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices.",
      "For instance, after Mr. Trump added tariffs to imported washing machines during his first term, the median price of those appliances jumped more than 11%, tacking on about $86 to the cost of a new unit, according to University of Chicago researchers.",
      "While consumers can opt for U.S.-made merchandise, domestic manufacturers also may raise their prices due to tariffs. Sometimes that's due to an increase in the cost of imported goods they need to manufacture their products. But some companies also take the opportunity to hike prices because the newly expensive foreign-made products provide them with more pricing flexibility.",
      "Without Mr. Trump's pause, imported vegetables, fruit and nuts were set to rise by 19% due to the tariffs, according to a recent analysis from the Yale Budget Lab, a public policy think tank. That would have boosted prices for those foods by more than 6%, after adjusting for an expected 0.6% increase in the cost of the same items grown in the U.S.",
      "What's the long-term outlook \u2014 are these tariffs likely to strengthen the U.S. economy or just cause temporary disruption?",
      "Economists say Mr. Trump's tariffs have increased the risk that the U.S. and other nations could tumble into a recession in the next year. Because tariffs raise prices, Americans are expected to cut back on spending \u2014 a potentially major problem given that 70 cents of every $1 in the nation's gross domestic product is based on consumer spending.",
      "For instance, the tariffs could slow GDP growth to 1.4% in 2025, while core inflation could rise to 3.9% this year, according to an April 2 forecast from Oxford Economics. That would represent a significant slowdown from the economy's 2.8% growth rate in 2024.",
      "Other experts say leaving sharply higher U.S. tariffs in place could leave much deeper scars. GDP growth could fall by 0.6 percentage points over the next decade, the Yale Budget Lab estimated.",
      "What is the end goal for the Trump administration's tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has said he believes tariffs will bring back manufacturing jobs. By making it more expensive to sell foreign-made goods in the U.S., the president wants to convince American and foreign companies to build factories here.",
      "But he's also highlighted other goals for his tariff barrage, such as convincing other nations to give more favorable trading terms to the U.S.",
      "Lastly, Mr. Trump has pointed to tariffs as a way to raise billions in revenue for the U.S. government, even though economists point out that tariffs are essentially a sales tax which are paid by American consumers.",
      "Does Mr. Trump really think he's going to be able to rebuild manufacturing in America again?",
      "Mr. Trump is adamant that tariffs can revive manufacturing in the U.S., which has been on the decline for at least half a century. Yet economists and other experts aren't so sure.",
      "There are several reasons for their skepticism. For one, building the types of factories and infrastructure to support the manufacturing that is now handled by other nations, such as China and Vietnam, would require years and billions in investment.",
      "The U.S. manufacturing sector has been shrinking for decades, so companies repatriating factories from abroad would struggle to find enough skilled workers, especially in technology and other areas higher up the industrial value chain",
      "And because of the uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's tariffs, some businesses might not want to commit to such an investment given that the import duties might disappear or be sharply lowered \u2014 as they were today.",
      "What could happen to block the U.S. tariff increases?",
      "Several factors could halt the tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump, according to experts.",
      "First, Congress could introduce a resolution to terminate the emergency declaration used by Mr. Trump to issue the tariffs. Since both the Senate and House are controlled by Republicans, that would require several members of the GOP to join Democrats in voting against Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "But Mr. Trump would likely veto any such measure that reached his desk, which means that two-thirds of both chambers would need to vote in favor of the measure in order to make it veto-proof.",
      "Second, the courts could intervene and rule that Mr. Trump has exceeded his authority. Already, there has been a lawsuit filed by a small business in Florida that argues that Mr. Trump has overstepped by issuing the April 2 tariffs, and that the power should belong to Congress alone.",
      "Third, the violent reaction in financial markets that followed Mr. Trump's latest tariff salvo could persuade him to change course. His move on Wednesday to pause many of the tariffs followed a five-day plunge in stocks that put the S&P 500 on the verge of entering a bear market \u2014 when equities fall at least 20% from their most recent high.",
      "That steep decline in stock prices hurts tens of millions of Americans saving for retirement and could lead them to cut their spending, a big drag on economic growth.",

      "The S&P 500's gain was the biggest one-day increase since October 2008, according to financial services company Factset. The Nasdaq's gains were its\u00a0largest since 2001, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "One notable exception to Mr. Trump's decision is China, with the president saying he's increasing the tariff rate on goods imported from that nation to 125%.",
      "\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" he wrote.",
      "Prior to the announcement, the S&P 500 had been down about 17% from its mid-February peak, pushing stocks toward a bear market, or when shares fall more than 20% from their most recent high, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "Even with today's gain, the S&P 500 remains 11% below its February 19 peak of 6,147.",
      "Investors have been spooked by Mr. Trump's escalating trade war, which Wall Street economists warn could raise the risk of a recession and hurt U.S. corporations and consumers by hiking prices on products from almost every nation.",
      "Even before Mr. Trump's announcement, some on Wall Street had expressed optimism that the White House could back down from the latest tariffs, which slapped rates of between 10% to 84% on U.S. trade partners.",
      "Despite the pause, experts noted that uncertainty remains an issue for U.S. businesses, given that the tariffs could restart in 90 days and that the penalties on China \u2014 a major trading partner \u2014 are likely to dampen economic growth.",
      "\"Businesses will be relieved that the destination for trade policy looks like it could be less disruptive than seemed possible yesterday,\" said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. \"Even so, the huge overhang of policy uncertainty will weigh on investment and weak decisions in the next few months.\"",
      "He noted, \"Also, 125% tariffs on Chinese imports will be a huge problem for many businesses if they stay in place.\"",
      "Best stock performers today",
      "The gains were widespread across the U.S. stock market, and 98% of the stocks in the S&P 500 index rallied.",

      "Also leading the way were airlines and other stocks that depend on customers feeling confident enough to travel for work or for vacation. Delta Air Lines soared 23.4%, while American Airlines gained 22.6%.",
      "China trade war intensifies",
      "Still, the trade war continues between the U.S. and China continues to rage. On Wednesday, China said it is raising its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%, up from its previously announced 34%, after President Trump's import duties on Chinese good\u00a0went into effect\u00a0today at a rate of 104%. The retaliation signals Beijing isn't backing down from Mr. Trump's global trade war.",
      "Mr. Trump's broad-based \"reciprocal tariffs,\" which apply to imports of almost every nation, had kicked in after midnight Eastern time in the U.S.",
      "Already, there are signs that some corporations are feeling the impact of Mr. Trump's tariff policies, with Delta on Wednesday pulling its guidance for 2025 as the trade war depresses bookings across the travel sector.",
      "\"With broad economic uncertainty around global trade, growth has largely stalled,\" CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement on Wednesday. \"In this slower-growth environment, we are protecting margins and cash flow by focusing on what we can control.\"",

      "\"China's position is clear and consistent: the door to talks is open, but dialogue must be conducted on an equal basis with mutual respect,\" Commerce Ministry spokeswoman He Yongqian said. \"China will stand by its position until the end. Pressuring, threatening, and blackmailing are not the correct ways to deal with China. We hope that the U.S. will work with China. Based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and a win-win cooperation, we will properly resolve differences through dialogue and consultation.\"",

      "\"The U.S.'s reckless and unjust actions go against the will of the people and are doomed to fail in the end,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said. \"I want to reiterate that in a tariff war or trade war, there are no winners. China does not want a trade war, but we are not afraid of one. We will never stand by and watch the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people be undermined, nor will we allow international trade rules and the multilateral trading system to be trampled upon. If the United States insists on waging a tariff war or trade war, China will fight to the end.\"",

      "Some nations are facing only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries are charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy.

      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",

Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump raised the tariff rate to 125%, effective immediately.",
      "The price for the popular tech tool, which starts at $599 for the most basic model, the iPhone 16e, is poised to increase by hundreds of dollars, depending on how Apple responds to the sweeping levies. The iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which features Apple Intelligence, costs $999.",
      "The iPhone accounts for about half of Apple's revenue. Most of its smartphones are manufactured in China.",

      "What if Apple moved production to the U.S.?",
      "President Trump has said the new U.S. tariffs are aimed at spurring both domestic and foreign companies to build in the U.S. But for Apple and other companies, manufacturing their products in the U.S. entail significantly higher labor costs \u2014 costs that would largely be passed on to consumers.",
      "If Apple were to begin assembling iPhones in the U.S, a Chinese-made device that previously sold for $1,000 would cost $3,500 if manufactured in New Jersey, Texas or some other state, Ives estimated.",
      "\"Saying we can just make this in the USA is a statement that incredibly understates the complexity of the Asia supply chain and the way electronics, chips, semi fabs, hardware, smartphones, etc. are made for U.S. consumers over the last 30 years,\" he said in a report.",

      "China said it is raising its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%, up from its previously announced 34%, after President Trump's import duties on Chinese good\u00a0went into effect today at a rate of 104%.",
      "Mr. Trump's broad-based tariffs, which apply to imports of almost every nation, kicked in after midnight Eastern time in the U.S. But on Wednesday afternoon the president announced he is pausing most of the new import taxes for 90 days and lowering the \"reciprocal tariff\" rate to 10%, effective immediately,",
      "At the same time, Mr. Trump said he's increasing the tariff on Chinese imports to 125%.",
      "\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" he wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The president continued, \"At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.\"",
      "China decries U.S. \"mistake\"",
      "China's announcement signals Beijing isn't backing down in a global trade war sparked by Mr. Trump's April 2 decision to levy so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on almost every nation. In response to that announcement, China said it would counter by placing the same duty \u2014 34% at the time \u2014 on U.S. imports, which prompted Mr. Trump to slap another 50% tariff on Chinese imports.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs be paid by U.S. companies that import products from China. Those companies are likely to pass on the cost of all or some of the import duties to American consumers, hiking prices on everything from iPhones to clothing made in China, according to experts.",
      "In an April 9 statement, China said called Mr. Trump's decision to add another 50% tariff as a \"mistake upon a mistake.\" It also called Mr. Trump's tariffs as an example of \"unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying.\"",
      "Wednesday's newest measures from Beijing include adding 11 American companies to a so-called \"unreliable entities\" list that would bar Chinese companies from selling them dual-use goods. Among the companies are American Photonics, and SYNEXXUS, both of whom work with the American military.",
      "So far, China has not appeared interested in bargaining. \"If the U.S. truly wants to resolve issues through dialogue and negotiation, it should adopt an attitude of equality, respect and mutual benefit,\" said Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Lin Jian Wednesday.",
      "China now controls about 35% of the world's manufacturing, compared with 12% for the U.S.,\u00a0according to the Centre for Economic Policy Research. Beijing has also expanded its exports to other countries, particularly developing nations, as it seeks to lessen its reliance on the U.S., research group Onyx Strategic Insights noted in a recent report.",
      "\"China has spent the last five years Trump-proofing its economy \u2014 it has been working to nationalize supply chains, it has been working to penetrate different export markets, particularly in the developing world,\" Scott Lincicome, a trade expert at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. China is \"willing to endure the pain, thinking they can handle it longer than we can, and they might have a point.\"",
      "China was the third-largest export market for the U.S. in 2023, following Canada and Mexico, with $145 billion in goods shipped to the Asian nation that year, according to the U.S.-China Business Council. Oilseeds and grains are the top export that the U.S. sends to China, followed by oil and gas.",
      "EU also hitting back",
      "Separately, the European Union on Wednesday announced its own retaliatory measures against the U.S. The 27-country trading bloc announced tariffs on more than $22 billion in U.S. products, including soybeans, motorcycles and beauty products, according to AFP.",

      "On April 2, Mr. Trump announced what he called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on virtually every nation the U.S. does trade with. Despite stock markets around the globe descending into tumult and economists warning for months that it will be consumers who pay the price for the levies, Mr. Trump has not backed down, insisting the measures will help the U.S. balance its trade deficit with other nations in the longer term.",
      "But in the near term, many Americans' adult beverages of choice, including European wines and Scotch whisky, are likely to come at more of a premium, according to industry insiders.",
      "Bartholomew Broadbent, who owns the Virginia-based wine wholesaler and importer Broadbent Selections, warned the impact on retail prices in the U.S. is going to be \"a lot worse than people think.\"",
      "French wines, as an example, will be subject to 20% tariffs under the measures announced by Mr. Trump. But Broadbent told CBS News the real-world price increase will be closer to 30%, because the cost of the tariff will be compounded at every stage of a bottle or crate's journey to a store shelf \u2014 with producers in France and other nations, along with importers like himself and then distributors and retailers all adding their own mark-ups.",
      "\"The price is going to have to go up,\" he said.",

      "Broadbent, whose company imports wines from 11 different countries and it also works with wineries in California, said more than 80% of his business will now face new tariffs. Wines from South Africa will be the most heavily impacted, he said, as the White House has hit the country with a steep 30% tariff.",
      "\"I don't see a single person who can benefit from this,\" Broadbent said. \"Even the wineries in America will suffer badly because they're all buying barrels and corks from Europe.\"",
      "The tariffs sent shockwaves through the global wine industry, with France's Bourgogne Wine Board (BIVB) warning the levies risked \"pushing our wines past a psychological price threshold.\"",
      "Bourgogne \u2014 or the Burgundy region as it's known in English \u2014 exported nearly 21 million bottles of wine to the U.S. in 2024, according to the BIVB, which agreed with the assessment that Mr. Trump's tariffs will have a negative impact on everyone, from French exporters and their distributor partners to American consumers.",
      "\"The industry deeply regrets this decision,\" the BIVB said in a press release",
      "The people who make, sell and enjoy Scotland's world renowned distilled spirits are also staring down the barrel of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Last year alone, about 132 million bottles of Scotch whisky were imported into the U.S. market, according to the Scotch Whisky Association.",
      "The mood in Scotland is one of \"frustration and uncertainty,\" according to Drew McKenzie Smith, who founded and runs the Lindores Abbey Distillery just north of Edinburgh.",
      "McKenzie Smith estimated that the 10% baseline tariff Mr. Trump imposed on the U.K. would see the price of a bottle of his Scotch hiked by about the same amount for American consumers. So a bottle that currently costs $60 will soon jump to $66, be believes.",
      "While that \"may not sound severe,\" McKenzie Smith told CBS News, \"it still adds a meaningful burden \u2014 especially for smaller producers like us.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court ruled Thursday the U.S. must facilitate the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador and imprisoned.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department told a federal judge Friday that it is unable to provide information she requested about a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador and called a deadline set by the judge to provide the details \"impracticable.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Trump administration to give her information about Kilmar Abrego Garcia after the Supreme Court on Thursday reaffirmed her directive for the federal government to \"facilitate\" his release from Salvadoran custody.",
      "Shortly after the Supreme Court issued its order, Xinis directed Homeland Security officials to provide Abrego Garcia's physical location and custodial status, what steps they have taken to facilitate his immediate return to the U.S. and what further steps the government will take and when to help with his return. She initially gave the department a deadline of 9:30 a.m. Friday but extended it by two hours after the Justice Department filed a motion to ask for an extension until next week.",
      "During a hearing Friday afternoon, Xinis asked Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, why he could not provide answers to her questions, including on Abrego Garcia's whereabouts.",
      "\"I'm not asking for state secrets,\" she said. \"I'm asking a very simple question: where is he?\"",
      "Ensign repeatedly said he was not given information that he could provide to the court, including Abrego Garica's custodial status and who had authority over him. Trump administration officials are still evaluating the Supreme Court's order, he said.",
      "Xinis repeatedly pressed Ensign about where Abrego Garcia is. He noted that his lawyers said Abrego Garcia's last known location is in El Salvador and acknowledged the government has not put forth information to the contrary.",
      "The judge called the lack of evidence from the Justice Department about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts \"extremely troubling.\"",
      "\"It behooves this case and how the system of justice works that the following be communicated to your clients: You are the officer of the court. You are the instrument to represent\" the government, Xinis said. She said that the record in the case currently shows that despite her directive to take steps to bring Agrego Garcia back to the U.S., \"your clients have done nothing to facilitate\" his return.",
      "\"I'm not sure what to take from the fact that the Supreme Court has spoken quite clearly and yet I can't get an answer today about what you've done, if anything, in the past,\" Xinis said.",
      "Ensign told the judge that the federal government \"intends to comply with the Supreme Court's order.\" He said that while the administration is prepared to answer her questions about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts and what actions have been taken to secure his return, they may assert privileges.",
      "Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's lawyer, said his lawyers and family have not had contact with Abrego Garcia, and accused the Trump administration of \"playing games with their own lawyers.\"",
      "\"They clearly didn't comply\" with the district court's order to turn over information about Abrego Garcia, he said.",
      "Xinis said she plans to order the Justice Department to provide daily updates as to the answers to her questions.",
      "In a filing to the court ahead of the hearing, Justice Department attorneys told the judge they \"are not in a position where they 'can' share any information requested by the court. That is the reality.\"",
      "\"Defendants received the order late in the evening last night. They are reviewing the order and actively evaluating next steps,\" they wrote. \"It is unreasonable and impracticable for defendants to reveal potential steps before those steps are reviewed, agreed upon, and vetted. Foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines, in part because it involves sensitive country-specific considerations wholly inappropriate for judicial review.\"",
      "The Justice Department lawyers said that the judge gave them an \"insufficient amount of time\" to review the Supreme Court's order and argued she has not yet provided clarity as to the scope of her initial directive, as the high court told her\u00a0to do.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys opposed the government's motion and accused the Justice Department of continuing \"to delay, obfuscate, and flout court orders, while a man's life and safety is at risk.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia, who lives in Maryland with his wife and children, was arrested and removed to El Salvador last month after Trump administration officials accused him of having ties to the MS-13 gang.\u00a0 His lawyers said he has no affiliation with MS-13, and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "The 29-year-old is being confined at the notorious Salvadoran prison known as CECOT, along with other migrants sent there by the administration as part of an agreement with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. Under the deal, the U.S. government is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to hold U.S. detainees.",
      "But Abrego Garica's case emerged as a flashpoint in President Trump's immigration crackdown after a U.S. immigration official acknowledged in a court filing that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\"",
      "In 2019, an immigration judge granted Abrego Garcia relief known as withholding of removal, which forbids the government from returning him to his home country of El Salvador because he is more likely than not to face persecution from local gangs, according to court records.",
      "While the Trump administration admitted the error in sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it has argued that the district court has no jurisdiction over the Salvadoran government and therefore cannot force it to release Abrego Garcia from its prison. Justice Department lawyers have said that the Salvadoran government has custody of Abrego Garcia, so he cannot be returned to the U.S. unless it releases him.",
      "Abrego Garcia and his wife filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland following his arrest and removal, alleging it violated federal immigration law. They sought an order requiring his return to U.S. custody.",
      "Xinis granted that request last week following a hearing and directed the government to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. no later than 11:59 p.m. Monday. The dispute ended up before the Supreme Court, and Chief Justice John Roberts put that deadline on hold to allow the high court more time to consider the matter.",
      "Then, on Thursday, the Supreme Court unanimously agreed that the Trump administration had to \"facilitate\" the release of Abrego Garcia from Salvadoran custody and \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador\" \u2014 to provide Abrego Garcia with due process of law.",
      "But the Supreme Court also directed the district court to clarify its order, and specifically the directive that the government \"effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return.",
      "\"The district court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" the court said. \"For its part, the government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.\"",

      "A Space Force spokesperson said Meyers was removed by Col. Kenneth Klock for \"loss of confidence in her ability to lead.\" \"Commanders are expected to adhere to the highest standards of conduct, especially as it relates to remaining nonpartisan in the performance of their duties,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Vance visited Pituffik Space Base along with second lady Usha Vance in late March, where he\u00a0criticized\u00a0Denmark's leadership of the semi-autonomous island, claiming the NATO country has \"not done a good job by the people of Greenland\" and \"underinvested in the security architecture.\" Vance suggested Greenlanders could seek independence from Denmark and \"we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there.\" He said he did not believe military force would be needed to take over the island, echoing Mr. Trump's statements.",

      "Mr. Trump, who at 78 is the oldest president to be sworn in for a new term, had his last known comprehensive examination in September 2023. He released only limited details from that visit. A source familiar with the president's upcoming physical said he is not expected to take a cognitive test.",

      "\"The basic thing they're going to be doing are vital signs, your heart, lung, abdominal exam that you're used to getting at the doctor's office,\" said CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder. \"Basic labs like your cholesterol, your blood sugar, maybe kidney and liver tests. And then if there is a prior medical history of risk factor or some other issue, maybe an EKG, a chest X-ray, ultrasound, echocardiogram, that sort of thing.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 12:27:10 -0400",
    "summary": "Recent cuts eliminated a small, specialized workforce that sets the poverty standards determining who is eligible for Medicaid as well as assistance with food, home heating, child care, and more.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's firings at the Department of Health and Human Services included the entire office that sets federal poverty guidelines, which determine whether tens of millions of Americans are eligible for health programs such as Medicaid, food assistance, child care, and other services, former staff said.",
      "The small team, with technical data expertise, worked out of HHS' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, or ASPE. Their dismissal mirrored others across HHS, which came without warning and left officials puzzled as to why they were \"RIF'ed\" \u2014 as in \"reduction in force,\" the bureaucratic language used to describe the firings.",
      "\"I suspect they RIF'ed offices that had the word 'data' or 'statistics' in them,\" said one of the laid-off employees, a social scientist whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because the person feared further recrimination. \"It was random, as far as we can tell.\"",
      "Among those fired was Kendall Swenson, who had led development of the poverty guidelines for many years and was considered the repository of knowledge on the issue, according to the social scientist and two academics who have worked with the HHS team.",
      "The sacking of the office could lead to cuts in assistance to low-income families next year unless the Trump administration restores the positions or moves its duties elsewhere, said Robin Ghertner, the fired director of the Division of Data and Technical Analysis, which had overseen the guidelines.",
      "The poverty guidelines are \"needed by many people and programs,\" said Timothy Smeeding, a professor emeritus of economics at the La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin. \"If you're thinking of someone you fired who should be rehired, Swenson would be a no-brainer,\" he added.",
      "Under a 1981 appropriations bill, HHS is required annually to take Census Bureau poverty-line figures, adjust them for inflation, and create guidelines that agencies and states use to determine who is eligible for various types of help.",
      "There's a special sauce for creating the guidelines that includes adjustments and calculations, Ghertner said. Swenson and three other staff members would independently prepare the numbers and quality-check them together before they were issued each January.",
      "Everyone in Ghertner's office was told last week, without warning, that they were being put on administrative leave until June 1, when their employment would officially end, he said.",
      "\"There's literally no one in the government who knows how to calculate the guidelines,\" he said. \"And because we're all locked out of our computers, we can't teach anyone how to calculate them.\"",
      "ASPE had about 140 staff members and now has about 40, according to a former staffer. The HHS shake-up merged the office with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, whose staff has shrunk from 275 to about 80, according to a former AHRQ official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "HHS has said it laid off about 10,000 employees and that, combined with other moves, including a program to encourage early retirements, its workforce has been reduced by about 20,000. But the agency has not detailed where it made the cuts or identified specific employees it fired.",
      "\"These workers were told they couldn't come into their offices so there's no transfer of knowledge,\" said Wendell Primus, who worked at ASPE during the Bill Clinton administration. \"They had no time to train anyone, transfer data, etc.\"",
      "HHS defended the firings. The department merged AHRQ and ASPE \"as part of Secretary Kennedy's vision to streamline HHS to better serve Americans,\"\u00a0 spokesperson Emily Hilliard said. \"Critical programs within ASPE will continue in this new office\" and \"HHS will continue to comply with statutory requirements,\" she said in a written response to KFF Health News.",
      "After this article published, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon called KFF Health News to say others at HHS could do the work of the RIF'ed data analysis team, which had nine members. \"The idea that this will come to a halt is totally incorrect,\" he said. \"Eighty million people will not be affected.\"",
      "Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has so far declined to testify about the staff reductions before congressional committees that oversee much of his agency. On April 9, a delegation of 10 Democratic members of Congress waited fruitlessly for a meeting in the agency's lobby.",
      "The group was led by House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee ranking member Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), who told reporters afterward that Kennedy must appear before the committee \"and tell us what his plan is for keeping America healthy and for stopping these devastating cuts.\"",
      "Matt VanHyfte, a spokesperson for the Republican committee leadership, said HHS officials would meet with bipartisan committee staff on April 11 to discuss the firings and other policy issues.",
      "ASPE serves as a think tank for the HHS secretary, said Primus, who later was Rep. Nancy Pelosi's senior health policy adviser for 18 years. In addition to the poverty guidelines, the office maps out how much Medicaid money goes to each state and reviews all regulations developed by HHS agencies.",
      "\"These HHS staffing cuts \u2014 20,000 \u2014 obviously they are completely nuts,\" Primus said. \"These were not decisions made by Kennedy or staff at HHS. They are being made at the White House. There's no rhyme or reasons to what they're doing.\"",
      "HHS leaders may be unaware of their legal duty to issue the poverty guidelines, Ghertner said. If each state and federal government agency instead sets guidelines on its own, it could create inequities and lead to lawsuits, he said.",
      "And sticking with the 2025 standard next year could put benefits for hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk, Ghertner said. The current poverty level is $15,650 for a single person and $32,150 for a family of four.",
      "\"If you make $30,000 and have three kids, say, and next year you make $31,000 but prices have gone up 7%, suddenly your $31,000 doesn't buy you the same,\" he said, \"but if the guidelines haven't increased, you might be no longer eligible for Medicaid.\"",
      "The 2025 poverty level for a family of five is $37,650.",
      "As of October, about 79 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children's Health Insurance Program, both of which are means-tested and thus depend on the poverty guidelines to determine eligibility.",
      "Eligibility for premium subsidies for insurance plans sold in Affordable Care Act marketplaces is also tied to the official poverty level.",
      "One in eight Americans rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, and 40% of newborns and their mothers receive food through the Women, Infants, and Children program, both of which also use the federal poverty level to determine eligibility.",
      "Former employees in the office said they were not disloyal to the president. They knew their jobs required them to follow the administration's objectives. \"We were trying to support the MAHA agenda,\" the social scientist said, referring to Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" rubric. \"Even if it didn't align with our personal worldviews, we wanted to be useful.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Senate committee heard from several experts Thursday on setting a year-round time standard instead of switching back and forth with daylight saving time. President Trump recently called it a \"50/50 issue,\" but he previously vowed to get rid of daylight saving.",
      "At the hearing, the committee's chairman, Sen. Ted Cruz, said there is a general consensus among his colleagues that the system of switching the clocks needs to be changed, but he said there is disagreement about whether to adopt universal standard time or daylight saving time.",
      "\"I personally struggle with the two choices here, because it's a question of what do you care about more: sunshine and joy and fun and money, or health, mental health, physical health,\" said Cruz, a Republican from Texas. \"And the honest answer for most people, gosh, I care about all that stuff.\"",
      "Cruz said an alternative has been discussed to pick daylight saving time, but letting states opt out. Arizona and Hawaii current opt out of changing the clock. But others said in Thursday's hearing that having different standards for different states could cause widespread confusion.",
      "The Senate Commerce Committee hearing notice did not set a preference for daylight saving time or standard time, but instead said it would focus on \"various issues around whether the country should continue 'springing forward' and 'falling back' each year with time.\"",
      "Daylight saving time begins in March, when clocks are moved forward an hour, and ends in October, when the clocks go back to standard time.",
      "The twice-yearly time changes are\u00a0generally unpopular\u00a0among Americans, with 63% saying they\u00a0would like to eliminate\u00a0them completely, compared to just 16% who said they would not, according to an Economist/YouGov poll in November 2021.",
      "\"People across our country are tired of the constant cycle of falling back and springing forward,\" Democratic Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware said, calling it time for a \"thoughtful solution\" across the country.",
      "\"The important thing is that we land of something consistent and make smart investments to keep people safe,\" she said.",
      "\"Time is always complicated and the system we have is complicated, but it's complicated because it's a human creation,\" said Scott Yates, the founder of the Lock the Clock movement, which supports getting rid of twice-yearly time changes.",
      "\"The sun moving around the earth doesn't actually have anything to do with time,\" Yates said. \"We need this system, but this system has this bug right now, and the bug is daylight saving time, the switching of the clocks. And so if we have a little bit of time, a couple of years, so the individual states can address all of these complexities and make those decisions, then we will be able to get rid of this bug permanently. It is something we have been stuck with since World War I, and this is our opportunity to finally fix it.\"",
      "A 2020\u00a0commentary\u00a0for the journal JAMA Neurology found evidence linking the annual transition to daylight saving time to\u00a0increased strokes,\u00a0heart attacks\u00a0and\u00a0teen sleep deprivation.",
      "The Senate in 2022 passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act to make daylight saving time permanent, but the bill never went anywhere in the House. The 2022 bill had 17 cosponsors from both parties and was spearheaded by then-Sen. Marco Rubio, who is now the Secretary of State in the Trump administration.",
      "President Trump has given a range of comments about his views. He said in March that it's a \"50/50 issue,\" saying \"it's hard to get excited about it. I assume people would like to have more light later, but some people want to have more light earlier because they don't want to take their kids to school in the dark.\"",
      "But on Friday, after the latest hearing, he posted on social media: \"The House and Senate should push hard for more Daylight at the end of a day. Very popular and, most importantly, no more changing of the clocks, a big inconvenience and, for our government, A VERY COSTLY EVENT!!!\"",
      "In December, he said the \"Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn't!\"",
      "Mr. Trump in the past had supported making daylight saving time\u00a0permanent \u2014 that is, keeping clocks shifted one hour ahead, which happens in the spring. His\u00a0December comment\u00a0called for daylight saving time to be eliminated.",
      "In addition to Yates, testifying Thursday was Jay Karen, chief executive officer of the National Golf Course Owners Association; Karin Johnson, practicing physician and professor of neurology at UMass Chan School of Medicine Baystate, on behalf of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine; and David Harkey, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.",

      "Presidents Trump and Biden are the two oldest presidents ever to be sworn in. When Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2025, he eclipsed Biden by a few months to take the record. Both were inaugurated at age 78, but Mr. Trump was about 5 months older.",
      "The third oldest president at his inauguration was Ronald Reagan, who was 69 when he was sworn in in 1981. \"I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience,\" Reagan famously said in 1984 while running for reelection against Walter Mondale.",
      "In fourth place is the nation's ninth president, William Henry Harrison. Harrison was elected in 1841 at age 68, but his tenure as president was short-lived. He died 32 days into his first term, making his presidency the shortest in U.S. history.",
      "Who are the oldest living U.S. presidents?",
      "The oldest living president is Biden, who turned 82 on Nov. 20, 2024, just weeks after the election. Mr. Trump and two former presidents, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, all 78 years old, roughly tied for second.",
      "Who was the longest-living president?",
      "Jimmy Carter who died at the age of 100\u00a0in December 2024, was the oldest living former U.S. president in history. Carter, a Democrat from Georgia, served one term, from 1977 to 1981. He\u00a0broke the longevity milestone in 2019, at 94 years old, surpassing George H.W. Bush to become the longest-living president.",
      "More than 1,000 people recently paid tribute to the former president at a\u00a0benefit concert\u00a0ahead of his centennial. He\u00a0celebrated his 100th birthday\u00a0on Oct. 1, 2024, more than a year after it was announced he had entered hospice care.",
      "After he left office more than 40 years ago, Carter kept busy building more than 4,000 homes for Habitat for Humanity, traveled the world to promote human rights and won the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "Full list of U.S. presidents, from oldest to youngest at end of presidency",
      "The list ranges from Biden, at 82, down to John F. Kennedy, who was just 46 when he was assassinated. Mr. Trump will also be 82 at the end of his second term in 2029.",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 01:12:00 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. and Russian intelligence agencies negotiated an agreement to free American Ksenia Karelina in exchange for a Russian detainee.",
    "story": [
      "Russia released Ksenia Karelina, a dual U.S.-Russian national who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason in August last year, in a new prison swap on Thursday. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed her release in a social media post early Thursday, but offered no information about the terms of her release.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported\u00a0Karelina's release, saying she was freed in a swap arranged by the two countries' intelligence agencies, and a CIA official later told CBS News that the agency had played a central role in the deal on behalf of the U.S. government.",
      "\"American Ksenia Karelina is on a plane back home to the United States,\" Rubio said in his post. \"She was wrongfully detained by Russia for over a year and President Trump secured her release.\"",
      "The plane landed around 11 p.m. EDT at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where she was greeted by several people including her boyfriend, professional boxer Chris van Heerden. In a touching moment, Karelina and van Heerden had a long embrace.",
      "In a statement first published by the Journal and later provided to CBS News, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said, \"President Trump brought home another wrongfully detained American from Russia,\" and added his praise for \"the CIA officers who worked tirelessly to support this effort\" and for the United Arab Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which he said had enabled the exchange. The swap of the two detainees was carried out in Abu Dhabi.",
      "Ratcliffe was directly involved in the negotiations, which he conducted with an unnamed senior Russian intelligence official, the CIA said.",
      "The top level communication indicates a deepening of efforts by the Trump administration to improve ties with Moscow. Mr. Trump has been pushing both Russia and Ukraine to negotiate a peace agreement to end the three-year war sparked by Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of its neighbor.",
      "In exchange for Karelina, who lives in California, the CIA official confirmed that the U.S. had freed Arthur Petrov, a German-Russian national arrested in Cyprus 2023 at the request of U.S. authorities. According to the Journal, he was being held on allegations of exporting sensitive microelectronics.",
      "\"Much of the swap was negotiated by the U.S. government, with CIA playing a key role engaging with Russian intelligence,\" a CIA spokesperson said Thursday, adding, \"The exchange shows the importance of keeping lines of communication open with Russia, despite the deep challenges in our bilateral relationship.\"",
      "Karelina was sentenced to 12 years in a Russian penal colony after pleading guilty to treason. She was arrested while on visit to Russia for donating about $51 to an American-based humanitarian group that was helping Ukrainians impacted by the war, according to Russian state media.",
      "Her lawyers said she acknowledged transferring the funds, though she did not admit she intentionally directed them to organizations that might have used the money for actions against Russia. She didn't expect that her donation would end up supporting anti-Russian activities, according to her lawyers.",
      "Van Heerden\u00a0told CBS News last year that she had made the small donation in 2022, \"exercising her First Amendment rights,\" adding that \"she has done nothing wrong.\"",
      "Van Heerden said he was uneasy about Karelina's decision to return to Russia for a visit, given the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, but he said she \"had no worry in the world,\" and that she had assured him it would be safe since she was entering the country as a dual American-Russian citizen.",
      "\"She wanted to go home. She made it very clear that she wanted to go home,\" Van Heerden told Gayle King on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Wanting to fulfill her wish to visit home, Van Heerden said he bought her a plane ticket as a birthday gift, and the pair first traveled together to Istanbul. He had originally intended to travel with her to Russia from there, but he didn't feel comfortable, so she traveled alone to Russia, and he returned to Los Angeles.",
      "Russia imprisoned a number of Americans as tension with Washington soared amid the build up to, and eventually the full-scale war in Ukraine. Paul Whelan, Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich\u00a0and teacher\u00a0Marc Fogel\u00a0were all designated wrongfully detained like Karelina and freed in previous prisoner swaps with Moscow.",
      "Among the U.S. nationals still jailed in Russia is U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Gordon Black, whose three-year, nine-month prison sentence for robbing and threatening his Russian girlfriend was reduced earlier this week by seven months by a Russian court.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 23:21:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal immigration official acknowledged last week that the removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man, to El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday said the Trump administration must facilitate the release of a Maryland man mistakenly deported from custody in El Salvador, but ordered additional proceedings before a federal district court.",
      "In an unsigned decision, the high court acknowledged that a late Monday deadline set by the district court judge to secure the return to the U.S. of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, and paused by Chief Justice John Roberts had already passed, effectively granting in part the emergency relief sought by the Trump administration.",
      "But the court said that the district court's order \"properly requires the government to 'facilitate'\" Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody and to \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"",
      "The Supreme Court went on to say that the intended scope of the term \"effectuate\" in the lower court's decision is unclear and may exceed its authority. The high court directed the district court to provide more clarification with the case sent back for further proceedings.",
      "\"The district court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" the court said in an unsigned opinion. \"For its part, the Government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.\"",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis issued an order Thursday evening following the Supreme Court's decision directing the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia \"as soon as possible.\"",
      "She gave the Department of Justice until 9:30 a.m. Friday to detail where Abrego Garcia is and the plans to bring him back to the U.S.",
      "There were no noted dissents, and the three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, noted their respect for the court's disposition of the application. Sotomayor said in a statement joined by Kagan and Jackson that there is agreement among the justices \"that the proper remedy is to provide Abrego Garcia with all the process to which he would have been entitled had he not been unlawfully removed to El Salvador.\"",
      "\"As the Supreme Court correctly recognized, it is the exclusive prerogative of the President to conduct foreign affairs,\" a DOJ spokesperson said Thursday. \"By directly noting the deference owed to the Executive Branch, this ruling once again illustrates that activist judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of the President's authority to conduct foreign policy.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers asked the Trump administration in a court filing to facilitate his release from the notorious Salvadoran supermax prison known as CECOT Thursday evening and to dispatch a plane to retrieve him. They cited the \"grave risk to his safety in El Salvador.\"",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to step in after a federal district judge on Friday ordered it to take immediate action to return Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. The 29-year-old Salvadoran national was arrested by immigration authorities on March 15 and was among the more than 200 people sent on deportation flights to El Salvador last month.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case sparked backlash after a federal immigration official acknowledged in a court filing last week that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16 years old and was arrested in 2019, according to court documents. During immigration proceedings, the Department of Homeland Security claimed that Abrego Garcia was a member of the gang MS-13, citing a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie he was wearing and allegations from a confidential informant who said he belonged to a branch of MS-13 that operates on Long Island, New York, court records show.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said he has never lived on Long Island and has no affiliation with MS-13. They also said he has no criminal history and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "An immigration judge detained Abrego Garcia after denying a request for release on bond, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board. But he was ultimately granted withholding of removal to El Salvador, a legal status that prohibits the government from returning him to his home country because he is more likely than not to face persecution from local gangs, according to court records.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from custody following that decision and has lived for six years in Maryland with his wife and their children. He had regular check-ins with immigration authorities, according to court filings, but was arrested on March 12 after he was stopped by immigration agents while driving with his son in the back seat. Abrego Garcia was taken into custody and transported to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in Baltimore, Louisiana and Texas before he was flown to El Salvador, according to legal filings.",
      "After Abrego Garcia was sent to the Salvarodan prison last month, he and his wife, a U.S. citizen, filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland alleging his removal violated federal immigration law and seeking an order requiring his return to U.S. custody.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis granted that request following a hearing Friday and directed the government to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. no later than 11:59 p.m. Monday. The Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit to halt that order, and while its request was pending, asked the Supreme Court to intervene. The 4th Circuit then declined to pause the district court's decision.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the lower court order \"sets the United States up for failure\" because it interfered with President Trump's ability to conduct foreign diplomacy and set a tight timeline for compliance. He wrote that the U.S. cannot force the release of Abrego Garcia because he is now in the custody of the Salvadoran government.",
      "\"The United States does not control the sovereign nation of El Salvador, nor can it compel El Salvador to follow a federal judge's bidding,\" the solicitor general wrote.",
      "Sotomayor warned in her statement that the government's argument \"implies that it could deport and incarcerate any person, including U. S. citizens, without legal consequence, so long as it does so before a court can intervene.\"",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia called his case \"one of one,\" and argued in court papers that requiring the government to facilitate their client's return is \"not novel,\" because the district court's order just requires the Trump administration to correct its own error.",
      "\"The executive branch may not seize individuals from the streets, deposit them in foreign prisons in violation of court orders, and then invoke the separation of powers to insulate its unlawful actions from judicial scrutiny,\" they wrote.",
      "Abrego Garcia's legal team called the government's mistake in removing him \"Kafka-esque,\" and noted that he has lived in the U.S. for several years without any issues.",
      "\"The government offers no evidence that he has become a threat overnight,\" they wrote.",
      "Migrants removed from the U.S. are being housed in CECOT as a result of a temporary agreement the Trump administration reached with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, under which the U.S. government is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to hold U.S. detainees for a year.",
      "Citing this arrangement, Abrego Garcia's lawyers argued that the U.S. government \"functionally controls Abrego Garcia's detention \u2014 it has simply contracted with El Salvador to be the jailer.\"",
      "Lower courts also said that the government has control over Abrego Garcia, since he is being temporarily housed in CECOT at the Trump administration's request.",
      "\"The government's claim that it can remove an individual from the United States pursuant to such an agreement and thereby lose the ability to reclaim that individual and return him to the country for process (or for any other purpose) cannot stand,\" Judge Stephanie Thacker, who sits on the 4th Circuit, wrote in an opinion. She added that \"the government's actions in this case most assuredly violated the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\"",
      "Thacker, who was joined by Judge Robert King, wrote that \"the government cannot escape its responsibility to return Abrego Garcia to the United States by claiming it now lacks authority to control El Salvador.\"",
      "While the Trump administration has acknowledged that it inadvertently sent Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it has argued that the federal courts do not have the power to demand his return since he's no longer in U.S. custody. Administration officials have also claimed that he is an MS-13 \"leader,\" though they have not produced evidence to support the allegations.",
      "During last week's hearing before Xinis, Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni repeatedly struggled to answer the judge's questions but said he wasn't given sufficient information by the administration.",
      "\"The facts are conceded, plaintiff Abrego Garcia should not have been removed,\" Reuveni said.",
      "When questioned about why the government is not able to return Abrego Garcia, Reuveni said he \"asked the government the same question\" and did not receive an answer. The Justice Department lawyer said multiple times he was \"frustrated\" with the government's lack of cooperation in the case.",
      "Following Friday's argument, Reuveni was placed on administrative leave, and Sauer said in a filing that his statements were \"inappropriate\" and \"do not reflect the position of the United States.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News about Reuveni's employment status, Attorney General Pam Bondi said, \"At my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences.\"",

    "story": [
      "Faced with a deadline to provide evidence in its deportation case against activist Mahmoud Khalil, lawyers for the federal government instead filed a memorandum by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to a Louisiana immigration court.",
      "In the memo, which was obtained by CBS News, Rubio wrote that Khalil's role in protests on the campus of Columbia University is in conflict with American foreign policy objectives. Rubio did not cite specific evidence against Khalil. He stated that Khalil is deportable under a little-known statute in federal immigration law that provides the government is entitled to deport noncitizens whose presence in the U.S. damages national foreign policy interests.",
      "Rubio argued that the presence of Khalil, a 30-year-old legal permanent resident, undermines \"U.S. policy to combat anti-Semitism around the world and in the United States, in addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence in the United States.\"",
      "Khalil was a prominent voice in the spring 2024 pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, where he earned a master's degree from the School of International and Public Affairs in December 2024. He was detained by federal immigration authorities at his university-owned apartment as his pregnant wife looked on. He was moved from New York to a detention center in New Jersey before being flown to a remote facility in Jena, Louisiana.",
      "The government claims that Khalil has supported Hamas, and can be deported if it is determined his presence and activities threaten the foreign policy interests of the U.S., citing alleged support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group. To date, CBS News has not found evidence that Khalil has said he supports Hamas.",
      "Assistant chief immigration Judge Jamee Comans on Tuesday said she would terminate the case unless the government showed evidence supporting the removal of the former Columbia student. Khalil's attorney Marc Van Der Hout said at the hearing that he had \"not received a single document\" of evidence from the government.",
      "\"I'd like to see the evidence,\" Comans said, demanding that the government make a filing within 24 hours.",
      "In response, the Department of Homeland Security submitted the two-page memo from Rubio, which includes references to Khalil and one other lawful permanent resident whose name was redacted.",
      "Rubio wrote that they should be removed from the country because their \"presence or activities would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\"",
      "\"The foreign policy of the United States champions core American interests and American citizens,\" he continued, \"and condoning anti-Semitic conduct and disruptive protests in the United States would severely undermine that significant foreign policy objective.\"",
      "Rubio pointed to Khalil's participation in what he descirbed as \"antisemitic protests and disruptive activities,\" which he said creates a \"hostile environment for Jewish students,\" as well as \"unlawful activity\" during those protests.",
      "\"The government can't just operate on hidden law based on one executive official's say so,\" said Baher Azmy, Legal Director of the Center of Constitutional Rights during a press call about Khalil on Thursday. \"Does anyone here know what conduct they would have to engage in that would trigger an adverse foreign policy interest to The United States? No one does. No one can. Which is what's so dangerous about this law.\"",
      "Comans has set a removability hearing for Khalil on Friday at 1 p.m., at which she could determine whether sufficient evidence has been provided to support the continuation of his immigration case.",
      "The government had previously said Khalil should be expelled for what it's described as \"material support\" for the militant group Hamas via his role in campus protests against Israel.",
      "Khalil's attorneys, who have also sued the government on his behalf, lambasted the government, saying the government was depriving him of his right to free speech.",
      "\"After a month of hiding the ball since Mahmoud's late-night unjust arrest in New York and taking him away to a remote detention center in Louisiana, immigration authorities have finally admitted that they have no case whatsoever against him,\" said Van Der Hout. \"Instead, the government is clearly going after Mahmoud and persecuting him for exercising his First Amendment rights.\"",
      "After Khalil's arrest, President Trump said it was just the first \"of many to come.\" His statement heralded a crackdown on students and alleged \"agitators\" who have protested against Israel.",
      "Foreign-born students across the country have since faced the knocks of immigration agents at the door, and deportation proceedings.",
      "\"If the secretary of state claims the power to arrest, detain and deport someone, including a lawful permanent resident, simply because that person dissents from US foreign policy, there are no limits. There's no beginning and no end to that kind of executive power,\" said Johnny Sinodis, an attorney for Khalil's immigration case.",
      "\"This is not a routine immigration case or even routine habeas case,\" he added. \"This case is intentionally projecting a message of repression about who can say what in this country and the consequences to your liberty and your life if you object to U.S. policy.\""

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/save-act-voter-registration-citizenship-married-women-name-change/",
    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 16:36:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The SAVE Act could change voter registration requirements for millions of people. Here's how.",
    "story": [
      "A claim circulating on social media suggests that married people who changed their last name will face difficulties when trying to vote under the proposed Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act.",
      "Experts say the bill, which\u00a0passed in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, April 10, would not explicitly prevent these voters from casting a ballot, but it could create barriers to registration by requiring them to show additional documentation.",
      "The measure now heads to the Senate. If it passes in the Senate and is\u00a0signed into law, the act would amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which requires states\u00a0to offer voter registration when obtaining a driver's license, to mandate documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration.",
      "This means that common forms of ID used for voter registration, including driver's licenses, would no longer be accepted as they are not generally considered proof of citizenship. Instead, voters would have to present documents such as a U.S. passport, a birth certificate, or naturalization paperwork to register.",
      "The Center for American Progress analysis estimated as many as 69 million have taken their spouse's name but do not have a matching birth certificate. \"The fate of those 69 million women are basically up in the air, the way the bill is written,\" said Greta Bedekovics, associate director of democracy policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy and advocacy group.",
      "Opponents argue that the law could also make voting more difficult for military and rural voters by upending both mail-in and online voter registration. Bedekovic said it would make an in-person trip to the election office the only \"viable way for Americans across the country to register to vote,\" adding that rural voters are less likely to have a passport and may have to travel hours to obtain and submit documents.",
      "According to Congress.gov, the bill also \"establishes criminal penalties\" for registering someone who does not have the right documents to vote.",
      "Eliza Sweren-Becker, senior counsel in the Brennan Center's Voting Rights and Elections Program, noted that the bill \"does not specify what extra documents\" married individuals would need to produce, adding that \"election officials, who would face legal risks under the bill, would be hesitant to register women whose documentation name does not match their current name.\"",
      "\"This in-person 'show your papers' requirement would keep many eligible voters out of the voting booth \u2014 beyond the millions who already lack ready access to their citizenship documents \u2014 and cause chaos for election administration,\" said Sweren-Becker.",
      "As of January 2025, eight states require proof of citizenship to register to vote, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Americans widely support both voter ID requirements and proof of citizenship. A\u00a02024 Gallup survey found more than 4 in 5 respondents supported proof of citizenship requirements for first-time voters.",
      "Supporters of the bill, including U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, a Republican from Pennsylvania, argue that it is necessary to prevent noncitizens from voting.",
      "However,\u00a0noncitizen voting is already illegal and rare. In a study following the 2016 election, the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice found just 30 suspected cases of noncitizen voting out of 23.5 million votes cast in the 42 jurisdictions reviewed.",
      "A 2023 Pew Research survey found\u00a0that about 80% of women married to men in the U.S. take their husband's last name. Under the SAVE Act, if their voter registration name differs from the name on their birth certificate or passport, they may need to show additional documents.",
      "If the SAVE Act were to become law, Bedekovics said married women who have changed their names should obtain certified copies of all marriage certificates, locate their birth certificates, and keep any change-of-name documentation on hand for any updates to their voter registration.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 16:14:04 -0400",
    "summary": "The vote was initially delayed amid conservatives' concerns about the level of spending cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday adopted a budget blueprint for President Trump's agenda after Republican leaders scrambled to convince GOP holdouts who want deeper spending cuts to back it.",
      "The resolution was adopted in a 216-214 vote, with two Republicans \u2014 Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Victoria Spartz of Indiana \u2014 joining all Democrats to vote against it.",
      "About a dozen House conservatives ultimately flipped their opposition after receiving assurances from leaders that the Senate would pursue $1.5 trillion in savings, at a minimum.",
      "\"Our two chambers are directly aligned,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said before the vote. \"We're committed to finding at least $1.5 trillion in savings for the American people while also preserving our essential programs.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, echoed that the Senate is \"aligned with the House in terms of what their budget resolution outlined in terms of savings.\"",
      "\"The speaker talked about $1.5 trillion dollars. We have a lot of United States senators who believe that is a minimum,\" Thune said.",
      "The lower chamber was set to vote Wednesday evening on the budget resolution but punted after several House conservatives resisted increasing pressure from Mr. Trump to accept the blueprint that would open the door to implementing his border security, defense, energy priorities and extending expiring tax cuts.",
      "Approving the budget plan in both chambers is the first step in the reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate and pass Mr. Trump's agenda with a simple majority. Going that route allows Republicans, who have control of the House and Senate, to pass the measure without any support from Democrats.",
      "The House and Senate worked on separate blueprints earlier this year but more recently reached a compromise resolution, which the Senate adopted early Saturday morning. Republican leaders in the House worked to unite their divided party behind the budget plan this week before Congress leaves town for a two-week recess.",
      "The Senate set much lower minimum floors for spending cuts at just about $4 billion, though committees could find far more. The compromise resolution also allows for the House to slash at least $1.5 trillion in spending.",
      "The Senate also wants to account for tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term with a tactic known as \"current policy baseline,\" which assumes that continuing expiring policies will cost nothing. Under that baseline, the nearly $4 trillion it would cost to extend the 2017 tax cuts would not be counted, further frustrating House conservatives.",
      "Johnson said House and Senate committees would be working in a \"collaborative fashion\" over the two-week recess to find savings.",
      "Before backing the resolution, House conservatives wanted assurances from the Senate that there will be deeper spending cuts, which sent leadership scrambling to find another compromise.",
      "\"We just don't trust the Senate,\" Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, told reporters Wednesday night after fiscal hawks huddled with Johnson for more than hour as the vote was delayed. \"We all campaign on spending cuts, but again and again, that doesn't happen. And when the Senate sent over something that said $4 billion is their floor, that was unacceptable to a lot of us.\"",
      "Burlison was among those who changed their minds and voted in favor of the resolution. Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said he and other holdouts were moved to support the resolution by a White House commitment to making \"significant cuts,\" Johnson's \"firm commitment\" to maintain House Republicans' framework of tying tax cuts to spending cuts and Thune's \"strong statement\" promising at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts.",
      "Massie, one of the two Republicans who held firm on his \"no\" vote, called it \"a framework for financial collapse.\"",
      "\"I don't believe they're going to make any cuts of any consequence. Now they may change spending, reduce spending here, and increase spending there, but overall, the money spent next year is going to be more than the money spent this year,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump increased pressure on House Republicans in recent days to swallow the blueprint, telling holdouts on Tuesday night, \"close your eyes and get there.\" He added that individual lawmakers may not get \"every little ounce\" of what they want in the legislation.",
      "\"It's a phenomenal bill. Stop grandstanding,\" Mr. Trump said at the House GOP campaign arm's fundraising dinner.",
      "Democrats have railed against the proposed cuts, arguing the Republican plan will lead to massive cuts in entitlement programs such as Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security.",
      "\"The budget resolution that passed the House today will set in motion some of the most extreme cuts to health care, nutritional assistance and the things that matter to everyday Americans in our nation's nearly 250-year history,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said Thursday. \"It's a disgrace.\"",

      "Wynn-Williams began working at Meta, then known as Facebook, as the director of Global Public Policy in 2011. In her almost seven years with the company, Wynn-Williams told the panel she witnessed the company provide \"custom built censorship tools\" for the Chinese Communist Party. She said a Chinese dissident living in the United States was removed from Facebook in 2017 after pressure from Chinese officials. Facebook said at the time it took action against the regime critic, Guo Wengui, for sharing someone else's personal information.",
      "Wynn-Williams described the use of a \"virality counter\" that flagged posts with over 10,000 views for review by a \"chief editor,\" which Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called \"an Orwellian censor.\" These \"virality counters\" were used not only in Mainland China, but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan, according to Wynn-Williams's testimony.",

DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company that sent shockwaves through the American technology industry earlier this year when its AI model was shown to be competitive with OpenAI's ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost.",
      "In a statement last year on Llama, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone wrote, \"The alleged role of a single and outdated version of an American open-source model is irrelevant when we know China is already investing over 1T to surpass the US technologically, and Chinese tech companies are releasing their own open AI models as fast, or faster, than US ones.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams encouraged senators to continue investigating Meta's role in the development of artificial intelligence in China, as they continue their probe into the social media company founded by Zuckerberg.",

Routh aimed his rifle at an agent, who opened fire, which led Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing, they said.",
      "Uthmeier, a Republican, criticized the Biden administration, accusing it of trying to \"frustrate our efforts\" and \"block\" his office's investigation. He lauded FBI director Kash Patel and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi for being willing to \"work together to pursue justice.\"",
      "Routh is jailed on federal charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, assaulting a federal officer, being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, and possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number.",
      "He is due in court on the federal charges in September. The lag between his arrest and his next court date was granted to give his attorneys time to review hundreds of hours of footage from police body cameras and surveillance cameras, and to pore over material from Routh's 17 cellphones and other electronic devices.",
      "On Tuesday, the government submitted new evidence against Routh, alleging that in March and April 2024, Routh spent over a week in West Palm Beach, \"engaging in apparent reconnaissance for his assassination attempt.\"",
      "\"Routh's acidity is undeniably necessary context for the jury to understand the significance of Routh's conduct on September 15 at Trump International because it shows his planning for what happened that day and his familiarity with locations he revisited on and leading up to September 15, including the South Bay area where he camped in the weeks beforehand, and Southern Boulevard, the main road from South Bay to Trump International,\" the government wrote in the court documents.",
      "The government also alleged that Routh sought to acquire anti-aircraft weapons to shoot down Mr. Trump's plane.",

And frankly, the war has gone on for far too long,\" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement. \"The real issue is whether the Russians and Ukrainians are ready to do what's necessary to end this war.\"",
      "Brink has not formally submitted resignation papers but she has been making farewell calls to colleagues, sources said.",
      "Ambassador Brink has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "One senior U.S. official told CBS that her resignation stems from an unusual mix of personal and policy concerns, including the recent USAID layoffs. Brink is serving in a war zone far from her family, since Kyiv is designated as an unaccompanied post, where officers serve without bringing their families with them.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio intended to keep Brink, a career foreign service officer, in the job and declined the initial resignation she had submitted in January as part of the standard turnover between administrations.",
      "Brink's resignation comes at a pivotal moment for U.S.-Ukraine relations. The Trump administration has tried to broker an end to the Russian invasion in part by ending the policy of diplomatically isolating Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "While Ukraine accepted a U.S. ceasefire proposal, Russia has not. It is not clear whether President Trump has set any deadline for conclusion of the diplomacy, but he's continuing to have special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff at the fore of outreach to Russia.",
      "At NATO meeting last week, Rubio indicated U.S. patience with Russia was wearing thin.",
      "\"We will know soon enough, in a matter of weeks, not months, whether Russia is serious about peace or not. I hope they are,\" Rubio said on April 4.",

      "His distrust of Zelenskyy was visible in an explosive Oval Office confrontation in February. Mr. Trump told Zelenskyy to reach a ceasefire agreement with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vice President JD Vance accused the Ukrainian president of being \"disrespectful\" after he challenged the vice president's assertion that the war had dragged on because of a lack of diplomacy from Ukraine and the Biden administration. Vice President JD Vance also admonished Zelensky: \"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting?\"",
      "The Trump administration subsequently paused military and intelligence aid to Ukraine amid the fallout. That intelligence support resumed once Ukraine agreed to go along with the Trump administration's outreach to Putin. Mr. Trump continues to sit on the nearly $4 billion in remaining U.S. military aid already designated for Ukraine. The U.S. has been a key supplier of weapons since the Russian invasion began.",

      "Asked when he was made aware of the pause by Rep. Steven Horsford, a Democrat from Nevada, Greer said, \"Well, I understood the decision was made a few minutes ago. It's something that's been under discussion.\"",
      "\"So did you know that this was under discussion and why did you not include that as part of your opening remarks?\" Horsford asked.",
      "Greer replied he doesn't share the contents of his discussions with Mr. Trump.",
      "Immediately after Mr. Trump announced the pause, the U.S. stock market surged. It had fallen significantly after the president's initial announcement on the tariffs. A universal tariff of 10% remained in place for nearly every country, except China, which faces an even higher tariff of 125%. China raised its own tariffs against the U.S.",
      "Horsford pressed Greer for details of the pause.",
      "\"I understand it's 90 days. I haven't spoken to the president since I've been in this hearing,\" Greer said.",
      "Horsford interrupted, \"So the trade representative hasn't spoken to the president of the United States about a global re-ordering of trade?\"",
      "\"Yes I have, I'm just here in a hearing with you,\" Greer interjected.",
      "\"And yet he announced it on a tweet? W.T.F.? Who's in charge?\" Horsford yelled.",
      "\"The president of the United States is in charge,\" Greer said.",
      "\"And what do you know about those details?\" Horsford asked. Before Greer could answer, he said, \"It looks like your boss just pulled the rug out from under you.\"",
      "\"There's no strategy,\" Horsford said. \"You just found out. Three seconds ago. Sitting here. We saw you. If you came here knowing that you were going to be turned off, that these tariffs were going to be turned off, why didn't you include that in your opening statement? Why didn't you reference that as part of your testimony?\"",
      "Greer repeated he doesn't disclose his conversations with the president.",
      "\"These were specific questions we asked you all along,\" Horsford said. \"What's the strategy? These are real consequences for the American people and small businesses. \u2026 This is amateur hour and it needs to stop. What does this even mean for your negotiating strategy? How are you in charge of negotiation if the president is tweeting about this from wherever the hell he is?\"",
      "\"The president was elected and he runs the trade policy and I advise him and execute his policy,\" Greer said.",
      "\"Did you know that this was happening?\" Horsford pressed.",
      "\"We had been discussing all kinds of options, Sir,\" Greer said.",
      "\"There was no strategy. There was no plan,\" Horsford said, adding that Mr. Trump \"put our economy in disarray and near collapse.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued the tariffs were a \"negotiating strategy.\"",
      "Horsford asked Greer if this was market manipulation.",
      "When Greer answered, \"No,\" Horsford, said \"Why not? If it was a plan. If it was always the plan, how is this not market manipulation?\"",
      "\"We're trying to reset the global trade system,\" Greer said.",
      "\"And what has that done? How have you achieved any of that? But to enact enormous harm on the American people?\" Horsford said. \"Tariffs are a tool. It can be used in the appropriate way to protect U.S. jobs and small businesses, but that's not what this does, so if it's not market manipulation, what is it? Who's benefitting? What billionaire just got richer?\"",
      "Horsford then slammed Republicans for their budget plan and repeated to Greer, \"Who's in charge? Because it sure doesn't look like it's the trade representative. You just got the rug pulled out from under you.\"",
      "\"I wish I could feel some empathy, but the empathy I have is for the American people whose very wellbeing and livelihoods are being effected. This is not a game. This is real life,\" Horsford said before yielding his time.",

      "Nearly half of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's staff working on developmental disabilities and birth defects was laid off this month, multiple officials tell CBS News, wiping out teams working on research about adults with cognitive disabilities and\u00a0sickle cell disease.",
      "Work likely to be halted by the cuts includes the collection of data for studying Americans with sickle cell, a painful blood disorder that predominantly affects Black families, as well as supporting testing for its more dangerous complications.",
      "\"If it is not restored, it will disrupt life-saving public health programs, halt critical research, and increase preventable hospitalizations, complications, and deaths. Its elimination runs counter to the Administration's stated commitment to addressing chronic disease,\" said Dr. Belinda Avalos, president of the American Society of Hematology, in a statement this week.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed openness to restoring some programs he gutted, like the CDC's lead poisoning experts, though for now they have yet to be reinstated.",
      "\"HHS is following the Administration's guidance and taking a careful look at all divisions to see where there is overlap that could be streamlined to support the President's broader efforts to restructure the federal government. This is to ensure that HHS better serves the American people at the highest and most efficient standard,\" HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano said in a statement.",
      "In addition to the blood disorders division, Kennedy's layoffs wiped out the entire leadership team atop CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities that housed it. Support staff for the center, as well as its Disability and Health Promotion Branch, were also cut.",
      "That branch had been responsible for a federal database tracking state-level rates of adults with disabilities. Researchers and health authorities rely on the data to target resources where they're needed most, and to study patterns and trends in disabilities.",
      "A now-stalled upcoming release of data had been expected to help shed light on a recent increase in cognitive disability among younger adults, an official said.",
      "\"There seems to be a step back to see developmental disabilities, like autism, being only in childhood. The branch provided key public health expertise for disability in adulthood, where people spend most of their lives,\" said a current CDC official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "It has also ended work on the congressionally mandated Early Hearing Detection and Intervention programs, which fund states and other efforts to screen and diagnose children's hearing issues.",
      "Nearly all U.S. newborns are now screened for hearing loss thanks in part to the program, according to the center's data, up from less than half of newborns 25 years ago. States had also been working with the branch on efforts to increase\u00a0 follow-up rates.",
      "Also eliminated in the cuts were CDC staff overseeing a partnership with the Special Olympics \u2014 an organization founded by Kennedy's aunt, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, and now chaired by his cousin, Timothy Shriver. The CDC program had provided health screenings and collected data on people with intellectual disabilities.",
      "Only a handful of researchers remain on the job in the center, in the agency's Child and Development and Disability Branch and Division of Birth Defects and Infant Disorders.",
      "This includes researchers working on the CDC's autism monitoring network, which produce figures that Kennedy has often cited as evidence that rates of autism are on the rise.",
      "Many of those remaining staff are expected to be merged into Kennedy's new Administration for a Healthy America agency, two officials said, along with staff from the CDC's centers focused on chronic disease and drug overdoses.",

    "story": [
      "In what could be a key 2025 bellwether, Virginia's race for governor will also make history, all but guaranteeing the Commonwealth's first female governor. Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former congresswoman and CIA officer, will face Republican Lt. Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, a Marine veteran, after both state parties confirmed their nominees in recent days.",
      "One of the only competitive races of the year, the Virginia gubernatorial contest will be closely watched by both parties \u2014 and is often treated as a referendum on the president's party. Historically, Virginia has voted for a governor of the opposite political party, every time a new president has been elected since 1977.",
      "The race is already breaking state records for fundraising, with Earle-Sears raising more than $3 million from January to March and Spanberger raising around $6.7 million during the same period, according to the campaigns.",
      "In an interview with \"America Decides,\" Spanberger told CBS News she believes national issues will weigh heavily on the race, from the Trump administration's mass layoffs of federal employees, more than 144,000 of whom live in Virginia, as well as what she called an \"antagonistic trade war.\"",
      "\"All of this impacts Virginia, and the stakes of this election reflect that,\" said Spanberger.",
      "When asked whether Earle-Sears supports President Trump's tariff policy, her campaign deflected but said in a statement, \"After leftists like Joe Biden and Abigail Spanberger devastated our economy and standing in the world\u2014President Trump is doing the work to put America first again.\"",
      "Earle-Sears has attacked Spanberger for her votes in Congress supporting Biden administration policies including the Inflation Reduction Act, which passed in 2022 with no Republican support. Earle-Sears argues it has contributed to inflation.",
      "\"I think it's a ridiculous assertion given that my opponent has been eager to claim credit for some of the funding that came through some of those federal dollars to Virginia's Commonwealth,\" Spanberger told CBS News. \"But, the reality is that my opponent is endeavoring to distract, because she's not talking about the fact that we've seen an absolute tanking of the stock market because of Donald Trump's actions.\"",
      "While the economy is a top issue for Virginians and both candidates, advocates are also hoping gun safety mobilizes voters.",
      "Spanberger is set to receive the endorsement of Everytown for Gun Safety Thursday, the group first told CBS News. Everytown, established by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, is also contributing $1 million to the race, which will include organizing efforts and political ads.",
      "Spanberger herself became a volunteer for pro-gun control group Moms Demand Action after leaving the CIA.",
      "\"Abigail Spanberger understands that common-sense laws to keep guns out of dangerous hands are crucial to ensuring public safety,\" John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said of the endorsement.",
      "Everytown also points to their success at the state legislative level in 2023 when nine gun safety volunteers won races and helped flip the House of Delegates, the lower house of Virginia's legislature, to Democratic control.",
      "The group says internal polling from that year revealed it's a top three issue for Virginia voters in battleground districts across Northern Virginia, Richmond and Hampton Roads.",
      "Youngkin vetoed an assault weapons ban and other gun control bills that passed the state legislature last year.",
      "He did sign two other gun measures, including one that bans auto sears, a device that converts semi-automatic handguns into automatic weapons. He also signed \"Lucia's Law,\" making it a crime for parents who allow children deemed as threats to access firearms.",
      "Earle-Sears has supported the governor's vetoes.",
      "In 2021, Earle-Sears became the first Black woman ever elected to statewide office in Virginia. She will have to appeal to moderates and independent voters in the blue-leaning state but has given mixed messages on her support for Mr. Trump in recent years.",
      "In 2020, she co-chaired the group \"Black Americans to re-elect President Trump,\" but in 2022, following the midterms, she told FOX Business it was \"time to move on.\"",
      "\"A true leader understands when they have become a liability,\" she said during the interview. \"A true leader understands when it's time to step off the stage.\"",
      "She went on to vote for Mr. Trump in 2024. A source close to the campaign says she sees the president as a federal partner. It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump offers Earle-Sears an endorsement given the high stakes of this year's few marquee races.",
      "While Mr. Trump made inroads in Virginia during the 2024 presidential election, the state comfortably went for Vice President Kamala Harris in November.",

      "Bondi referred to Henrry Villatoro Santos as \"one of the top members and head of the East Coast\" of the violent MS-13 gang during a March 27 news conference in Manassas, Virginia.

    "summary": "Republicans' budget resolution was expected to get a final vote Wednesday night. But a number of Republicans have withheld their support.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on a Republican budget plan, lacking enough GOP support to get it over the finish line on Wednesday.",
      "Several House Republicans have resisted increasing pressure from President Trump to swallow a blueprint that's key to extending his tax cuts, which are set to expire this year.",
      "The resolution's passage was in peril heading into the planned vote, making it a gamble for Johnson, who huddled with conservatives off the House floor as the preceding vote was held open for more than an hour while he tried to flip the holdouts. It's the latest setback for Johnson and creates further uncertainty about the future of Mr. Trump's agenda.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said the vote could be rescheduled for Thursday morning.",
      "At a fundraiser for House Republicans Tuesday night, Mr. Trump told GOP holdouts to \"close your eyes and get there.\" Earlier in the day, he met with some of them at the White House, urging them to back the budget resolution adopted by the Senate\u00a0on Saturday.",
      "But more than a dozen members have balked at the low level of spending cuts in the Senate resolution \u2014 just about $4 billion \u2014 compared with the nearly $1.5 trillion in cuts in the House version. The budget resolution serves as a blueprint for implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense, energy and tax priorities.",
      "\"They have to do this. They have to get there,\" Mr. Trump said at the House GOP campaign arm's fundraising dinner, adding that he had a great meeting with some of the holdouts, but \"just in case there are a couple of Republicans out there \u2014 you just got to get there. Close your eyes and get there. It's a phenomenal bill. Stop grandstanding.\"",
      "The president criticized Democrats on their policies, but admired the fact that \"they always vote in unison,\" saying, \"you don't see somebody that's holding up.\"",
      "\"One little thing the Republican Party has to do is get together and damn vote,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that individual lawmakers may not get \"every little ounce \u2014 it doesn't work that way.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, who's played a key role in shepherding the House GOP on legislation in recent months, promised a \"massive victory\" in the 2026 midterm elections if Republicans follow through on the budget resolution and enact his agenda more broadly. He argued \"they will not be able to even touch your seat,\" and he predicted they'd pick up \"40, 50, or even 60\" seats in the House, an outcome that would defy conventional political dynamics, with the party in control of the White House often losing control of the House in the midterms.",
      "\"If we don't get it done because of stupidity or a couple of people that want to show how great they are, you just have to laugh at them or smile at them or cry right in their face,\" the president continued.",
      "On Wednesday morning, as the House Rules Committee prepared to consider the budget resolution, the president posted on Truth Social to coax the conference to fall in line.",
      "\"Republicans, it is more important now, than ever, that we pass THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL,\" he said. \"The USA will Soar like never before!!!\"",
      "Congressional leaders are pushing to get the budget plan adopted this week before they leave town for a two-week recess. Adopting the budget resolution marks the first step in the reconciliation process, a maneuver that enables Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate and pass the measure with a simple majority. It will allow Republicans to approve the legislation funding the president's agenda without support from Democrats.",
      "After Republicans in the House and Senate had forged ahead on their own budget blueprints earlier this year, the Senate on Saturday adopted the compromise resolution, giving the House just days to overcome opposition and get it over the finish line before the recess. And while GOP leaders came together on the path forward in recent weeks, the approach has frustrated many House Republicans.",
      "The Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for several committees, at just about $4 billion dollars, though they expect to find far more. At the same time, it allows for House plans to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending. On top of that, the Senate-adopted plan relies on a budget scoring method known as \"current policy,\" which assumes that continuing the expiring current policies will incur no cost. Under that baseline, the $3.8 trillion it would cost to extend the Trump tax cuts would not be counted.",
      "The Trump tax cuts were originally passed in 2017 using a \"current law\" baseline, and they were set to expire this year. This scoring method, which was also used in the House budget resolution, means that the $3.8 trillion cost to extend the tax cuts is counted as new spending.",
      "Fiscal hawks have criticized the Senate-backed plan, including Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, who told reporters Tuesday that \"there's no way\" the House adopts it at this point. Burlison said he could be convinced by a guarantee that the Senate will make deeper spending cuts, calling the levels currently outlined in the resolution \"anemic\" and \"a joke.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona, when asked if he'd consider backing the measure if he had assurances on spending cuts from the president, told reporters he would have to \"see some product from the Senate that actually shows that they're serious about cutting.\"",
      "Crane called the pressure from House GOP leadership to fall in line on the resolution to avoid jeopardizing the president's agenda \"nonsense.\"",
      "\"I think it's just another tactic to try and pressure us into the status quo,\" he added.",
      "During the House Rules Committee hearing on the resolution Wednesday, House Budget Committee chairman Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican, said he has \"concerns\" about the Senate's resolution guiding the reconciliation process.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, reiterated during the meeting that \"the math still doesn't math.\"",
      "\"The Senate budget is all tax cuts and no spending cuts,\" Roy said, adding that he doesn't trust a promise from the Senate to cut spending.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, and a lowering of the \"reciprocal tariff\" rate to 10%, effective immediately, he\u00a0said on Truth Social.",
      "The U.S. stock market surged immediately after the president's announcement. At the same time, the president said he's increasing the tariff rate on goods imported from China to 125%.",
      "\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" he wrote.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified to reporters moments later that the universal tariff rate for the next 90 days will be 10% for virtually all countries, with the exception of China.",
      "The tariff rate of 10% includes the European Union. It's unclear what will happen after the 90-day period concludes, while countries negotiate with the Trump administration. Previous tariff rates on steel, aluminum and auto imports remain unchanged, a White House official said.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote: \"Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters during a race car event at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, the president was asked to explain how he reached a decision to issue the pause.",
      "\"Well, l thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting yippy, you know?\" the president said. \"They were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid, unlike these champions.\"",
      "\"I was watching the bond market,\" he added. \"The bond market is very tricky. I was watching it. But if you look at it now, it's, it's beautiful. The bond market right now is beautiful. But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy.\"",
      "The president said he \"did a 90-day pause for the people that didn't retaliate.\"",
      "Bessent said he expects the number of countries trying to negotiate with the U.S., which is over 75 now, to climb even higher.",
      "\"President Trump wants to be personally involved,\" Bessent said in explaining the reason for the 90-day pause.",
      "\"No one creates leverage for himself like President Trump,\" Bessent said. Despite the days of market volatility since the tariffs were announced, Bessent said this was Mr. Trump's \"strategy all along.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Leavitt reiterated Mr. Trump's insistence that he wasn't considering an extension or delay.",
      "But on Wednesday, the president said he'd been mulling a pause \"over the last few days.\" The president said he decided to forward with the pause early Wednesday morning. He and his top advisers wrote the statement without lawyers present, he said, and came \"from the heart.\"",
      "The so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs above the baseline 10% worldwide rate went into effect Wednesday.",
      "\"It's unfolded exactly the way it should. It's a beautiful thing,\" said top White House adviser Peter Navarro on Fox Business Channel.",
      "Shortly before announcing the pause Wednesday, Mr. Trump took to Truth Social to write, \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!\"",

      "The nation's 988 hotline works like 911, bringing critical access to care for those battling mental health emergencies. Counselor Alejandra takes calls at the nation's largest suicide prevention center \u2014 Los Angeles' Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services. That one center receives 20,000 calls and texts a month.",

      "\"The ultimate goal is for all Americans to have access to crisis care for mental health and substance use issues, in the way that 911 provides rapid response for physical health emergencies,\" SAMHSA told CBS News in a statement. \"The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is working diligently to support the development and sustainability of local treatment and support connected to 988, including the expansion of mobile crisis services and 24/7 walk-in crisis care clinics across the country. Transformation of this scale and building a cohesive crisis care system takes time, and there is more work needed to be able to deliver these critical services to the American public.\"",
      "Morris said additional cuts could lead to \"a very dire situation.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily halted lower court decisions that voided President Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, allowing their removals to go back into effect for now.",
      "Roberts issued an administrative stay that gives the Supreme Court more time to consider a Justice Department request to allow Mr. Trump's removal of Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protection Board and Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board. He gave lawyers for Harris and Wilcox until 5 p.m. on April 15 to file a response with the court.",
      "The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court earlier Wednesday to block a pair of district court decisions that restored Harris and Wilcox to their roles at the two independent boards. In a request for emergency relief from the high court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the orders harm the president and the separation of powers.",
      "Sauer asked the high court to issue a stay of district court decisions that found the firings unlawful and said the justices could also take up the case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rules. If the Supreme Court chooses that route, Sauer asked it to consider the constitutionality of federal laws that provide removal protections for members of the NLRB and MSPB.",
      "\"The president should not be forced to delegate his executive power to agency heads who are demonstrably at odds with the administration's policy objectives for a single day \u2014 much less for the months that it would likely take for the courts to resolve this litigation,\" he wrote.",
      "The bid for the Supreme Court's intervention comes as the justices have been faced with a flurry of requests for emergency relief from the Trump administration. More than 150 cases challenging Mr. Trump's second-term agenda have been filed in courts across the country and are progressing through the federal judiciary.",
      "At the center of these disputes is the president's authority to remove executive branch officers from their positions at independent agencies. Wilcox was appointed to the NLRB by former President Joe Biden in 2021 and confirmed to a second, five-year term in 2023. Harris, meanwhile, was named to the MSPB for a seven-year term by Biden in 2022 and designated its chair in 2024.",
      "But Wilcox and Harris received emails soon after Mr. Trump returned to the White House informing them that they were being removed from their positions on their respective boards. They each challenged their firing in federal district court, asserting that their termination violated federal laws that limited the grounds for their removal to neglect of duty or malfeasance, and sought relief restoring them to their roles.",
      "In early March, two separate federal judges in Washington, D.C., ruled for Harris and Wilcox, finding that it was unlawful for Mr. Trump to fire them. The judges declared the removals null and void, and said the two each remained members of their respective boards.",
      "But the D.C. Circuit last month agreed to pause those decisions, clearing the way for the president to remove Harris and Wilcox once again. The officials asked the full complement of judges to reconsider their cases, and earlier this week, the full D.C. Circuit ruled 7-4 to put the district court orders back in place, meaning Wilcox and Harris could go back to their jobs at the NLRB and MSPB while they challenged the removals.",
      "In the emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, Sauer argued that Article II of the Constitution empowers the president to remove at-will members of multi-member boards that exercise \"substantial executive power,\" like the NLRB and MSPB.",
      "\"Federal courts lack any constitutional, statutory, or equitable authority to order the reinstatement of agency heads whom the president has removed and to force the president to rely on principal officers whom the president believes should not be exercising any executive power,\" he wrote.",
      "Sauer said that the NLRB and MSPB both fall outside an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers established by the Supreme Court in 1935. In that case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the high court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "Both agencies, he said, exercise \"substantial\" executive power in executing laws governing the workforce or labor relations.",

      "An ancient jawbone discovered in Taiwan belonged to an enigmatic group of early human ancestors called Denisovans, scientists reported Thursday.",

      "The probable identification of the jawbone from Taiwan as Denisovan expands the region where scientists know these ancient people once lived, said Tsutaya.",
      "\"Denisovans must therefore have been capable of adapting to a wide range of habitat types,\" study co-author Frido Welker told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The partial jawbone was first recovered when a fishing operation dredged the seafloor in the Penghu Channel near the Taiwan Strait. After it was sold to an antique shop, a collector spotted it and purchased it in 2008, then later donated it to Taiwan's National Museum of Natural Science.",
      "Based on the composition of marine invertebrates found attached to it, the fossil was dated to the Pleistocene era. But exactly which species of early human ancestor it belonged to remained a mystery.",
      "The condition of the fossil made it impossible to study ancient DNA. But recently, scientists in Taiwan, Japan and Denmark were able to extract some protein sequences from the incomplete jawbone.",
      "An analysis showed some protein sequences resembled those contained in the genome of a Denisovan fossil recovered in Siberia. The findings were published in the journal Science.",
      "While the new research is promising, Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Project, said he would like to see further data before confirming the Taiwan fossil as Denisovan.",
      "Potts, who was not involved in the new research, praised the study for \"a fantastic job of recovering some proteins.\" But he added, such a small sliver of material may not give a full picture.",

      "\"We can identity Neanderthal elements and Denisovan elements\" in the DNA of some people alive today, said Tsutaya.",
      "Scientists still don't know exactly why Denisovans went extinct.",
      "\"We have so little archaeological and fossil information about Denisovans that we can only speculate as to why they disappeared,\" Welker told Reuters. \"A lasting legacy, though, is that some human populations in East and Southeast Asia carry some Denisovan ancestry in their genomes today.\"",

      "The still mysterious city was one of the largest in the world at its peak between 100 B.C. and A.D. 750. But it was abandoned before the rise of the Aztecs in the 14th century.",

      "\"The remains of three children not older than 4 years were found on three sides of the altar,\" Paiz told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Teotihuacan were traders who traveled all over the country (Guatemala),\" Paiz said. \"The Teotihuacan residential complexes were houses with rooms and in the center altars; that's what the residence that was found is like, with an altar with the figure representing the Storm Goddess.\"",

After extensive leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal, hatches were opened at 7:28 a.m., allowing Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim to float into the station.",
      "Welcoming them aboard were Soyuz MS-26/72S crewmates Alexey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Donald Pettit, along with SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.",
      "\"It was the trip of a lifetime and an honor to be here,\" Kim told flight controllers during a traditional postdocking video conference.",
      "Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are replacing Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit, who were launched to the ISS on Sept. 11 and who plan to return to Earth aboard their own Soyuz on April 19 to wrap up a 219-day stay in space.",
      "The Crew 10 fliers, launched on March 14, replaced their Crew 9 predecessors \u2014 Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov and Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams \u2014 who returned to Earth on March 18.",
      "Rotating space station crews have typically carried out, on average, six-month tours of duty aboard the lab complex. But starting with Kim's flight, the Russians are increasing Soyuz durations to eight months to gather more data on the effects of long-term stays in space.",
      "As such, Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are expected to return to Earth around Dec. 9.",
      "In a pre-flight interview with CBS News, Jonathan Yong \"Jonny\" Kim, the son of South Korean immigrants and a father of three, said he first heard of the Navy's SEALs when he was 16 years old. He eventually joined the elite corps and went on to participate in more than 100 combat operations as a member of SEAL Team Three in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.",
      "\"To me, it is the strongest calling I've ever had in my life, even to this day,\" he said. \"I've had additional callings in life. But it was really that first calling I had to be a SEAL that I will remember for the rest of my life. Because it was the first time that I felt I had a purpose, and I had a dream.\"",
      "That dream was to serve as a warrior.",
      "\"Back then, I used to have a really narrow focus on that,\" he said. \"But to me, a warrior is someone that is in continued pursuit of excellence in their craft. It doesn't have to be combat. It can be in medicine. It can be as a NASA astronaut. It can be in politics. It can be anything.",
      "\"But it's someone who's passionate and in pursuit of continued excellence. And the reason why it just resonated so well with me is because it was everything I wasn't at the time, but I wanted to be.\"",
      "Kim said he had \"some terrible moments\" in combat and ended up \"just really burnt out. I was very burnt out from the combat, from the war and the loss. ... I needed a way to continue serving, and it seemed logical that medicine would be that vehicle.\"",
      "Already a veteran combat medic, Kim was accepted in Harvard Medical School. Along the way, he said, he \"probably went a little too extreme in ensuring that previous successes did not set myself up for the future.\"",
      "\"I ensured that the people I worked with in the hospital didn't know I was previously a SEAL, because I wanted my patients, I wanted my colleagues to think of me as dependable and proficient and a good physician. Not because I used to be a SEAL, but because that's who I was.\"",
      "Then, as he was wrapping up medical school and preparing for his residency, Kim watched the initial test flight of NASA's Orion moonship in 2014 on YouTube and became a self-described \"space nerd.\" He met physician and former astronaut Scott Parazynski, who encouraged him to apply to NASA for astronaut training.",
      "Out of 18,000 applications for the class of 2017, NASA chose 12, including Kim.",
      "He said learning Russian was the most challenging aspect of training to fly aboard a Soyuz, but added that his crewmates spoke excellent English and had gone out of their way to welcome him aboard.",
      "\"We are friends. I mean, we're very, very professional,\" Kim said. \"We work well together. ... I've had Alexey and Sergey over for dinner and they've done the same thing for me. So our relationships are personal and there's a lot of trust and friendship there.",
      "As for being assigned to a Soyuz flight, riding a vehicle that's been around for decades as opposed to the roomier touchscreen-equipped SpaceX Crew Dragon, Kim said he was more than happy to fly with the Russians.",
      "\"I just love technology (but) there's also something to be said about reliability, or as the saying goes, 'If it's not broke, don't fix it,'\" he said. \"The amount of testing and the reliability the Soyuz has shown over decades is unsurpassed and is absolutely admirable.\"",
      "During the course of his stay aboard the station, Kim said, he hopes to venture outside the lab for a spacewalk at some point, but added he would be more that happy to serve in any capacity.",
      "\"The modern day astronaut is a jack of all trades,\" he told CBS News. \"You know, we train to do spacewalks. We train to support space walks, train to do research. One day we might be plumbers or mechanics, we might be technicians repairing a radio or we might be pipetting various fluids into other fluids for research.",

      "\"Back then, I used to have a really narrow focus on that,\" he said. \"But to me, a warrior is someone that is in continued pursuit of excellence in their craft. It doesn't have to be combat. It can be in medicine. It can be as a NASA astronaut. It can be in politics. It can be anything.",
      "\"But it's someone who's passionate and in pursuit of continued excellence. And the reason why it just resonated so well with me is because it was everything I wasn't at the time, but I wanted to be.\"",
      "Kim said he had \"some terrible moments\" in combat and ended up \"just really burnt out. I was very burnt out from the combat, from the war and the loss. ... I needed a way to continue serving, and it seemed logical that medicine would be that vehicle.\"",
      "Already a veteran combat medic, Kim was accepted in Harvard Medical School. Along the way, he said, he \"probably went a little too extreme in ensuring that previous successes did not set myself up for the future.\"",
      "\"I ensured that the people I worked with in the hospital didn't know I was previously a SEAL, because I wanted my patients, I wanted my colleagues to think of me as dependable and proficient and a good physician. Not because I used to be a SEAL, but because that's who I was.\"",
      "Then, as he was wrapping up medical school and preparing for his residency, Kim watched the initial test flight of NASA's Orion moonship in 2014 on YouTube and became a self-described \"space nerd.\" He met physician and former astronaut Scott Parazynski, who encouraged him to apply to NASA for astronaut training.",
      "Out of 18,000 applications for the class of 2017, NASA chose 12, including Kim.",
      "He said learning Russian was the most challenging aspect of training to fly aboard a Soyuz, but added that his crewmates spoke excellent English and had gone out of their way to welcome him aboard.",
      "\"We are friends. I mean, we're very, very professional,\" Kim said. \"We work well together. ... I've had Alexey and Sergey over for dinner and they've done the same thing for me. So our relationships are personal and there's a lot of trust and friendship there.",
      "As for being assigned to a Soyuz flight, riding a vehicle that's been around for decades as opposed to the roomier touchscreen-equipped SpaceX Crew Dragon, Kim said he was more than happy to fly with the Russians.",
      "\"I just love technology (but) there's also something to be said about reliability, or as the saying goes, 'If it's not broke, don't fix it,'\" he said. \"The amount of testing and the reliability the Soyuz has shown over decades is unsurpassed and is absolutely admirable.\"",
      "During the course of his stay aboard the station, Kim said, he hopes to venture outside the lab for a spacewalk at some point, but added he would be more that happy to serve in any capacity.",
      "\"The modern day astronaut is a jack of all trades,\" he told CBS News. \"You know, we train to do spacewalks. We train to support space walks, train to do research. One day we might be plumbers or mechanics, we might be technicians repairing a radio or we might be pipetting various fluids into other fluids for research.",
      "\"So it's kind of all of the above, whatever the demands that the space station need at a time.\"",

    "story": [
      "The next total solar eclipse with a path of totality visible from the continental U.S. is still about two decades away.",
      "Millions of Americans witnessed a total solar eclipse chart its way across the United States in 2024. Viewers in\u00a0the path of totality\u00a0saw the moon completely block the sun.",
      "The awe-inspiring experience won't happen in the U.S. again until 2044, with only three states in the path, and 2045, with more than a dozen states in the path.",
      "\"A total solar eclipse is one of the most spectacular things anyone can see in their lifetime,\" Virginia Tech astrophysicist Nahum Arav told CBS News. The eclipse \"looks like a black hole in the sky,\" said Arav, who watched the paths of totality of eclipses in 1991 and 2017.",
      "The 2024 eclipse started on the Pacific Coast of Mexico, and then moved into Texas. The eclipse's visibility tracked\u00a0through 15 states\u00a0\u2014 Oklahoma, Illinois, Ohio,\u00a0Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont,\u00a0New Hampshire\u00a0and Maine, among them \u2014 before heading northward into Canada and then exiting North America.",
      "Even with spotty weather in some states, millions of people from coast to coast saw a partial solar eclipse, in which the moon partially covers the sun. However, only those within the path of totality experienced the darkness of the total solar eclipse.",
      "When is the next total solar eclipse in the U.S. after the 2024 eclipse?",
      "Solar eclipses happen about twice a year, said Arav. \"Eclipses happen all over the Earth evenly,\" he told CBS News \u2014 but noted the timings when they occur are not regular. That means\u00a0eclipses can occur within just a few years, or every few decades, in North America.",
      "Before the eclipse in 2024, the last total solar eclipses visible from the U.S. were in 2017 and\u00a01979. The 2017 solar eclipse was the first whose path of totality crossed the entire continent in 99 years.",
      "Even though eclipses may seem to occur randomly, scientists can pinpoint exactly when and where they will happen.",
      "\"There is no ambiguity, as we know exactly where it will land,\" said Arav.",
      "There will be eight total solar eclipses visible from parts of the continental U.S. in the 21st century, Arav said, with one occurring about every 12 years, on average.",
      "The next one is predicted to occur on Aug. 23, 2044, NASA said. However, the path of totality from this eclipse will only touch three states, according to\u00a0The Planetary Society, a nonprofit organization dedicated to public interest in space.",
      "This next eclipse will mainly be observed in Canada, Arav said.",
      "Path of totality for the 2044 total solar eclipse",
      "The 2044 eclipse will start in Greenland on Aug. 23, 2044, and will continue its path through Canada.",
      "The total solar eclipse will be short, mostly appearing in Canada. It will be visible from just three states in the U.S.: Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.",
      "The path of totality will cross Williston and Dickinson, North Dakota, and Great Falls, Montana.",
      "Path of totality for the 2045 total solar eclipse",
      "The next solar eclipse that crosses a significant portion of the continental U.S. will be in 2045, said Arav. That year, a solar eclipse on Aug. 12 will darken skies in parts of the U.S., Haiti, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Guyana, French Guiana, Suriname and Brazil.",
      "It will be visible in many states as it moves from coast to coast. The eclipse will start in California and move east to end in Florida, similar to 2017, Arav said.",
      "There will be numerous U.S. cities where eclipse watchers can view the total eclipse, including Reno, Nevada; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Little Rock, Arkansas; Jackson, Mississippi; and Orlando, Florida.",
      "Future solar eclipses in North America after 2045",
      "In addition to the 2017 and 2024 total solar eclipses, scientists have predicted six more will appear in the contiguous states  in the 21st century.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 14:34:07 -0400",
    "summary": "Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams testified Wednesday afternoon before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism.",
    "story": [
      "Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams told senators in testimony Wednesday on Capitol Hill that the social media company worked \"hand in glove\" with the Chinese government to censor its platforms, among other allegations.",
      "\"I saw Meta executives repeatedly undermine U.S. national security and betray American values,\" Wynn-Williams said in her opening remarks, which were obtained by CBS News before the hearing.",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism and led the bipartisan hearing, said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"made censorship his business model.\"",
      "\"The evidence that we have in black and white is a company and leadership that is willing to do anything, anything, work with America's chief competitor, work with our chief adversary,\" Hawley said.",
      "Hawley sent a letter to Zuckerberg Thursday requesting his testimony before the subcommittee, writing, \"The American people deserve to know the truth about your company.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams began working at Meta, then known as Facebook, as the director of Global Public Policy in 2011. In her almost seven years with the company, Wynn-Williams told the panel she witnessed the company provide \"custom built censorship tools\" for the Chinese Communist Party. She said a Chinese dissident living in the United States was removed from Facebook in 2017 after pressure from Chinese officials. Facebook said at the time it took action against the regime critic, Guo Wengui, for sharing someone else's personal information.",
      "Wynn-Williams described the use of a \"virality counter\" that flagged posts with over 10,000 views for review by a \"chief editor,\" which Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called \"an Orwellian censor.\" These \"virality counters\" were used not only in Mainland China, but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan, according to Wynn-Williams's testimony.",
      "Wynn-Williams also told senators Chinese officials could \"potentially access\" the data of American users. When Meta engineers expressed concern about data security, Wynn-Williams testified that Meta leadership, including Zuckerberg, were indifferent.",
      "Wynn-Williams testified Zuckerberg was \"personally invested\" in Meta's business relationship with China, claiming he committed to learning Mandarin and \"had weekly Mandarin sessions with employees.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams alleged Meta's artificial intelligence model known as \"Llama\" was used to help DeepSeek. DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company that sent shockwaves through the American technology industry earlier this year when its AI model was shown to be competitive with OpenAI's ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost.",
      "In a statement last year on Llama, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone wrote, \"The alleged role of a single and outdated version of an American open-source model is irrelevant when we know China is already investing over 1T to surpass the US technologically, and Chinese tech companies are releasing their own open AI models as fast, or faster, than US ones.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams encouraged senators to continue investigating Meta's role in the development of artificial intelligence in China, as they continue their probe into the social media company founded by Zuckerberg.",
      "\"The greatest trick Mark Zuckerberg ever pulled was wrapping the American flag around himself and calling himself a patriot and saying he didn't offer services in China, while he spent the last decade building an $18 billion business there,\" she said.",
      "In response to her opening statement, a Meta spokesperson called Wynn-Williams' testimony \"divorced from reality and riddled with false claims.\"",
      "\"While Mark Zuckerberg himself was public about our interest in offering our services in China and details were widely reported beginning over a decade ago, the fact is this: we do not operate our services in China today,\" Meta said in a statement.",
      "Meta, which changed its name from Facebook in 2021, operates some of the most popular social media platforms in the United States, including its previous namesake Facebook as well as Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads.",
      "Washington is taking a more aggressive posture toward China and its growing threat to American economic interests and national security. The Trump administration increased tariffs on imported goods from China to 125% Wednesday. The administration also continues to pursue the sale of TikTtok, a short-form video platform owned by Chinese company ByteDance, to an American buyer. And on Capitol Hill in 2023, the House of Representatives created the Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party to investigate China's challenge to American global power.",
      "In March, Wynn-Williams published a memoir called \"Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed and Lost Idealism\" about her time at Meta.",

      "The technology giant has taken a number of steps to mitigate the impact of President Trump's steep tariffs on China. That includes ramping up iPhone production in India, which is subject to far lower levies than China, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. Apple continues to make most iPhones in China.",
      "Apple has added workers in its main India factory, extending shifts to reach its goal of ramping up production by 20%, Reuters reported.",
      "Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a 27% tariff on India, which Mr. Trump on Wednesday\u00a0paused for 90 days\u00a0along with import taxes on dozens of other countries as the U.S. seeks to negotiate more favorable trade deals. By contrast, a 125% \"reciprocal tariff\" on China remains in effect.",
      "Apple chartered cargo flights to transport the smartphones to the U.S. because it \"wanted to beat the tariff,\" a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Apple reportedly spent eight months lobbying Indian airport authorities to cut the phones' customs clearance time down from 30 hours to six hours.

      "In a move that threatens to raise costs on all electronics, including iPhones, the White House on Tuesday said it would follow through on a threat to enact a 104% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S. The levy took effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT. Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump raised the tariff rate to 125%, effective immediately.",
      "The price for the popular tech tool, which starts at $599 for the most basic model, the iPhone 16e, is poised to increase by hundreds of dollars, depending on how Apple responds to the sweeping levies. The iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which features Apple Intelligence, costs $999.",
      "The iPhone accounts for about half of Apple's revenue. Most of its smartphones are manufactured in China.",
      "Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday that the added levies could create a \"category 5 price storm\" for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of \"flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,\" he added.",
      "How much more could an iPhone cost?",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which is among the devices that are assembled in China, retails for $1,199. Under the new tariffs on Chinese imports, the price of the device could rise by $675, or 56%, lifting the price tag to $1,874, an April 9 analysts from UBS Investment Research shows.",

      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on how the Trump tariffs could affect iPhone prices.",
      "What if Apple moved production to the U.S.?",
      "President Trump has said the new U.S. tariffs are aimed at spurring both domestic and foreign companies to build in the U.S. But for Apple and other companies, manufacturing their products in the U.S. entail significantly higher labor costs \u2014 costs that would largely be passed on to consumers.",
      "If Apple were to begin assembling iPhones in the U.S, a Chinese-made device that previously sold for $1,000 would cost $3,500 if manufactured in New Jersey, Texas or some other state, Ives estimated.",
      "\"Saying we can just make this in the USA is a statement that incredibly understates the complexity of the Asia supply chain and the way electronics, chips, semi fabs, hardware, smartphones, etc. are made for U.S. consumers over the last 30 years,\" he said in a report.",

    "story": [
      "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the U.S. economy faces a critical stretch, while also warning of the ongoing uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariff policies.",
      "\"The economy is facing considerable turbulence (including geopolitics), with the potential positives of tax reform and deregulation and the potential negatives of tariffs and 'trade wars,' ongoing sticky inflation, high fiscal deficits and still rather high asset prices and volatility,\" he said Friday during the banking giant's first-quarter earnings call.",
      "Dimon told Wall Street analysts that JPMorgan expects tariffs to increase inflation roughly 0.5% this year. But he also expressed confidence that the Trump administration is eager to negotiate trade agreements with other countries, which would ease the strain on the economy.",
      "\"I would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals. I think that will be good for everybody, and they want to do it, too,\" he said.",
      "Dimon, considered the country's most influential banking leader, said earlier this week that U.S. tariffs could lead to higher inflation, weaker economic growth and potentially even a recession.",
      "\"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,\" he said in his annual shareholder letter Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump this week\u00a0paused most country-based tariffs\u00a0for 90 days \u2014 a move that came as CEOs and Wall Street investors publicly pressed the White House to reconsider its trade measures and as financial markets gave a resounding thumb's down to U.S. trade policies.",
      "After suspending the \"reciprocal\" tariffs, Mr. Trump said he had watched an interview with Dimon on Fox Business in which the banker said the tariffs would make a recession a \"likely outcome,\" according to Bloomberg.",
      "Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square, also decried the tariffs this week,\u00a0saying\u00a0on social media Sunday that \"we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital.\"",
      "JPMorgan Chase earnings",
      "JPMorgan also reported first-quarter earnings on Friday that beat Wall Street expectations.",
      "Dimon said a strong performance by the bank's markets division helped lift it to another strong quarter, but he added that the bank is also facing the potential negatives of trade tensions, as is the broader economy.",
      "JPMorgan's earnings per share rose to $5.07 per share from $4.44 a year ago. The result beat Wall Street profit projections of $4.63 a share, according to the data firm FactSet. Total managed revenue hit $46 billion, up from the $41.9 billion a year ago. Wall Street was expecting revenue of $44 billion.",

    "story": [
      "Reginald Reed Jr., known as Reggie, spent more than two decades wondering who killed his mother, Selonia Reed, when he was only 6 years old. Selonia, a bank teller, was 26 when her body was found in her car in Hammond, Louisiana.",
      "One of the last memories Reggie has of that day is his mother buying him a chocolate chip cookie at the Hammond Square Mall. He also remembers her kissing him goodbye but everything else is a blur.",
      "\"48 Hours\" and contributor Vladimir Duthiers investigate what happened in the decades that followed in \"The Day My Mother Never Came Home\" airing Saturday, April 12 at 10 p.m. EST on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "It was a hot summer day in August 1987 when Selonia's body was found inside her blue Chevy Sprint in a parking area about one-and-a-half miles from the Reed home. Police said she had been bludgeoned, stabbed multiple times and stripped naked. It was clear, police said, that she was sexually assaulted.",
      "Selonia's husband Reginald Reed Sr. had reported her missing an hour or so before her body was found. Reginald told police on the morning of Aug. 23, 1987, that Selonia told him she was going out with a girlfriend the night before. That girlfriend later told police the two had \"no plans\" to go out that night, but Reginald stuck to his story.",
      "As the investigation unfolded, police learned that Selonia had told relatives that Reginald was physically abusive and had talked about getting a divorce. He became an early suspect, but none of that suspicion reached the ears of Reggie, who was only a child.",
      "Reggie was questioned by police after they received permission from his father. The police videotaped Reggie's interview with a police detective while his father sat next to him. He vouched for his father's version of events, saying the two of them spent the evening playing video games and sleeping in the same sofa bed. In effect, Reggie became his father's alibi. Years later, Reggie viewed that interview and became emotional when he saw his 6-year-old self crying that he wanted his \"mommy\" and \"daddy.\"",
      "\"I just can't imagine what it's like as a 6-year-old to have to sit there,\" said Duthiers.",
      "\"Looking at that, it's still hard to believe that that's me,\" said Reggie. \"Watching that video just brings back so \u2026 so many questions and \u2014 and pain because \u2026 I see me crying.\"",
      "Reggie wrote a memoir about his experiences titled, \"The Day My Mother Never Came Home.\"",
      "Reggie had no idea that his father was the prime suspect in the case until 25 years later in 2012 when a Texas Ranger showed up at his home. By then, Reggie was 31, had graduated college and was working for a pharmaceutical company near San Antonio.",
      "\"I was like, where's this coming from?\" Reggie told \"48 Hours.\" \"I remember asking, is there any new evidence that was surfaced?\"",
      "But over the next few years, the new lead investigator in the case, Lt. Barry Ward of the Louisiana State Police, was able to come up with new evidence. Eventually, it was enough that Reginald and an alleged accomplice were indicted for second-degree murder.",
      "The accomplice, a friend of Reginald named Jimmy Ray Barnes, agreed to testify against Reginald in exchange for a five-year prison sentence. In November 2022, Reginald Reed Sr. was found guilty of second-degree murder for killing Selonia Reed and was later sentenced to life in prison.",
      "Ward told Reggie that police believe Reginald likely murdered Selonia in their bedroom while Reggie slept. Detectives believe he then placed her body in her car and drove to the spot where it was found. Reginald's co-conspirator Jimmy Ray Barnes testified at trial that he met Reginald at the crime scene and saw Reginald in that car next to Selonia's body.",
      "To this day, Reggie continues to question his father's guilt.",
      "\"I want justice, but I didn't think justice was gonna come at the price of my dad going to prison for life,\" Reggie told Duthiers who asked: \"Do you believe that your father murdered your mother?\"",
      "\"I don't know \u2026 another question \u2014 do I think my dad had some involvement?\u202fMaybe. I don't know though. I don't know. So that's where I'm just, it's like a tug-of-war game.\"",
      "Reggie said he struggles to square what the state claims with the father he knew. Reggie appreciates that his father was loving to him, put him through private school and raised him to be the man he is today.",
      "\"Just knowing the type of father he is,\" Reggie said. \"I can't just turn a page and just look at my father as a complete monster.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department told a federal judge Friday that it is unable to provide information she requested about a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador and called a deadline set by the judge to provide the details \"impracticable.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Trump administration to give her information about Kilmar Abrego Garcia after the Supreme Court on Thursday reaffirmed her directive for the federal government to \"facilitate\" his release from Salvadoran custody.",
      "Shortly after the Supreme Court issued its order, Xinis directed Homeland Security officials to provide Abrego Garcia's physical location and custodial status, what steps they have taken to facilitate his immediate return to the U.S. and what further steps the government will take and when to help with his return. She initially gave the department a deadline of 9:30 a.m. Friday but extended it by two hours after the Justice Department filed a motion to ask for an extension until next week.",
      "During a hearing Friday afternoon, Xinis asked Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, why he could not provide answers to her questions, including on Abrego Garcia's whereabouts.",
      "\"I'm not asking for state secrets,\" she said. \"I'm asking a very simple question: where is he?\"",
      "Ensign repeatedly said he was not given information that he could provide to the court, including Abrego Garica's custodial status and who had authority over him. Trump administration officials are still evaluating the Supreme Court's order, he said.",
      "Xinis repeatedly pressed Ensign about where Abrego Garcia is. He noted that his lawyers said Abrego Garcia's last known location is in El Salvador and acknowledged the government has not put forth information to the contrary.",
      "The judge called the lack of evidence from the Justice Department about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts \"extremely troubling.\"",
      "\"It behooves this case and how the system of justice works that the following be communicated to your clients: You are the officer of the court. You are the instrument to represent\" the government, Xinis said. She said that the record in the case currently shows that despite her directive to take steps to bring Agrego Garcia back to the U.S., \"your clients have done nothing to facilitate\" his return.",
      "\"I'm not sure what to take from the fact that the Supreme Court has spoken quite clearly and yet I can't get an answer today about what you've done, if anything, in the past,\" Xinis said.",
      "Ensign told the judge that the federal government \"intends to comply with the Supreme Court's order.\" He said that while the administration is prepared to answer her questions about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts and what actions have been taken to secure his return, they may assert privileges.",
      "Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's lawyer, said his lawyers and family have not had contact with Abrego Garcia, and accused the Trump administration of \"playing games with their own lawyers.\"",
      "\"They clearly didn't comply\" with the district court's order to turn over information about Abrego Garcia, he said.",
      "Xinis said she plans to order the Justice Department to provide daily updates as to the answers to her questions.",
      "In a filing to the court ahead of the hearing, Justice Department attorneys told the judge they \"are not in a position where they 'can' share any information requested by the court. That is the reality.\"",
      "\"Defendants received the order late in the evening last night. They are reviewing the order and actively evaluating next steps,\" they wrote. \"It is unreasonable and impracticable for defendants to reveal potential steps before those steps are reviewed, agreed upon, and vetted. Foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines, in part because it involves sensitive country-specific considerations wholly inappropriate for judicial review.\"",
      "The Justice Department lawyers said that the judge gave them an \"insufficient amount of time\" to review the Supreme Court's order and argued she has not yet provided clarity as to the scope of her initial directive, as the high court told her\u00a0to do.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys opposed the government's motion and accused the Justice Department of continuing \"to delay, obfuscate, and flout court orders, while a man's life and safety is at risk.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia, who lives in Maryland with his wife and children, was arrested and removed to El Salvador last month after Trump administration officials accused him of having ties to the MS-13 gang.\u00a0 His lawyers said he has no affiliation with MS-13, and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "The 29-year-old is being confined at the notorious Salvadoran prison known as CECOT, along with other migrants sent there by the administration as part of an agreement with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. Under the deal, the U.S. government is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to hold U.S. detainees.",
      "But Abrego Garica's case emerged as a flashpoint in President Trump's immigration crackdown after a U.S. immigration official acknowledged in a court filing that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\"",
      "In 2019, an immigration judge granted Abrego Garcia relief known as withholding of removal, which forbids the government from returning him to his home country of El Salvador because he is more likely than not to face persecution from local gangs, according to court records.",
      "While the Trump administration admitted the error in sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it has argued that the district court has no jurisdiction over the Salvadoran government and therefore cannot force it to release Abrego Garcia from its prison. Justice Department lawyers have said that the Salvadoran government has custody of Abrego Garcia, so he cannot be returned to the U.S. unless it releases him.",
      "Abrego Garcia and his wife filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland following his arrest and removal, alleging it violated federal immigration law. They sought an order requiring his return to U.S. custody.",
      "Xinis granted that request last week following a hearing and directed the government to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. no later than 11:59 p.m. Monday. The dispute ended up before the Supreme Court, and Chief Justice John Roberts put that deadline on hold to allow the high court more time to consider the matter.",
      "Then, on Thursday, the Supreme Court unanimously agreed that the Trump administration had to \"facilitate\" the release of Abrego Garcia from Salvadoran custody and \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador\" \u2014 to provide Abrego Garcia with due process of law.",
      "But the Supreme Court also directed the district court to clarify its order, and specifically the directive that the government \"effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return.",
      "\"The district court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" the court said. \"For its part, the government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.\"",

The S&P 500 was up 65 points, or 1.2%, to 5,334 as of 1:13 p.m. EST. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 433 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.3%.",
      "\"The U.S. alternately raising abnormally high tariffs on China has become a numbers game, which has no practical economic significance, and will become a joke in the history of the world economy,\" a Chinese finance ministry spokesman said in a statement announcing the new tariffs. \"However, if the U.S. insists on continuing to substantially infringe on China's interests, China will resolutely counter and fight to the end.\"",
      "Beijing on Friday announced that it would raise tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%. That matches the 125% duties on Chinese goods that President Trump announced this week\u00a0\u2014 those tariffs will rise to as much as 145% for some of the Asian nation's products.",
      "\"China's tit-for-tat retaliation in its rapidly escalating trade war with the U.S. exerted some renewed pressure on equities and the dollar today, with bonds still buffeted by expectations of monetary easing and signs of market dislocation,\" John Higgins, chief market economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",

    "summary": "Recent cuts eliminated a small, specialized workforce that sets the poverty standards determining who is eligible for Medicaid as well as assistance with food, home heating, child care, and more.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's firings at the Department of Health and Human Services included the entire office that sets federal poverty guidelines, which determine whether tens of millions of Americans are eligible for health programs such as Medicaid, food assistance, child care, and other services, former staff said.",
      "The small team, with technical data expertise, worked out of HHS' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, or ASPE. Their dismissal mirrored others across HHS, which came without warning and left officials puzzled as to why they were \"RIF'ed\" \u2014 as in \"reduction in force,\" the bureaucratic language used to describe the firings.",
      "\"I suspect they RIF'ed offices that had the word 'data' or 'statistics' in them,\" said one of the laid-off employees, a social scientist whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because the person feared further recrimination. \"It was random, as far as we can tell.\"",
      "Among those fired was Kendall Swenson, who had led development of the poverty guidelines for many years and was considered the repository of knowledge on the issue, according to the social scientist and two academics who have worked with the HHS team.",
      "The sacking of the office could lead to cuts in assistance to low-income families next year unless the Trump administration restores the positions or moves its duties elsewhere, said Robin Ghertner, the fired director of the Division of Data and Technical Analysis, which had overseen the guidelines.",
      "The poverty guidelines are \"needed by many people and programs,\" said Timothy Smeeding, a professor emeritus of economics at the La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin. \"If you're thinking of someone you fired who should be rehired, Swenson would be a no-brainer,\" he added.",
      "Under a 1981 appropriations bill, HHS is required annually to take Census Bureau poverty-line figures, adjust them for inflation, and create guidelines that agencies and states use to determine who is eligible for various types of help.",
      "There's a special sauce for creating the guidelines that includes adjustments and calculations, Ghertner said. Swenson and three other staff members would independently prepare the numbers and quality-check them together before they were issued each January.",
      "Everyone in Ghertner's office was told last week, without warning, that they were being put on administrative leave until June 1, when their employment would officially end, he said.",
      "\"There's literally no one in the government who knows how to calculate the guidelines,\" he said. \"And because we're all locked out of our computers, we can't teach anyone how to calculate them.\"",
      "ASPE had about 140 staff members and now has about 40, according to a former staffer. The HHS shake-up merged the office with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, whose staff has shrunk from 275 to about 80, according to a former AHRQ official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "HHS has said it laid off about 10,000 employees and that, combined with other moves, including a program to encourage early retirements, its workforce has been reduced by about 20,000. But the agency has not detailed where it made the cuts or identified specific employees it fired.",
      "\"These workers were told they couldn't come into their offices so there's no transfer of knowledge,\" said Wendell Primus, who worked at ASPE during the Bill Clinton administration. \"They had no time to train anyone, transfer data, etc.\"",
      "HHS defended the firings. The department merged AHRQ and ASPE \"as part of Secretary Kennedy's vision to streamline HHS to better serve Americans,\"\u00a0 spokesperson Emily Hilliard said. \"Critical programs within ASPE will continue in this new office\" and \"HHS will continue to comply with statutory requirements,\" she said in a written response to KFF Health News.",
      "After this article published, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon called KFF Health News to say others at HHS could do the work of the RIF'ed data analysis team, which had nine members. \"The idea that this will come to a halt is totally incorrect,\" he said. \"Eighty million people will not be affected.\"",
      "Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has so far declined to testify about the staff reductions before congressional committees that oversee much of his agency. On April 9, a delegation of 10 Democratic members of Congress waited fruitlessly for a meeting in the agency's lobby.",
      "The group was led by House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee ranking member Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), who told reporters afterward that Kennedy must appear before the committee \"and tell us what his plan is for keeping America healthy and for stopping these devastating cuts.\"",
      "Matt VanHyfte, a spokesperson for the Republican committee leadership, said HHS officials would meet with bipartisan committee staff on April 11 to discuss the firings and other policy issues.",
      "ASPE serves as a think tank for the HHS secretary, said Primus, who later was Rep. Nancy Pelosi's senior health policy adviser for 18 years. In addition to the poverty guidelines, the office maps out how much Medicaid money goes to each state and reviews all regulations developed by HHS agencies.",
      "\"These HHS staffing cuts \u2014 20,000 \u2014 obviously they are completely nuts,\" Primus said. \"These were not decisions made by Kennedy or staff at HHS. They are being made at the White House. There's no rhyme or reasons to what they're doing.\"",
      "HHS leaders may be unaware of their legal duty to issue the poverty guidelines, Ghertner said. If each state and federal government agency instead sets guidelines on its own, it could create inequities and lead to lawsuits, he said.",
      "And sticking with the 2025 standard next year could put benefits for hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk, Ghertner said. The current poverty level is $15,650 for a single person and $32,150 for a family of four.",
      "\"If you make $30,000 and have three kids, say, and next year you make $31,000 but prices have gone up 7%, suddenly your $31,000 doesn't buy you the same,\" he said, \"but if the guidelines haven't increased, you might be no longer eligible for Medicaid.\"",
      "The 2025 poverty level for a family of five is $37,650.",
      "As of October, about 79 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children's Health Insurance Program, both of which are means-tested and thus depend on the poverty guidelines to determine eligibility.",
      "Eligibility for premium subsidies for insurance plans sold in Affordable Care Act marketplaces is also tied to the official poverty level.",
      "One in eight Americans rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, and 40% of newborns and their mothers receive food through the Women, Infants, and Children program, both of which also use the federal poverty level to determine eligibility.",
      "Former employees in the office said they were not disloyal to the president. They knew their jobs required them to follow the administration's objectives. \"We were trying to support the MAHA agenda,\" the social scientist said, referring to Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" rubric. \"Even if it didn't align with our personal worldviews, we wanted to be useful.\"",

      "When F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote \"The Great Gatsby\" at the height of the roaring '20s, he couldn't possibly realize that the book would emerge as one of the very top contenders for \"the great American novel.\"",
      "In fact, when Fitzgerald \u2013 a St. Paul, Minnesota native whose debut novel \"This Side of Paradise\" launched him into national prominence at the age of 24 \u2013 died in 1940 at the early age of 44, the book was already in danger of falling into obscurity.",
      "Now, 100 years after the book's first publication on April 10, 1925, it endures as one of the country's foremost tales of American hubris, modern yearning and class consciousness. And its clear-eyed assessment of the attainability of the American dream remains incisive with each passing decade.",
      "Fitzgerald's book, long a staple in high school literature classes, tells the story of Nick Carraway, a Midwesterner (and veiled Fitzgerald stand-in) who becomes enamored with the bon vivant, Jazz Age lifestyle on Long Island, specifically the effects of mutli-millioniare Jay Gatsby.",
      "Like Carraway, Gatsby is a Midwesterner who has trekked to the East Coast to make a name for himself. It's Carraway's cousin Daisy Buchanan who serves as the catalyst for Gatsby's downfall, and ultimately Carraway's own disillusionment. All the while, a symbolic green light beckons from the distance.",
      "When the book was first published, reviews were largely positive, though not unanimous. Fitzgerald, who originally wanted to title the book \"Trimalchio in West Egg\" before being persuaded to go with a title he thought far more generic, watched as the book languished on the vine commercially, selling fewer than 25,000 copies in the initial push.",
      "He would only complete one further novel in his lifetime: 1934's \"Tender is the Night,\" a thinly-veiled roman \u00e0 clef of Fitzgerald's own marriage to socialite Zelda Sayre, detailing their mutual descent into alcoholism and mental illness. Fitzgerald's early death from a heart attack was likely fuelled by years and years of alcohol abuse. Ironically, he'd gone sober just ahead of the cardiac event.",
      "If \"The Great Gatsby\" never achieved the level of esteem it now enjoys during the author's own life, it wasn't long after his death that Fitgerald's literary reputation took off.",
      "When the Modern Library asked authors, historians, critics and publishers on the eve of Y2K to rank their picks for the world's best novels of the 20th century, it was \"The Great Gatsby\" that\u00a0stood above all other U.S. contenders near the top of the poll. (The novel landed in second place, bookended by Irish author James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" and \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" in the top three.)",
      "The novel has since launched multiple film adaptations, has been transposed to the stage, and since going into the public domain in 2021, has been the subject of an endless array of reimaginings, remixes and mashups. It's even cleared space around itself as a modern-day meme, in the form of an animated .GIF depicting Leonardo Dicaprio (playing Gatsby in Baz Luhrmann's 2013 film adaptation) smirking as he offers a champagne toast flanked by ostentatious fireworks.",

    "summary": "A new breed of veterinary clinic is changing how pets \u2014 and their owners \u2014 are treated. \"I'd rather see four pets a day,\" one vet said.",
    "story": [
      "When Kathleen Whitman's daughter's Bernadoodle, Cody, swallowed a Kong toy, the family faced a veterinary emergency requiring immediate surgery.",
      "X-rays at their local suburban clinic suggested what looked like a hair tie tangled in Cody's intestines. When referred to a corporate emergency hospital, the family was quoted $10,000 for the procedure.",
      "\"They literally told me in the waiting room with a clipboard, thinking I was just coming in and we were doing $10,000,\" Whitman said. \"I said, 'No, I'm just coming in to hear the price.\"",
      "Desperate for an alternative, Whitman reached out to Vetique, a boutique veterinary clinic in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. There, Dr. Jessica Trice and Dr. Jennifer Remnes performed the surgery for what Whitman called \"an appropriate fee\" that was significantly less than $10,000.",
      "During the surgery, she and her daughter waited in the clinic's lobby with glasses of Prosecco while receiving regular updates.",
      "\"The humans were taken care of just as much as the puppy in distress was,\" Whitman said.",
      "This experience mirrors what many pet owners report when comparing corporate-owned emergency animal hospitals to independent practices. Kara Adams, whose 16-year-old rescue dog Shadow needed emergency eye surgery, also chose Vetique over corporate alternatives.",
      "When Adams called Vetique explaining she had only $1,000 available, staff accommodated her financial constraints.",
      "\"The planning manager came out with a payment plan for me,\" Adams said. \"I was crying because otherwise, what would I do? I didn't have any other options.\"",
      "\"You literally burn people out\"",
      "Drs. Trice and Remnes founded Vetique after witnessing firsthand how corporate consolidation was transforming veterinary medicine \u2014 often for the worse.",
      "\"Just coming from a corporation for many years, the whole thing is about quantity, getting all those pets,\" Trice explained after spending 10 years at Banfield Pet Hospital, followed by five years as a medical director at VCA Animal Hospitals. \"We feel the best way is not pushing about the number of quantity, because it gets very sloppy and you lose that interaction and relationship with the clients.\"",
      "Remnes' experience echoed her partner's concerns. At Banfield as a new graduate, she found herself overwhelmed by volume demands.",
      "\"As a new grad, you're still learning and trying to break into this brand-new world. I was seeing like 30 pets a day,\" Remnes said.",
      "She later moved to VCA before its Mars acquisition, initially enjoying the autonomy because \"each hospital was able to operate as they liked to.\" After the corporate takeover, however, the pressure intensified.",
      "\"It was like, 'Oh, you need to see this number of pets, or we're decreasing your salary.' That's what's burning out the industry,\" Remnes said. \"You literally burn people out doing that. You can't possibly offer your best when you're crammed with all of these patients.\"",
      "These pressures contribute to a profession in crisis. A 2024 study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that U.S. veterinarians are more likely to experience serious mental health struggles than most people.",
      "\"We have forums on Facebook where our industry has one of the highest suicide rates,\" Remnes noted. \"It's because of things like this, when you're given spreadsheets and quotas rather than focusing on patient care.\"",
      "Their solution was to create a different business model. Instead of maximizing patient volume, Vetique prioritizes extended appointment times and a calming environment with luxury touches like sparkling epoxy floors, examination tables with faux fur coverings and exam rooms named after the founders' pets.",
      "\"I'd rather see four pets a day. That meant that family was getting my full attention, that pet was getting everything that I do,\" Remnes explained.",
      "Alongside traditional veterinary medicine, Trice offers acupuncture, herbal remedies and chiropractic treatments \u2014 holistic approaches she had wanted to pursue at corporate practices but was discouraged from using.",
      "Surging pet care prices",
      "Setting prices at Vetique involves balancing fair market rates with the clinic's added value. What Remnes found surprising was how significantly corporate prices have increased in recent years. \"Prices are so drastically different from when I was at VCA seven years ago. They're charging actually close to what we're charging as a general practice for an exam,\" she noted.",
      "This observation led her to reconsider Vetique's own pricing strategy.",
      "\"It's like, 'Well, we can actually probably charge more, because we offer all these experiences along with it.' It's trying to find a happy medium, trying to be fair, but also knowing our value.\"",
      "Despite the appeal of the boutique model, both Remnes and Trice acknowledge significant business challenges. The clinic is in its third year of operation, still within the typical three-to-five-year window before seeing substantial returns. Unlike corporate-backed veterinary chains, Vetique is entirely funded through a bank loan.",
      "Vetique's founders see their clinic not as a competitor to corporate chains but as an alternative model for the industry. \"We're not competing,\" Trice said. \"We're creating a new veterinary culture.\"",
      "Corporate giants reshape vet landscape",
      "John Volk, senior consultant with Brakke Consulting, said veterinary practices historically grow 4-5% annually and carry minimal accounts receivable, making them attractive to investors.",
      "\"Pet care in general is very attractive to the financial community,\" Volk said. \"It's a very steady growth industry, and it's a cash business, so they carry very little accounts receivable because pet owners pay for their services at time of service.\"",
      "Mars Inc., best known for candy brands like M&M's and Snickers, has quietly become the largest owner of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. through a series of major acquisitions.",
      "The privately held company owns three of the nation's largest veterinary chains: Banfield Pet Hospital, VCA Animal Hospitals, and BluePearl Specialty and Emergency Pet Hospital \u2014 giving it control of more than 2,000 clinics across North America.",
      "Mars entered the pet care industry in 2007 by acquiring Banfield, which primarily operates inside PetSmart locations. In 2017, it significantly expanded its footprint by purchasing VCA for $9.1 billion \u2014 one of the largest acquisitions in veterinary history,\u00a0according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.",
      "VCA operates more than 900 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, while Banfield has over 1,000 clinics nationwide. Unlike VCA, which grew by acquiring independent practices, Banfield has mostly launched new locations within retail stores.",
      "Mars's scale allows for standardized protocols, shared technology platforms and subscription-based wellness plans across its network. According to the company website, Mars Veterinary Health serves more than 25 million pets annually.",
      "While private equity firms have been acquiring veterinary practices since the late 1980s, the trend has accelerated significantly over the past 15 years. Volk estimates approximately 30% of veterinary practices are now corporate-owned.",
      "Despite the growth in corporate ownership, Volk sees no evidence that care quality differs significantly between corporate and independent practices.",
      "\"I've not seen any data to suggest that the services provided by corporately owned practices are materially different than services provided by independently owned practices,\" he said.",
      "However, some policymakers have raised concerns about the impact of consolidation on pricing. In January 2023, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, specifically called out Mars Veterinary Health and other large veterinary corporations in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission. Warren cited \"troubling reports of anti-competitive consolidation\" and suggested these corporate entities were using market power to \"raise prices for consumers and lower wages for veterinarians.\"",
      "Even as consolidation continues, Volk finds that independent practices remain viable. \"If you have a DVM degree and don't have a bad personal history, you can get money to buy or start a practice,\" he said. \"Veterinarians are one of the lowest-risk borrowers of any category.\"",
      "For new veterinarians, the industry offers growing opportunities. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports the average starting salary in companion animal medicine reached approximately $137,000 in 2024.",
      "Design, investment, and a human touch",
      "When clients walk into a Bond Vet clinic, they won't find the sterile environment or cluttered waiting rooms traditionally associated with veterinary offices. Instead, they'll encounter soft pastel colors, comfortable seating and an atmosphere deliberately designed to feel more like a high-end hospitality experience than a medical facility.",
      "\"The industry has two categories of clinics historically \u2014 many designed very clinical, cold and sterile, and then others called mom and pop, which could be cluttered or dirty,\" said Garrett Lewis, CEO of Bond Vet. \"The question is how to solve both problems.\"",
      "That solution \u2013 creating premium veterinary experiences with transparent pricing and greater accessibility \u2013 has attracted significant private equity investment.",
      "While these premium services might suggest significantly higher costs, Lewis emphasizes transparency in Bond Vet's pricing model. \"When someone comes in, you can look at the laptop and see exactly what the pricing is,\" he said. \"Our prices are just a little bit above average, but the experience is what differentiates us.\"",
      "This transparency extends to digital platforms, where clients can check prices online or via text before visiting. During appointments, veterinarians show pricing information directly to clients on laptops, allowing for discussion about options.",
      "Bond Vet, backed by a $170 million investment from Warburg Pincus, has expanded to 57 locations across the Northeast and Midwest since its founding in 2019. The company was inspired by human-focused healthcare models like One Medical, focusing on convenience, design, and a better experience for both pets and owners.",
      "\"They saw the same issue, which was that the industry wasn't serving clients and pets at a much higher level,\" Lewis said of Bond Vet's founders, who included a veterinarian and her husband. \"They quickly found it was very different to change culture and design in existing practices, so they rebooted from the ground up.\"",
      "Bond Vet's approach represents a broader trend in veterinary medicine, where traditional practices are being reinvented with a focus on client experience alongside medical care.",
      "Bond Vet's model bridges the gap between traditional veterinary practices and emergency hospitals, offering urgent care alongside preventative services \u2013 all with a hospitality-focused approach.",
      "\"In the 90s, if you needed sick care, your veterinarian would say, 'Come on in.' If you needed preventive care, they'd say, 'Come on in,'\" Lewis explained. \"What happened in the 2000s is a lot of specialization occurred where practices became just preventative and started referring out anything that looked urgent or sick.\"",
      "Bond Vet handles non-emergency urgent cases that might otherwise end up in expensive emergency rooms. \"ER practices see about 40% of their volume as urgent rather than emergent cases. Clients go to ER and spend twice as much, often having to wait longer,\" Lewis noted.",
      "These clinics feature design elements specifically created to reduce stress for pets \u2014 an approach that appears to be working. \"I always see dogs dragging their owners into the clinic, which is not a common thing,\" Lewis said.",
      "The \"no walls\" philosophy breaking ground",
      "Imagine walking into a veterinary emergency room and instead of being separated from your pet during a crisis, you're welcomed directly onto the treatment floor. At  VEG ER for Pets, this isn't just possible \u2014 it's mandatory.",
      "\"We built an entire business around it,\" said Dr. David Bessler, founder and CEO of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's much easier doing something 100% of the time than trying to do it 90% of the time.\"",
      "With 102 locations across 28 states, VEG ER for Pets represents an approach to emergency veterinary medicine that stands apart from both traditional practices and newer primary care models.",
      "Unlike other veterinary innovators that blend primary and urgent care, VEG ER for Pets focuses exclusively on emergency medicine \u2013 a deliberate strategy that Bessler calls \"a bit of a crazy bet.\"",
      "\"We took the hardest part of an industry, emergency, and created an entire business around that,\" said David Glattstein, co-founder and president of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's hard to make money, it's hard to get the team, it's hard to recruit, it's hard to train.\"",
      "VEG ER for Pets' most distinctive feature is its commitment to keeping pets with their owners throughout the entire treatment process, even during emergencies \u2014 an approach not found in traditional emergency hospitals, where pets are typically treated in back rooms away from owners.",
      "This transparency extends to the physical design of newer hospitals, which have eliminated traditional waiting rooms entirely. \"Our newer hospitals don't even have a lobby,\" Glattstein explained. \"You literally walk in and you're in the middle of the treatment floor.\"",
      "In a notable departure from many veterinary innovators, VEG ER for Pets has achieved financial independence from its initial investors and now funds its expansion through its own operations.",
      "\"VEG ER for Pets is now independently able to do that,\" Glattstein stated. \"We don't need anyone else to advocate for us or to pay for us. We're not beholden to anybody. We're beholden to our customers, and we're beholden to our veggies.\"",
      "This independence allows the company to maintain its distinctive approach while continuing to open 25-30 new locations annually.",
      "The company's exclusive focus on emergency care, while limiting in some ways, has allowed it to \"crack the code\" on veterinary emergencies according to Glattstein. \"We've kind of cracked the code on one way of doing things in emergency that results in a better experience for all of the souls that are there experiencing that at the same time.\"",

      "A Senate committee heard from several experts Thursday on setting a year-round time standard instead of switching back and forth with daylight saving time. President Trump recently called it a \"50/50 issue,\" but he previously vowed to get rid of daylight saving.",
      "At the hearing, the committee's chairman, Sen. Ted Cruz, said there is a general consensus among his colleagues that the system of switching the clocks needs to be changed, but he said there is disagreement about whether to adopt universal standard time or daylight saving time.",
      "\"I personally struggle with the two choices here, because it's a question of what do you care about more: sunshine and joy and fun and money, or health, mental health, physical health,\" said Cruz, a Republican from Texas. \"And the honest answer for most people, gosh, I care about all that stuff.\"",
      "Cruz said an alternative has been discussed to pick daylight saving time, but letting states opt out. Arizona and Hawaii current opt out of changing the clock. But others said in Thursday's hearing that having different standards for different states could cause widespread confusion.",
      "The Senate Commerce Committee hearing notice did not set a preference for daylight saving time or standard time, but instead said it would focus on \"various issues around whether the country should continue 'springing forward' and 'falling back' each year with time.\"",
      "Daylight saving time begins in March, when clocks are moved forward an hour, and ends in October, when the clocks go back to standard time.",
      "The twice-yearly time changes are\u00a0generally unpopular\u00a0among Americans, with 63% saying they\u00a0would like to eliminate\u00a0them completely, compared to just 16% who said they would not, according to an Economist/YouGov poll in November 2021.",
      "\"People across our country are tired of the constant cycle of falling back and springing forward,\" Democratic Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware said, calling it time for a \"thoughtful solution\" across the country.",
      "\"The important thing is that we land of something consistent and make smart investments to keep people safe,\" she said.",
      "\"Time is always complicated and the system we have is complicated, but it's complicated because it's a human creation,\" said Scott Yates, the founder of the Lock the Clock movement, which supports getting rid of twice-yearly time changes.",

And so if we have a little bit of time, a couple of years, so the individual states can address all of these complexities and make those decisions, then we will be able to get rid of this bug permanently. It is something we have been stuck with since World War I, and this is our opportunity to finally fix it.\"",

      "Thirty-five is the minimum age requirement for the U.S. presidency, but there's no upward limit. The two last presidential elections, which brought Joe Biden, now 82, and Donald Trump, at\u00a078, to the White House, are proof of this political reality.",
      "The Founding Fathers excluded a maximum age limit from the Constitution, giving those in their golden years the ability to run for the highest office in the land.",
      "According to Pew Research, 19 inaugurations have involved presidents in their 60s and just four have involved presidents in their 70s. The median age for U.S. presidents\u00a0on their first day in office is 55.",
      "The 2024 election cycle again brought discussion about\u00a0how old is too old\u00a0for office, which accelerated after Mr. Biden's on-air debate fumbles in June 2024. The political firestorm led to his his decision\u00a0to step aside as the Democratic nominee a few weeks later. Critics have also raised concern about Mr. Trump's age and competency.",
      "Here's a look at the history of the oldest presidents \u2014 in the Oval Office and beyond:",
      "Who were the oldest U.S. presidents at election and in office?",
      "Presidents Trump and Biden are the two oldest presidents ever to be sworn in. When Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2025, he eclipsed Biden by a few months to take the record. Both were inaugurated at age 78, but Mr. Trump was about 5 months older.",
      "The third oldest president at his inauguration was Ronald Reagan, who was 69 when he was sworn in in 1981. \"I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience,\" Reagan famously said in 1984 while running for reelection against Walter Mondale.",
      "In fourth place is the nation's ninth president, William Henry Harrison. Harrison was elected in 1841 at age 68, but his tenure as president was short-lived. He died 32 days into his first term, making his presidency the shortest in U.S. history.",
      "Who are the oldest living U.S. presidents?",
      "The oldest living president is Biden, who turned 82 on Nov. 20, 2024, just weeks after the election. Mr. Trump and two former presidents, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, all 78 years old, roughly tied for second.",
      "Who was the longest-living president?",
      "Jimmy Carter who died at the age of 100\u00a0in December 2024, was the oldest living former U.S. president in history. Carter, a Democrat from Georgia, served one term, from 1977 to 1981. He\u00a0broke the longevity milestone in 2019, at 94 years old, surpassing George H.W. Bush to become the longest-living president.",
      "More than 1,000 people recently paid tribute to the former president at a\u00a0benefit concert\u00a0ahead of his centennial. He\u00a0celebrated his 100th birthday\u00a0on Oct. 1, 2024, more than a year after it was announced he had entered hospice care.",
      "After he left office more than 40 years ago, Carter kept busy building more than 4,000 homes for Habitat for Humanity, traveled the world to promote human rights and won the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "Full list of U.S. presidents, from oldest to youngest at end of presidency",

    "summary": "Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy and the rest of golf's best players have gathered again at Augusta National for the Masters.",
    "story": [
      "The Masters began Thursday at Augusta National. Defending champion Scottie Scheffler will try to win his third green jacket and\u00a0Rory McIlroy will try again to win his first as the biggest names in golf come together amid the Georgia pines for 2025's first major championship.",
      "There are 95 players in the field, the largest in a decade, even without five-time champion Tiger Woods, who had surgery in March to repair a torn Achilles tendon. Last year, Woods set a record by making the cut for the 24th time in a row.",
      "There is still a schism in the game, and just 12 from the breakaway LIV Golf league will be teeing up among the pink dogwoods and blooming azaleas. That includes Jon Rahm, the winner two years ago, and U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau.",
      "Here is a look at what you need to know about the Masters. CBS Sports will update its live leaderboard with player standings as the tournament goes on.",
      "When will the Masters start?",
      "The first round began at about 7:25 a.m. EDT Thursday, when honorary starters Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Tom Watson teed off on Tea Olive, the first hole at Augusta National. Jock Hutchison and Fred McLeod were the first honorary starters in 1963, but it was not until Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen took over in 1981 that it became a treasured tradition.",
      "Who is playing in the Masters?",
      "Davis Riley and Patton Kizzire were the first competitors off at 7:40 a.m., followed by groups of three. After the second round, the top 50 players and ties make the cut for the weekend and are paired according to score for the final two rounds.",
      "Scheffler, who has yet to win this season, is the 9-2 favorite, according to BetMGM Sportsbook. McIlory is second at 13-2 after his wins at Pebble Beach and The Players Championship. Collin Morikawa is 14-1 while Rahm and DeChambeau are 16-1.",
      "Scheffler, who along with his green jacket and Olympic gold medal won seven times on the PGA Tour last year, got a late start to this season after cutting himself on a wine glass in December. But the world No. 1 comes into the Masters with momentum after a final-round 63 left him one shot back of winner Min Woo Lee in his last start at the Houston Open.",
      "McIlroy has been playing some of the best golf of his career. His collapse in the U.S. Open at Pinehurst last year in a Sunday duel with DeChambeau seems to have made the 35-year-old from Northern Ireland an even bigger sentimental favorite.",
      "Xander Schauffele won two majors last year and is seeking his first green jacket, though he seems to be still rounding into form following a rib injury. Five-time major winner Brooks Koepka has twice finished second at Augusta National.",
      "Morikawa, Lee and Joaquin Niemann teed off at 9:47 a.m. Thursday, beginning a run of high-profile groups. Phil Mickelson, Jason Day and Keegan Bradley played next, followed by Scheffler, who is grouped with Justin Thomas and U.S. Amateur champ Jose Luis Ballester. Jordan Spieth, Tom Kim and Tyrrell Hatton went off at 10:26 a.m.",
      "In the afternoon, McIlroy is grouped with Ludvig Aberg and Akshay Bhatia and tees off at 1:12 p.m., just behind the group of Schauffele, Adam Scott and Viktor Hoveland. DeChambeau, Hideki Matsuyama and Shane Lowery are off at 1:23 p.m., followed by Rahm, Wyndham Clark and Tommy Fleetwood.",
      "How to watch the Masters",
      "The Masters stream on its website began Thursday at 7:15 a.m. and runs throughout the day. Cameras highlight holes and featured groups. The first two rounds are broadcast on ESPN beginning at 3 p.m. Thursday and Friday. CBS takes over Saturday and Sunday with coverage on its Paramount+ platform at noon and on the network beginning at 2 p.m.",
      "What has happened at the Masters so far?",
      "While most of Monday's practice round was washed out, Tuesday and Wednesday were warm and sunny. The forecast for Thursday is clear, but storms could arrive overnight and the rain could continue into the early part of Friday.",
      "Scheffler birdied the fourth hole of the course for the first time in his career. He has now birdied, or scored one stroke under par, on all 18 holes at the course at least once, CBS Sports reported.",
      "Before the competition got underway Thursday, players took part in the Masters Par 3 Contest, where golfers aim to complete each step of the nine-hole course in three strokes or less. The contest was held Wednesday. It dates back to 1960 and is set around DeSoto Springs Pond and Ike's Pond, the PGA said.",
      "Nicolas Echavarria and J.J. Spaun finished atop the leaderboard at 5 under in the family friendly event, but they may come to regret it \u2014 nobody has won the\u00a0Par 3 Tournament and gone on to win the Masters in the same year.",

    "summary": "A federal immigration official acknowledged last week that the removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man, to El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday said the Trump administration must facilitate the release of a Maryland man mistakenly deported from custody in El Salvador, but ordered additional proceedings before a federal district court.",
      "In an unsigned decision, the high court acknowledged that a late Monday deadline set by the district court judge to secure the return to the U.S. of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, and paused by Chief Justice John Roberts had already passed, effectively granting in part the emergency relief sought by the Trump administration.",
      "But the court said that the district court's order \"properly requires the government to 'facilitate'\" Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody and to \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"",
      "The Supreme Court went on to say that the intended scope of the term \"effectuate\" in the lower court's decision is unclear and may exceed its authority. The high court directed the district court to provide more clarification with the case sent back for further proceedings.",
      "\"The district court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" the court said in an unsigned opinion. \"For its part, the Government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.\"",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis issued an order Thursday evening following the Supreme Court's decision directing the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia \"as soon as possible.\"",
      "She gave the Department of Justice until 9:30 a.m. Friday to detail where Abrego Garcia is and the plans to bring him back to the U.S.",
      "There were no noted dissents, and the three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, noted their respect for the court's disposition of the application. Sotomayor said in a statement joined by Kagan and Jackson that there is agreement among the justices \"that the proper remedy is to provide Abrego Garcia with all the process to which he would have been entitled had he not been unlawfully removed to El Salvador.\"",
      "\"As the Supreme Court correctly recognized, it is the exclusive prerogative of the President to conduct foreign affairs,\" a DOJ spokesperson said Thursday. \"By directly noting the deference owed to the Executive Branch, this ruling once again illustrates that activist judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of the President's authority to conduct foreign policy.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers asked the Trump administration in a court filing to facilitate his release from the notorious Salvadoran supermax prison known as CECOT Thursday evening and to dispatch a plane to retrieve him. They cited the \"grave risk to his safety in El Salvador.\"",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to step in after a federal district judge on Friday ordered it to take immediate action to return Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. The 29-year-old Salvadoran national was arrested by immigration authorities on March 15 and was among the more than 200 people sent on deportation flights to El Salvador last month.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case sparked backlash after a federal immigration official acknowledged in a court filing last week that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16 years old and was arrested in 2019, according to court documents. During immigration proceedings, the Department of Homeland Security claimed that Abrego Garcia was a member of the gang MS-13, citing a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie he was wearing and allegations from a confidential informant who said he belonged to a branch of MS-13 that operates on Long Island, New York, court records show.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said he has never lived on Long Island and has no affiliation with MS-13. They also said he has no criminal history and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "An immigration judge detained Abrego Garcia after denying a request for release on bond, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board. But he was ultimately granted withholding of removal to El Salvador, a legal status that prohibits the government from returning him to his home country because he is more likely than not to face persecution from local gangs, according to court records.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from custody following that decision and has lived for six years in Maryland with his wife and their children. He had regular check-ins with immigration authorities, according to court filings, but was arrested on March 12 after he was stopped by immigration agents while driving with his son in the back seat. Abrego Garcia was taken into custody and transported to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in Baltimore, Louisiana and Texas before he was flown to El Salvador, according to legal filings.",
      "After Abrego Garcia was sent to the Salvarodan prison last month, he and his wife, a U.S. citizen, filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland alleging his removal violated federal immigration law and seeking an order requiring his return to U.S. custody.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis granted that request following a hearing Friday and directed the government to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. no later than 11:59 p.m. Monday. The Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit to halt that order, and while its request was pending, asked the Supreme Court to intervene. The 4th Circuit then declined to pause the district court's decision.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the lower court order \"sets the United States up for failure\" because it interfered with President Trump's ability to conduct foreign diplomacy and set a tight timeline for compliance. He wrote that the U.S. cannot force the release of Abrego Garcia because he is now in the custody of the Salvadoran government.",
      "\"The United States does not control the sovereign nation of El Salvador, nor can it compel El Salvador to follow a federal judge's bidding,\" the solicitor general wrote.",
      "Sotomayor warned in her statement that the government's argument \"implies that it could deport and incarcerate any person, including U. S. citizens, without legal consequence, so long as it does so before a court can intervene.\"",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia called his case \"one of one,\" and argued in court papers that requiring the government to facilitate their client's return is \"not novel,\" because the district court's order just requires the Trump administration to correct its own error.",
      "\"The executive branch may not seize individuals from the streets, deposit them in foreign prisons in violation of court orders, and then invoke the separation of powers to insulate its unlawful actions from judicial scrutiny,\" they wrote.",
      "Abrego Garcia's legal team called the government's mistake in removing him \"Kafka-esque,\" and noted that he has lived in the U.S. for several years without any issues.",
      "\"The government offers no evidence that he has become a threat overnight,\" they wrote.",
      "Migrants removed from the U.S. are being housed in CECOT as a result of a temporary agreement the Trump administration reached with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, under which the U.S. government is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to hold U.S. detainees for a year.",
      "Citing this arrangement, Abrego Garcia's lawyers argued that the U.S. government \"functionally controls Abrego Garcia's detention \u2014 it has simply contracted with El Salvador to be the jailer.\"",
      "Lower courts also said that the government has control over Abrego Garcia, since he is being temporarily housed in CECOT at the Trump administration's request.",
      "\"The government's claim that it can remove an individual from the United States pursuant to such an agreement and thereby lose the ability to reclaim that individual and return him to the country for process (or for any other purpose) cannot stand,\" Judge Stephanie Thacker, who sits on the 4th Circuit, wrote in an opinion. She added that \"the government's actions in this case most assuredly violated the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\"",
      "Thacker, who was joined by Judge Robert King, wrote that \"the government cannot escape its responsibility to return Abrego Garcia to the United States by claiming it now lacks authority to control El Salvador.\"",
      "While the Trump administration has acknowledged that it inadvertently sent Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it has argued that the federal courts do not have the power to demand his return since he's no longer in U.S. custody. Administration officials have also claimed that he is an MS-13 \"leader,\" though they have not produced evidence to support the allegations.",
      "During last week's hearing before Xinis, Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni repeatedly struggled to answer the judge's questions but said he wasn't given sufficient information by the administration.",
      "\"The facts are conceded, plaintiff Abrego Garcia should not have been removed,\" Reuveni said.",
      "When questioned about why the government is not able to return Abrego Garcia, Reuveni said he \"asked the government the same question\" and did not receive an answer. The Justice Department lawyer said multiple times he was \"frustrated\" with the government's lack of cooperation in the case.",
      "Following Friday's argument, Reuveni was placed on administrative leave, and Sauer said in a filing that his statements were \"inappropriate\" and \"do not reflect the position of the United States.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News about Reuveni's employment status, Attorney General Pam Bondi said, \"At my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences.\"",

    "summary": "Trade tensions remain high despite President Trump's decision on Wednesday to temporarily freeze U.S. tariffs on dozens of countries.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. stocks surrendered a chunk of their historic gains from the day before as President Donald Trump's trade war continues to threaten the economy.",
      "The S&P 500 fell 189 points, or 3.5%, Thursday to close at 5,268. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,015 points, or 2.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite sank 4.3%.",
      "China this week announced more countermeasures against the U.S., and market losses accelerated after the White House clarified that it will tax Chinese imports at 145%, not 125% as initially announced by Mr. Trump on social media. The swings also hit the bond market despite a better-than-expected report on inflation. U.S. crude oil prices fell more than 3%.",
      "It's been a wild couple of weeks on Wall Street with Mr. Trump's tariff announcements,\u00a0reversals and retaliation from U.S. trading partners. That volatility seems unlikely to change in the coming weeks with the U.S. and China still locked in a tit-for-tat tariff battle and earnings season kicking off on Friday with the latest results from some of the nation's biggest banks.",
      "\"Despite Wednesday's announcements to lower the reciprocal tariff rate for most countries to 10%, the escalation between the U.S. and China could dramatically impact trade between the world's two largest economies,\" said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer for wealth management at UBS, in a research note.",
      "Taking into account Mr. Trump's 145% levy on Chinese imports, UBS currently estimates the overall U.S.\u00a0effective tariff rate at 27%, versus 9% prior to April 2. \"Excluding trade with China, the effective tariff rate is 11%,\" Haefele added.",
      "\"Everything is still very volatile, because with Donald Trump, you don't know what to expect,\" said Francis Lun, chief executive of Geo Securities. \"This is really big uncertainty in the market. The threat of recession has not faded.\"",
      "Markets had been sinking earlier Wednesday on worries that Mr. Trump's trade war could drag the global economy into a recession. But then came the posting on social media that investors worldwide had been waiting and wishing for.",
      "\"I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE,\" Mr. Trump said, saying more than 75 countries are negotiating on trade and not retaliating against his latest increases in tariffs. China was a huge exception, with the president raising tariffs\u00a0 on its products to 145%.",
      "Investors went \"from fear to euphoria,\" Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said in a commentary. On Wednesday, following Mr. Trump's tariff-pause announcement, the S&P 500 surged 9.5%, its third-best day since 1940. The index is still below where it was when Trump announced his sweeping set of tariffs last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shot to a gain of nearly 3,000 points, or 7.9%. The Nasdaq composite leaped 12.2%.",
      "\"It's now a manageable risk, especially as global recession tail bets get unwound, and most of Asia's exporters breathe a massive sigh of relief,\" Innes said. Analysts had expected the global comeback given that U.S. stocks had one of their best days in history on Wednesday as investors registered their relief over Trump's decision.",
      "The trade war isn't over, and an escalating battle between the world's two largest economies can create plenty of damage. U.S. stocks are also still below where they were just a week ago. Technology stocks were the biggest drag on markets in early trading Thursday, followed by the industrial and the financial sectors.",
      "CPI report brings good news",
      "On a positive note, the U.S. government's latest consumer inflation data revealed inflation in March\u00a0rose\u00a02.4% on an annual basis, a sign of progress in the Federal Reserve's battle to\u00a0bring down inflation\u00a0to a 2% rate.",
      "\"This month's inflation report showed that CPI dropped across the board in March, which is welcome news for the Federal Reserve, which would like to cut rates if significant damage is done to the economy through increased tariffs, but otherwise would be reluctant to cut rates in the face of an inflation threat,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management.",
      "March \"saw a fairly big cooling in inflation (both headline and core) and this, coupled w/the healthy job adds from last week, point to robust underlying economic fundamentals. The downtick in inflation gives breathing room for the Fed to be more forceful in responding to market turmoil,\" said equity analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, in a report.",
      "From bear investors' perspective, however, \"inflation is still running above the Fed's target and regardless, Mar and Q1 numbers are irrelevant given how much the world has changed. Trump's tariffs are only hitting the economy now, and it will take months before they fully show up in the data,\" Crisafulli added.",
      "In other words, according to most analysts, the situation is still too uncertain to call.",
      "\"It's much too soon to blow the all clear \u2014 both on tariffs or on inflation \u2014 since the tariff damage has only been postponed as of now, and will only be relieved if tariff deals can be struck across the board,\" Zaccarelli said.",
      "\"Inflation still remains a concern because the full impact of tariffs is yet to be felt, however, at least the underlying trends (e.g. non-tariff related inflation) seems benign at this time. We will be keeping a close eye on PPI tomorrow in order to determine whether or not future inflation is already in the pipeline,\" he added.",
      "In report Thursday, TD Securities analysts echoed that sentiment, saying, \"Indeed, uncertainty remains in the air as the outlook for consumer price inflation remains blurred by ongoing trade policy developments.\"",

    "summary": "Inflation cooled in March, but economists expect prices to reaccelerate as some of President Trump's tariffs kick in.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index in March rose 2.4% on an annual basis, showing progress in the Federal Reserve's battle to bring down inflation to a 2% rate.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was forecast to rise 2.6% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "March's report comes after\u00a0inflation rose 2.8% on an annual basis in February.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices actually fell 0.1% in March, the first monthly drop in nearly five years.",
      "Inflation eased last month due partly to lower fuel prices, with gasoline tumbling 9.8% on an annual basis, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said.",
      "Another reason prices fell was sharp drops in travel-related costs, including airfares, which decreased 5.3% just from February to March. Hotel room prices dropped 3.5%.",
      "Economists said those declines in part reflected much slower international demand as the number of tourists visiting the United States has fallen sharply amid Trump's aggressive trade policy.",
      "Visits to the United States from overseas fell nearly 12% last month, according to government data.",
      "What experts say",
      "Easing inflation combined with President Trump's announcement yesterday of a 90-day pause in his reciprocal tariffs should help alleviate some concerns for the Federal Reserve when it meets on May 7 to make its next interest rate decision, said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank.",
      "But because other tariffs orchestrated by Mr. Trump have recently gone into effect \u2014 such as auto tariffs \u2013 inflation nevertheless could pick up later this year, experts say.",
      "Yet March's data is \"backward looking\" and doesn't reflect the trade policy changes orchestrated by the Trump administration, noted Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are still expected to lift inflation later in the year as the impact of the import duties trickle through the economy. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. importers like Walmart when they accept shipments of foreign goods, they typically pass off all or some of the tariff cost onto consumers through higher prices.",
      "The president's 90-day pause excludes China, a major exporter to the U.S., which will continue to face tariffs of 125% on its goods. And Mr. Trump's 10% universal duty will also likely to push up prices in the coming months, economists say. The higher import taxes will likely weigh on the economy's growth as well.",
      "What the CPI shows about egg prices",
      "Although consumer prices cooled in March, the CPI data showed egg prices continued to inch higher last month. According to the CPI figures, egg prices increased in March to reach a new record-high of $6.23 despite a drop in wholesale prices and no egg farms having bird flu outbreaks.",
      "More recently, grocers have told CBS News that egg prices are\u00a0showing signs of easing.",
      "Bird flu outbreaks were cited as the major cause of price spikes in January and February after more than 30 million egg-laying chickens were killed to prevent the spread of the disease.",
      "Since the current bird flu outbreak began, more than 168 million birds have been slaughtered, most of them egg-laying chickens. Any time a bird gets sick, the entire flock is killed to help keep bird flu from spreading. That can have an effect on the egg supply because massive egg farms may have millions of birds.",
      "What the CPI means for your money",
      "Despite today's cooler-than-expected CPI numbers, inflationary risks are still a threat to the U.S. economy, especially as some of Mr. Trump's tariffs are still in place while others are merely delayed, experts say.",
      "\"Going forward, the Fed is likely to face a difficult trade-off as tariff-driven price increases start to feed through to the inflation data and activity remains soft,\" Haigh said. \"We expect the Fed's initial reaction to be cautious, but the risks remain that a sharper than expected slowdown in the economy could result in a resumption of the Fed's easing cycle.\"",
      "Three of four economists polled by FactSet expect the Fed will hold rates steady at its next meeting on May 7. The current federal funds \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 now stands in a range 4.5% to 4.75%.",
      "That means consumers and businesses are unlikely to see any relief on loan rates in the near term, although economists are penciling in cuts later in the year, with the majority forecasting a reduction at the Fed's June 18 meeting.",

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now backing an additional measles vaccine shot for some travelers within the United States, multiple health officials tell CBS News, in response to record outbreaks of the highly contagious virus this year.",
      "In a letter shared with health departments on April 8, the CDC said it would now be recommending that visitors to areas affected by measles outbreaks within the United States follow stepped up vaccination guidance issued by local authorities.",
      "Most adults still do not need an additional dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, the CDC says. But for \"people going to or living in areas in the United States with ongoing community-wide measles transmission,\" the CDC says doctors should \"reassess need\" for vaccination.",
      "This means that adult and teen travelers to some counties in Texas and Kansas \u2014 the states that have updated their recommendations \u2014 should get a second dose if they have not received two doses already or get two doses if they are unvaccinated. Infants should get an early first dose before the typically recommended age of 12 months old, followed by two more doses, and children over 12 months old should get an early second dose if they already have one, or two doses if they are unvaccinated.",
      "Previously, the CDC had said that one dose of the measles vaccine or other evidence of immunity was \"sufficient for most adults.\"",
      "But the CDC has long had stepped up recommendations for Americans preparing for international travel. Under those recommendations, children over 12 months old, teenagers and adults should have two doses if they do not have other evidence of immunity, and infants should get an early first dose.",
      "Local outbreaks of the virus have also been reported to the CDC from New Jersey, Georgia and Ohio, the agency said last week. Other states have since reported local spread, including Indiana and Colorado.",
      "More than 600 measles cases across at least 21 states have been reported so far this year, the most since a record 2019 wave of the virus that reached 1,274 cases nationwide. Two unvaccinated children in Texas, and an unvaccinated adult in neighboring New Mexico, have died.",
      "While the CDC said that health departments could share the updated guidance with providers in their state, it is unclear why the agency did not publish their latest recommendations on its own website. A bulletin issued by the agency on April 8 about measles did not mention the new vaccination recommendations for domestic travel.",
      "\"CDC's clinical vaccination guidance for measles outbreaks has not changed. During measles outbreaks, health departments may provide additional recommendations to protect their communities,\" a spokesperson for the agency said in a statement.",
      "They said that the decision to offer an early dose of vaccine to young children \"should be made carefully after weighing the risks of the potential long-term impact of lower immune responses\" compared to the benefit of early protection.",
      "\"There are no recommendations to receive a third dose of MMR vaccine during measles outbreaks,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Who should get another measles shot?",
      "Vaccination of visitors to areas affected by outbreaks should follow the same recommendations issued by health authorities for those areas, which are being published on the agency's website, the CDC told doctors.",
      "So far, only two states \u2014 Texas and Kansas \u2014 are listed by the CDC as having issued \"updated outbreak recommendations\" in response to the virus, which are broken down by age for most residents.",
      "The states say in counties facing outbreaks, adults and teenagers should get a second dose if they've only had one previously. If they are unvaccinated, they should get one dose immediately, followed by a second dose at least 28 days later.",
      "Infants 6 to 11 months old should get an early first dose, the recommendations say. They then should receive a second dose at 12 to 15 months and a third at 4 to 6 years old.",
      "Children over 12 months old who have one dose should get an early second dose, as long as it's been at least 28 days since the first. If they haven't been vaccinated, they should get one dose immediately, followed by another at least 28 days later.",
      "Additionally, individuals born between 1957 and 1968 who received an older MMR vaccine, are recommended to get at least one dose of the current vaccine. Texas recommends those individuals get two doses.",

      "China said Friday that it was raising tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125%, the latest development in the escalating trade war between the two countries. It said the higher tariffs would take effect on Saturday.",
      "\"The U.S.' arbitrary imposition of abnormally high tariffs on China seriously violates international economic and trade rules, disregards the post-World War II global economic order built by the U.S. itself, and violates basic economic laws and common sense,\"\u00a0a statement put out by China's Finance Ministry announcing the tariffs said.",
      "The statement called rising U.S. tariffs \"a joke\" and said it would not respond to future U.S. tariff hikes.",

    "story": [
      "An ancient jawbone discovered in Taiwan belonged to an enigmatic group of early human ancestors called Denisovans, scientists reported Thursday.",
      "Relatively little is known about Denisovans, an extinct group of human cousins that interacted with Neanderthals and our own species, Homo sapiens.",
      "\"Denisovan fossils are very scarce,\" with only a few confirmed finds in East Asia, said study co-author Takumi Tsutaya at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies in Japan.",
      "So far, the only known Denisovan fossils include partial jawbones, a few teeth and part of a finger bone found in caves in Siberia and Tibet. Some scientists believe fossils found in a cave in Laos may also belong to Denisovans.",
      "The probable identification of the jawbone from Taiwan as Denisovan expands the region where scientists know these ancient people once lived, said Tsutaya.",
      "\"Denisovans must therefore have been capable of adapting to a wide range of habitat types,\" study co-author Frido Welker told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The partial jawbone was first recovered when a fishing operation dredged the seafloor in the Penghu Channel near the Taiwan Strait. After it was sold to an antique shop, a collector spotted it and purchased it in 2008, then later donated it to Taiwan's National Museum of Natural Science.",
      "Based on the composition of marine invertebrates found attached to it, the fossil was dated to the Pleistocene era. But exactly which species of early human ancestor it belonged to remained a mystery.",
      "The condition of the fossil made it impossible to study ancient DNA. But recently, scientists in Taiwan, Japan and Denmark were able to extract some protein sequences from the incomplete jawbone.",
      "An analysis showed some protein sequences resembled those contained in the genome of a Denisovan fossil recovered in Siberia. The findings were published in the journal Science.",
      "While the new research is promising, Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Project, said he would like to see further data before confirming the Taiwan fossil as Denisovan.",
      "Potts, who was not involved in the new research, praised the study for \"a fantastic job of recovering some proteins.\" But he added, such a small sliver of material may not give a full picture.",
      "At one time, at least three human ancestor groups - Denisovans, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens - coexisted in Eurasia and sometimes interbred, researchers say.",
      "\"We can identity Neanderthal elements and Denisovan elements\" in the DNA of some people alive today, said Tsutaya.",
      "Scientists still don't know exactly why Denisovans went extinct.",
      "\"We have so little archaeological and fossil information about Denisovans that we can only speculate as to why they disappeared,\" Welker told Reuters. \"A lasting legacy, though, is that some human populations in East and Southeast Asia carry some Denisovan ancestry in their genomes today.\"",

      "Russia released Ksenia Karelina, a dual U.S.-Russian national who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason in August last year, in a new prison swap on Thursday. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed her release in a social media post early Thursday, but offered no information about the terms of her release.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported\u00a0Karelina's release, saying she was freed in a swap arranged by the two countries' intelligence agencies, and a CIA official later told CBS News that the agency had played a central role in the deal on behalf of the U.S. government.",
      "\"American Ksenia Karelina is on a plane back home to the United States,\" Rubio said in his post. \"She was wrongfully detained by Russia for over a year and President Trump secured her release.\"",

      "\"Much of the swap was negotiated by the U.S. government, with CIA playing a key role engaging with Russian intelligence,\" a CIA spokesperson said Thursday, adding, \"The exchange shows the importance of keeping lines of communication open with Russia, despite the deep challenges in our bilateral relationship.\"",
      "Karelina was sentenced to 12 years in a Russian penal colony after pleading guilty to treason. She was arrested while on visit to Russia for donating about $51 to an American-based humanitarian group that was helping Ukrainians impacted by the war, according to Russian state media.",
      "Her lawyers said she acknowledged transferring the funds, though she did not admit she intentionally directed them to organizations that might have used the money for actions against Russia. She didn't expect that her donation would end up supporting anti-Russian activities, according to her lawyers.",
      "Van Heerden\u00a0told CBS News last year that she had made the small donation in 2022, \"exercising her First Amendment rights,\" adding that \"she has done nothing wrong.\"",
      "Van Heerden said he was uneasy about Karelina's decision to return to Russia for a visit, given the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, but he said she \"had no worry in the world,\" and that she had assured him it would be safe since she was entering the country as a dual American-Russian citizen.",
      "\"She wanted to go home. She made it very clear that she wanted to go home,\" Van Heerden told Gayle King on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Wanting to fulfill her wish to visit home, Van Heerden said he bought her a plane ticket as a birthday gift, and the pair first traveled together to Istanbul. He had originally intended to travel with her to Russia from there, but he didn't feel comfortable, so she traveled alone to Russia, and he returned to Los Angeles.",

      "Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic \u2014 Rescue crews in the Dominican Republic dug through the remains of a legendary nightclub Thursday whose roof collapsed earlier this week, killing at least 221 people, but hopes of finding survivors were slim.",
      "Meanwhile, dozens of people in the capital of Santo Domingo were still searching for their loved ones and growing frustrated that they weren't getting any answers after visiting hospitals and the country's forensic institute.",
      "Doctors warned that some of the two dozen patients who remained hospitalized were still not in the clear, especially the eight who were in critical condition.",
      "\"If the trauma is too great, there's not a lot of time\" left to save patients in that condition, said Health Minister Dr. V\u00edctor Atallah.",
      "He and other doctors said injuries include fractures of the skull, femur and pelvis caused by cement slabs falling on people attending a merengue concert at the Jet Set nightclub in Santo Domingo. More than 200 were injured.",
      "The government said Wednesday night that it was moving to a recovery phase focused on finding bodies, but Juan Manuel M\u00e9ndez, director of the Center of Emergency Operations, said crews at the scene were still looking for victims and potential survivors, though no one has been found alive since Tuesday afternoon.",
      "\"We're not going to abandon anyone. Our work will continue,\" he said.",
      "Names of victims emerging",
      "The legendary club was packed with musicians, professional athletes and government officials when dust began falling from the ceiling and into people's drinks early Tuesday. Minutes later, the roof collapsed.",
      "Victims include merengue icon Rubby P\u00e9rez, who'd been singing to the crowd before the roof fell; former MLB players Octavio Dotel and Tony Enrique Blanco Cabrera; and Nelsy Cruz, the governor of the northwestern province of Montecristi whose brother is seven-time Major League Baseball All-Star Nelson Cruz.",
      "Also killed were a retired United Nations official; saxophonist Luis Sol\u00eds, who was playing onstage when the roof fell; New York-based fashion designer Mart\u00edn Polanco; the son and daughter-in-law of the minister of public works; the brother of the vice minister of the Ministry of Youth; and three employees of Grupo Popular, a financial services company, including the president of AFP Popular Bank and his wife.",
      "Randolfo Rijo G\u00f3mez, director of the country's 911 system, said it received more than 100 calls, including several from people buried under the rubble. He noted that police arrived at the scene in 90 seconds, followed minutes later by first response units. In less than half an hour, 25 soldiers, seven fire brigades and 77 ambulances were activated, he said.",
      "Crews used dogs and thermal cameras to search for victims and rescued 145 survivors from the rubble, authorities said.",
      "Attention to turn soon to probing collapse's cause",
      "It wasn't immediately clear what caused the roof to collapse, or when the Jet Set building was last inspected.",
      "The government said late Wednesday that once the recovery phase ends, it will launch a thorough investigation.",
      "The club issued a statement saying it was cooperating with authorities. A spokesperson for the family that owns the club told The Associated Press that she passed along questions about potential inspections.",
      "Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Works referred questions to the mayor's office. A spokesperson for the mayor's office didn't respond to a request for comment.",

      "U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink intends to resign from her post early, three sources told CBS News.",
      "The State Department confirmed her intent to step down\u00a0Thursday afternoon.",
      "\"Ambassador Brink is stepping down. She's been the ambassador there for three years \u2013 that's a long time in a war zone. And frankly, the war has gone on for far too long,\" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement. \"The real issue is whether the Russians and Ukrainians are ready to do what's necessary to end this war.\"",
      "Brink has not formally submitted resignation papers but she has been making farewell calls to colleagues, sources said.",
      "Ambassador Brink has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "One senior U.S. official told CBS that her resignation stems from an unusual mix of personal and policy concerns, including the recent USAID layoffs. Brink is serving in a war zone far from her family, since Kyiv is designated as an unaccompanied post, where officers serve without bringing their families with them.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio intended to keep Brink, a career foreign service officer, in the job and declined the initial resignation she had submitted in January as part of the standard turnover between administrations.",
      "Brink's resignation comes at a pivotal moment for U.S.-Ukraine relations. The Trump administration has tried to broker an end to the Russian invasion in part by ending the policy of diplomatically isolating Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "While Ukraine accepted a U.S. ceasefire proposal, Russia has not. It is not clear whether President Trump has set any deadline for conclusion of the diplomacy, but he's continuing to have special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff at the fore of outreach to Russia.",
      "At NATO meeting last week, Rubio indicated U.S. patience with Russia was wearing thin.",
      "\"We will know soon enough, in a matter of weeks, not months, whether Russia is serious about peace or not. I hope they are,\" Rubio said on April 4.",
      "Mr. Trump's longtime fascination with Putin and frustration with Ukraine's Zelenskyy has complicated the diplomacy, and prompted concern from Western allies.",
      "His distrust of Zelenskyy was visible in an explosive Oval Office confrontation in February. Mr. Trump told Zelenskyy to reach a ceasefire agreement with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vice President JD Vance accused the Ukrainian president of being \"disrespectful\" after he challenged the vice president's assertion that the war had dragged on because of a lack of diplomacy from Ukraine and the Biden administration. Vice President JD Vance also admonished Zelensky: \"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting?\"",
      "The Trump administration subsequently paused military and intelligence aid to Ukraine amid the fallout. That intelligence support resumed once Ukraine agreed to go along with the Trump administration's outreach to Putin. Mr. Trump continues to sit on the nearly $4 billion in remaining U.S. military aid already designated for Ukraine. The U.S. has been a key supplier of weapons since the Russian invasion began.",

Based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and a win-win cooperation, we will properly resolve differences through dialogue and consultation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced a pause on the planned implementation of higher tariffs for almost all nations late Wednesday, leaving a 10% universal tariff in place, but said he was raising tariffs on China from 104% to 125%. The heightened levies took effect Thursday, at the same time as Beijing's retaliatory tariffs of 84% took effect on U.S. imports to China.",
      "\"I have reiterated China's position many times, and it is very clear. We do not provoke trouble, nor do we fear trouble. The legitimate development rights of the Chinese people and the people of the world cannot be taken away. China's and like all other countries' sovereignty, security, and development interests should not be infringed upon,\" He said.",
      "China's foreign ministry took a harsher stance, and vowed to fight on.",
      "\"The U.S.'s reckless and unjust actions go against the will of the people and are doomed to fail in the end,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said. \"I want to reiterate that in a tariff war or trade war, there are no winners. China does not want a trade war, but we are not afraid of one. We will never stand by and watch the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people be undermined, nor will we allow international trade rules and the multilateral trading system to be trampled upon. If the United States insists on waging a tariff war or trade war, China will fight to the end.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he believed he could come to a resolution with China.",
      "\"China wants to make a deal,\" the president said at the White House. \"They just don't know how quite to go about it.\"",
      "EU announces its own 90-day pause on any retaliatory tariffs",
      "In other parts of the world, as markets rallied in response to Mr. Trump's tariff rollback after days of steep losses, leaders and economists continued to express concern about economic uncertainty, but there was also more potentially positive news for stock traders.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a social media post that the 27-nation bloc would put its own plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports on hold for 90 days, matching Mr. Trump's latest move.",
      "\"We want to give negotiations a chance,\" Von der Leyen said. \"While finalizing the adoption of the EU countermeasures that saw strong support from our Member States, we will put them on hold for 90 days.\"",

      "The pardon and repatriation came amid efforts by Congolese authorities to sign a minerals deal with the U.S. in exchange for security support that will help Kinshasa fight rebels in the country's conflict-hit east.",
      "The release of the U.S. citizens comes a week after the Department of State announced it appointed Massad Boulos\u00a0as senior adviser for Africa.

      "Dozens of others were convicted after the coup attempt, a majority of them Congolese but also including a Briton, a Belgian and a Canadian. Charges included terrorism, murder, criminal association and illegal possession of weapons.",

      "\"The remains of three children not older than 4 years were found on three sides of the altar,\" Paiz told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Teotihuacan were traders who traveled all over the country (Guatemala),\" Paiz said. \"The Teotihuacan residential complexes were houses with rooms and in the center altars; that's what the residence that was found is like, with an altar with the figure representing the Storm Goddess.\"",

      "Rom\u00e1n said the discovery also reinforces the idea that Tikal was a cosmopolitan center at that time, a place where people visited from other cultures, affirming its importance as a center of cultural convergence.",
      "Mar\u00eda Bel\u00e9n M\u00e9ndez, an archaeologist who was not involved with the project, said the discovery confirms \"that there has been an interconnection between both cultures and what their relationships with their gods and celestial bodies was like.\"",

      "French wines, as an example, will be subject to 20% tariffs under the measures announced by Mr. Trump.

      "Broadbent, whose company imports wines from 11 different countries and it also works with wineries in California, said more than 80% of his business will now face new tariffs. Wines from South Africa will be the most heavily impacted, he said, as the White House has hit the country with a steep 30% tariff.",
      "\"I don't see a single person who can benefit from this,\" Broadbent said. \"Even the wineries in America will suffer badly because they're all buying barrels and corks from Europe.\"",

As a child, you\u2019re still developing your ego and sense of self. And so sometimes that \u2018coming second\u2019 thing becomes too much a part of who the child is.

I remember just dreading those days. But I didn\u2019t have anything horrible happen to me really.

So to be able to escape and do this thing where I was totally safe when I was getting validation from adults, and it was based on a skill that I had that was special, I think really, really saved me.\"",

Innovation isn't a democracy \u2014 it\u2019s a process of exploration.\"",
      "\"What truly matters is the outcome,\" Chew explained. \"If a reimagined classic resonates, its value will speak for itself. Dismissing it without seeing the result is less about merit and more about discomfort with change. A classic doesn\u2019t stop being a classic because it\u2019s expressed in a new way. In fact, the heart of a classic is its ability to endure, evolve, and inspire across generations. Some may say reimagining beloved films with AI is gimmicky or disrespectful. My take? Don\u2019t engage with the remake if it\u2019s not your thing \u2014 but let others explore and create. The only real line we shouldn\u2019t cross is legal or ethical: copyright, attribution and transparency.\"",

      "Siegel added that it rarely affects humans \"because only some of the rodents have it, and they don't all come into contact \u2014 but one-third to one-half of cases are fatal.\"",
      "Symptoms and treatment",
      "Early symptoms of hantavirus include fever, muscle aches, fatigue and\u00a0gastrointestinal issues that appear anywhere from one to eight weeks after exposure, according to Parry.",
      "\"These progress to serious respiratory symptoms like coughing, shortness of breath and fluid in the lungs four to 10 days later,\" he said.",

      "\"If a patient is experiencing full distress, it is less likely the treatment will be effective.\"",

      "When people clear their throats, it actually slams the vocal folds together, which over time can cause lesions, nodules, bruising and hemorrhages that affect the voice, according to Husain, who works at Powers Health in Munster, Indiana.",

      "While LPM is not life-threatening, the main concern is its impact on quality of life, according to Husain.",

      "Over time, people who clear their throat often may find themselves doing it even more because of muscle memory. (iStock)",

      "\"I've actually seen throat-clearing irritation get worse when people start allergy pills or antihistamines without actually having an allergy,\" she cautioned.",

      "At just 13, Clara began experiencing uncontrollable seizures that baffled doctors. Initially misdiagnosed with anxiety and gallbladder issues, she even underwent unnecessary surgery before doctors finally identified the real culprit: epilepsy. But this wasn\u2019t just any epilepsy; Clara had multifocal epilepsy, a rare and severe form that resists all medication.",
      "\"Every night I would have seizures, up to 10, and it was just miserable,\" Clara said, recalling the years lost to her condition.",

The device, known as the\u00a0NeuroOne OneRF Ablation System, is the first of its kind FDA-cleared technology designed for both diagnosing and treating neurological disorders in one procedure.",
      "\"It took them maybe 30 minutes, and the longest part was setting up,\" Clara said about the procedure that transformed her life.",
      "Dr. Brin Freund, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, explained Clara\u2019s case in more detail:",
      "\"Clara has had a history of seizures that, unfortunately, were uncontrolled with medications. In these cases, surgery may be the only option to reduce and potentially cure the seizure disorder. After a thorough diagnostic evaluation, our group at Mayo Clinic Florida recommended implantation of electrodes (stereoelectroencephalography, or stereo EEG) in the brain to determine where her seizures were originating, in order to develop a surgical plan to treat them.",
      "\"Clara and her family were very much in agreement with this plan, given how debilitating her seizures had been and the failure to control her seizures with medications. Clara underwent implantation of NeuroOne electrodes in order to record seizure activity to determine where her seizures were arising from and then to potentially treat them by performing radiofrequency ablation in these areas.\"",

      "HOW ELON MUSK\u2019S NEURALINK BRAIN CHIP WORKS",
      "How NeuroOne\u2019s dual-function system works",
      "The NeuroOne system uses ultra-thin electrodes to pinpoint the exact source of seizures in the brain. Once identified, it employs radiofrequency energy to disrupt abnormal electrical signals in problematic brain tissue without permanently damaging surrounding areas. This dual functionality, diagnostic and therapeutic, is what sets it apart from traditional methods that require two separate surgeries.",
      "NeuroOne CEO Dave Rosa explained:",
      "\"What separates our technology from others is that our device can be used for both the diagnostic part \u2013 finding the area of the brain \u2013 and then ablating or destroying that tissue, all in the same hospitalization.\"",
      "He added that this approach minimizes patient risk by reducing the number of procedures and hospitalizations required.",
      "Freund emphasized this advantage:",
      "\"Stereo EEG electrodes provide the ability to localize seizure onset with excellent precision as long as the electrode implantation is planned thoroughly and accurately. With regards to the NeuroOne electrodes, they allow for radiofrequency ablation to be performed while the electrodes are still implanted without having to remove them. We can therefore not only localize the seizure onset but provide a surgical treatment and potentially avoid a second and potentially more extensive or invasive procedure such as a craniotomy and resection of brain tissue.",
      "\"The NeuroOne electrodes allow us to control the conditions of the ablative procedure. They also provide us more confidence that the electrodes will withstand the duration of the implantation, which would include recording seizure data, performing the ablation and then recording more data after the ablation to ensure that the treatment achieved the intended goal.\"",
      "Brain implant patient Clara Fuller (NeuroOne)",
      "THIS MIND-READING TECH USING AI CAN CONVERT BRAIN ACTIVITY INTO TEXT",
      "The results",
      "The results have been nothing short of life-changing for Clara. Since undergoing the procedure, she has been completely seizure-free. She\u2019s now back to enjoying school, sports and uninterrupted sleep \u2013 things most people take for granted but were once unimaginable for her.",
      "According to Freund:",
      "\"Regarding the implantation itself, she did very well and there were no adverse effects. The first ablation did not cause any acute complications. We then performed a second ablation a few days later after data was recorded from the electrodes demonstrating ongoing seizure activity to ensure that her seizures would not recur. This was also well-tolerated without complications. We have now followed up months after the electrodes were removed and there have been no signs of ill effects due to the implantation or the ablations. She has been seizure-free since the ablation and has done amazingly well.\"",
      "Clara\u2019s story offers hope for others living with drug-resistant epilepsy, which affects about one-third of the 3 million Americans with epilepsy. According to Rosa, \"The desire to expand ablation therapy to patients suffering from seizures that do not respond to drug therapy was our driving force.\"",
      "NeuroOne One RF Ablation System (NeuroOne)",
      "A broader impact on medicine",
      "NeuroOne\u2019s innovative technology isn\u2019t just limited to epilepsy treatment. The company plans to expand its applications to other areas, such as pain management for facial pain and lower back pain, using the same RF ablation technology. Rosa also sees potential for treating neurological conditions beyond epilepsy:\u00a0\"Pain management appears to be the largest opportunity outside of brain ablation.\"",
      "Dr. Freund believes this technology could dramatically improve long-term care for pediatric epilepsy patients like Clara:",
      "\"This technology could allow for limiting the number of procedures that are required to treat drug-resistant focal epilepsy and also provide immediate feedback as to whether or not a surgical treatment was effective. This could potentially reduce the risk of adverse events by limiting the number of times that a brain surgery would be needed. This technology also allows us to access deeper parts of the brain to provide surgical treatment.\"",
      "He added that the impact may soon be widespread:",
      "\"In our practice, we are now using these electrodes in every case that requires Stereo EEG for treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. I think as these types of electrodes are used at more centers and they get more experience, there would be no reason not to use them.\"",

      "How it happens",
      "Even if a new credit card hasn\u2019t arrived yet, it may already be vulnerable. In many cases, the issue isn\u2019t about the card being physically stolen but about someone gaining access to your information digitally. Criminals can exploit online account features, mobile wallets or leaked personal data to start using your card before you\u2019ve even opened the envelope. Below are some of the most common ways this type of fraud happens.",
      "If a scammer already has access to your account, either through stolen login credentials, a hacked email or\u00a0malware, they can view the newly issued card number in the online dashboard or mobile app. Many credit card companies now allow instant access to digital card numbers for use in Apple Pay, Google Wallet or online purchases. This means that as soon as a new card is issued, it may be visible digitally before the physical card is even shipped. If a fraudster has access to your account, they can add the number to a digital wallet and begin spending before the envelope ever hits your mailbox.",
      "Some card issuers allow you to add your credit card to mobile wallets instantly, even before the physical card arrives. While this feature is convenient, it can also expose you to specific security risks tied to mobile wallet activation. Criminals may exploit this process by using stolen personal information to bypass security checks and add your card to their own Apple Pay or Google Wallet accounts. They might pose as you to request a new card, intercept or reroute the digital activation process, or even start making fraudulent purchases immediately. This type of fraud can be hard to detect, especially if you're not expecting a new card or if unauthorized charges blend in with legitimate transactions.",

      "THIS IS HOW TO PROTECT YOUR CREDIT AND BANK CARDS FROM GETTING HACKED",
      "Another common scenario involves your personal information being compromised in a\u00a0phishing attack or large-scale\u00a0data breach. Thieves use this stolen data, such as your name, Social Security number, address and security question answers, to impersonate you and gain access to your account dashboard or reset login credentials. Once inside, they can retrieve new card details directly from the source or request a replacement card. Phishing scams often trick victims into revealing sensitive information through fake emails or websites, while data breaches expose vast amounts of personal data that criminals can exploit for fraudulent activities.",
      "Although charges made before a new credit card is received are rarely due to mail theft, this type of traditional fraud still poses a risk. Criminals may intercept your mail to steal sensitive documents, including credit cards, which can then be used for unauthorized purchases. To reduce this risk, avoid leaving important mail unattended in your mailbox. Consider using\u00a0Informed Delivery by USPS to track incoming mail or request that your credit card be delivered to a secure location, such as a P.O. box or directly to your bank branch.",

      "5. Invest in personal data removal services: Consider using a personal data removal service to reduce your online exposure. These services continuously monitor and remove your sensitive information from data brokers and websites that could be exploited by criminals.

While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6. Ask your credit card company to investigate:\u00a0Contact your credit card provider directly and request a full investigation. Ask if there was any suspicious account activity, such as a login from a new device, before the fraudulent charges occurred. They may be able to trace when and how your account was accessed. Most card issuers will reverse fraudulent charges and can reissue a new card with a different number.",
      "7. Notify law enforcement:\u00a0File a report with the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission. If necessary, a police report should also be filed to document the fraud. This can be helpful for disputing charges and clearing your record.",

      "X app on an iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "The X data leak is believed to stem from a combination of breaches, including a massive one that allegedly occurred in January 2025 and another in 2023. The leaked dataset, reportedly a 34 GB CSV file, contains 201,186,753 entries with information such as X screen names, user IDs, full names, locations, email addresses (from the 2023 breach), follower counts, profile data, time zones and profile images.",
      "ThinkingOne claimed that the data was cross-referenced from a larger breach involving 2.8 billion unique Twitter IDs and screen names. This breach may have been linked to an insider job during layoffs at X, although the company has not verified this claim. Cybersecurity researchers, including those from\u00a0Safety Detectives, partially confirmed the authenticity of the data by matching a sample with public X profiles and verifying some email addresses. However, they were not able to fully confirm ownership.",
      "The breach appears to trace back to a vulnerability identified in January 2022 through Twitter\u2019s bug bounty program. This flaw allowed attackers to access user data using only an email address or phone number. Although the vulnerability was patched, the compromised data seems to have resurfaced in later leaks.",

      "The 2025 incident alone does not include passwords or financial information, but when combined with the email addresses from the 2023 leak, it significantly increases the risk of phishing and social engineering attacks. X has not officially acknowledged this specific breach at the time of writing, although it previously downplayed the 2023 incident by claiming it involved mostly public data.",
      "The total of 2.8 billion records far exceeds X\u2019s estimated 335 to 600 million active users, suggesting that the dataset may include inactive accounts, bots or historical data.

      "If you have an account on X or think your data may have been part of the breach, here are seven important steps you can take to protect yourself.",
      "1) Use strong antivirus software",
      "This breach included email addresses linked to X accounts, prime fuel for phishing attacks. Hackers may now send emails that look like they\u2019re from X, Musk or support, asking you to \"verify your account\" or \"reset your password.\" These often contain links or attachments that can install malware or steal personal data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Remove your personal data from the internet",
      "Since this X leak exposed full names, email addresses and other public-facing profile details, hackers can easily cross-reference it with other data broker sites to build a full profile on you. This could lead to impersonation or spear-phishing.",
      "To reduce your exposure, use a trusted data removal service that scans data broker websites and requests the deletion of your personal information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Change your X account password",
      "Even though this particular breach may not have included passwords, there\u2019s still a significant risk, especially if you use the same password across multiple platforms. Once attackers have your email, they often try using it with common or previously leaked passwords to break into accounts.",
      "To change your X account password, go to Settings and privacy from your profile menu, then select\u00a0Your account and tap on\u00a0Change your password. Enter your current password, set a new strong password and confirm the change. You can do this via the mobile app or by logging in through the web. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4) Make your X profile more private to reduce future risk",
      "Adjust your X account's privacy settings to limit the visibility of personal information, such as making your profile private. Ensure that only necessary information is publicly visible. Information that seems harmless, like your location, job title or birthday, can be used by cybercriminals to impersonate you or guess your login credentials. If your X profile includes any personal details that aren\u2019t necessary, now is the time to remove them.",
      "Keeping your profile minimal not only protects your privacy but also makes it harder for scammers to craft convincing phishing messages or social engineering attacks. Think twice before posting personal updates or details publicly, especially if they can be used to guess passwords or verify your identity.",
      "Go to\u00a0Settings > Privacy and safety and lock down your account visibility.",
      "5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your X and email accounts",
      "If hackers got your email from the X breach, they may try to reset your password.\u00a02FA helps stop this by requiring a second code to log in:",
      "Use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy, not SMS, which can be interceptedSecure your email accounts, too, since they can be used to reset your X credentials",
      "Use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy, not SMS, which can be intercepted",
      "Secure your email accounts, too, since they can be used to reset your X credentials",
      "6) Use a VPN on public Wi-Fi",
      "Protect your data when accessing X or other platforms on public networks by using a VPN to encrypt your connection. This will help safeguard your information from being intercepted by malicious actors. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7) Sign up for identity theft protection to catch if your X-linked info is abused",
      "With 200-plus million names and email addresses exposed, scammers may try opening accounts in your name or use your email in fraud attempts. Good identity protection can alert you if your info is being sold on the dark web. It can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my\u00a0tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "NEW PHISHING SCAM OUTSMARTS SECURITY CODES TO STEAL YOUR INFO",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The X breach is yet another reminder that patching a vulnerability is only one piece of a much larger puzzle. The persistence of leaked data \u2013 years after the original flaw was disclosed and fixed \u2013 highlights the long tail of exposure that comes with large-scale breaches. Even when credentials aren\u2019t involved, the combination of identifiers like email addresses, names and social connections can be weaponized through correlation attacks, data enrichment and AI-assisted social engineering.",

      "Chatbots like ChatGPT are undeniably powerful tools that enhance productivity and creativity. However, their ability to store and process user data demands caution. By understanding what not to share and taking steps to protect your privacy, you can enjoy the benefits of AI while minimizing risks. Ultimately, it\u2019s up to you to strike a balance between leveraging AI\u2019s capabilities and safeguarding your personal information. Remember: Just because a chatbot feels human doesn\u2019t mean it should be treated like one. Be mindful of what you share and always prioritize your privacy.",

      "What makes doubleclickjacking especially dangerous is that most websites weren\u2019t designed to defend against it. Traditional security features usually protect against a single click, but they often fail when a second click is involved. That small detail opens the door for attackers to bypass layers of protection.",
      "This trick doesn\u2019t just affect websites, either. It can also interfere with browser extensions like crypto wallets and VPNs, sometimes tricking users into approving actions or turning off protection without realizing it. On mobile devices, a simple double-tap can trigger the same effect. To make matters worse, this vulnerability is more widespread than you might expect. Many well-known websites haven\u2019t fixed it yet. All it takes is one quick double-click in the wrong place, and you could unknowingly give away access to sensitive parts of your device.",

      "How does doubleclickjacking work?",
      "Here\u2019s a simplified version of how the trick plays out. A malicious website quietly loads invisible elements behind or over visible ones, like an embedded frame, hidden button, or disguised pop-up. On your first click, the attacker uses that action to reposition those hidden elements so that your next click lands exactly where they want it. On your second click, you unknowingly interact with the hidden content. You might be clicking \"Allow\" on a browser permission, authorizing a login, or disabling a setting, without ever realizing it. Because modern browsers are lightning fast, this all happens in a split second. The entire setup and switch are virtually invisible to the user. From your perspective, it just feels like a normal double-click.",

      "How to protect yourself",
      "Doubleclickjacking might be sneaky, but there are simple ways to keep yourself safer online. Here are some practical steps you can take right now:",
      "1. Be cautious about double-clicking on unfamiliar websites: It might sound obvious, but most of us click (and double-click) automatically. If a site prompts you to double-click anything, especially for a login, permission or download, ask yourself if it\u2019s really necessary. Hackers rely on you acting quickly without thinking.",
      "2. Keep your browser updated: Browsers like Chrome, Edge and Safari regularly release patches for these vulnerabilities. That means delaying updates could leave you exposed to tricks like doubleclickjacking. Turn on automatic updates if possible, or make sure to manually keep up with updates so you\u2019re always protected.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Browser-based tools and extensions can help block hidden or malicious scripts before they run, but they\u2019re not foolproof. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords for every account:\u00a0Don\u2019t reuse passwords. If one account gets compromised, hackers can use it to access your other accounts. A password manager helps you create and store strong passwords effortlessly. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Limit unnecessary permissions: Take control of your privacy by reviewing which websites have access to your camera, microphone, and location. Many sites request these permissions by default, even when they don\u2019t need them. Head into your browser\u2019s privacy settings and revoke access from any site you don\u2019t fully trust. For example, here's a guide on\u00a0how to navigate Google's privacy settings.",
      "6. Avoid sketchy sites and pop-ups: If a website looks outdated, spammy or aggressively pushes you to click something, get out of there. Avoid downloading random files, and don\u2019t trust pop-ups that claim you\u2019ve won something, need to \"fix\" your device or \"verify\" your login info.",
      "WINDOWS DEFENDER SECURITY CENTER SCAM: HOW TO PROTECT YOUR COMPUTER FROM FAKE POP-UPS",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Doubleclickjacking is a clever new spin on a classic hacking trick that allows cybercriminals to take control over your device or account, just from a simple double-click. Because this kind of attack is nearly invisible and works on popular browsers, it\u2019s important to stay alert. Always be cautious when interacting with unfamiliar websites, especially if you're being asked to double-click. Keeping your browser updated and limiting unnecessary permissions can go a long way in reducing your risk. Most importantly, having the right digital protection tools in place can help stop these types of threats before they ever reach you.",

It's ultimately up to this judge to make a decision on resentencing, irrespective of what Hochmon is requesting to be done.\"",
      "Two of the brothers' older relatives had already provided testimony at a November hearing as a precaution and the only relative against the brother's release, their uncle Milton Anderson, died last month at age 90.",
      "Subject to the court\u2019s ruling, a resentencing hearing is tentatively scheduled for April 17 and 18. If that goes forward, prosecutors are expecting the defense to call several Menendez family members who support resentencing.",
      "The hearing was postponed due to the impact of recent wildfires on the parties' extensive preparations.",
      "Claypool, who is based in Los Angeles County, believes that resentencing hearing is \"a political tug-of-war\" between Hochman and Gov. Gavin Newsom, more than anything else.",
      "\"The reason I say that is because Gavin Newsom has already requested weeks ago that the California Parole Board conduct what's called a risk assessment on the Menendez brothers. Why is that important? Because that portends that Newsom is likely to grant clemency if this judge doesn't grant resentencing. And in many respects, I believe that Newsom did that on purpose to put some implied pressure on this judge to grant resentencing,\" Claypool said.",
      "Hochman's office has said that despite the \"defense arguing that this decision is political, such an argument is devoid of merit.\"",
      "\"Though this pathway to resentencing has been offered to the Menendez brothers, they have chosen to stubbornly remain hunkered down in their over 30-year-old bunker of lies, deceit, and denials.\"",
      "\"The basis for this withdrawal request is that the prior DA\u2019s motion did not examine or consider whether the Menendez brothers have exhibited full insight and taken complete responsibility for their crimes by continuing for the past over 30 years to lie about their claims of self-defense, that is, their fear that their mother and father were going to kill them the night of Aug. 20, 1989, justifying the brutal murders of their parents with shotgun blasts through the back of their father\u2019s head, a point-blank blast through their mother\u2019s face, and shots to their kneecaps to stage it as a Mafia killing,\" Hochman said.",
      "\"As a full examination of the record reveals, the Menendez brothers have never come clean over the past three decades and admitted that they lied about their self-defense as well as suborned perjury and attempted to suborn perjury by their friends for the lies, among others, of their father violently raping Lyle\u2019s girlfriend, their mother poisoning the family, and their attempt to get a handgun the day before the murders.\"",

      "\"The facts and the law \u2014 not politics \u2014 are now what drives DA Hochman\u2019s request to withdraw that motion as laid out in detail in the over 85-page response filed on March 10, 2025. There is no political tug-of-war between the DA and the Governor. The DA has done his job involving a thorough and detailed review of the facts and the law, and the DA assumes the Governor will honor his similar obligations.\"",

      "\"Hochman has to come out and vigorously oppose this because that is his mantra. That is his campaign message, but I think deep down he knows that it's not about winning or losing right now, for Hochman, it's about where does he stand politically on this issue,\" Claypool shared.",

Trump.",
      "\"America has always been generous,\" Graham told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"President Trump is not against aid. He supports aid, but he does not support waste,\" Graham continued. \"And that\u2019s what\u2019s happened in some of these cases in the past\u2014our government has wasted too much money. But I think the president will be very generous.\"",
      "Graham also reflected on the president\u2019s personal trials. \"I believe God saved his life,\" he said, referencing the assassination attempt in Butler, Pa. \"And the president believes that\u2014he says that. So we need to pray for him. There are many people that would like to see harm come to him.

      "Samaritan\u2019s Purse has already begun surgical operations in Naypyidaw, the capital city of Burma, which lies between Yangon and Mandalay and is among the areas most severely impacted. The organization is operating out of a soccer stadium provided by the Burmese government, which has also granted full cooperation, including visa approvals and facility access.",
      "Graham reported that Samaritan\u2019s Purse initially deployed 60 beds and two operating theaters. The government contributed an additional 24 beds via medical container units, known as connexes, including one operating room. \"So it was 84 beds and three operating theaters,\" Graham explained. \"The rest of the hospital arrives tomorrow\u2026 we should be fully operational by the day after tomorrow.\"",

Nearly 100 earthquake victims were already waiting for surgery when the team arrived.",
      "Graham emphasized urgency: \"Speed is critical after a deadly earthquake like the one that rocked Myanmar,\" he said. \"We praise God that we are already able to provide surgery even while we are still building the full field hospital.\"",
      "One of the first patients treated was a woman who shielded her son during a building collapse. \"She covered her son\u2019s body with her body to protect him,\" Graham shared. \"She had problems with her spine.

It\u2019s going to take years for them to build back. If they can build back, I don\u2019t know.\"",
      "Samaritan\u2019s Purse sent more than 104 tons of critical supplies, including six water filtration systems, hygiene kits, emergency shelter material, and solar lights, aboard a 747-cargo plane from Greenville, South Carolina.

      "The organization\u2019s logistics capacity played a vital role. \"We keep all of this in stock,\" Graham said. \"We have warehouses here in North Carolina\u2026 So it\u2019s just a matter of loading the boxes on the plane and going.\" He noted that the hospital will need to be resupplied regularly: \"About every 10 days we\u2019ll have a plane leaving Greensboro for Myanmar.\"",
      "Temperatures in the region are exceeding 110\u00b0F with high humidity. The team lives in tents and works in austere conditions. \"We provide our own accommodations. We have our own water, we have our electricity, we\u2019re self-contained, but it\u2019s a tough assignment,\" Graham said.",
      "Still, the team remains committed. \"They\u2019re holding clinics during the day, operating during the night\u2026 But our team is motivated. They are excited for the opportunity to serve the people of Myanmar and to do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.\"",

      "A single veto is enough to block a resolution being enacted, and progress in the council has become stagnant following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "But even if Russia objects to reimposing sanctions on Iran, as Tehran has become a close ally of Moscow\u2019s, it actually has very few options for blocking the snapback mechanism that it previously agreed to, so long as at least one other nation actually calls for the sanction tool.",

      "A federal judge on Friday ruled that the Trump administration can deport Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil just a month after his arrest prompted national outrage and marked the start of the federal government\u2019s broader crackdown on foreign students.",
      "Khalil has until April 23 to file for relief.",
      "In his ruling, the judge said that \u201cthe court will sustain charge of removability.\u201d",
      "After the judge ruled, Khalil addressed the court, saying: \u201cNothing more important than due process and fundamental fairness. Neither of those principles were present today. This is exactly why the Trump admin sent me to this court 1,000 miles away from my family.\"",
      "\"I hope your urgency for this is to the thousands of people here in this facility,\" he added.",
      "Khalil, who helped lead student protests against the war in Gaza at the Ivy League school last year, was detained on March 8 by federal authorities at his university-owned apartment complex in New York City. He has since been in custody at a Louisiana immigration detention center.",
      "The Trump administration has maintained publicly that it has the authority to deport Khalil \u2014 a 30-year-old green card holder \u2014because he \"led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\"",
      "The administration also repeatedly cited a rarely invoked provision from a 1952 law \u2014 the\u00a0Immigration and Nationality Act\u00a0\u2014 which allows the secretary of state to deport noncitizens if their presence in the country threatens U.S. foreign policy.",
      "Lawyers for the government have also alleged that Khalil withheld information about his affiliation with certain organizations and failed to disclose in his permanent residency application that he was previously employed at the Syria Office in the British Embassy in Beirut.",
      "A federal judge pressed the administration to submit evidence supporting their claims and justification for Khalil's deportation by Wednesday.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio responded Wednesday evening with a brief memo obtained by NBC News that cites Khalil\u2019s beliefs in justifying his deportation.",
      "Rubio said that while Khalil\u2019s \"past, current or expected beliefs, statements, or associations that are otherwise lawful,\" the provision allows Rubio alone to \"personally determine\" whether Khalil should be allowed to stay in the country.",
      "Rubio \u2014 who is a child of Cuban immigrants \u2014 said last month that the State Department had revoked more than 300 student visas and would continue to do so.",
      "According to an NBC News analysis, as of Wednesday, officials had revoked the visas of foreign students\u2014many of whom are Arab\u2014in at least 29 states.",
      "Video of the March arrest of a Tufts University student, Rumeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, showed several plainclothes DHS agents surrounding her, grabbing her wrists, and moving her into an SUV while she screamed out in confusion. Her lawyers argue that she was targeted for writing an opinion piece in her school newspaper that criticized Tufts' response to the war in Gaza.",
      "An international student at the University of Florida was deported late last month after he was arrested and accused of traffic violations, his family and local officials said.",
      "DHS announced a new task force on Wednesday to monitor the social media activity of immigrants, including foreign students, for antisemitism. Three sources familiar with the operation\u00a0told NBC News that\u00a0officials will screen approximately 1.5 million international students for potential grounds to revoke their visas.",
      "Khalil's arrest prompted a handful of protests at Columbia, the epicenter of last year's demonstrations, and around New York City, including at Trump Tower.",
      "Columbia students who spoke with NBC News since Khalil's arrest said that speaking out had become \"too dangerous\" at the university once known as a venue for challenging authority.",
      "A university spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment regarding the order over Khalil's deportation.",
      "The sweeping measures against international students are one of several ways the Trump administration has used the federal government's powers to exert leverage on academic institutions.",
      "The administration has also revoked hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to several universities in recent weeks \u2014 including Columbia, Harvard and Princeton \u2014 citing dissatisfaction with how they handled last year\u2019s protests against the war in Gaza."

      "An attorney representing the Ocean County Library Commission said the JBJ pop-up has a lease that goes to May 23. But the lawyer didn't immediately address the mayor's assertion that unhoused people coming to that location are taxing town resources.",
      "\"They're (patrons at the pop-up) not from Toms River and Toms River should not have to bear the brunt of homelessness for the entire county of Ocean, especially when not a single one of these folks are from Toms River,\" Rodrick said.",

Starting when Piper was 11, her account featured videos of her and her posse of tween sidekicks pulling pranks, performing skits and doing goofy viral challenges for millions of followers.",
      "However, for all their upbeat smiles on camera, Piper and her friends were experiencing a much darker reality behind the scenes, including alleged \u201cverbal, physical and, at times, sexual abuse\u201d at the hands of Piper\u2019s mother and producer, Tiffany Smith, a lawsuit filed in January 2022 by 11 former \u201cSquad\u201d members says.",

      "Read on to learn more about teen influencer Piper Rockelle, why her mom was sued for $22 million, and where they both are now.",
      "Who is Piper Rockelle?",
      "Piper Rockelle, 17, is an influencer with more than 30 million followers across YouTube, TikTok and Instagram.",
      "She rose to viral fame at age 8 when she began posting videos on YouTube with help from her mom and \u201cmomager,\u201d Tiffany Smith.",
      "When Piper was 11, Smith began recruiting other kids to appear in her daughter\u2019s videos, and the group of tweens and teens became known as \u201cPiper\u2019s Squad.\u201d",
      "Over the next few years, the Squad churned out hundreds of videos of themselves pulling pranks on each other, dancing to lip sync videos, completing viral challenges, and confessing to their crushes.",
      "The channel was incredibly lucrative for Smith and her daughter. At one point, Piper was earning more than half a million dollars per month for her video content, according to\u00a0The Los Angeles Times.",
      "Other members of the Squad routinely earned five figures per month via their own YouTube channels thanks to their association with Piper, according to a 2022 court document.",
      "While Piper\u2019s channel was presented as a harmless collection of videos about a group of tweens\u2019 silly pranks and adventures, it reportedly had a darker side.",
      "As the years went on, former Squad members began speaking out about physical, sexual and emotional abuse they had allegedly suffered at the hands of Smith. Accusations of exploitation and labor violations also arose.",
      "A group of former Squad members sued Smith and her business partner, Hunter Hill, in January 2022. Piper was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit.",
      "Why was Piper Rockelle\u2019s mom sued?",
      "In 2022, 11 former members of Piper\u2019s \u201cSquad\u201d sued\u00a0Rockelle\u2019s mother, Tiffany Smith, seeking damages of at least $2 million each, or $22 million total.",
      "Hill was also named as a defendant, along with Piper\u00a0Rockelle\u00a0Inc., the holding company for the family\u2019s content creation business.",
      "Hill, 28, portrayed a big brother-like figure to Piper on screen, but off camera he reportedly had a romantic relationship with Piper\u2019s mom and was \u201cthe primary director, editor and cinematographer\u201d of Piper\u2019s YouTube videos, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The complaint sought damages for sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, among several other alleged violations.",
      "The plaintiffs, all of whom were minors when the lawsuit was filed, accused Smith of \u201cgrossly inappropriate, offensive and abusive treatment.\u201d They claimed Smith made vulgar comments about their bodies, and at times touched them inappropriately.",
      "According to the complaint, Smith encouraged minors in the Squad to behave sexually with each other and to act proactively in videos and photos, such as urging them to make \u201csexy kissing faces\u201d or to \u201cwear something sluttier\u201d because \u201csex sells.\u201d",
      "According to the complaint, Smith and Hill would \u201csabotage\u201d children who left the Squad, targeting their individual YouTube channels.",
      "Smith and Hill allegedly engaged in a variety of tactics to \u201ctank\u201d former Squad members\u2019 online platforms, such as flooding them with bot subscribers, which can negatively affect how videos are promoted on YouTube, and falsely flagging their channels as \u201cinappropriate\u201d to get their content restricted.",
      "These alleged tactics led to a \u201csignificant loss\u201d in subscribers and viewerships for the plaintiffs, which translated to a loss of income, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Smith denied the allegations against her. In July 2023, she countersued for $30 million, accusing the plaintiffs\u2019 mothers of attempting to extort her by making false allegations of sexual abuse, according to\u00a0NBC News. She later voluntarily abandoned the lawsuit.",
      "In a December 2022 interview with The Los Angeles Times, Smith questioned the motives of the plaintiffs bringing the lawsuit against her.",
      "\u201cThis whole case is based on lies that are driven by financial jealousy,\u201d she said. \u201cFinancial jealousy of a 15-year-old girl.\u201d",
      "Smith has also denied allegations that she violated California labor laws in the filming of the Squad videos. Several parents of former Squad members have said their children filmed up to 12 hours per day and did not receive proper education on set, according to the Times.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Hill for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "\u201cImagine if these kids had been on a movie set for Lionsgate,\u201d Matthew Sarelson, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, told the Times in 2022. \u201cPeople would go to jail if this had happened at a studio.\u201d",
      "Smith has denied that she was running a professional production studio and said it was parents\u2019 responsibility to manage their kids\u2019 schooling.",
      "The Squad members\u2019 lawsuit was settled in October 2024 for $1.85 million, according to\u00a0NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis was never about the money \u2014 it was about holding an individual accountable, telling the truth, and taking a step toward healing,\u201d Angela Sharbino, the parent of one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement, according to NBC News. \u201cAll of these kids have now moved on from the \u2018Squad\u2019 and are closing this chapter of their lives.\u201d",
      "Where are Piper Rockelle and Tiffany Smith now?",
      "Piper continues to share content on social media.",
      "After the 2022 lawsuit was filed, YouTube demonetized Piper\u2019s channel, meaning she could no longer earn revenue from her videos. She still posts occasional YouTube videos, such as a 10-minute vlog entitled\u00a0\u201cWeek in my Life as a Full Time Influencer\u201d\u00a0in November 2024.",
      "\u201cObviously I film vlogs like this, but I don\u2019t really get a lot out of it besides the satisfaction of knowing you guys enjoy watching them, and I get a lot of fun memories that I can go back and watch, which I think is cool,\u201d she says in the video.",
      "The teen adds that she now does other types of work to \u201cyou know, keep the house over my head,\u201d such as brand deals and paid TikTok videos.",
      "Smith and Hill still appear to oversee the creation of Piper\u2019s videos. In her 2024 \u201cWeek in the Life\u201d video, a narrator who appears to be Hill says Smith \u201ccompletely rearranged and decorated\u201d a room in their house so Piper could film TikTok videos at all hours.",
      "One scene from the 2024 vlog shows Piper decorating a Christmas tree at 11:30 p.m. as part of a paid brand deal.",
      "The narrator, who appears to be Hill, says in the video that after they are done filming the Christmas tree scene, they still have to shoot something for her vlog that is going out \u201cin a couple hours.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have to finish editing it and we don\u2019t have a thumbnail for it,\u201d he says. \u201cSo there are so many stresses, you guys have no idea what this is like.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut it\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Piper chimes in.",
      "Piper has more than 14 million fans on TikTok, where she posts frequent videos featuring her hanging out with her boyfriend, lip syncing to viral songs, and sometimes posing in bikinis and other revealing outfits.",
      "She also has an account on BrandArmy, a platform that allows creators as young as 13 to share paid photos and videos of themselves, with parental oversight. The site is\u00a0only open\u00a0to subscribers over the age of 18.",
      "In her 2024 vlog, Piper says she is \u201cgrateful\u201d for the opportunity to create content, but also shares a candid look at her life and responsibilities.",
      "\u201cI have no room to complain about my life because things could be a lot worse. But what I do have to say is, it is hard work on my end. I\u2019ve never had, like, a normal job, but whatever I\u2019m doing right now, it feels like a job. It takes a lot out of me. I go to bed at night and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my God, what did I do today?\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cAnd on top of everything, all I want to do most of the time is just go work out because it makes me so happy,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, the one moment in my life when everything is quiet and I don\u2019t have to think about anything or please anybody.\u201d"

      "R\u00f3ger de la Rosa, who flew from the United States after finding out on Wednesday that his sister, Rosie de la Rosa Ortega, was one of the fatal victims, was desperately demanding answers from forensic officials on Friday morning. He questioned the need for the autopsies.",
      "\u201cNo one has faced me,\u201d de la Rosa said in Spanish. \u201cNo one has the courage to look me in the eyes.\u201d",
      "Others like Ana Julia Mej\u00eda, who was waiting to receive her mother\u2019s remains, had the same question.",
      "\"We don't want an autopsy because we know what they died of. We just want them to give them to us, so we can hold a wake,\" Mej\u00eda told Noticias Telemundo.",
      "Public Health Minister Victor Atallah updated the death toll from 221 to 225 when speaking to Noticias Telemundo early Friday afternoon.",
      "Government officials have said the autopsies help determine if the person died instantly, as a result of their injuries or by asphyxia due to the debris. Also, they said, the autopsies will likely serve as \"important evidence\" in the ongoing investigation into what caused the collapse.",
      "As of late Thursday night, forensic officials had completed 130 autopsies, according to the national attorney general\u2019s office.",
      "Antoliano Peralta, a legal consultant to the Dominican Republic\u2019s executive branch, admitted in an interview with Noticias Telemundo that the tragedy's death toll was so big it \"exceeds the forensic institute's capacity.\"",
      "The smell of the corpses inside the morgue could even be felt outside the building, reaching the families who were outside waiting for answers, Noticias Telemundo reported.",
      "No nation in the world is equipped to conduct hundreds of autopsies in one day, according to Atallah, the public health minister. Still, authorities assured they're doing everything they can to speed up the process.",
      "The attorney general\u2019s office said in a statement the government has \"strengthened our forensic medical team with the goal of completing all autopsies\" by Friday.",
      "Of the autopsies conducted as of Friday morning, over 80% of the victims died of head trauma caused by the impact of the crumbling ceiling, Atallah said. \"That means that they either died instantly or very quickly.\"",
      "\u2018I was trapped in the rubble\u2019",
      "In addition to the hundreds of bodies, rescue crews recovered 189 survivors from the rubble. Cristobal Moya was among those who survived.",
      "Speaking to NBC News from his hospital bed Thursday afternoon, Moya said he survived \"thanks to God.\"",
      "He recalled sitting down to watch renowned merengue singer Rubby P\u00e9rez perform on stage when what appeared to be heavy dust began to fall from above.",
      "\"In a minute, the roof caved in. Something hit my head. I lost consciousness,\" Moya said in Spanish. \"When I woke up, I was trapped in the rubble.\" He thought for a second, \"Was I dreaming? No, I wasn\u2019t.\"",
      "Video from the people who rescued Moya shows him laying face down, his head covered in blood and his body buried in the debris. Moya sustained injuries in his head, torso and legs.",
      "\"God gave me an opportunity,\" Moya said. \"A new opportunity at life.\"",
      "Videos from inside the Jet Set nightclub minutes before disaster struck show what is now P\u00e9rez's last concert. Before the roof collapse killed him, P\u00e9rez was entertaining the crowd with his powerful voice and energetic dance moves.",
      "The videos were filmed by Isaac Gonz\u00e1lez, the nightclub\u2019s official photographer. He was there to capture what was supposed to be a celebratory event starring one of the biggest music stars of the Dominican Republic. But instead, he ended the night documenting one of the country\u2019s deadliest events.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said the roof collapsed when he stepped outside the venue for five minutes to take a break. He was one of the first to film the club's devastation and the emergency response. His videos also show first responders arriving at the scene, later placing body bag after body bag into ambulances.",
      "Funeral services and burials\u00a0for all the victims continue to take place this week.",
      "Among the people who died are Nelsy Cruz, the governor of Montecristi province,\u00a0former MLB players Octavio Dotel\u00a0and\u00a0Tony Cabrera,\u00a0Dominican fashion designer Mart\u00edn Polanco\u00a0and employees of Grupo Popular \u2014 one of the country\u2019s largest banking companies \u2014 and the nation's Medical Colonel Dr. Jos\u00e9 Ovidio Maldonado Reyes.",

      "The judge also repeatedly asked Ensign about what has been done to facilitate Abrego Garcia\u2019s return, asking pointedly: \u201cHave they done anything?\u201d \u2014 to which Ensign said he didn\u2019t have personal knowledge of what had been done.",
      "\u201cSo that means they\u2019ve done nothing,\u201d the judge said, adding later: \u201cDespite this court\u2019s clear directive, your clients have done nothing to facilitate the return of Mr. Abrego Garcia.\u201d",
      "Attorneys for the Trump administration had told Xinis in a Friday morning filing that her Friday morning deadline for information was \u201cimpractical.\u201d They said they haven\u2019t had enough time to review the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling.",
      "Xinis had directed the Trump administration to \u201ctake all available steps to facilitate the return\u201d of Abrego Garcia following Thursday\u2019s high court order.",
      "She requested a declaration from the administration that addressed Abrego Garcia\u2019s location and custodial status and what steps the administration has taken and will take to facilitate his return.",
      "The U.S. attorneys also wrote in Friday morning\u2019s filing that it was \u201cunreasonable\u201d for the U.S. government \u201cto reveal potential steps before those steps are reviewed, agreed upon, and vetted.\u201d",
      "\u201cForeign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines, in part because it involves sensitive country-specific considerations wholly inappropriate for judicial review,\u201d the attorneys wrote.",
      "In its ruling on Thursday, the Supreme Court rejected the administration\u2019s emergency appeal of Xinis\u2019 April 4 order for Abrego Garcia\u2019s return.",
      "The Salvadoran citizen had an immigration court order preventing his deportation to his native country over fears he would face persecution from local gangs.",
      "The Supreme Court has issued a string of rulings on its emergency docket, where the conservative majority has at least partially sided with Trump amid a wave of lower court orders slowing the president\u2019s sweeping agenda. In Thursday\u2019s case, the court said Xinis\u2019 order must be clarified to make sure it doesn\u2019t intrude into executive branch power over foreign affairs, since Abrego Garcia is being held abroad.",
      "\u201cThe order properly requires the Government to \u2018facilitate\u2019 Abrego Garcia\u2019s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador,\u201d the court said in an unsigned order with no noted dissents.",
      "The administration claims Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, though he has never been charged with or convicted of a crime. His attorneys said there is no evidence he was in MS-13.",
      "The administration has conceded that it made a mistake in sending him to El Salvador, but argued that it no longer could do anything about it. The court\u2019s liberal justices said the administration should have hastened to correct \u201cits egregious error\u201d and was \u201cplainly wrong\u201d to suggest it could not bring him home.",
      "Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, said the ordeal has been an \u201cemotional rollercoaster\u201d for their family and the entire community.",
      "\u201cI am anxiously waiting for Kilmar to be here in my arms, and in our home putting our children to bed, knowing this nightmare is almost at its end. I will continue fighting until my husband is home,\u201d she said.",
      "Xinis\u2019 April 4 order said the government\u2019s decision to arrest Abrego Garcia and send him to El Salvador appeared to be \u201cwholly lawless.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is little to no evidence to support a \u2018vague, uncorroborated\u2019 allegation that Abrego Garcia was once in the MS-13 street gang,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "The 29-year-old was detained by immigration agents and deported last month. He had a permit from the Homeland Security Department to legally work in the U.S. and was a sheet metal apprentice pursuing a journeyman license, his attorney said. His wife is a U.S. citizen."

      "SANTO DOMINGO \u2014\u00a0Identifying and conducting autopsies for the 225 people killed in the Jet Set nightclub's roof collapse four days ago has been a task so daunting it overwhelmed the country's morgue.",
      "Heartbroken families hoping to receive the remains of their loved ones have been waiting outside the Dominican Republic's institute of pathology for days, begging authorities to release the bodies so they can start to mourn their relatives.",
      "R\u00f3ger de la Rosa, who flew from the United States after finding out on Wednesday that his sister, Rosie de la Rosa Ortega, was one of the fatal victims, was desperately demanding answers from forensic officials on Friday morning. He questioned the need for the autopsies.",
      "\u201cNo one has faced me,\u201d de la Rosa said in Spanish. \u201cNo one has the courage to look me in the eyes.\u201d",
      "Others like Ana Julia Mej\u00eda, who was waiting to receive her mother\u2019s remains, had the same question.",
      "\"We don't want an autopsy because we know what they died of. We just want them to give them to us, so we can hold a wake,\" Mej\u00eda told Noticias Telemundo.",
      "Public Health Minister Victor Atallah updated the death toll from 221 to 225 when speaking to Noticias Telemundo early Friday afternoon.",
      "Government officials have said the autopsies help determine if the person died instantly, as a result of their injuries or by asphyxia due to the debris. Also, they said, the autopsies will likely serve as \"important evidence\" in the ongoing investigation into what caused the collapse.",
      "As of late Thursday night, forensic officials had completed 130 autopsies, according to the national attorney general\u2019s office.",
      "Antoliano Peralta, a legal consultant to the Dominican Republic\u2019s executive branch, admitted in an interview with Noticias Telemundo that the tragedy's death toll was so big it \"exceeds the forensic institute's capacity.\"",

      "No nation in the world is equipped to conduct hundreds of autopsies in one day, according to Atallah, the public health minister. Still, authorities assured they're doing everything they can to speed up the process.",
      "The attorney general\u2019s office said in a statement the government has \"strengthened our forensic medical team with the goal of completing all autopsies\" by Friday.",
      "Of the autopsies conducted as of Friday morning, over 80% of the victims died of head trauma caused by the impact of the crumbling ceiling, Atallah said. \"That means that they either died instantly or very quickly.\"",
      "\u2018I was trapped in the rubble\u2019",
      "In addition to the hundreds of bodies, rescue crews recovered 189 survivors from the rubble. Cristobal Moya was among those who survived.",
      "Speaking to NBC News from his hospital bed Thursday afternoon, Moya said he survived \"thanks to God.\"",
      "He recalled sitting down to watch renowned merengue singer Rubby P\u00e9rez perform on stage when what appeared to be heavy dust began to fall from above.",
      "\"In a minute, the roof caved in. Something hit my head. I lost consciousness,\" Moya said in Spanish. \"When I woke up, I was trapped in the rubble.\" He thought for a second, \"Was I dreaming? No, I wasn\u2019t.\"",
      "Video from the people who rescued Moya shows him laying face down, his head covered in blood and his body buried in the debris. Moya sustained injuries in his head, torso and legs.",
      "\"God gave me an opportunity,\" Moya said. \"A new opportunity at life.\"",
      "Videos from inside the Jet Set nightclub minutes before disaster struck show what is now P\u00e9rez's last concert. Before the roof collapse killed him, P\u00e9rez was entertaining the crowd with his powerful voice and energetic dance moves.",
      "The videos were filmed by Isaac Gonz\u00e1lez, the nightclub\u2019s official photographer. He was there to capture what was supposed to be a celebratory event starring one of the biggest music stars of the Dominican Republic. But instead, he ended the night documenting one of the country\u2019s deadliest events.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said the roof collapsed when he stepped outside the venue for five minutes to take a break. He was one of the first to film the club's devastation and the emergency response. His videos also show first responders arriving at the scene, later placing body bag after body bag into ambulances.",
      "Funeral services and burials\u00a0for all the victims continue to take place this week.",

      "On the surface, Piper Rockelle\u2019s massively popular YouTube channel was glossy, fun and kid friendly. Starting when Piper was 11, her account featured videos of her and her posse of tween sidekicks pulling pranks, performing skits and doing goofy viral challenges for millions of followers.",
      "However, for all their upbeat smiles on camera, Piper and her friends were experiencing a much darker reality behind the scenes, including alleged \u201cverbal, physical and, at times, sexual abuse\u201d at the hands of Piper\u2019s mother and producer, Tiffany Smith, a lawsuit filed in January 2022 by 11 former \u201cSquad\u201d members says.",
      "A new three-part Netflix docuseries, \u201cBad Influence: The Dark Side of Kidfluencing,\u201d shares the stories of several former child influencers who were members of \u201cPiper\u2019s Squad.\u201d",
      "The documentary also sheds light on the world of \u201ckidfluencing,\u201d a legally murky and largely unregulated sector of the entertainment industry.",
      "Read on to learn more about teen influencer Piper Rockelle, why her mom was sued for $22 million, and where they both are now.",
      "Who is Piper Rockelle?",
      "Piper Rockelle, 17, is an influencer with more than 30 million followers across YouTube, TikTok and Instagram.",
      "She rose to viral fame at age 8 when she began posting videos on YouTube with help from her mom and \u201cmomager,\u201d Tiffany Smith.",
      "When Piper was 11, Smith began recruiting other kids to appear in her daughter\u2019s videos, and the group of tweens and teens became known as \u201cPiper\u2019s Squad.\u201d",
      "Over the next few years, the Squad churned out hundreds of videos of themselves pulling pranks on each other, dancing to lip sync videos, completing viral challenges, and confessing to their crushes.",
      "The channel was incredibly lucrative for Smith and her daughter. At one point, Piper was earning more than half a million dollars per month for her video content, according to\u00a0The Los Angeles Times.",
      "Other members of the Squad routinely earned five figures per month via their own YouTube channels thanks to their association with Piper, according to a 2022 court document.",
      "While Piper\u2019s channel was presented as a harmless collection of videos about a group of tweens\u2019 silly pranks and adventures, it reportedly had a darker side.",
      "As the years went on, former Squad members began speaking out about physical, sexual and emotional abuse they had allegedly suffered at the hands of Smith. Accusations of exploitation and labor violations also arose.",
      "A group of former Squad members sued Smith and her business partner, Hunter Hill, in January 2022. Piper was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit.",
      "Why was Piper Rockelle\u2019s mom sued?",
      "In 2022, 11 former members of Piper\u2019s \u201cSquad\u201d sued\u00a0Rockelle\u2019s mother, Tiffany Smith, seeking damages of at least $2 million each, or $22 million total.",
      "Hill was also named as a defendant, along with Piper\u00a0Rockelle\u00a0Inc., the holding company for the family\u2019s content creation business.",
      "Hill, 28, portrayed a big brother-like figure to Piper on screen, but off camera he reportedly had a romantic relationship with Piper\u2019s mom and was \u201cthe primary director, editor and cinematographer\u201d of Piper\u2019s YouTube videos, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The complaint sought damages for sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, among several other alleged violations.",
      "The plaintiffs, all of whom were minors when the lawsuit was filed, accused Smith of \u201cgrossly inappropriate, offensive and abusive treatment.\u201d They claimed Smith made vulgar comments about their bodies, and at times touched them inappropriately.",
      "According to the complaint, Smith encouraged minors in the Squad to behave sexually with each other and to act proactively in videos and photos, such as urging them to make \u201csexy kissing faces\u201d or to \u201cwear something sluttier\u201d because \u201csex sells.\u201d",
      "According to the complaint, Smith and Hill would \u201csabotage\u201d children who left the Squad, targeting their individual YouTube channels.",
      "Smith and Hill allegedly engaged in a variety of tactics to \u201ctank\u201d former Squad members\u2019 online platforms, such as flooding them with bot subscribers, which can negatively affect how videos are promoted on YouTube, and falsely flagging their channels as \u201cinappropriate\u201d to get their content restricted.",
      "These alleged tactics led to a \u201csignificant loss\u201d in subscribers and viewerships for the plaintiffs, which translated to a loss of income, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Smith denied the allegations against her. In July 2023, she countersued for $30 million, accusing the plaintiffs\u2019 mothers of attempting to extort her by making false allegations of sexual abuse, according to\u00a0NBC News. She later voluntarily abandoned the lawsuit.",
      "In a December 2022 interview with The Los Angeles Times, Smith questioned the motives of the plaintiffs bringing the lawsuit against her.",
      "\u201cThis whole case is based on lies that are driven by financial jealousy,\u201d she said. \u201cFinancial jealousy of a 15-year-old girl.\u201d",
      "Smith has also denied allegations that she violated California labor laws in the filming of the Squad videos. Several parents of former Squad members have said their children filmed up to 12 hours per day and did not receive proper education on set, according to the Times.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Hill for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "\u201cImagine if these kids had been on a movie set for Lionsgate,\u201d Matthew Sarelson, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, told the Times in 2022. \u201cPeople would go to jail if this had happened at a studio.\u201d",
      "Smith has denied that she was running a professional production studio and said it was parents\u2019 responsibility to manage their kids\u2019 schooling.",
      "The Squad members\u2019 lawsuit was settled in October 2024 for $1.85 million, according to\u00a0NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis was never about the money \u2014 it was about holding an individual accountable, telling the truth, and taking a step toward healing,\u201d Angela Sharbino, the parent of one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement, according to NBC News. \u201cAll of these kids have now moved on from the \u2018Squad\u2019 and are closing this chapter of their lives.\u201d",
      "Where are Piper Rockelle and Tiffany Smith now?",
      "Piper continues to share content on social media.",
      "After the 2022 lawsuit was filed, YouTube demonetized Piper\u2019s channel, meaning she could no longer earn revenue from her videos. She still posts occasional YouTube videos, such as a 10-minute vlog entitled\u00a0\u201cWeek in my Life as a Full Time Influencer\u201d\u00a0in November 2024.",
      "\u201cObviously I film vlogs like this, but I don\u2019t really get a lot out of it besides the satisfaction of knowing you guys enjoy watching them, and I get a lot of fun memories that I can go back and watch, which I think is cool,\u201d she says in the video.",
      "The teen adds that she now does other types of work to \u201cyou know, keep the house over my head,\u201d such as brand deals and paid TikTok videos.",
      "Smith and Hill still appear to oversee the creation of Piper\u2019s videos. In her 2024 \u201cWeek in the Life\u201d video, a narrator who appears to be Hill says Smith \u201ccompletely rearranged and decorated\u201d a room in their house so Piper could film TikTok videos at all hours.",
      "One scene from the 2024 vlog shows Piper decorating a Christmas tree at 11:30 p.m. as part of a paid brand deal.",
      "The narrator, who appears to be Hill, says in the video that after they are done filming the Christmas tree scene, they still have to shoot something for her vlog that is going out \u201cin a couple hours.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have to finish editing it and we don\u2019t have a thumbnail for it,\u201d he says. \u201cSo there are so many stresses, you guys have no idea what this is like.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut it\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Piper chimes in.",
      "Piper has more than 14 million fans on TikTok, where she posts frequent videos featuring her hanging out with her boyfriend, lip syncing to viral songs, and sometimes posing in bikinis and other revealing outfits.",
      "She also has an account on BrandArmy, a platform that allows creators as young as 13 to share paid photos and videos of themselves, with parental oversight. The site is\u00a0only open\u00a0to subscribers over the age of 18.",
      "In her 2024 vlog, Piper says she is \u201cgrateful\u201d for the opportunity to create content, but also shares a candid look at her life and responsibilities.",
      "\u201cI have no room to complain about my life because things could be a lot worse. But what I do have to say is, it is hard work on my end. I\u2019ve never had, like, a normal job, but whatever I\u2019m doing right now, it feels like a job. It takes a lot out of me. I go to bed at night and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my God, what did I do today?\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cAnd on top of everything, all I want to do most of the time is just go work out because it makes me so happy,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, the one moment in my life when everything is quiet and I don\u2019t have to think about anything or please anybody.\u201d"

      "\"We appreciate that Bon Jovi wants to feed people that are needy,\" Rodrick told NBC News. \"But the public library down a block from a school is not the appropriate place to bus homeless in from all over the state of New Jersey and other states.\"",

      "\"Serving as your governor has been the greatest honor of my life, an opportunity that not so long ago I never could have imagined,\" Reynolds said in a video posted to social media.",
      "\"After a lot of thought, prayer and conversations with my family, I have decided I will not seek re-election in 2026,\" she continued. \"This wasn't an easy decision because I love this state and I love serving you.\"",
      "Reynolds has been a fixture in Iowa Republican politics for years. She joined then-Republican gubernatorial nominee Terry Branstad's ticket as his running mate during their successful 2010 campaign, and eventually stepped up from the lieutenant governorship to take over as governor when Branstad became President Donald Trump's ambassador to China in 2017.",
      "She's won two elections at the top of the ticket since then, and she has championed conservative issues like school vouchers, curbing legal protections for transgender people, promoting abortion restrictions and cutting income taxes. More recently, she's pushed for a state version of the Department of Government Efficiency helmed by billionaire Elon Musk in Washington.",
      "Her decision not to run again will create an opening in a state that\u2019s shifted to the right over the last two decades.",
      "Democrats last won a gubernatorial race in Iowa in 2006 and haven't won a Senate race there since 2008. The state's congressional delegation is all Republicans, though there are a few hotly contested battleground seats, and a Democrat hasn\u2019t won a federal House race there since 2020. Still, Democrats believe there\u2019s an opening in the state to run against the years of total Republican control of government, running a playbook similar to the one that has helped them gain ground in Kansas.",
      "Looking to her party's political future, Reynolds said she had \"no doubt that Iowa and our Republican Party will remain in great hands\" and praised the \"next generation\" of conservative leadership in the state.",
      "Pastor and former GOP state Rep. Brad Sherman is the only major candidate in the race right now, but that's expected to change now that the incumbent is no longer running. As Reynolds alluded to, there's no shortage of prominent Republicans in the state who could be interested in the bid. On the Democratic side, state Auditor Rob Sand told Pluribus News\u00a0earlier this year he's weighing a gubernatorial bid.",
      "While Reynolds has no shortage of allies in conservative circles and was especially popular among Republicans for much of her career, she's faced some tough political trends from within her own party in recent years.",
      "Reynolds was one of just a handful of prominent Republican officeholders to back Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' presidential bid against Trump, a coup for DeSantis and a blow to Trump in the early nominating state.",
      "Speaking about Trump in 2023, she told NBC News: \"I believe he can\u2019t win ... and I believe that Ron can.\"",
      "But DeSantis lost Iowa, big. And in the months after her endorsement, Trump used his bully pulpit to criticize her and call her \"the most unpopular governor in America.\"",
      "While Trump's comment was an overstatement, Reynolds has seen lackluster favorability numbers in recent years.",
      "Morning Consult's new polling of the nation's governors, released this week, found her disapproval rating at 49% (and an approval rating of 44%). That is the highest disapproval rating of any governor polled, for the fifth quarter in a row in Morning Consult's polling, and she's the only governor with a higher disapproval rating than approval rating in the poll."

      "Sydney Robinson is the showrunner, director, writer, cinematographer and star of the internet\u2019s new favorite show: a series of TikToks about a girls\u2019 group chat.",
      "The\u00a0first video, which Robinson, 27, posted March 30, introduces viewers to a set of roommates whose group text chain starts to blow up when another friend makes a controversial move: inviting her boyfriend to that night\u2019s dinner reservation.",
      "What ensues is a series of passive aggressive remarks and verbal spars exchanged between the group chat\u2019s members.",
      "Online, viewers can\u2019t get enough of the drama.",
      "As of Friday, April 11, the original \u201cGroup Chat\u201d video has more than 30 million views, nearly 4 million likes and over 20,000 comments. Celebrities like\u00a0Stassi Schroeder\u00a0and Bethenny Frankel have posted their own videos weighing in on the drama, while Leslie Jones, Hailey Bieber and Charlie Puth (more on that later) have commented that they\u2019re hooked on the plot\u2019s twists and turns.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been gaining around 100,000 (followers) every day, steady,\u201d Robinson tells TODAY.com.",
      "On April 11, Robinson appeared live on \"TODAY\" to share more about the videos, joking that she hasn\u2019t slept much since the series went viral.",
      "\u201cI try to do it when I get home from work, or in the morning before I go, which I know sounds crazy,\u201d she told Savannah Guthrie and Willie Geist. (She has a day job with an estate jewelry company.) \u201cSetting up the camera and getting into the different outfits is what takes the most time. ... Sometimes when people are like, \u2018It\u2019s been four days!\u2019 People don\u2019t realize I don\u2019t do this full time.\u201d",
      "The TikToker, who has been posting content on the app since around the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, mostly about popular TV shows, says before posting the first \u201cGroup Chat\u201d video she was \u201cstuck\u201d at around 260,000 followers.",
      "She hit 1 million on Saturday, April 5.",
      "The inspiration",
      "Robinson says she\u2019s been trying to write the \u201cGroup Chat\u201d series for about a year.",
      "It all started when she was watching an episode of \u201cJersey Shore: Family Vacation\u201d while flying to Las Vegas in the summer of 2024, she tells TODAY.com.",
      "In the episode, Mike \u201cThe Situation\u201d Sorrentino\u00a0gets released from jail and alerts the rest of the cast via their group chat.",
      "\u201cHe texts everyone that he\u2019s out, and they\u2019re all on a vacation in a house sleeping, and it just revives the group chat,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cIt revives the entire group. Everyone\u2019s like, waking up, looking at it, and just the very idea of his name popping up on their home screen sent shock waves through the house.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018That. That feeling,\u2019\u201d she adds of what she wants to capture in her TikTok series.",
      "The storyline so far involves one friend nearly hijacking her friends\u2019 dinner by inviting her boyfriend, Justin, named for an inside joke among her friends.",
      "The girl, Hailey (named after the character from \u201cOne Tree Hill\u201d \u2014\u00a0not\u00a0Hailey and Justin Bieber, Robinson notes), insists Justin had \u201csuch a rough day\u201d and she doesn\u2019t \u201cwant to leave him alone.\u201d The rest of the girls in the group chat try to shut it down.",
      "Robinson says the story does draw from some of her own experiences.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so funny the ways in which being a woman is such a universal experience,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think having a really close group of girlfriends with very different personalities that are bound to clash, but it doesn\u2019t always mean the end of a friendship.\u201d",
      "After the series started to go viral, she says people started to text her asking, \u201cIs this about this person?\u201d or, \u201cIs this about that story I told you?\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018No,\u2019 but that\u2019s how universal it is, that everybody lowkey thinks I\u2019m like, subtweeting them, and I\u2019m not,\u201d she says.",
      "Tensions escalate\u00a0in Part 2\u00a0as Hailey leaves the group chat, while the rest of the girls find out the original reservation included Justin in the tally all along.",
      "Then\u00a0in Part 3, Hailey asks to rejoin the group and confirms she\u2019ll join them for dinner sans Justin \u2014\u00a0only for the rest of the girls to find him already at the restaurant, sparking confusion from nearly all parties.",
      "Robinson\u00a0posted Part 4 of the series, which saw the aftermath of the group\u2019s arrival at the restaurant, on April 5. And for the first time, one of the characters wasn\u2019t played by Robinson.",
      "Instead one of the series\u2019 biggest fans lent his voice to the role of the elusive boyfriend \u2014 Puth.",
      "Yes, that character was voiced by Charlie Puth",
      "After posting Part 2 of her series, Robinson says she took a nap. Meanwhile, her mom, who has been on vacation out of the country, started calling.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s calling me like 100 times, and she\u2019s like, \u2018Charlie Puth commented on your video,\u2019\u201d Robinson recalls. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018No, shut up.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so invested in this\u2026,\u201d Puth commented.",
      "After, they ended up messaging, and she outright asked if he\u2019d be the voice actor for the Justin character. She says she was \u201cso surprised\u201d he agreed.",
      "\u201cI have no idea why this massive man in the music industry with 22 million followers would want to be a part of my \u2018Group Chat\u2019 skit,\u201d she says.",
      "The goal was to create a bit of mystery by not revealing the voice actor. But within 10 minutes of the video going live, Robinson says she noticed comments like, \u201cWait, is that Charlie Puth?\u201d She says one TikTok user even made a video comparing clips of Puth talking with the voice of Justin to confirm they\u2019re the same.",
      "Once people caught on, Puth confirmed his involvement by commenting, \u201cWhy does Justin\u2019s voice sound familiar \u2026\u201d",
      "Asked if this guest role will turn into a regular gig, Robinson says the goal was to write Justin into just one episode.",
      "\u201cObviously if he ever wanted to be involved ... of course he\u2019s got the part, no question,\u201d she says.",
      "Plus, there might be more special guests to look out for.",
      "\u201cAt this point, it seems like Charlie Puth might not be the last guest star for \u2018Group Chat.\u2019 There might be some more to come,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cHopefully I can keep writing this forever, and hopefully there\u2019s just a bunch of fun surprises in store.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s next?",
      "Right now, fans are left on a cliffhanger, with Part 4 revealing that Justin had separate plans at that restaurant with another woman, who calls him, \u201cbabe,\u201d in the final seconds of the skit, implying Hailey might have been trying to catch Justin cheating on her.",
      "Going forward, Robinson hints that there will be a bit of a \u201credemption arc\u201d for Hailey.",
      "There\u2019s one more video planned for the story of this fateful girls\u2019 night out dinner, Robinson says.",
      "\u201cWe are going to kind of get an answer about what\u2019s been going on,\u201d Robinson promises.",
      "But she emphasizes, \u201cJust because the dinner segment has ended, doesn\u2019t mean the group chat is done.\u201d",
      "In fact, she says she already has storylines planned for situations like, \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d and \u201cThe Birthday.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are keeping the same characters,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to change the scenario. And it might not always be Hailey. Because everyone has their annoying qualities.\u201d",
      "And fans shouldn\u2019t have too long to wait. After \u201cThe Dinner\u201d storyline has wrapped, Robinson says she\u2019ll probably dive right back in.",
      "\u201cTikTok does not allow me the time to take a beat,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cPeople are finding my Venmo and requesting like one cent, but being like, \u2018What I\u2019m actually requesting is Part 4.\u2019\u201d"

    "story": [
      "More than 130 Jewish members of the Georgetown University community in Washington, D.C., released a\u00a0signed statement Friday in support of Badar Khan Suri, a Muslim postdoctoral scholar and professor at the school who was arrested and targeted for deportation last month by the Trump administration.",
      "Jewish faculty, staff, students and alumni wrote in the public statement that Trump is \u201cweaponizing\u201d the Jewish identity and faith, along with fears of antisemitism, to justify the arrest, detention and attempted deportation of Suri and other Muslim students and scholars.",
      "The letter comes after Suri, whose attorneys filed a petition challenging his detainment, was arrested outside his apartment building in Virginia. Suri, who has been a postdoc at Georgetown for the past three years, was accused by the Department of Homeland Security of \u201cactively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.\u201d",
      "The statement also criticizes the administration\u2019s revocation of visas from international students who have engaged in political protests.",
      "\u201cWhile we may hold varying opinions and perspectives on Israel-Palestine, we all agree that the growing wave of politically motivated campus deportation efforts is an authoritarian move that harms the entire campus community,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe encourage Jews and everyone \u2014 at Georgetown and beyond \u2014 to take action and speak out.\u201d",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields responded to NBC News, calling the group \"radical activists\" who \"wouldn\u2019t last a minute in Hamas-controlled Gaza.\"",
      "\"Their misguided virtue signaling is doing more to embolden Hamas than to end the war,\" Fields said in an email. \"President Trump will always stand for peace and for the nation of Israel.\u201d",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement sent to NPR that she disagreed with the group\u2019s assertion that the administration\u2019s actions are harming the greater student body.",
      "\u201cPretty absurd mental gymnastics to believe that revoking visas of individuals who glorify and support terrorists, harass Jews and do the bidding of organizations that relish the killing of Americans and Jews, is in fact, making Jewish students less safe,\u201d McLaughlin said.",
      "In the letter, the group demanded the immediate release of Suri, an Indian national who has been in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody since his arrest last month, along with that of others who have been \u201cunjustly detained.\u201d The statement cites the cases of Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil and Tufts University PhD candidate Rumeysa Ozturk, who were arrested within weeks of one another, as examples of the administration\u2019s \u201ctransgressions of civil liberties.\u201d",
      "Additionally, the group called on Jewish community leaders and institutions like the nonprofits Anti-Defamation League and Hillel International, the largest Jewish student organizations in the world, to openly condemn the administration\u2019s actions. They also asked Georgetown to protect its students\u2019 rights to free speech, and for elected officials to push back on the deportations and \u201cattacks on universities.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are horrified to see this escalating authoritarian action that will only worsen and expand unless we act,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe urge everyone \u2014 especially our fellow Jewish community members, regardless of your political orientation \u2014 to make your voices heard however you are able.\u201d",
      "McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, addressed Suri\u2019s detention on X, saying that \u201cSuri has close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas.\u201d",
      "Suri\u2019s attorney, Hassan Ahmad, previously told NBC News that he has never made any pro-Hamas or antisemitic comments, calling his detention \u201ccontemptible.\u201d And Nader Hashemi, Suri\u2019s supervisor, said that he was not particularly politically outspoken.",
      "\u201cHe was not a public intellectual. He was just a humble young academic scholar,\u201d said Hashemi, director of the school\u2019s Alwaleed Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding. \u201cThe shock and the trauma of this entire arrest \u2026 is just a reflection of the brutal authoritarianism of this Trump administration that is trying to inflict terror and trauma on society.\u201d"

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 Long a method of execution associated with political terror or military justice, a\u00a0firing squad\u00a0is set to kill a South Carolina inmate on Friday, the second time the state will have carried out that method in the past five weeks.",
      "Mikal Mahdi\u00a0was sentenced to die 20 years ago for the ambush killing of an off-duty police officer. He will be the fifth inmate executed by South Carolina in less than eight months as the state makes its way through prisoners who ran out of appeals during an unintended 13-year pause on the death penalty.",
      "Mahdi, 42, chose to die by three bullets to the heart instead of\u00a0lethal injection\u00a0or the electric chair. On March 7,\u00a0Brad Sigmon\u00a0was executed in the first U.S. firing squad death in 15 years and only the fourth since 1976. The others all occurred in Utah.",
      "The firing squad is an execution method with a\u00a0long and violent history\u00a0around the world. Death in a hail of bullets has been used to punish mutinies and desertion in armies, as frontier justice in America\u2019s Old West and as a tool of terror and political repression in the former Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.",
      "But South Carolina lawmakers saw it as the quickest and most humane way to kill an inmate, especially with the uncertainty in obtaining lethal injection drugs.",
      "Mahdi will be the 12th execution in the U.S. this year. Twenty-five prisoners in nine states were killed in all of 2024.\u00a0Alabama\u00a0and\u00a0Louisiana\u00a0have killed inmates by nitrogen gas.\u00a0Florida,\u00a0Oklahoma,\u00a0Arizona\u00a0and\u00a0Texas\u00a0have executed men by lethal injection, while South Carolina has used both the\u00a0firing squad\u00a0and\u00a0lethal injection.",
      "How the execution will unfold",
      "At 6 p.m. Friday, the curtain will open in the death chamber at a Columbia prison with fewer than a dozen witnesses sitting behind bulletproof glass.",
      "Mahdi\u00a0will be strapped into a chair. A white square with a red bull\u2019s-eye will be over his heart, placed by a doctor with a stethoscope. His lawyer can read Mahdi\u2019s final statement if he has one. A prison employee will then place a hood over Mahdi\u2019s head, walk across the small room and pull open a black shade where the prison employees who volunteered for the firing squad will be stationed.",
      "Without an audible or visual warning to witnesses, the shooters will fire high-powered rifles at Mahdi from 15 feet (4.6 meters) away, about the distance from a basketball backboard to the free-throw line. They all will have live bullets that shatter and splinter when they hit something firm, like a rib cage.",
      "A doctor will then come out within a minute or two, examine Mahdi and declare him dead.",
      "The crime",
      "Mahdi admitted he killed Orangeburg Public Safety officer James Myers in 2004, shooting him at least eight times before burning his body. Myers\u2019 wife found him in the couple\u2019s Calhoun County shed, which had been the backdrop to their wedding 15 months earlier.",
      "Myers\u2019 shed was a short distance through the woods from a gas station where Mahdi tried but failed to buy gas with a stolen credit card and left behind a vehicle he had carjacked in Columbia. Mahdi was arrested in Florida while driving Myers\u2019 unmarked police pickup truck.",
      "Mahdi also admitted to the killing three days earlier of Christopher Boggs, a Winston-Salem, North Carolina, convenience store clerk who was shot twice in the head as he checked Mahdi\u2019s ID. Mahdi was sentenced to life in prison for that killing.",
      "Final appeal",
      "Mahdi\u2019s final appeal\u00a0was rejected\u00a0this week by both the U.S. and South Carolina Supreme Courts. His lawyers said Mahdi\u2019s original attorneys put on a shallow case trying to spare his life that didn\u2019t call on relatives, teachers or others who knew him and ignored the impact of months spent in solitary confinement in prison as a teen.",
      "The defense\u2019s case to spare Mahdi\u2019s life before a judge lasted only about 30 minutes. It \u201cdidn\u2019t even span the\u00a0length of a Law & Order episode, and was just as superficial,\u201d Mahdi\u2019s lawyers wrote.",
      "Mahdi\u2019s earliest memory was his father slamming his mother through a glass table and later lying to his son and saying his mother was dead. Mahdi\u2019s father pulled him out of school in fifth grade when officials suggested he needed behavioral help, defense lawyers said.",
      "Prosecutors said Mahdi constantly uses brutality to solve his problems. As a death row prisoner, he stabbed a guard and hit another worker with a concrete block. Mahdi was caught three times with tools he could have used to escape, including a piece of sharpened metal that could be used as a knife, according to prison records.",
      "\u201cThe nature of the man is violence,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Busy death chamber",
      "Mahdi\u2019s death is the end of a busy time in South Carolina\u2019s death chamber. He will be the fifth inmate killed since September after the state had not had any executions since 2011. No other inmates are out of appeals but several are close.",
      "The state was able to restart executions after lawmakers allowed the firing squad and passed a bill allowing suppliers of the pentobarbital to remain secret, along with the exact procedures used to kill inmates and the names of prison employees on execution teams, including the firing squad shooters.",
      "Along with\u00a0Sigmon\u2019s firing squad\u00a0death last month, three other South Carolina prisoners have been executed via lethal injection since September.",
      "South Carolina now has\u00a028 inmates\u00a0on its death row. Just one man has been sentenced to death in the past decade."

He explains you have to be within 50 feet of someone to send them a Digi Drop so he walks around the restaurant, measuring how far the prankster could be. He concludes that they must be in the dining room with them.",

      "Over the course of the date, Violet struggles with the ethics of killing Henry, trying different tricks to secretly let others know her son is in danger \u2014 including secretly informing Phil, but this only gets him killed too.",
      "In response, Let's Play has the masked man in her home attack Jen, knocking her out with the butt of his gun. The masked man then picks Toby up and locks him in his room.",

      "There, Henry confronts her about the watch that fell out of her purse, asking her why she's lying to him. The two have a heartfelt conversation about being honest and genuine. Violet admits to staying in an abusive relationship even after her son was born. She says she is still stuck in it at times, revealing she once watched Blake almost kill Toby as she just sat there.",
      "\"And that's the kind of mother I am,\" she says, to which Henry confides that in the past, he's found himself in a messed-up situation that hurt good people for a long time and he still feels the guilt.",
      "Henry tells Violet that abusive people will make you feel guilty, even if they are dead. Violet tells Henry he's a good guy, but still pretends she forgot the limes for their shots. When Henry goes to grab them, she poisons his shot.",
      "Henry asks if they can toast to \"hope,\" which they do. The poisoned shot is on his lips, but Violet has a change of heart. She spills her red wine all over him so he won't take the shot.",

      "That's when Richard drops all pretenses and darkly tells her to sit. He takes out his earpiece and tells her he admires her tenacity, although he says it won't help her.",
      "He makes her drink one of the shots she brought over (non-poisoned) as he explains that the table he's sitting at is situated in the blind spot of the cameras. He explains that people hired him to get rid of Henry and the SD card as those were the final two loose ends left for covering up the mayor's fraud. He also reveals that Henry is an FBI informant.",
      "Richard's plan will have Violet take the fall for Henry's death as she's on camera poisoning his shot at her table and he made the poison from drugs Violet often prescribes. He says it will be painted as \"widow assassin strikes again,\" despite Violet maintaining she didn't kill her husband.",
      "Pants now clean, Henry approaches Violet and Richard. Richard immediately starts playing nice again, offering Henry the poisoned shot, which he initially refuses but then takes.",
      "Violet asks Henry to give them one more minute and she will explain everything. Henry excuses himself. Richard then calls the masked man to call off the kill mission on Toby and tells Violet that her son will be safe.",
      "He digs into the dessert in front of him, saying all that's left is for him to enjoy his dessert and watch Henry die.",

      "Furious at being outsmarted, Richard pulls out a gun and shoots at Violet, but Henry pushes her out of the way \u2014 taking the bullet himself. One of Richard's bullets whizzes past and hits the glass wall, where small cracks begin to form.",
      "Violet confronts him, grabbing the closest thing she can reach: the puck Henry bought as a gift for Toby. She chucks the hockey puck at the cracks in the glass window, causing it to burst open where the force of the wind sucks Richard out of it.",
      "But the wind is so strong that Violet is also sucked out of the window.",
      "She grabs hold of a ripping tablecloth, dangling over the side of the building until a bleeding Henry pulls her back up to safety. She instructs Henry to apply pressure to his wound, then takes his keys and drives home quickly since before Richard died, he had instructed his counterpart to kill Jen and Toby.",
      "Back at Violet's house, Jen is mid fight with the intruder, trying her hardest to keep Toby safe. Violet arrives, grabbing a kitchen knife and sneaking up behind him to stab him in the chest.",
      "The masked man throws Violet across the table, kicking her in the side. The masked man gets ready to kill Violet, but Toby uses his remote control toy truck to deliver the gun to Violet, which she quickly grabs and kills the intruder with.",
      "What happens with Henry and Violet?",
      "The end of the movie takes place while Henry and Jen are both recuperating from gunshot wounds in the hospital. A news program in the background informs viewers that the mayor's office has been linked to an embezzlement scheme.",
      "Violet visits Henry with food, where he thanks her for saving his life. The pair agrees to a second date before drinking the milkshakes Violet brought for them."

Starting when Piper was 11, her account featured videos of her and her posse of tween sidekicks pulling pranks, performing skits and doing goofy viral challenges for millions of followers.",
      "However, for all their upbeat smiles on camera, Piper and her friends were experiencing a much darker reality behind the scenes, including alleged \u201cverbal, physical and, at times, sexual abuse\u201d at the hands of Piper\u2019s mother and producer, Tiffany Smith, a lawsuit filed in January 2022 by 11 former \u201cSquad\u201d members says.",

      "She rose to viral fame at age 8 when she began posting videos on YouTube with help from her mom and \u201cmomager,\u201d Tiffany Smith.",
      "When Piper was 11, Smith began recruiting other kids to appear in her daughter\u2019s videos, and the group of tweens and teens became known as \u201cPiper\u2019s Squad.\u201d",
      "Over the next few years, the Squad churned out hundreds of videos of themselves pulling pranks on each other, dancing to lip sync videos, completing viral challenges, and confessing to their crushes.",
      "The channel was incredibly lucrative for Smith and her daughter. At one point, Piper was earning more than half a million dollars per month for her video content, according to The Los Angeles Times.",
      "Other members of the Squad routinely earned five figures per month via their own YouTube channels thanks to their association with Piper, according to a 2022 court document.",
      "While Piper\u2019s channel was presented as a harmless collection of videos about a group of tweens\u2019 silly pranks and adventures, it reportedly had a darker side.",
      "As the years went on, former Squad members began speaking out about physical, sexual and emotional abuse they had allegedly suffered at the hands of Smith. Accusations of exploitation and labor violations also arose.",
      "A group of former Squad members sued Smith and her business partner, Hunter Hill, in January 2022. Piper was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit.",

      "The complaint sought damages for sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, among several other alleged violations.",
      "The plaintiffs, all of whom were minors when the lawsuit was filed, accused Smith of \u201cgrossly inappropriate, offensive and abusive treatment.\u201d They claimed Smith made vulgar comments about their bodies, and at times touched them inappropriately.",
      "According to the complaint, Smith encouraged minors in the Squad to behave sexually with each other and to act proactively in videos and photos, such as urging them to make \u201csexy kissing faces\u201d or to \u201cwear something sluttier\u201d because \u201csex sells.\u201d",
      "According to the complaint, Smith and Hill would \u201csabotage\u201d children who left the Squad, targeting their individual YouTube channels.",

      "She also has an account on BrandArmy, a platform that allows creators as young as 13 to share paid photos and videos of themselves, with parental oversight. The site is only open to subscribers over the age of 18.",
      "In her 2024 vlog, Piper says she is \u201cgrateful\u201d for the opportunity to create content, but also shares a candid look at her life and responsibilities.",
      "\u201cI have no room to complain about my life because things could be a lot worse. But what I do have to say is, it is hard work on my end. I\u2019ve never had, like, a normal job, but whatever I\u2019m doing right now, it feels like a job. It takes a lot out of me. I go to bed at night and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my God, what did I do today?\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cAnd on top of everything, all I want to do most of the time is just go work out because it makes me so happy,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, the one moment in my life when everything is quiet and I don\u2019t have to think about anything or please anybody.\u201d"

      "As of Friday, April 11, the original \u201cGroup Chat\u201d video has more than 30 million views, nearly 4 million likes and over 20,000 comments. Celebrities like Stassi Schroeder and Bethenny Frankel have posted their own videos weighing in on the drama, while Leslie Jones, Hailey Bieber and Charlie Puth (more on that later) have commented that they\u2019re hooked on the plot\u2019s twists and turns.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been gaining around 100,000 (followers) every day, steady,\u201d Robinson tells TODAY.com.",
      "On April 11, Robinson appeared live on TODAY to share more about the videos, joking that she hasn\u2019t slept much since the series went viral.",
      "\u201cI try to do it when I get home from work, or in the morning before I go, which I know sounds crazy,\u201d she told Savannah Guthrie and Willie Geist. (She has a day job with an estate jewelry company.) \u201cSetting up the camera and getting into the different outfits is what takes the most time. ... Sometimes when people are like, \u2018It\u2019s been four days!\u2019 People don\u2019t realize I don\u2019t do this full time.\u201d",
      "The TikToker, who has been posting content on the app since around the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, mostly about popular TV shows, says before posting the first \u201cGroup Chat\u201d video she was \u201cstuck\u201d at around 260,000 followers.",
      "She hit 1 million on Saturday, April 5.",

      "Robinson says the story does draw from some of her own experiences.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so funny the ways in which being a woman is such a universal experience,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think having a really close group of girlfriends with very different personalities that are bound to clash, but it doesn\u2019t always mean the end of a friendship.\u201d",

      "After, they ended up messaging, and she outright asked if he\u2019d be the voice actor for the Justin character. She says she was \u201cso surprised\u201d he agreed.",
      "\u201cI have no idea why this massive man in the music industry with 22 million followers would want to be a part of my \u2018Group Chat\u2019 skit,\u201d she says.",
      "The goal was to create a bit of mystery by not revealing the voice actor. But within 10 minutes of the video going live, Robinson says she noticed comments like, \u201cWait, is that Charlie Puth?\u201d She says one TikTok user even made a video comparing clips of Puth talking with the voice of Justin to confirm they\u2019re the same.",
      "Once people caught on, Puth confirmed his involvement by commenting, \u201cWhy does Justin\u2019s voice sound familiar \u2026\u201d",
      "Asked if this guest role will turn into a regular gig, Robinson says the goal was to write Justin into just one episode.",
      "\u201cObviously if he ever wanted to be involved ... of course he\u2019s got the part, no question,\u201d she says.",
      "Plus, there might be more special guests to look out for.",
      "\u201cAt this point, it seems like Charlie Puth might not be the last guest star for \u2018Group Chat.\u2019 There might be some more to come,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cHopefully I can keep writing this forever, and hopefully there\u2019s just a bunch of fun surprises in store.\u201d",
      "What's next?",
      "Right now, fans are left on a cliffhanger, with Part 4 revealing that Justin had separate plans at that restaurant with another woman, who calls him, \u201cbabe,\u201d in the final seconds of the skit, implying Hailey might have been trying to catch Justin cheating on her.",
      "Going forward, Robinson hints that there will be a bit of a \u201credemption arc\u201d for Hailey.",
      "There\u2019s one more video planned for the story of this fateful girls\u2019 night out dinner, Robinson says.",
      "\u201cWe are going to kind of get an answer about what\u2019s been going on,\u201d Robinson promises.",
      "But she emphasizes, \u201cJust because the dinner segment has ended, doesn\u2019t mean the group chat is done.\u201d",
      "In fact, she says she already has storylines planned for situations like, \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d and \u201cThe Birthday.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are keeping the same characters,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to change the scenario. And it might not always be Hailey. Because everyone has their annoying qualities.\u201d",
      "And fans shouldn\u2019t have too long to wait. After \u201cThe Dinner\u201d storyline has wrapped, Robinson says she\u2019ll probably dive right back in.",
      "\u201cTikTok does not allow me the time to take a beat,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cPeople are finding my Venmo and requesting like one cent, but being like, 'What I\u2019m actually requesting is Part 4.'\u201d"

      "On April 10, \"Celebrity Big Brother U.K.\" and ITV, the British network on which it airs, released a clip of the most recent episode in which the incidents occurred. In it, Rourke is heard making comments about Siwa in the backyard, including suggesting he could change the 21-year-old performer's sexuality.",

      "\u201cGood American Family\u201d is a fictionalization of Grace\u2019s true story. Born in Ukraine with a rare form of dwarfism, Grace was adopted by a New Hampshire couple in 2008, before they put her up for re-adoption in 2010, according to a 2021 document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "Grace was then adopted by Michael and Christine Barnett, who began to suspect that she was not a little girl, but a grown adult who was trying to kill them. According to the Court of Appeals document, Grace's Ukrainian adoption paperwork stated she was born in 2003.",

      "Grace has maintained that she was a child at the time of her adoption, and that Kristine Barnett told her to say she was older. \u201cI was terrified of her. I was terrified, so when Kristine told me to tell people that I was 22, I listened because I didn\u2019t know what she would have me do. I didn\u2019t know what she would do to me,\u201d Grace says in the documentary \"The Curious Case of Natalia Grace.\"",
      "\u201cShe threatened me into telling people lies. At first I said, \u2018No, I\u2019m a kid,\u2019 and I guess she just got so mad,\" she continued.",
      "According to a 2019 affidavit filed in the Tippecanoe Court in Indiana obtained by\u00a0TODAY.com, a doctor at Peyton Manning Children\u2019s Hospital examined Grace and determined her age was about 8. A skeletal examination of Grace found she was 11 years old in 2012, per the affidavit.",
      "The document from the Indiana Court of Appeals also states that in 2013, the Barnetts did in fact move Grace into two apartments in Indiana and helped her get federal disability benefits and supportive services to help her \u201cas an adult.\u201d The couple then relocated to Canada with their three biological children.",
      "This is where Episode 5 starts. Prior to that, \u201cGood American Family\u201d was told from Kristine Barnett (Ellen Pompeo) and Michael Barnett\u2019s (Mark Duplass) perspective, depicting Natalia as a sinister adult pretending to be a child.",
      "The latest episode details Natalia living on her own without her walker. She struggles with everyday tasks like turning on the shower and getting into the bathtub, which makes her unable to bathe herself. Because of her small stature, she isn't able to reach the top cabinets in the kitchen and finds it difficult to make herself a meal. She is seen spending her days in front of the television, eating junk food as the apartment becomes a mess.",
      "All alone, at one point, she accidentally cuts her hand trying to open a can of food.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Natalia says, as her hand is covered in blood. \u201cMommy, please mommy. I don\u2019t know how to take care of this.\u201d",
      "She seeks help from a neighbor, who confuses her for a child, but Natalia tells her she's an adult who looks young.",
      "\u201cI remember reading the script and thinking, \u2018OK, this is going to be a big episode for me,\u201d Reid tells TODAY.com. \u201cIt was a little daunting because it\u2019s just me and long hours on set.\u201d",
      "The episode, Robbins tells TODAY.com, is the first time Natalia is seen on screen by herself.",
      "\u201cOne might not realize it watching the first four episodes, but in those first four episodes, you\u2019re never in a scene only with\u00a0Natalia. She can only be in a scene if she\u2019s in a scene with Kristine or Michael, because those episodes are from their perspective,\u201d Robbins says. \u201cSo by the time you get to (Episode) 5 and you\u2019re on the other side of that door, it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve been in a room alone with her.\u201d",
      "As the episode continues, viewers see Natalia getting into trouble after she and the neighbor\u2019s grandson take the bus and get lost while attempting to go to the Barnetts\u2019 home.",

      "Robbins says that watching Reid film her solo scenes was incredibly emotional for everyone on set.",
      "\u201cWatching (Imogen) play those scenes, people on our crew, people who have been doing this job for decades and who have seen it all, seasoned pros, were crying watching her because of the vulnerability that she brings and because of the themes that it deals with,\u201d Robbins adds.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 19:28:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Meghan Markle's As Ever raspberry spread sold out within hours, but we were able to secure a jar. Here's our review of the Duchess of Sussex's signature product.",
    "story": [
      "If you\u2019re upset that there\u2019s no royal jam in Montecito, you had better compote yourself.",
      "On April 2, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, released the first eight products from her lifestyle brand As Ever. From Herbal Hibiscus Tea to Flower Sprinkles (which showed up on her Netflix show, \u201cWith Love, Meghan\u201d), everything flew off the virtual shelves within an hour.",
      "Given Meghan\u2019s air of luxuriousness, folks have been wondering how the brand would do as fears of a recession loom large, but in an April 8 interview with Fortune, Meghan said she wasn\u2019t worried.",
      "\u201cAt the moment, all of our products are currently made in the U.S., so we don\u2019t anticipate tariffs affecting us directly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as we look at the larger context of how this is going to affect the consumer day to day, I\u2019m very grateful that in part of the conception of this brand, I wanted to create products that look more prestige, but are more accessible and affordable. I think during any time of recession, people still want to find creature comforts, items that can bring them joy.\u201d",
      "I was one of the lucky souls to be able to secure a jar of her Raspberry Spread\u00a0 \u2014 which retails for $9, or $15 with a keepsake box \u2014 which the brand says is \u201cwhere it all began.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also the spread that everyone seems to be talking about online, from Instagram to TikTok, so I was eager to try it.",
      "First thing\u2019s first: This isn\u2019t jam.",
      "Months ago, every celebrity from\u00a0Chrissy Teigen\u00a0to \u201cReal Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d star Garcelle Beauvais gabbed about the royal\u2019s \u201cjam,\u201d but Meghan actually\u00a0sent 50 jars of strawberry\u00a0spread\u00a0labeled with brand\u2019s old name \u2014\u00a0American Riviera Orchard\u00a0\u2014 and nothing about its contents. We\u2019ve been jam-boozled by the glitterati.",
      "With all that in mind, I was assuming a thick texture when I opened the jar and almost spilled it all over myself. The confusion is widespread \u2014 and valid! \u2014 as fruit cooked with sugar goes by a bevy of names: jam, jelly, chutney, marmalade and more.",
      "This raspberry spread has pectin in it, like jam typically does, but it isn\u2019t like the jam you find on store shelves.",
      "To compare, Bonne Maman\u2019s Raspberry Preserves \u2014\u00a0also not jam \u2014 has similar ingredients, including pectin, but is much thicker. I would call this a syrup, compote or coulis. Meghan is calling it \u201cspread,\u201d though \u2014 so spread it is!",
      "Tastewise, I found it fresh and bright. The raspberry sweetness gives way to a lemony tartness I found really refreshing paired with whipped cream cheese on an English muffin. The consistency, though surprising at first, gives it a homemade feel, as does the ratio of raspberry to lemon. It tasted like a sunny day, even though it\u2019s overcast as I stare out my window.",
      "I don\u2019t think the spread would work on a closed sandwich, though: It would likely sploosh out of a peanut butter and jelly \u2014 er, spread \u2014 leaving your hands a sticky mess. On the other hand, I suspect this spread would go fabulously in a crepe \u2014 which is probably a reason the brand sells mix for that, too \u2014 or poured over pancakes.",
      "I was pleasantly surprised by how different this product and the others I\u2019ve tried are from that of competitors in the market. Last night, I tried the Herbal Peppermint Tea and it was so minty, I felt like I was drinking a pack of liquid Altoids \u2014 an unexpected feeling, but not a bad one.",
      "I\u2019m excited to try more products from Meghan\u2019s brand as it expands \u2014 but only if I can get my hands on them fast enough."

      "Noah Wyle says he's \"profoundly sad and disappointed\" about a legal action alleging the Max hit \"The Pitt\" is an unsanctioned revival of \"ER,\" 16 years after the legendary NBC drama ended its run.",
      "Wyle, a cast member of both shows and an executive producer on \"The Pitt,\" spoke to Variety about his reaction to the lawsuit filed by the estate of late author and executive producer Michael Crichton, who wrote the screenplay for what became the pilot episode of \"ER.\"",
      "\u201cThe only thing that I can legally speak to is how I feel emotionally, which is just profoundly sad and disappointed,\" Wyle said. \"This taints the legacy, and it shouldn\u2019t have. At one point, this could have been a partnership. And when it wasn\u2019t a partnership, it didn\u2019t need to turn acrimonious. But on the 30th anniversary of \u2018ER,\u2019 I\u2019ve never felt less celebratory of that achievement than I do this year.\u201d",
      "Crichton's estate, which includes his widow, Sherri Crichton, filed a lawsuit in August 2024 accusing the creators of \"The Pitt\" of breach of contract and two other counts. Wyle, former \"ER\" producer R. Scott Gemmill and executive producer John Wells were among the named defendants. Gemmill created \"The Pitt,\" and Wells is an executive producer on the show along with Wyle.",

      "Wyle, 53, played Dr. John Carter, a young hotshot doctor, on \u201cER,\u201d and portrays Dr. Michael \u201cRobby\u201d Robinavitch, a grizzled veteran of the emergency room at a Pittsburgh hospital, in \u201cThe Pitt.\"",
      "\u201cNoah Wyle\u2019s character is Dr. John Carter from \u2018ER\u2019 in all but name, only 30 years later, and imbued with the experience and lessons learned during the 15-year run of the original series,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.",
      "The defendants started work on an \"ER\" reboot in 2020 with plans for it to air on HBO Max, according to the complaint. The lawsuit alleges the defendants did this \"without any notice\" to Sherri Crichton and with \"brazen disregard\" of contractual rights of Michael Crichton's estate, according to the complaint.",
      "The creators of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d argued that making the show was a \u201cconstitutionally protected act of free speech,\u201d according to a\u00a0ruling by the Superior Court of California in February.",
      "Wyle told Variety that he and \u201cThe Pitt\u201d creators purposefully set out to do a different show after the negotiations with Crichton's estate over an \u201cER\u201d revival fell apart.",
      "\u201cWe pivoted as far in the opposite direction as we could in order to tell the story we wanted to tell \u2014\u202fand not for litigious reasons, but because we didn\u2019t want to retread our own creative work,\u201d Wyle said.",

      "Wyle told Variety that an \"ER\" reboot \"got pretty close to being a reality,\" but Warner Bros. Television could not come to an agreement with Sherri Crichton, who oversees her late husband's estate.",
      "The complaint alleges that the creators of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d shared with Sherri Crichton in 2022 that they had been developing an \u201cER\u201d reboot. She refused to give consent for the planned reboot after negotiations stalled, according to the lawsuit.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 If President Donald Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, he should hold off negotiating a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, Britain\u2019s former top spy told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "Richard Dearlove, the ex-head of British intelligence agency MI6, said that rushing a truce \u2014 and giving too many concessions to the Kremlin \u2014 could encourage President Vladimir Putin to launch other hostile forays into Europe.",
      "The Russians badly need a ceasefire, said Dearlove, citing waning Kremlin cash reserves and the falling price of crude oil, which Moscow exports to fund its war machine.",
      "\u201cUkraine is pretty close to a tipping point,\u201d he said in a wide-ranging interview. \u201cBut the worry at the moment is that Trump will do a premature deal with the Russians\u201d and make too many concessions.",
      "The \u201chighly undesirable\u201d consequences would be to \u201cembolden the Russians, over time, to be more aggressive and assertive in Europe,\u201d said Dearlove over a coffee at one of London\u2019s historic private members clubs.",
      "His remarks come as Ukraine\u2019s military chief said Russia had launched a new offensive in the Eastern European country.",
      "While often less critical of Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach than many other foreign policy experts, Dearlove said he finds Trump\u2019s general \u201clack of grace\u201d and \u201clack of decent behavior\u201d to be \u201cvery disconcerting\u201d \u2014 specifically his Oval Office bust-up with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February.",
      "\u201cMy general view of Americans is they\u2019re gracious and they behave very respectfully,\u201d said a gently amused Dearlove, 80, an Olympic rower\u2019s son who spent a year at Connecticut\u2019s preparatory Kent School before gaining his degree back in Britain at the University of Cambridge. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary the way that Trump has blown up all of that.\u201d",
      "The jovial, outspoken grandee of the British foreign policy establishment joined MI6 in 1966 and served as its chief \u2014 code-named \u201cC\u201d \u2014 between 1999 and 2004. He now co-hosts the \u201cOne Decision\u201d podcast, covering global news, alongside former U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.",
      "He says he \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the American president\u2019s campaign to pressure European allies to spend more on defense, decrying the imbalance of Europe enjoying a relatively generous health care and benefits system while letting the U.S. foot the bill for Western defense.",
      "\u201cWhy should American taxpayers pay for indulgent social security programs in countries like Germany, France and Italy?\u201d he said.",
      "He dismisses \u201cSignalgate\u201d \u2014 in which Trump\u2019s team discussed bombing Yemen on the messaging app Signal \u2014 as a \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201csilly mistake\u201d that showed \u201ca degree of amateurism.\u201d And he said it wouldn\u2019t have a long-term impact on Western intelligence sharing.",
      "Reached for comment on Dearlove\u2019s remarks, White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields said, \u201cPresident Trump is a master negotiator who has done more to bring about world peace during his tenure than any president in modern history.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe President\u2019s Peace Through Strength agenda has delivered historic achievements across the globe and restored American dominance on the world stage,\u201d Fields added. \u201cThe \u2018experts\u2019 have been wrong for decades, and doing the same thing while expecting a different result is the definition of insanity.\u201d",
      "The ex-MI6 head says his biggest short-term worry revolves around Trump\u2019s approach to Ukraine, which has involved parallel talks with both Kyiv and Moscow and has been lambasted by Trump\u2019s critics in the West as being too favorable to the latter.",
      "\u201cIf you want to get the Nobel Peace Prize, don\u2019t do a premature deal with Ukraine \u2014 wait,\u201d Dearlove said. (According to former aides, the president still covets the landmark award won by four of his predecessors, and for which Trump has been nominated at least twice before.)",
      "Dearlove believes the Russians are on the back foot and will only come under more pressure to accept terms. \u201cThe Russians themselves badly need a ceasefire, but Putin is incapable of seeking one because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a reverse gear,\u201d Dearlove said.",
      "On Iran, responding to Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. will hold direct talks with Tehran over its nuclear program, Dearlove says he believes the administration will \u201cdemand a very high price\u201d \u2014 namely that Iran give up its entire nuclear program, both for energy and weapons.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a bottom line for Trump and Israel that Iran must not have nuclear capability,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that if Iran were to try to weaponize or if the intelligence suggests that they are weaponized, then there would be a joint Israeli-American attack.\u201d",
      "Trump didn\u2019t rule out military action if the talks don\u2019t succeed, saying Tehran would have a \u201cvery bad day\u201d if diplomacy failed.",
      "Dearlove agreed: \u201cIf the Iranians don\u2019t negotiate, or if they mislead, which they\u2019re quite capable of doing, they\u2019re ones heading for a crisis.\u201d",
      "Dearlove was head of MI6 when the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, and was later criticized by a public inquiry for his handling of intelligence alleging that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, a key argument steering Britain into the war alongside Washington. At the inquiry in 2017, he described claims he was too close to the British government as \u201ccomplete rubbish.\u201d And, according to a BBC interview in 2023, he is among a minority of people who believe that Iraq did have some kind of weapons program, but that its components may have been moved into neighboring Syria.",
      "Looking ahead, Dearlove believes by far the biggest issue is how the West deals with China.",
      "\u201cPax Americana\u201d \u2014 the \u201cAmerican peace\u201d that has largely held since 1945 and is a byword for Washington\u2019s postwar global dominance \u2014 has \u201cdefinitively disintegrated,\u201d he said.

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putins-two-faced-strategy-says-approach-trump-ukraine-rcna199449",
    "published": "Sat, 05 Apr 2025 04:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has dispatched his close friend Kirill Dmitriev to Washington, while conscripting 160,000 new troops and bombing Kharkiv.",
    "story": [
      "To the casual observer, Russia seems to be marching in two opposite directions.",
      "President Vladimir Putin sent one of his close allies, Kirill Dmitriev, to Washington this week for diplomatic talks, the most senior Kremlin official to visit since Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "At the same time, Putin ordered the mobilization of 160,000 troops, his largest in 14 years, as his drones continue their nightly bombardment of Ukrainian civilians and he plans a spring offensive \u2014 if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is to be believed.",
      "But these twin approaches perfectly illustrate Russia\u2019s strategy, according to some Western foreign policy specialists. They say that Putin is slow-walking talks with President Donald Trump so he can press his battlefield advance in Ukraine, while gambling on achieving normalized relations with a friendly White House.",
      "Putin \u201cthinks that time is on his side, and by dragging things out he\u2019ll put himself in an even better position to negotiate,\u201d said Sergey Radchenko, a Soviet-born Cold War historian and professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.",
      "Mixed messages",
      "Having once promised to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine in 24 hours, Trump has found the reality to be far thornier.",
      "His team has tried to broker a ceasefire, but so far even a partial or temporary truce has been blocked by the Russians. Putin and his envoys have said they will only accept a truce if Ukraine agrees to extreme conditions tantamount to surrender and subjugation.",
      "Many Western officials and experts say Russia knows these cannot be accepted.",
      "\u201cPutin continues to obfuscate, continues to drag his feet,\u201d British Foreign Secretary David Lammy told reporters Friday at the headquarters of NATO in Brussels. \u201cWe see you, Vladimir Putin. We know what you are doing.\u201d",
      "That frustration has been felt in the White House, which under Trump has taken a far friendlier approach toward the Kremlin than previous administrations.",
      "Trump told NBC News on Sunday he was \u201cpissed off\u201d when Putin reiterated his view that Zelenskyy should be ousted. Trump\u2019s inner circle is advising him not to hold a call with Putin until he commits to a ceasefire, two administration officials told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "Familiar envoy",
      "This growing dissatisfaction explains why Moscow dispatched Dmitriev, according to Oleg Ignatov, a senior analyst on Russia at the International Crisis Group in Brussels.",
      "\u201cDmitriev has direct access to Putin; in the Russian system, this is the most important thing a negotiator can have,\u201d Ignatov said. He also \u201chas his own connections in the United States.\u201d",
      "Dmitriev, 49, was born in Kyiv when it was part of the Soviet Union and heads the Russian sovereign wealth fund responsible for investing and growing the country's cash pile. He has a close relationship with Putin, who in February appointed him special envoy on international economic investment.",
      "Dmitriev studied at Stanford and got his MBA at Harvard before working for Goldman Sachs and McKinsey & Co.",
      "After meeting with Trump\u2019s officials, he did a round of broadcast interviews in which he talked up normalizing relations with Washington, Arctic cooperation and a minerals deal. He even said the Kremlin could be involved in Elon Musk\u2019s plan to put humans on Mars. Ukraine was mentioned in passing, but he did not mention it in his social-media summary of the trip.",
      "\u201cWithout doubt, we note a positive dynamic in our relations,\u201d he told journalists in Washington. \u201cA series of meetings will still be needed for us to resolve all our differences. But the main thing we see is a positive, constructive attitude.\u201d",
      "The significance of Dmitriev\u2019s visit may lie in the fact he is not a career diplomat.",
      "\u201cHis apparent closeness to Putin makes him more than just a messenger,\u201d said Pavel Baev, a research professor at the Peace Research Institute Oslo, a think tank. \u201cHe appears to be a person who can really engage in bargaining and compromise.\u201d",
      "Asked about Dmitriev\u2019s\u00a0trip, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Moscow was \u201ccautiously optimistic.\u201d",
      "Pressing ahead",
      "But, to be clear, Dmitriev's main task is clearly to re-establish links with Washington \u2014 rather than signal any drawdown in Ukraine ambitions, according to experts such as Robert Hamilton, a retired U.S. Army colonel and now head of research at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.",
      "Dmitriev's mission \u201csignals that the Kremlin is interested in broadening the discussions with the U.S. and steering them away from Ukraine,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cWhat the Kremlin actually seeks is to sideline the Ukraine issue and pursue a broader reset with the U.S. that leaves Ukraine and Europe out of the process and frees Russia to continue its war.\u201d",
      "Some saw evidence of that this week in Putin\u2019s announcement that the annual spring conscription draft would take on 160,000 recruits, the largest in 14 years.",
      "\u201cA clear signal it wants peace (not!)\u201d Tymofiy Mylovanov, Ukraine\u2019s former economics minister, wrote on X.",
      "Some experts point out the draft is only slightly higher than in previous years, and by law the recruits are barred from participating in what Russia calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. But it is nonetheless a symptom of Russia's growing militarization, a shift that has seen the entire economy retooled toward its war effort.",
      "In the short term, there are few signs Russia is slowing its war.",
      "One drone attack on Ukraine\u2019s second city of Kharkiv late Thursday killed five people and injured more than 30 others, officials said. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy told the French newspaper La Figaro last week he believes Putin is preparing a spring offensive.",
      "Russia\u2019s \u201cceasefire intentions are, as far as I can discern, nonexistent,\u201d Baev added. \u201cDmitriev is most probably sent in order to wriggle out of a tight corner.\u201d"

      "Eyewitnesses described seeing the helicopter fall apart as it hit the river.",

      "Mohamed Salah\u2019s trophy-laden spell with Liverpool is set to extend to a decade after the prolific Egypt forward signed a new contract with the Premier League leader, ending months of uncertainty over his future.",
      "The 32-year-old Salah was one of three key senior players \u2014 with Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk \u2014 due to be out of contract at the end of this season.",
      "He is the first to extend his stay, having already established himself as a club great with 243 goals in 394 appearances, placing him third in the list of Liverpool\u2019s all-time top scorers.",
      "Liverpool didn\u2019t disclose the length of Salah\u2019s new deal in an announcement on Friday but manager Arne Slot did, saying in a news conference it was a two-year contract.",
      "More Sports from NBC News",
      "After a combined 141 straight losses, these college baseball teams finally savor victory For Luka Doncic, a teary return to Dallas MLB weighs a salary cap as potential lockout looms in 2026 Grizzlies' Jaylen Wells sent to hospital after midair collision during dunk attempt",

      "Grizzlies' Jaylen Wells sent to hospital after midair collision during dunk attempt",
      "\u201cOf course I\u2019m very excited,\u201d said Salah, who joined from Roma in 2017 for 42 million euros ($50 million). \u201cWe have a great team now. Before also we had a great team. But I signed because I think we have a chance to win other trophies and enjoy my football.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great, I had my best years here. I played eight years, hopefully it\u2019s going to be 10. Enjoying my life here, enjoying my football. I had the best years in my career.\u201d",
      "Salah has been either tied or alone as the Premier League\u2019s top scorer in three seasons, been voted as the league\u2019s player of the year twice, and has lifted seven major trophies including the Premier League in 2020 and the Champions League in 2019.",
      "Helped by Salah\u2019s league-leading 27 goals this campaign, Liverpool holds an 11-point lead in the Premier League in its bid for a record-tying 20th English top-flight title.",
      "\u201cI would like to say to (the fans), I am very, very happy to be here,\u201d Salah said. \u201cI signed here because I believe we can win a lot of big trophies together. Keep supporting us and we\u2019ll give it our best, and hopefully in the future we\u2019re going to win more trophies.\u201d",
      "Salah\u2019s future at Liverpool appeared in the balance for much of this season. He had been linked with a move to the Saudi league \u2014 Liverpool rejected an offer worth a reported $188 million in 2023 \u2014 and, in an apparent show of brinksmanship, gave a number of interviews stating he was playing his last year at the club because he was no closer to agreeing to a new deal.",
      "Slot, however, said he knew for some time that Salah was likely to stay at Liverpool. And he praised sporting director Richard Hughes and the Fenway Sports Group ownership for securing the forward\u2019s future, which meant deviating from the club\u2019s policy of not handing players over 30 years of age lucrative new contracts.",
      "British media reported Friday that a cut in Salah\u2019s reported wages of 350,000 pounds ($460,000) a week was never on the agenda in discussions.",
      "\u201cMo Salah is such a great player that as a free agent he can go probably to every club in the world, wherever he wants to,\u201d Slot said. \u201cBut he stayed at our club.\u201d",
      "For Slot, Salah\u2019s continued presence boosts Liverpool\u2019s appeal in the transfer market.",
      "\u201cIt gives a positive vibe to the club \u2014 maybe a positive vibe we might not need but it\u2019s always good to have positive vibes instead of negative vibes,\u201d the Dutch coach added.",
      "\u201cIf you want to sign new players or players who want to extend here, it is always a positive to see one of our star players over the last seven or eight years has made the choice to extend his contract. It also shows maybe how ambitious this club is: not only Mo, but the owners.\u201d",
      "Attention now turns to whether Van Dijk and Alexander-Arnold will follow Salah in committing their future to Liverpool.",
      "Van Dijk, the commanding Netherlands center back who has been at Anfield since 2018, said in comments reported Monday that he was getting closer to signing a new contract.",
      "\u201cThere is progress, yeah,\u201d said the Liverpool captain, who turns 34 in July. \u201cListen, these are internal discussions and we\u2019ll see.\u201d",
      "Alexander-Arnold, however, is the most likely to leave Liverpool having been linked heavily with a move to Real Madrid."

    "summary": "In Egypt, ancient treasure dating back 3,300 years is being So'oud Aten. Dubbed the lost golden city, its residents left at the whim of Pharaoh Akhenaten.",
    "story": [
      "SO\u2019OUD ATEN, Egypt \u2014 It\u2019s a familiar story: The whim of a leader upends citizens\u2019 lives\u00a0and leads them into the wilderness.",
      "In ancient Egypt, Pharaoh Akhenaten was no different. Determined that his population should stop from worshipping multiple gods, more than 3,300 years ago he told residents to seal up their homes and workshops in the city of So\u2019oud Aten with mud and clay bricks and move to a new home, a leading Egyptologist, Zawi Hawass, told NBC News last month.",
      "\u201cWhen the king makes a decision, everyone has to obey the decision,\u201d Hawass said. \u201cThis is the pharaoh.\u201d",
      "So quick was their exodus that many left behind an array of items including jewelry, pottery, children's shoes and toys, as well as a pizza peel similar to those used to make bread by their modern day descendants \u2014 a treasure trove that is now being recovered by archeologists.\u00a0NBC News was given exclusive access to the latest findings.",
      "But much is still a mystery in a city that was only discovered four years ago by archeologists searching for a mortuary temple where animal skeletons were arranged for religious rights. Egyptologists may never figure out why a fish was covered in gold.",
      "\u201cNobody really can explain it,\u201d Hawass said, adding that around 500 statues of the Sekhmet, the goddess of healing, have also been found at the site, which he has dubbed the \u201clost golden city,\u201d in part because it thrived during Egypt\u2019s golden age.",
      "Today it is a sleepy patch of desert, surrounded by a metal fence, and a dusty road. Archeologists work in the blazing sun at the site where an artificial lake with boat moorings was recently unearthed, likely created to deliver and dispatch goods to the Nile.",
      "Its location though is hugely significant. Situated near Luxor, an ancient city in central Egypt, it is surrounded by historical monuments, including the Colossi of Memnon, the Madinat Habu Temple and the Ramesseum. During the 18th dynasty, this was royal Egypt.",
      "Hawass, who served as Egypt\u2019s minister for antiquities, said that So\u2019oud Aten provides important information about the high standard of living for artisans and craftsmen as well as \u201cthe daily life of the people,\u201d who were so well off that archeologists \u201cfound many showers inside the houses,\u201d he said.",
      "In the past few months Hawass said a set of administrative buildings akin to a police station or town hall have also been uncovered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a snapshot in time,\u201d said Salima Ikram, a professor of Egyptology at the American University of Cairo.",
      "Workmen just laid down their tools, she said, adding, \u201cTheir stuff is lying around. They\u2019re in the middle of making, you know, pegging out a cow hide. They\u2019re cutting out sandals, and suddenly, all of this.\u201d",
      "Another recent discovery, a sun image etched onto the wall of a room in the district of the city where spinning, leatherwork and jewelry production took place, appears to signal a shift in religious thinking over time, Hawass said.",
      "Then in his life changing ruling, Akhenaten decided that his citizens should worship Aten, who was represented by the sun, he said, adding that it was possibly the first historical example of monotheism.",
      "Others like Ikram, prefer to define him as a henotheist \u2014 someone who worships one particular god, while acknowledging the existence and potential worship of other deities.",
      "Akhenaten, Hawass said, was \u201chated\u201d by religious priests who profited from the worship of multiple gods.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to go to a place to worship Aten,\u201d Hawass said, adding that he chose a site known today as Tell-el Amarna, around 200 miles south of Egypt\u2019s capital, Cairo.",
      "He called the new city the \u201cRise of Aten,\u201d Hawass said, adding that he believed that he was inspired to build the city by his father, Amenhotep III, who ruled Egypt from 1391 till 1353 B.C.",
      "Queen Nefertiti, Akhenaten\u2019s far more famous wife, would have walked the streets alongside him, Hawass added.",
      "The move was a \u201creligious revolution,\u201d said Yasmin El Shazly, the deputy director of the American Research Center in Egypt, which , which offers financial assistance to some archeologists. \u201cWe know that during the reign of Amenhotep lll, the religion became increasingly solar. There is evidence of the Aten, but there are other deities as well. So we know that it was not monotheistic at the time.\u201d",
      "But mentioning other gods, even the major deity Amun, \u201cbecame almost taboo,\u201d she said.",
      "After Akhenaten\u2019s death the city continued to be used by pharaohs including Tutankhamun, whose nearly intact tomb was discovered in the Valley of the Kings by British archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922.",
      "What the citizens thought about leaving their original home in So\u2019oud Aten remains unclear.",
      "By blocking the doors, Hawass said it appeared that they were thinking they may come back and they wanted to \u201ckeep it safe.\u201d",
      "But at the time, he said no one could raise their objections to the pharaoh. \u201cNo one can talk to the king,\u201d he said."

      "The State Department said Thursday that Bridget Brink will be leaving her post in the near future, although it was not immediately clear exactly when she would depart. Brink assumed the post under former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration and has been a staunch advocate for U.S. military assistance to Ukraine.",
      "Her resignation had been expected for some time, especially considering the Trump administration\u2019s premium on rapprochement with Russia and ending the war.",
      "\u201cAmbassador Brink is stepping down,\u201d the department said. \u201cShe\u2019s been the ambassador in Kyiv for three years \u2014 that\u2019s a long time in a war zone. And frankly, the war has gone on for far too long.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe real issue is whether the Russians and Ukrainians are ready to do what\u2019s necessary to end this war,\u201d it said."

      "LONDON \u2014\u00a0LGBTQ professionals in Britain still feel pressured to downplay their identity at work, with some changing their appearance, voice or behavior to avoid discrimination or to be taken seriously, a new report said on Thursday.",
      "Pride in Leadership, a network of LGBTQ business leaders, called for stronger rights protecting members of the community and urged companies to do more to stamp out homophobia and transphobia disguised as \u201cbanter.\u201d",
      "The not-for-profit, which surveyed 1,000 LGBTQ professionals between June and November of last year in its first such report, said 85% of respondents encountered career obstacles due to their identity.",

      "Over half said it influenced their career choices, prompting them to avoid certain sectors or roles due to fears of discrimination or lack of support.",

      "Haworth added, \u201cEveryone deserves a fair chance to succeed \u2014 regardless of who they love or how they identify.\"",
      "Official data from the 2021 Census showed that around 1.5 million people in England and Wales identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual or another sexual orientation."
