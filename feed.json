      "A judge has denied singer R. Kelly\u2019s request for furlough from prison after the convicted sex offender accused federal prison officials of plotting to murder him",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- A judge has denied singer R. Kelly 's request to be freed from prison, saying she lacks jurisdiction to consider the convicted sex offender's allegations that federal prison officials plotted to murder him.",
      "U.S. District Judge Martha M. Pacold canceled Friday's scheduled arguments in Chicago, and instead issued a five-page ruling denying his emergency request to serve his time on home detention during a temporary furlough.",
      "Born Robert Sylvester Kelly, the 58-year-old Grammy-winning R&B singer is serving sentences at a prison in Butner, North Carolina, for child sex crimes and racketeering.",
      "Pacold noted that federal courts have only limited power in such cases, and one by one she examined and rejected various ways Kelly's request could be considered.",
      "\u201cJurisdictional limitations must be respected even where, as here, a litigant claims that the circumstances are extraordinary,\u201d Pacold wrote. \"Kelly has not identified (nor is the court aware of) any statute or rule that authorizes the court to exercise jurisdiction. Thus, the court cannot award relief in this case.\u201d",
      "Kelly claimed in a series of filings this month that prison officials solicited white supremacist leaders to kill him, to halt the disclosure of information damaging to prison officials.",
      "Kelly's attorney says he was then moved to solitary confinement and purposely given an overdose of medication, which required hospitalization and surgery for blood clots.",
      "Pacold noted that Kelly offers no evidence to back up his claims. Government lawyers suggested Kelly had spun a \u201cfanciful conspiracy.\u201d",
      "Known for such hits as \u201cI Believe I Can Fly,\u201d Kelly was found guilty in Chicago in 2022 of three charges of producing child sexual abuse images and three charges of enticement of minors for sex. In New York in 2021, he was found guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking. He is serving most of his 20-year Chicago sentence and 30-year New York sentence simultaneously.",
      "His appeals have been unsuccessful, including to the U.S. Supreme Court. Kelly has also sought President Donald Trump\u2019s help.",

    "story": [
      "Keke Palmer is giving her take on her 2023 public breakup with her ex Darius Jackson on her new album, \u2018Just Keke",
      "NEW YORK -- A sheer dress silhouetting a black body suit, Usher\u2019s signature crowd interaction and a tweet from her child\u2019s father: that concoction created a nearly two-week social media frenzy starring Keke Palmer back in 2023. Now, the multi-hyphenate creative has channeled that experience into her new album, \u201cJust Keke.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was tough \u2026 I didn\u2019t even realize I was in such grief,\u201d said the 31-year-old about the fallout of her extremely public breakup with her ex, Darius Jackson. \u201cI get to put that same emotion into a song, and I get tell those people that\u2019s been watching me since I was nine \u2026 what\u2019s going on in a way that it can translate.\u201d",
      "Following 2023\u2019s \u201cBig Boss,\u201d her third solo studio project, out now, is an 18-track visual album conceptualized and directed by Palmer and her team. Tayla Parx, who\u2019s written for Alicia Keys, Justin Bieber and Dua Lipa, handled the bulk of the writing and executive produced with Palmer. The storyline follows Palmer musically navigating celebrity, motherhood and self-reflection. But her vulnerability about her well-publicized relationship drama is the album\u2019s throughline.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what artistry is \u2026 mine is about transmutation, it\u2019s about bringing closure,\u201d said Palmer, who\u2019s usually mum about her romantic relationships. \u201cI have to address something that I would never address, especially nothing on an intimate level \u2014 that\u2019s just so not me. But I knew that I had to because now that it\u2019s become public, it\u2019s become a part of my work, and I have to respond to it as such. And that just caused me to have to grow.\u201d",
      "While attending Usher\u2019s popular Las Vegas residency in 2023, the Emmy winner danced closely with the music icon during his routine audience interaction segment. Social videos of the interaction prompted a viral tweet from Jackson, her ex-boyfriend and child\u2019s father, criticizing her attire, writing, \u201cIt\u2019s the outfit tho.. you a mom.\u201d",
      "While he was quickly admonished online, the conversation eventually moved beyond social media to articles and think pieces tackling subjects ranging from patriarchy, women\u2019s attire, and having children before marriage.",
      "Standout tracks on \u201cJust Keke\u201d include \u201cMy Confession\u201d \u2014 a tongue-in-cheek interpolation of Usher\u2019s hit \"Confessions, Pt. II\" \u2014 as well as the previously released \"125 Degrees\u201d and \u201cOff Script.\u201d She passionately belts out her love on the ballad \u201cUnless It\u2019s You,\u201d while \u201cMisunderstood\u201d finds her asking, \u201cDon\u2019t you see me throwing out a lifeline? / You too busy pinning me the bad guy / Maybe we ain\u2019t doing what we should / or maybe we\u2019re just misunderstood.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat the project, I think, speaks to as well is just like reclamation,\u201d said the \u201cNope\u201d star, admitting the album could reignite criticism about her personal life. \u201cI\u2019m just Keke, hate it or love it. This is me, this is my story, this is how I see things, I see my life \u2026 the whole point of it, too, is making peace with just saying what you got to say and letting it be that.\u201d",
      "While Palmer\u2019s mic is still hot, she\u2019s extremely booked and busy on Hollywood lots: a sequel to \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d and she stars with Eddie Murphy and Pete Davidson in \u201cThe Pickup\u201d from Prime Video in August. The \u201cAkeelah and the Bee\u201d actor will lead Peacock\u2019s upcoming TV adaptation of Mel Brook\u2019s \u201cThe \u2019Burbs,\u201d and she\u2019ll join the team on \u201cSpaceballs 2\u201d with original stars Bill Pullman and Rick Moranis, the latter a reclusive \u201880s and \u201990s star who\u2019s since largely stayed out of Hollywood.",
      "Palmer says she\u2019ll judge the success of \u201cJust Keke\u201d not necessarily by sales or Billboard charts, but by potential opportunities that arise, whether it\u2019s creating and directing visual albums for other artists, helming her own musical and comedic variety show, or even embarking on her own world tour.",
      "\u201cIt could look like so many things, and I\u2019m open to all of them,\u201d said Palmer. \u201cAs long as I know that I put my all into this, I know I can\u2019t lose.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Trailblazing deaf actor Marlee Matlin opens up in the new documentary \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore.\u201d",
      "When American Masters approached Marlee Matlin about doing a documentary, Matlin had one name in mind to direct: Shoshanna Stern.",
      "Like Matlin, Stern is deaf. She also hadn\u2019t directed before. But Matlin, who herself became the first deaf person in the Directors Guild of America just a few years ago, was certain she was up to the task.",
      "The resulting film, \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore\u201d is an intimate look at her life: Growing up in a hearing family; winning the best actress Oscar at 21 for her first movie role in \u201cChildren of a Lesser God,\u201d which film critic Rex Reed at the time called a \u201cpity vote\u201d; what she's described as an abusive romantic relationship with her co-star, the late William Hurt, which he denied; getting sober; and her experiences in an industry not equipped to accommodate deaf actors.",
      "It\u2019s also an evocative portal into the world of the deaf community that uses groundbreaking techniques and sound design to put American Sign Language (ASL) and visual communication first. The film opens in select theaters Friday.",
      "While Matlin told much of her story in the memoir \u201cI\u2019ll Scream Later,\u201d on some level it wasn\u2019t a completely satisfactory experience. Before the #MeToo movement, its revelations were not treated entirely seriously in the media. But a documentary also provided an opportunity.",
      "\u201cWe communicate visually,\u201d she said.",
      "Matlin and Stern spoke though translators to The Associated Press about the \u201cCODA\u201d effect, making the doc on their terms, and why they hope Reed sees this film. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "STERN: I had never seen a deaf person direct an episode of TV or film. Never. I thought, what does that even look like? I didn\u2019t realize until I took the job that really the whole form of documentary as we know it is really rooted in sound, in the assumption that people will be speaking and they can speak. I thought, what are we going to do when we\u2019re using American Sign Language? I have to reframe a whole form of documentary. We have to be able to see what a visually-based documentary is going to look like.",
      "We wouldn\u2019t do justice to Marlee\u2019s life if I had forced this form that really wasn\u2019t rooted in the way that she experienced this life. And that was exciting to do. Scary for some people out there, but I never felt scared in making this documentary because she believed in me.",
      "MATLIN: If I had had a hearing director approach me to do this project, we could have done a very good job, but that person would not have seen me in the same way. They would not have the same lens as a deaf person.",
      "STERN: I did want to film with captions in mind, so I made sure that we did have a wider frame. We figured out visual voiceover with a split screen that we added. We did this little surgery with words and syllables in one of the scenes where we mixed them all around to be able to bring people into how Marlee experiences conversations and the world. We wanted to make this documentary an immersive experience for the audience members, a sensory experience to help them understand.",
      "MATLIN: \u201cCODA\u201d certainly was a milestone and respected by so many people in the industry. It tackled a lot of things that both deaf and hearing people or audiences can identify with. I love the fact that they burnt in the captions. That you can\u2019t just turn it off.",
      "And I hoped that all the love we received and the three Academy Awards that we got would make a difference. It was honored on so many other levels too as well, whether we\u2019re talking about (director) Sian (Heder) or you\u2019re talking about Troy (Kotsur) or the SAG award which was just a dream come true, specifically of mine. I took that opportunity to specifically address that that we \u201cexist,\u201d that we want to be actors just like you, we want to be directors, we want be producers, we want to be hair and wardrobe stylists. We want to work in all levels of production. So \u201cCODA\u201d really elevated that conversation about how much we wanted to be part of the industry. But for some reason it didn\u2019t really break open the door as wide as I would have thought. Yet we just don\u2019t give up. We are persistent. Because it is what it is. We are working on our own levels to make changes.",
      "STERN: Marlee said something really brave when we were at Sundance. She said, \u201cIt won\u2019t last.\u201d The moment, yes, in the moment. But I don\u2019t know if we have movement.",
      "MATLIN: There\u2019s so many stories that we can tell, so many stories that you can put up on screen, so many stories that we can put on stage.",
      "I\u2019d like to see action because I\u2019ve been hearing that, \u201cYes, we have to do this\u201d or \u201cI will do this,\u201d but it\u2019s been 40 years. I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m complaining. I just want to make sure that we put our money where our mouth is.",
      "I go back to that comment about Rex Reed. I wonder if he would ever see this film. I\u2019d love to see if he has the balls to make a comment and say, \"Oh look, I realize I might have said something wrong.\"",
      "That\u2019s just one example of the things I\u2019d like to see happen. And maybe the people who interviewed me over the years. I don\u2019t want you to misunderstand me, I have a great deal of respect for them. But specifically, I am calling out Rex Reed. So, you know, sorry but not sorry.",

      "The group launched in 2013 with the hip-hop heavy single album \u201c2 Cool 4 Skool,\" releasing three full-length projects before really gaining momentum with their 2016 album \u201cWings.\" Their global breakthrough came in 2017 when \u201cDNA\u201d entered the Billboard Hot 100, making BTS the first Korean boy band to achieve such a feat. The song\u2019s success was followed by a performance at the American Music Awards, further fueling their international fan base.",
      "The band is largely credited with bringing K-pop to the international stage, and with good reason. Across their discography, BTS broke boundaries and records: In 2020, they released the five-time platinum \u201cDynamite,\u201d their first all-English single, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 \u2014 a first for an all-South Korean musical act. At the height of their popularity, BTS was not only the biggest K-pop group on the planet, but the biggest boy band overall.",
      "In fact, they've been certified platinum many times over, according to The Recording Industry Association of America. Their platinum successes include:",
      "\u2014 2018's \u201cMic Drop;\u201d",
      "\u2014 2020's \u201cMap of the Soul: 7,\" \u201cLove Yourself: Answer,\u201d and \u201cIdol;\u201d",
      "\u2014 2021's \u201cBe,\u201d and song of the summer \u201cButter;\u201d",
      "\u2014 and high-profile collaborations \u201cMy Universe\u201d with Coldplay and \u201cBoy With Luv\u201d featuring Halsey.",
      "BTS has also been nominated for five Grammy Awards. Their first, for \u201cDynamite\u201d in the best pop duo/group performance category, marked the first time a K-pop act received a Grammy nod.",
      "As their global popularity grew, the septet also became international advocates for social justice. Their 2018 address to the United Nations General Assembly launched the \u201cLove Myself\u201d campaign in partnership with UNICEF to combat violence, abuse and bullying while promoting self-esteem among young people. The group\u2019s commitment to human rights activism continued in 2020 when they donated $1 million to the Black Lives Matter movement, denouncing racial discrimination and violence. Their fan base, known the world over as ARMY, responded by matching the donation within 24 hours.",
      "Their dual impact on music and social causes culminated in 2022 when they were invited to the White House to discuss anti-Asian hate crimes with President Joe Biden.",
      "In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18 to 28 are required by law to perform 18-21 months of military service under a conscription system meant to deter aggression from rival North Korea.",
      "The law gives special exemptions to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers if they have obtained top prizes in certain competitions and are assessed to have enhanced national prestige. K-pop stars and other entertainers aren\u2019t subject to such privileges.",
      "However, in 2020, BTS postponed their service until age 30 after South Korea\u2019s National Assembly revised its Military Service Act, allowing K-pop stars to delay their enlistment until age 30.",
      "There was heated public debate in 2022 over whether to offer special exemptions of mandatory military service for BTS members, until the group\u2019s management agency announced in October 2022 that all seven members would fulfill their duties.",
      "BTS tiered their enlistments, giving ample time for its members to focus on solo projects while the group was on a break.",
      "Jin released two EPs, \u201cHappy\u201d in 2024 and \u201cEcho\u201d in May of this year. Suga dropped his debut solo album, \u201cD-Day,\u201d in 2023 under his moniker Agust D.",
      "Also in 2024, RM released his second solo album, the elastic, experimental \u201cRight Place, Wrong Person\u201d, and j-hope released an EP, \u201cHope on the Street Vol. 1.\" Earlier this year, j-hope embarked on his first solo tour.",
      "Jimin released two projects, 2023's \u201cFace\u201d and 2024's \u201cMuse.\u201d V's debut album, the smooth alt-R&B \u201cLayover,\u201d arrived in 2023, as did Jung Kook's retro-pop debut, \u201cGolden.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- After Hollywood's \u201cNapoleon\u201d exposed the legendary emperor to a new generation, over 100 relics \u2014 which shaped empires, broke hearts and spawned centuries of fascination \u2014 are on display in Paris ahead of what experts call one of the most important Napoleonic auctions ever staged.",
      "His battered military hat. A sleeve from his red velvet coat. Even the divorce papers that ended one of history\u2019s most tormented romances \u2014 with Josephine, the empress who haunted him to the end.",
      "Two centuries after his downfall, Napoleon remains both revered and controversial in France \u2014 but above all, unavoidable. Polls have shown that many admire his vision and achievements, while others condemn his wars and authoritarian rule. Nearly all agree his legacy still shapes the nation.",
      "\u201cThese are not just museum pieces. They\u2019re fragments of a life that changed history,\u201d said Louis-Xavier Joseph, Sotheby\u2019s head of European furniture, who helped assemble the trove. \u201cYou can literally hold a piece of Napoleon\u2019s world in your hand.\u201d",
      "The auction \u2014 aiming to make in excess of 7 million euros ($7.5 million) \u2014 is a biography in objects. The centerpiece is Napoleon\u2019s iconic bicorne hat, the black felt chapeau he wore in battle \u2014 with wings parallel to his shoulders \u2014 so soldiers and enemies could spot him instantly through the gunpowder haze.",
      "\u201cPut a bicorne on a table, and people think of Napoleon immediately,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the laurel crown of Julius Caesar.\u201d",
      "The hat is estimated to sell for at least over half a million dollars.",
      "For all the pageantry \u2014 throne, swords, the Grand Eagle of the Legion of Honor \u2014 the auction's true power comes from its intimacy. It includes the handwritten codicil of Napoleon's final will, composed in paranoia and illness on Saint Helena.",
      "There is the heartbreakingly personal: the red portfolio that once contained his divorce decree from Josephine, the religious marriage certificate that formalized their love and a dressing table designed for the empress. Her famed mirror reflects the ambition and tragedy of their alliance.",
      "\u201cNapoleon was a great lover; his letters that he wrote are full of fervor, of love, of passion,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cIt was also a man who paid attention to his image. Maybe one of the first to be so careful of his image, both public and private.\u201d",
      "The auction's timing is cinematic. The 2023 biopic grossed over $220 million worldwide and reanimated Napoleon\u2019s myth for a TikTok generation hungry for stories of ambition, downfall and doomed romance.",
      "The auction preview is open to the public, running through June 24, with the auction set for June 25.",
      "Not far from the Arc de Triomphe monument dedicated to the general's victories, Djamal Oussedik, 22, shrugged: \u201cEveryone grows up with Napoleon, for better or worse. Some people admire him, others blame him for everything. But to see his hat and his bed, you remember he was a real man, not just a legend.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t escape him, even if you wanted to. He\u2019s part of being French,\" said teacher Laure Mallet, 51.",
      "The exhibition is a spectacle crafted by celebrity designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, famed for dressing Lady Gaga and Pope John Paul II.",
      "\u201cI wanted to electrify history,\u201d Castelbajac said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a mausoleum, it\u2019s a pop culture installation. Today\u2019s collectors buy a Napoleon artifact the way they\u2019d buy a guitar from Jimi Hendrix. They want a cabinet of curiosities.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s filled the show with fog, hypnotic music and immersive rooms. One is inspired by the camouflage colors of Fontainebleau. Another is anchored by Napoleon\u2019s legendary folding bed. \u201cI create the fog in the entrance of the Sotheby\u2019s building because the elements of nature were an accomplice to Napoleon\u2019s strategy,\u201d the designer said.",
      "Castelbajac, who said his ancestor fought in Napoleon\u2019s Russian campaign, brought a personal touch. \u201cI covered the emperor\u2019s bed in original canvas. You can feel he was just alone, facing all he had built. There\u2019s a ghostly presence.\"",
      "He even created something Napoleon only dreamed of. \u201cNapoleon always wanted a green flag instead of the blue, white, red tricolore of the revolution,\" he said, smiling. \"He never got one. So I made it for Sotheby\u2019s.\u201d",

      "Despite the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle or sharply cut back on U.S. government-run news outlets like Voice of America, two Persian-language services have been called into duty to report on Israel's war with Iran to Iranian audiences",
      "In the early days of Israel's attack on Iran, U.S.-operated Radio Farda, which broadcasts in the Persian language in Iran, debunked a state media report that an Israeli pilot had been shot down and captured.",
      "Its journalism has continued despite the Trump administration's threat to its future, along with a Persian-language television outlet run by Voice of America.",
      "Radio Farda, a branch of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and based in Prague, has continued broadcasting even though its managing editor estimated that more than half of its staff had been furloughed. VOA's Persian staff, ordered to go on administrative leave in March, were suddenly ordered back to work last Friday afternoon.",
      "\u201cWe've been giving information to Iranians minute by minute about the conflict,\u201d said Golnaz Esfandiani, managing editor of Radio Farda. That includes explanatory stories about Iran's nuclear program and short videos posted on social media, she said.",
      "Several Iranians have contacted the radio network to express appreciation for reporting that they do not get on Iranian state media, she said. At the same time, families in Iran of five Radio Farda staff members have been pressured by people in the government who want to see the broadcasts stopped, she said.",
      "Through the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the Trump administration has sought to dismantle or sharply curtail the government-funded outlets that provide news reports to countries where there isn't a tradition of free press. The administration says these services operate with a liberal bias.",
      "Both Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty are fighting the efforts in court.",
      "Employees at Voice of America's Persian service were notified in an email last Friday from Crystal Thomas, USAGM's human resources director, that they were being recalled and needed to report to work immediately.",
      "Kari Lake, who is running USAGM, told Fox News that \u201cwe are ramping up \u2014 as we've always planned to do \u2014 to meet this historic moment.\u201d",
      "One person who got that email was at the office within three hours and worked until midnight, helping to put out a one-hour broadcast, said the employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak to the press. About 50 people have returned to work. Voice of America is banned in Iran, but many of its citizens find ways through the internet to bypass the ban.",
      "Voice of America's broadcasts \u2014 and social media posts \u2014 have become a challenge to produce because the administration has canceled subscriptions to news services like The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse, said a second employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "For the employees, it's a stressful time, putting out urgent news reports without any sense of how long \u2014 or whether \u2014 they will continue to have a job.",
      "\u201cI'm grateful they've brought back our Persian service to continue their role as a trusted voice covering the region for the Iranian people,\u201d said Patsy Widakuswara, VOA's White House correspondent, who is a plaintiff in the court fight to keep the agency alive.",
      "\u201cBut why smash a working system only to cobble it back together when you realize you need it?\u201d Widakuswara asked. \u201cAnd how many crises would it take for them to realize that all VOA language services are important \u2014 before, after and during breaking news?\u201d",
      "During video reports posted online this week, a Voice of America anchor explained where Iranian counterattacks were landing in Israel, and how Iranians were trying to send out information about what is happening through social media.",
      "The danger for a service like VOA, having been off the air and off social media for more than two months, is that Iranian citizens will become accustomed to looking elsewhere for news, said Tom Kent, a media consultant and former president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.",
      "\u201cYou would hope that people would learn from this that international broadcasting cannot be turned on and off like a light bulb,\u201d said Kent, also a former AP editor.",
      "Despite an Israeli airstrike on its headquarters Monday while the Republic of Iran News Network was broadcasting live, the state-run news service is still operating.",
      "Radio Farda has stayed on the air despite cutbacks. It also continues to have access to news services like the AP, but those contracts will expire at the end of the month, Esfandiani said. Three people have been brought back from furlough to help cover the war, she said.",
      "She said she hopes the conflict lets people who question the service's existence know its value.",
      "\u201cIt's an information war, absolutely,\u201d Esfandiani said. \u201cThese countries \u2014 Iran, Russia and China \u2014 would be very happy if we were gone.\u201d",
      "One of the VOA employees called back to work said they have not been told how long it will be for. Despite evidence this week that someone in the administration saw value in what they do, might they still lose their job eventually?",

    "story": [
      "In \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland return to their apocalyptic pandemic with the benefit of now having lived through one",
      "Most movies are lucky to predict one thing. Danny Boyle\u2019s 2002 dystopian thriller \u201c28 Days Later\u201d managed to be on the cutting edge of two trends, albeit rather disparate ones: global pandemic and fleet-footed zombies.",
      "Add in Cillian Murphy, who had his breakout role in that film, and \u201c28 Days Later\u201d was unusually prognostic. While many of us were following the beginnings of the Afghanistan War and \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland were probing the the fragile fabric of society, and the potentially very quick way, indeed, horror might come our way.",
      "Boyle always maintained that his undead \u2014 a far speedier variety of the slow-stepping monsters of George A. Romero\u2019s \u201cThe Night of Living Dad\u201d \u2014 weren\u2019t zombies, at all, but were simply the infected. In that film, and its 2007 sequel \u201c28 Weeks Later\u201d (which Juan Carlos Fresnadillo helmed), the filmmakers have followed the fallout of the so-called rage virus, which emptied London in the first film and brought soon-dashed hopes of the virus\u2019 eradication in the second movie.",
      "Like the virus, the \u201c28 Days Later\u201d franchise has proven tough to beat back. In the new \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d Boyle and Garland return to their apocalyptic pandemic with the benefit of now having lived through one. But recent history plays a surprisingly minor role in this far-from-typical, willfully shambolic, intensely scattershot part three.",
      "The usual trend of franchises is to progressively add gloss and scale. But where other franchises might have gone global, \u201c28 Years Later\u201d has remained in the U.K., now a quarantine region where the infected roam free and survivors \u2014 or at least the ones we follow \u2014 cluster on an island off the northeast of Britain, connected to mainland by only a stone causeway that dips below the water at high tide.",
      "Boyle and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, who innovatively employed digital video in \u201c28 Days Later,\u201d have also turned to iPhones to shoot the majority of the film. Boyle, the \u201cSlumdog Millionaire,\u201d \u201cTrainspotting\u201d filmmaker, is an especially frenetic director to begin with, but \u201c28 Years Later\u201d is frequently gratingly disjointed.",
      "It\u2019s a visual approach that, taken with the story\u2019s tonal extremes, makes \u201c28 Years Later\u201d an often bumpy ride. But even when Boyle\u2019s film struggles to put the pieces together, there\u2019s an admirable resistance to being anything like a cardboard cutout summer movie.",
      "The recent event that hovers over \u201c28 Years Later\u201d is less the COVID-19 pandemic than Brexit. With the virus quarantined on Britain, the country has been severed from the European continent. On the secluded Holy Island, 12-year-old Spike (Alfie Williams, a newcomer with some sweetness and pluck) lives with his hunter father, Jamie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), and bedridden mother, Isla (Jodie Comer).",
      "The scene, with makeshift watchtowers and bows and arrows for weapons, is almost medieval. Jamie, too, feels almost like a knight eager to induct his son into the village\u2019s ways of survival. On Spike\u2019s first trip out off the island, his father \u2014 nauseatingly jocular \u2014 helps him kill his first infected. Back inside the village walls, Jamie celebrates their near scrapes and exaggerates his son\u2019s coolness under pressure. Other developments cause Spike to question the macho world he\u2019s being raised in.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re all lyin\u2019, mum,\u201d he says to his mother.",
      "After hearing of a far-off, supposedly deranged doctor whose constant fires mystify the townspeople, Spike resolves to take his mother to him in hopes of healing her unknown illness. Their encounters along the way are colorful. Ralph Fiennes plays the doctor, orange-colored when they encounter him; Edvin Ryding plays a Swedish NATO soldier whose patrol boat crashed offshore. Meanwhile, Comer is almost comically delusional, frequently calling her son \u201cDaddy.\u201d",
      "And the infected? One development here is that, while some remain Olympic-worthy sprinters, other slothful ones nicknamed \u201cSlow-Lows\u201d crawl around on the ground, rummaging for worms.",
      "Buried in here are some tender reflections on mortality and misguided exceptionalism, and even the hint of those ideas make \u201c28 Years Later\u201d a more thoughtful movie than you\u2019re likely to find at the multiplex this time of year. This is an unusually soulful coming-of-age movie considering the number of spinal cords that get ripped right of bodies.",
      "It's enough to make you admire the stubborn persistence of Boyle in these films, which he's already extending. The already-shot \u201c28 Days Later: The Bone Temple\u201d is coming next near, from director Nia DaCosta, while Boyle hopes \u201c28 Years Later\u201d is the start of trilogy. Infection and rage, it turns out, are just too well suited to our times to stop now.",
      "\u201c28 Years Later,\u201d a Sony Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for strong bloody violence, grisly images, graphic nudity, language and brief sexuality. Running time: 115 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "\u201cYou don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to be around in 20 years,\u201d said the drug dealer-turned-rap legend. \u201cThe streets change fast. But it\u2019s also a safe haven, too, \u2019cause it was like, \u2018OK, well, if it doesn\u2019t work, maybe I can go back.\u2019\u201d",
      "But there would be no need: \u201cLet\u2019s Get It: Thug Motivation 101\u201d was met with monumental success. The album, deemed a classic by critics and fans, detailed the Atlanta rapper\u2019s navigation of the drug trade and street life. It debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 with singles like \u201cSoul Survivor\u201d featuring Akon \u2014 which reached No. 4 on the Hot 100 \u2014 and \u201cGo Crazy,\u201d featuring a Jay-Z verse many consider one of his greatest.",
      "With distinctive ad-libs as memorable as his vivid storytelling, Jeezy displayed his gift of motivation, inspiring a vast cross-section of fans.",
      "\u201cThe music and the words resonated so well because they came from a real place. I wasn\u2019t trying to entertain \u2014 I was trying to reach,\" said the \u201cMy President\u201d rapper, who has built a business empire consisting of real estate and partnerships.",
      "In honor of the album's 20th anniversary, Jeezy is launching his \u201cTM:101 Live\u201d tour on June 27 in Miami, encouraging fans to come sharply dressed for the upscale performances. The Color of Noize Orchestra will back him, along with guest DJ Drama from their acclaimed \u201cTrap or Die\u201d mixtape.",
      "Jeezy spoke with the Associated Press about the album's legacy, social media discourse surrounding him and ex-wife Jeannie Mai, and his infamous snowman shirts that were banned at schools over accusations of promoting drug culture. This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "JEEZY: I just had this feeling that \u2014 if I could just get it out \u2014 that it would be life-changing for me. So, there was a lot of things I was up against at that time and I must say personally, that was probably the most adversity I ever faced. \u2026 I tore my vocal cords because I had polyps on my vocal cords and didn\u2019t know it. And then around the same time, I was hit with Bell\u2019s palsy. And around that time, the album got leaked.",
      "If you\u2019re doing something to change your life and you know that the only other avenues are prison or death, you\u2019re just like, \u201cThis gotta work.\u201d",
      "JEEZY: Samuel L. Jackson told me something a long time ago \u2014 a great friend of mine \u2014 he just said the snowman represents people that were demonized, and it was bigger than me. \u2026 It was this imagery of something that I was inspiring to be. And to know that they would suspend kids from school and keep them from wearing something that would represent that tells me that the message was loud and clear. \u2026 \u201cWe got a people\u2019s champ.\u201d",
      "JEEZY: It\u2019s like a tree: It grows where it\u2019s soft at, not where it is hard. It\u2019s just like over time, leaves fall off, branches fall off but the tree continues to grow.",
      "Everybody don\u2019t have the same vision or goals. And if you allow them, they\u2019ll sink the ship \u2014 or they\u2019ll chop down the tree.",

      "After Latin pop and R&B singer Nezza's viral controversial performance at Dodger Stadium, Dodgers fans have grown frustrated over the team\u2019s lack of vocal support for local immigrant communities impacted by the rise of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enfo...",
      "LOS ANGELES -- As fans removed their caps and stood for the national anthem Saturday night at Dodger Stadium, they were met with a surprising rendition of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d Latin pop and R&B singer Nezza stood in front of the crowd, closed her eyes and belted the song out \u2014 in Spanish.",
      "Her 90-second rendition, and a behind-the-scenes video she shared on social media of team representatives discouraging it beforehand, quickly went viral and have become a flashpoint for Dodgers fans frustrated by the team\u2019s lack of vocal support for immigrant communities impacted by the deportation raids across the U.S., including numerous neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles.",
      "Protests over the arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have captured international attention and mostly been held in areas a short drive from Dodger Stadium.",
      "Nezza says even after the discouragement from the team's representative, she hadn\u2019t yet decided whether to sing in English or Spanish until she walked out onto the field and saw the stands filled with Latino families in Dodger blue.",
      "\u201cThis is my moment to show everyone that I am with them that we have a voice and with everything that\u2019s happening it's not OK. I'm super proud that I did it. No regrets,\u201d the 30-year-old singer told The Associated Press.",
      "The team has yet to make a statement on the record regarding the arrests and raids.",
      "Manager Dave Roberts has said he doesn't know enough about the issue to comment, but Dodgers hitter Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez separately spoke out on Instagram over the weekend.",
      "\u201cI am saddened and infuriated by what\u2019s happening in our country and our city,\u201d he said in a post in English and Spanish. \u201cI cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart. ALL people deserve to be treated with respect, dignity and human rights.\u201d",
      "In her viral TikTok video, Nezza is shown speaking with an off-camera Dodgers employee who tells her, \u201cWe are going to do the song in English today, so I\u2019m not sure if that wasn\u2019t transferred or if that wasn\u2019t relayed.\u201d She\u2019s received an outpouring of support since Saturday from celebrities like Jason Mraz, Kehlani, Chiquis, Ava DuVernay, The Kid Mero, Becky G and more.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t you dare turn your backs on us now. We, as a city, have embraced you and need your support more than ever. Think about who fills up your stadium,\u201d said Becky G, addressing the Dodgers in her Instagram story.",
      "The Spanish-language version Nezza sang, \u201cEl Pend\u00f3n Estrellado,\u201d is the official translation of the national anthem and was commissioned in 1945 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt from Peruvian-American composer Clotilde Arias.",
      "Nezza says her manager immediately received a call from an unidentified Dodgers employee saying their clients were not welcome at the stadium again, but the baseball team said in a statement to the AP: \u201cThere were no consequences or hard feelings from the Dodgers regarding her performance. She was not asked to leave. We would be happy to have her back.\u201d",
      "Dodger Stadium has a long history with immigrant communities in Los Angeles.",
      "Many proudly wear Dodger blue jerseys and merchandise as an extension of their love for the city \u2014 the team still sells special \u201cLos Dodgers\u201d jerseys on its official website \u2014 and attend the stadium\u2019s multiple heritage nights honoring Mexican, Salvadoran, Guatemalan and more immigrant communities, including those from outside Latin America. The Dodgers' fan base is heavily Latino, and the team is among the select few to offer Spanish-language television broadcasts.",
      "The franchise is also frequently praised for its history seeking out diverse talent, including Jackie Robinson (baseball\u2019s first Black player), Fernando Valenzuela (a Mexican icon who transcended baseball) and Chan Ho Park (the first Korean in the big leagues).",
      "But the relationship is not without tension, with some Mexican American and Latino residents resentful of the team\u2019s forceful eviction of Latino families in the 1950s to build Dodger Stadium in what is popularly known as Chavez Ravine.",
      "Fans have since called for a boycott online, while others say they\u2019d be willing to return if the team spoke out.",
      "\u201cWe love you. You\u2019ve been so much a big part of our lives. \u2026 We would like to understand that you love us just the same. Or are we just money to you?\u201d asked Power 106's Brown Bag Mornings host Letty Peniche in an Instagram video.",
      "Los Angeles resident Alora Murray is considering a temporary boycott.",
      "\u201cNobody is messing around about this,\u201d said Murray. \u201cLos Angeles is built upon the Dodgers. For them to not kind of be with us, I feel like us boycotting or not going to games will send that message.\u201d",
      "Many in the Latino community have been sharing videos of stadium security confronting fans who have political signs or messages on their clothing.",
      "Longtime Dodger fan Emeli Avalos says she doesn\u2019t believe the team is apolitical since they released a statement to condemn Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s really about staying out of politics, then why do they support that? But when people down the street from them are getting taken, kidnapped, why do they stay silent?\u201d she said.",
      "Avalos attended Pride Night on June 13 wearing a shirt that said \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d on the front and \u201cFDT\u201d \u2014 an acronym for an expletive directed at President Donald Trump \u2014 on the back. In a popular TikTok video, Avalos is seen speaking with Dodgers security. She says she thought she was going to be asked to leave but was instead asked to cover the back of her shirt with her jersey.",
      "\u201cThey told me, \u2018The front is fine, you just gotta cover the back,\u2019\u201d said Avalos, who said she will not be returning to the stadium.",
      "Another video of a fan being confronted by security for holding a banner with \u201cICE\u201d crossed out circulated online over the weekend, furthering criticism of the team.",
      "When asked about the incidents, a Dodgers spokesperson pointed to the team's stadium guidelines, which state the team \u201cdoes not allow signs or banners of any kind.\u201d Also prohibited is any attire the Dodgers deem \u2014 at their sole discretion \u2014 to be obscene, profane, vulgar, indecent, violent, threatening, abusive or prejudiced against any individual or group.",
      "Nezza does not think she will return to the stadium, despite the Dodgers' statement, but says she hopes her performance will inspire others to use their voice and speak out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just shown me like how much power there is in the Latin community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe gotta be the voice right now.\u201d",

      "North Carolina alt-country indie rock band Wednesday is an exemplar in evocative songwriting",
      "NEW YORK -- A pit bull puppy peeing off a balcony. Mounted antlers in the kitchen on a crooked nail. Pink boiled eggs stay afloat in the brine. For its dedicated audience, the North Carolina alt-country-meets-indie rock band Wednesday is an exemplar in evocative songwriting, where whole worlds are found in short lyrical lines.",
      "And that says nothing of what they sound like. The most exciting band in contemporary indie rock is informed by Drive-By Truckers and Pavement in equal measure, a distinctive sonic fabric of lap steel, guitar fuzz, folksy and jagged vocals.",
      "On Sept. 19, they will release their sixth and most ambitious full-length, \u201cBleeds.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy songwriting is just better on this album,\u201d Wednesday's singer and songwriter Karly Hartzman explains. \u201cThings are said more succinctly ... the immediacy of these songs was the main growth.\u201d",
      "Wednesday began as Hartzman's solo project, evidenced in 2018's sweet-sounding \u201cyep definitely.\u201d They became a full band on 2020's \u201cI Was Trying to Describe You to Someone,\u201d a dive into guitar distortions, and 2021's \u201cTwin Plagues,\u201d a further refinement of their \u201ccreek rock\u201d sound. The lineup consists of Hartzman, bassist Margo Schulz, lap steel player Xandy Chelmis, guitarist Jake Lenderman and drummer Alan Miller. Some also tour with Lenderman's solo project, MJ Lenderman. (Hartzman and Lenderman previously dated.)",
      "Wednesday's last album, the narrative \u201cRat Saw God,\u201d was named one of the best albums of 2023 by The Associated Press partially for its uncanny ability to dive into the particularities and complications of Southern identity. \u201cBleeds\u201d sharpens those tools.",
      "\u201cOriginally, I was going to call it \u2018Carolina Girl\u2019 but my bandmates did not like that,'\u201d Hartzman jokes.",
      "\u201cBleeds\u201d comes from the explosive opening track, \u201cReality TV Argument Bleeds.\u201d",
      "She likes how the band name and album title sound together \u2014 \u201c'Wednesday Bleeds,' which I feel like I do, when I play music ... I'm almost, in a way, bloodletting and exorcising a demon.\u201d",
      "Lyrically, \u201cBleeds\u201d features some of Wednesday's best work \u2014 even in the revisiting of an older song, \u201cPhish Pepsi,\u201d that hilariously references both the jam band and the most disturbing movie released in 2010 \u2014 a kind of specificity born from Hartzman's writing practices. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she and Lenderman \u201cwrote 20 lines of writing each day,\u201d a practice adopted from Silver Jews' David Berman. She's also a documentarian of memory: She takes notes of things her friends say and images that are affecting, to later collage them together in songs.",
      "\u201cThe well never runs dry,\u201d Hartzman says. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve admitted not everything can come from inside. I need to look outward outside of myself for inspiration.\u201d",
      "Remembering, she says, \u201cis the goal for most of the (expletive) I do. ... I care. I want stories to persist.\u201d",
      "\u201cBleeds\u201d manages cohesion across a variance of sound. \u201cWasp\u201d is hard-core catharsis; lead single \u201cElderberry Wine\u201d drops guitar noise for shimmery, fermented country. \u201cWound Up Here (By Holding On),\u201d which references the Appalachian poet Evan Gray, is a pretty indie rock track about a hometown hero who drowns.",
      "The quietest moment on the album, the plucked \u201cThe Way Love Goes,\u201d was written as \u201ca love song for Jake when we were still together. \u2018Elderberry Wine\u2019 as well.'\u201d Hartzman explains. \u201c\u2018Elderberry Wine\u2019 is kind of talking about me noticing slight changes in a relationship.\u201d",
      "These are not breakup songs; they exist right before the point of dissolution. \u201cSweet song is a long con / I drove ya to the airport with the E-brake on,\u201d she sings on the latter.",
      "Later: \u201cSometimes in my head I give up and / Flip the board completely.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m understanding how sound creates emotion. That\u2019s what I\u2019m learning over time,\u201d Hartzman says of her musical growth. \u201cI\u2019m also listening to more music with every year that passes. So, my understanding of what\u2019s possible, or what I can be inspired by, shifts.\u201d",
      "A number of the songs pull from childhood memory, as they always have across Wednesday's discography. \u201cI think about growing up a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I think of trying to tell ... a story that\u2019s vivid and intense, that\u2019s just the easiest time in my life, where everything felt vivid and intense.\u201d",
      "Longtime fans of the band will find recurring themes and characters from past songs. For example, \u201cGary's\u201d from their 2021 album returns as the \u201cBleeds\u201d closer in \u201cGary\u2019s II,\u201d where he gets into a bar fight.",
      "\u201cIn a way, I\u2019m writing the same songs over and over, but I\u2019m just trying to make them better,\u201d she says.",
      "There is always more humanity to excavate. And often, those emotions, \u201cthey aren't done with you,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey're not letting you go.\u201d",
      "So, let the bloodletting begin.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jeff Ross, a comedian known for hosting brutal roasts of celebrities, is coming to Broadway this summer with a one-man autobiographical show that will offer fans a softer, more intimate side.",
      "\u201cThe hard part for me is letting go of a bit of my armor \u2014 of my roastmaster persona \u2014 and letting the audience get to me so that I can then get them,\u201d he tells The Associated Press ahead of a formal announcement Wednesday. \u201cI think it\u2019s healthy to change it up and surprise people.\u201d",
      "\u201cJeff Ross: Take a Banana for the Ride\u201d will play the Nederlander Theatre starting Aug. 5 for an eight-week engagement through Sept. 29.",
      "The show will explore Ross' close relatives, especially his grandfather on his mother's side \u2014 Ross calls him \u201cthe hero of my childhood\u201d \u2014 who stepped up after the comedian's parents died when he was a teenager.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very autobiographical, but it\u2019s also not really about just me. It\u2019s about all of us. When I talk about my uncle or my mom, I want you to see your uncle and your mom in the stories. That\u2019s really important to me,\u201d Ross says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very joyful. It kind of takes the stigma out of loss and sickness and lets people know that they\u2019re going to be OK no matter what happens.\u201d",
      "The title comes from the days when Ross was living with his grandfather in New Jersey. The younger man would take his grandfather to doctor visits or visit him in the hospital during the day and at night go into New York for open-mic nights.",
      "\u201cMy grandfather would always give me money for the bus and a banana, and he\u2019d say, \u2018Take a banana for the ride.\u2019 I reluctantly took it, and more often than not, I\u2019d be stuck in traffic, or I\u2019d get low blood sugar, and that banana would be a lifesaver,\u201d says Ross.",
      "\u201cBut it was really his way of saying, \u2018Be ready for anything\u2019 and also, \u2018I can\u2019t go with you but I\u2019m there with you in spirit.\u2019 So it was an emotional thing, it was a practical thing. It\u2019s something that I still do.\u201d",
      "Ross is known as \u201cThe Roastmaster General\u201d for his incendiary takedowns of Justin Bieber, Rob Lowe, Alec Baldwin and Tom Brady, among many others.",
      "The seeds for \u201cJeff Ross: Take a Banana for the Ride\u201d were planted in the mid-1990s when Ross gathered jokes and stories about his grandfather for an hourlong set. But digging up the past proved too much.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t sustain it emotionally. It was just too much for me as a 30-year-old guy,\u201d Ross says. \u201cBut now, 30 years later, I can dig in and look back and add a layer of experience over it all.\u201d",
      "He was spurred on in large part to losing three comedic friends \u2014 Bob Saget, Gilbert Gottfried and Norm Macdonald \u2014 within eight months. \u201cThat motivated me to look back at the old show from decades earlier and rewrite it completely for my current brain and my current skill set.\u201d",
      "Ross will be the latest comedian to come to Broadway, following John Mulaney, Mike Birbiglia, Alex Edelman, Amy Schumer, Keegan-Michael Key, Rachel Dratch, Billy Crystal and Colin Quinn. Bill Burr made his Broadway debut this year in a revival of \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross.\u201d",
      "Ross reaches back even further. His aunt took him to see Jackie Mason\u2019s \u201cThe World According to Me!\u201d in the 1980s, and the young comedian was floored by the comedian's captivating set.",
      "\u201cIt was elegant, but it was also punk rock because he was being bawdy and naughty and hilarious and saying taboo things and it really, really stayed with me for a long, long time.\u201d",

      "Fifty years after \u201cJaws\u201d sunk its teeth into us, we\u2019re still admiring the bite mark",
      "NEW YORK -- Fifty years after \u201cJaws\u201d sunk its teeth into us, we\u2019re still admiring the bite mark.",
      "Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1975 film, his second feature, left such a imprint on culture and Hollywood that barely any trip to the movies, let alone to the beach, has been the same since.",
      "Few films have been more perfectly suited to their time and place than \u201cJaws,\u201d which half a century ago unspooled across the country in a then-novel wide release accompanied by Universal Pictures' opening-weekend publicity blitz. \u201cJaws\u201d wasn\u2019t quite the first movie to try to gobble up moviegoers whole, in one mouthful (a few years earlier, \u201cThe Godfather\u201d more or less tried it), but \u201cJaws\u201d established \u2014 and still in many ways defines \u2014 the summer movie.",
      "That puts \u201cJaws\u201d at the birth of a trend that has since consumed Hollywood: the blockbuster era. When it launched in 409 theaters on June 20, 1975, and grossed a then-record $7.9 million in its first days, \u201cJaws\u201d set the template that\u2019s been followed ever-after by every action movie, superhero flick or dinosaur film that\u2019s tried to go big in the summer \u2014 a sleepy time in theaters before \u201cJaws\u201d came around.",
      "And yet the \u201cJaws\u201d legacy is so much more than being Hollywood\u2019s ur-text blockbuster. It\u2019s not possible to, 50 years later, watch Spielberg\u2019s film and see nothing but the beginning of a box-office bonanza, or the paler fish it\u2019s inspired. It\u2019s just too good a movie \u2014 and too much unlike so many wannabes since \u2013\u2014 to be merely groundbreaking. It\u2019s a masterpiece in its own right.",
      "\u201cIt supercharged the language of cinema,\u201d the filmmaker Robert Zemeckis says in the upcoming documentary \u201cJaws @ 50: The Definitive Inside Story,\u201d premiering July 10 on National Geographic.",
      "That documentary, with Spielberg\u2019s participation, is just a small part of the festivities that have accompanied the movie's anniversary. Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where \u201cJaws\u201d was shot, is hosting everything from concerts to \u201cJaws\u201d-themed dog dress-ups. \u201cJaws,\u201d itself, is streaming on Peacock through July 14, along with a prime-time airing Friday on NBC, with an intro from Spielberg. The \u201cJaws\u201d anniversary feels almost more like a national holiday \u2014 and appropriately so.",
      "But if \u201cJaws\u201d is one of the most influential movies ever made, Hollywood hasn't always drawn the right lessons from it. \u201cWe need a bigger boat\u201d has perhaps been taken too literally in movies that have leaned too much on scale and spectacle, when neither of those things really had much to do with the brilliance of Spielberg\u2019s classic.",
      "For the film\u2019s 50th anniversary, we looked at some of the things today's Hollywood could learn from \u201cJaws\" 50 years later.",
      "Every time I rewatch \u201cJaws\u201d \u2014 which I highly recommend doing on some projected screen, even a bedsheet, and preferably with an ocean nearby \u2014 I marvel at how much it gets from its Martha\u2019s Vineyard setting.",
      "Where U.S.-made film productions are shot has been a hot button issue lately. Various incentives often determine movie shooting locations, with set dressings, or CGI, filling in the rest. But \u201cJaws\u201d shows you just how much more than tax credits you can get from a locale.",
      "Spielberg was convinced the adaptation of Peter Benchley\u2019s novel \u2014 inspired by Benchley\u2019s childhood summers on Nantucket \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be done in soundstages. After looking up and down the Atlantic coast, he settled on Nantucket\u2019s neighboring island. Like his first film, the Mojave Desert-set \u201cDuel,\u201d Spielberg wanted his mechanized shark to swim in a real, definable place.",
      "\u201cI felt the same way about \u2018Jaws,\u2019\u201d Spielberg says in the documentary. \u201cI wanted to go to the natural environment so there was some kind of verisimilitude. So it needed to be in the ocean, out to sea.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t easy. The budget for \u201cJaws\u201d nearly tripled to $9 million and the shoot extended from 55 to 159 days. Spielberg would never again be under financial pressure on a picture, but the tortured \u201cJaws\u201d production put him under a microscope. An AP report from 1975 began: \u201cIt is news when a 26-year-old film director goes $2 million over budget and two and a half months over schedule and manages to avoid getting fired.\u201d",
      "More than any other time in his career, Spielberg fretted.",
      "\u201c\u2018Jaws\u2019 was my Vietnam,\u201d he told Richard Schickel. \u201cIt was basically naive people against nature and nature beat us every day.\u201d",
      "It also infused every inch of the frame with smalltown New England flavor in the way that no soundstage, or CGI, ever could.",
      "When Spielberg was ready to start filming, his star attraction wasn\u2019t. The mechanized shark, nicknamed \u201cBruce\u201d after the director\u2019s attorney, suffered frequent failures that forced Spielberg to find different approaches to shooting his shark scenes early in the film.",
      "\u201cJaws\u201d instead became, to Spielberg, a kind of homage to Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cPsycho.\u201d The suspense came less from the shark than the fear of the unknown and that spine-tingling question: What\u2019s in the water? Spielberg, with the significant aid of John Williams\u2019 instantly iconic score, delayed the appearance of his Great White until well into the film.",
      "\u201cThe visual ellipsis,\u201d the critic Molly Haskell wrote, \u201ccreated far greater menace and terror, as the shark is nowhere and everywhere.\u201d",
      "Spielberg once estimated that Bruce\u2019s mechanical delays added $175 million to the movie\u2019s box office. On its initial run, \u201cJaws\u201d grossed $260.7 million domestically in 1975. Adjusted for inflation, that\u2019s about $1.5 billion. Nowadays, the shark would almost certainly be done, like most movie creatures, with computer animation. But \u201cJaws\u201d showed that often the most powerful source of dread is our imagination.",
      "This is the time of year when the fate of the world often hangs in the balance. All manner of summer movies have had no bones about destroying cities for a mere plot point. Yet for all its terror, \u201cJaws\" features only a handful of deaths. All of its drama is human-scaled. Compared to more swaggering blockbusters today, \u201cJaws\u201d would be considered a modest, mid-budget movie.",
      "That\u2019s partially why you have to almost remind yourself that the movie has only three main characters in Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw). Casting director Sherry Rhodes peopled the cast with locals from the island, many of whom inject the film with little moments of day-to-day humanity. \u201cJaws,\u201d in that way, feels more like a community than a cast.",
      "On the one hand, \u201cJaws\u201d had little to do directly with its times. The Vietnam War had just ended. Watergate had just led to the resignation of President Nixon. The heart-stopping story of a shark off the Massachusetts shoreline promised escapism.",
      "Yet \u201cJaws\u201d has endured as a parable of capitalism, pulled out time and time again to illustrate those endlessly repeating clashes of cash versus social safety.",
      "\u201cAmity is a summer town,\u201d says Amity\u2019s mayor, Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) in the film. \u201cWe need summer dollars.\u201d",
      "The shark gets the theme song and the movie poster, but the real villain of \u201cJaws\u201d wears a pinstripe suit and smiles for the cameras. \u201cAs you can see, it\u2019s a beautiful day and the beaches are open,\u201d he says. More than the predator in the ocean, he, and the town, feast on human flesh.",
      "There are boatloads of movies \u2014 including the three sequels that followed after \u2014 that have tried in vain to capture some of the magic of \u201cJaws.\u201d But what happened in June 1975, let alone on Martha\u2019s Vineyard the year before, isn\u2019t repeatable. Even the greatest movies are products of a thousand small miracles. That title? Benchley came up with it minutes before going to print. The iconic poster came from Roger Kastel's painting for the book. Scheider, for instance, learned about the movie by overhearing Spielberg at a party. Williams relied on just two notes for one of the most widely known film scores in movie history.",
      "But no ingredient mattered more on \u201cJaws\u201d than the man behind the camera. Filmmaking talents like Spielberg come around maybe a couple times a century, and in \u201cJaws,\u201d he emerged, spectacularly. What's maybe most striking about \u201cJaws\u201d 50 years later is how much it still doesn't look like anything else.",
      "___",
      "Jake Coyle has been writing about movies for the AP since 2013. He's seen \u201cJaws\u201d at least a dozen times, and screened it for his kids when they were debatably too young for it.",

      "Bruce Springsteen has been deliberate in his career, careful with his album releases to keep a narrative flow and not repeat himself",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Bruce Springsteen's new project, \u201cTracks II: The Lost Albums,\u201d is entirely about that age-old question: What if?",
      "The box set, out June 27, comprises seven albums encompassing the period between 1983 and 2018, all but one he prepared to release in its time but ultimately shelved. Now that he's decided to drop them simultaneously, they offer a fascinating alternative story of his musical life.",
      "Building on its predecessor \u201cTracks,\u201d 1998's four-disc, 66-song collection of unreleased material, there are 83 songs here. While some slipped out on other projects \u2014 \u201cMy Hometown\u201d and \u201cSecret Garden\u201d among them \u2014 the vast majority hadn't been heard publicly. This is all fully completed material, not half-baked or half-finished outtakes. It's not unusual for artists to leave songs \u2014 or even full-lengths \u2014 on the cutting-room floor, but multiple entire albums? Springsteen explains that he's taken care releasing albums, looking to build a narrative arc for his career, and believes this approach has served him well.",
      "Perhaps as a result, the most interesting work on \u201cTracks II\u201d comes when he stretches out and explores pathways not in his wheelhouse: countrypolitan Bruce, border-town Bruce, Burt Bacharach-inspired Bruce and a set of synthesizer-based songs modeled after his Oscar-winning \u201cStreets of Philadelphia.\u201d Oddly, the one disc of strays cobbled together that feels most like an E Street Band record is the least compelling.",
      "Since these are seven distinct albums, it's worth evaluating them that way.",
      "\u201cLA Garage Sessions '83\u201d captures Springsteen working virtually alone at a home in the Hollywood Hills. It was squarely in between his \u201cNebraska\u201d and \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d albums, and he seems torn between those two approaches. There are character studies here, and more lighthearted fare like \u201cLittle Girl Like You,\u201d with a single man yearning to settle down. The most striking cut is \u201cThe Klansman,\u201d about a boy and his racist father, yet it cries out for more development. Ultimately, Springsteen chose the right albums to release at the time.",
      "The song \u201cStreets of Philadelphia\u201d was a genuine departure musically, and Springsteen decided to make an album in the same vein, with synthesizers and drum loops the dominant elements. If released in the early 1990s, this would have been the most contemporary-sounding disc of his career, with atmospherics that occasionally recall U2. Springsteen pulled it at the last minute, reasoning that the stories of doomed relationships \u2014 sample lyric: \u201cWe loved each other like a disease\u201d \u2014 was too much like \u201cTunnel of Love.\u201d",
      "At the same time he recorded \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad\u201d in 1995, Springsteen also convened a country band steered by pedal steel player Marty Rifkin. Their work was terrific, led by the one-two punch of \u201cRepo Man\u201d and the Johnny Rivers cover, \u201cPoor Side of Town.\u201d The title cut to a disc he calls \u201cSomewhere North of Nashville\u201d escaped into the public some two decades later. Since the somber \u201cJoad\u201d won a Grammy, who are we to second-guess his choice of what to put out? \u201cNashville,\u201d though, is a rollicking good time.",
      "\u201cInyo\u201d is similar to \u201cJoad\u201d and \u201cDevils & Dust,\u201d mostly acoustic-based narratives, here many of them stories of the Southwest. Springsteen even appropriately brings in mariachi bands for \u201cAdelita\u201d and \u201cThe Lost Charro.\u201d Soozie Tyrell's violin is notable, particularly on the majestic \u201cWhen I Build My Beautiful House.\u201d We're guessing that Springsteen may have considered \u201cInyo\u201d one album too many in the same style, but it's still strong work.",
      "At one point Springsteen considered making \u201cWestern Stars,\u201d his salute to early 1970s California songwriting, a double album. When he didn't, the songs on \u201cTwilight Hours\u201d were left behind. Here Bacharach is the primary influence, and this almost feels like Elvis Costello's collaboration with Burt, only without him (and is the lyric \u201cGod give me strength\u201d a hat-tip to that project?). The crooning Bruce of \u201cSunday Love\u201d is spellbinding, maybe the box's best song. \u201cLonely Town\u201d sits at the intersection of Bacharach and Roy Orbison, while \u201cDinner at Eight\u201d is a lovely sum-up. \u201cTwilight Hours\u201d may startle Springsteen fans \u2014 and impress them, too.",
      "The workmanlike songs on \u201cFaithless\u201d were written on commission in two weeks, the soundtrack to a movie that was never made. It's a good bet it would have been a moody Western.",
      "When Springsteen duels with Tom Morello on the song \u201cAnother Thin Line,\u201d you realize how little you've heard his electric guitar on \u201cTracks II.\u201d The album \u201cPerfect World\u201d is the one here made up of leftovers from different periods, with the greatest E Street Band participation. Here's the deal, though: Most good E Street Band material has already been released. The best left behind for this disc is \u201cYou Lifted Me Up,\u201d with minimalist lyrics and a vocal collaboration with Patti Scialfa and Steve Van Zandt.",
      "The box gives Springsteen completists plenty to mull over, and you can question whether these \u201clost discs\u201d would get more attention released separately instead of together. If it's too much, he's releasing a 20-song set of its highlights.",

      "Competitive eater Joey \u201cJaws\u201d Chestnut announced Monday he will return to compete in this year's Nathan\u2019s Famous Fourth of July hot dog eating contest after skipping last year's gastronomic battle for the coveted Mustard Belt.",
      "\u201cThis event means the world to me,\u201d Chestnut, 41, said in a message posted on X. \u201cIt\u2019s a cherished tradition, a celebration of American culture, and a huge part of my life.\u201d",
      "It will mark the 20th appearance for the Indiana eater at the Coney Island contest.",
      "Last year, Major League Eating event organizer George Shea said Chestnut, who has won the 10-minute eat-a-thon 16 times, would not be participating due to a contract dispute. Chestnut had struck a deal with a competing brand, the plant-based meat company Impossible Foods.",
      "In a phone interview Monday, the competitive eater made it clear he never appeared in any commercials for the company's vegan hot dogs and that Nathan's is the only hot dog company he has worked with. But Chestnut acknowledged he \u201cshould have made that more clear with Nathan\u2019s.\"",
      "\u201cThere was a little bit of communication that we could have improved on last year,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I, yeah, I think we figured it out. It took a little bit of finessing.\u201d",
      "Chestnut is still working with Impossible Foods and said \u201cclarifications\u201d have been made to his respective contracts.",
      "Richard Shea, president of Major League Eating, said he did not want to rehash what happened last year because he found it \u201cdispiriting,\u201d but said he\u2019s happy \u201ceverything is resolved\u201d now.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s the return of the greatest competitive eater of all time to the biggest competitive eating event of all time. So I don\u2019t think it gets much bigger in any sport,\u201d Shea said. \u201cI mean, this guy is the greatest performer we\u2019ve ever seen in Coney Island and in competitive eating.\u201d",
      "Chestnut said he heard from fans over the past year who wanted him to return to the Coney Island event, which is broadcast live on ESPN and even shown overseas.",
      "Last year, he opted to compete against soldiers in Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas, in a 5-minute hot dog eating contest. Back in New York, Patrick Bertoletti gobbled up 58 hot dogs to win his first men\u2019s title while defending champion Miki Sudo won her 10th title in the women's division, downing a record 51 links.",
      "Chestnut holds the world record of eating 76 hot dogs.",
      "\u201cOver the last year, I ran into a lot of people who said that it wasn\u2019t the same without me. And I told many people that I was going to work really hard to make sure I got back there,\u201d Chestnut said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really happy that Nathan\u2019s and Major League Eating, we were able all to figure it out.\u201d",
      "Chestnut said he been prepping for the big event and has a couple practice sessions left before the July Fourth holiday.",
      "\u201cMy body's in tune right now,\u201d he said, explaining how he has to build tolerance for consuming so many hot dogs and \u201cget all those muscles used to working together.\u201d He likened the process to boxer getting in practice rounds before a big fight.",
      "Chestnut made it clear his business relationship with Impossible Foods does not mean he has become a vegan, an assumption he said some fans made last year. Chestnut said he was surprised by the \u201cweird blowback\u201d he received about it, explaining he eats a plant-based diet during his recovery from competitive eating events.",
      "\u201cI love meat. I\u2019m going to continue to eat meat. But when I recover from a contest, I have to eat super clean in order to get my body to try to get back to normal,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t eat pounds of meat every day.\u201d",

      "The Louvre Museum has failed to open on time Monday, leaving thousands of visitors stuck in long, unmoving lines",
      "PARIS -- The Louvre, the world\u2019s most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, has withstood war, terror, and pandemic \u2014 but on Monday, it was brought to a halt by its own striking staff, who say the institution is crumbling under the weight of mass tourism.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization\u2019s greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "Thousands of stranded and confused visitors, tickets in hand, were corralled into unmoving lines by I.M. Pei's glass pyramid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mona Lisa moan out here,\u201d said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. \u201cThousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\u201d",
      "The Louvre has become a symbol of tourism pushed to its limits. As hotspots from Venice to the Acropolis race to curb crowds, the world\u2019s most iconic museum, visited by millions, is hitting a breaking point of its own.",
      "Just a day earlier, coordinated anti-tourism protests swept across southern Europe. Thousands rallied in Mallorca, Venice, Lisbon and beyond, denouncing an economic model they say displaces locals and erodes city life. In Barcelona, activists sprayed tourists with water pistols \u2014 a theatrical bid to \u201ccool down\u201d runaway tourism.",
      "The Louvre's spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \u201cuntenable\u201d working conditions.",
      "It\u2019s rare for the Louvre to close its doors. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds.",
      "What's more, the disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle.",
      "But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait six years for help,\u201d said Sarah Sefian, a front-of-house gallery attendant and visitor services agent. \u201cOur teams are under pressure now. It\u2019s not just about the art \u2014 it\u2019s about the people protecting it.\u201d",
      "At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience.",
      "Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum\u2019s largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t see a painting,\u201d said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \u201cYou see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you\u2019re pushed out.\u201d",
      "Macron\u2019s renovation blueprint, dubbed the \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "\u201cConditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,\u201d Macron said in January.",
      "But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the 700 million to 800 million-euro ($730 million to $834 million) renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre\u2019s annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade \u2014 even as visitor numbers soared.",
      "\u201cWe take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,\u201d Sefian said, \u201cbut when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.\u201d",
      "While many striking staff plan to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited \u201cmasterpiece route\u201d for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid\u2019s greenhouse effect.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \u201cno longer watertight,\u201d that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \u201ca physical ordeal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,\u201d Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon.",
      "The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre\u2019s Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",
      "But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan.",
      "Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo \u2014 neither fully funded nor fully functional.",
      "President Macron, who delivered his 2017 election victory speech at the Louvre and showcased it during the 2024 Paris Olympics, has promised a safer, more modern museum by the end of the decade.",
      "Until then, France\u2019s greatest cultural treasure \u2014 and the millions who flock to see it \u2014 remain caught between the cracks.",

      "Bicycles have long been ubiquitous, and many families tend to have one. Cultural norms in northern Uganda don\u2019t prohibit women from riding. While the roads in Lira town are paved, dirt paths lead into the heart of the district where farming is the main economic activity.",

      "A Brazilian woman who says she became pregnant after being raped in March should have been granted access to a legal abortion",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- A 27-year-old Brazilian woman, who said she became pregnant after being raped in March during Carnival in Brasilia, should have been granted access to a legal abortion. But when she sought to terminate the pregnancy at a hospital around a month later, she was told she needed a police report to access the service, despite it not being a legal requirement.",
      "She decided to abort at home with medication she bought on the black market, with only a few friends on site to help.",
      "\u201cI fainted several times because of the pain. I was terrified I was going to die,\u201d she said.",
      "The Associated Press does not identify people without their permission if they say they have been sexually assaulted.",
      "In Brazil, abortion is legally restricted to cases of rape, life-threatening risks to the pregnant woman or if the fetus has no functioning brain. Theoretically, when a pregnancy results from sexual violence, the victim\u2019s word should suffice for access to the procedure.",
      "\u201cThe law doesn\u2019t require judicial authorization or anything like that,\u201d explained Ivanilda Figueiredo, a professor of law at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cA woman seeking an abortion recounts the situation to a multi-disciplinary team at the healthcare clinic and, in theory, that should be enough.\u201d",
      "In practice, however, advocates, activists and health experts say women encounter significant barriers to ending a pregnancy even under the limited conditions provided for by the law. This is due to factors including lack of facilities, disparities between clinic protocols and even resistance from medical personnel.",
      "\u201cHealthcare professionals, citing religious or moral convictions, often refuse to provide legal abortions, even when working in clinics authorized to perform them,\u201d said Carla de Castro Gomes, a sociologist who studies abortion and associate researcher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.",
      "Women in Brazil also face geographical barriers to legal abortions. Only 290 facilities in a mere 3.6% of municipalities around the country of approximately 213 million people provide the service, according to a 2021 study from scientific journal Reports in Public Health.",
      "In June 2022, four nonprofits filed a legal challenge with the Supreme Court, arguing that restrictions on abortion access violate women\u2019s constitutional rights. The case is currently under review.",
      "A 35-year-old cashier from a small city in the interior of Rio de Janeiro state also said she became pregnant as a result of a rape. But, unlike the woman in Brasilia, she chose to pursue an abortion through legal means, fearing the risks that come with a clandestine procedure.",
      "Although Brazil\u2019s Health Ministry mandates that, in the case of a pregnancy resulting from rape, healthcare professionals must present women with their rights and support them in their decision, the woman said a hospital committee refused to terminate the pregnancy. They claimed she was too far along, despite Brazilian law not stipulating a time limit for such procedures.",
      "She eventually found help through the Sao Paulo-based Women Alive Project, a nonprofit specializing in helping victims of sexual violence access legal abortions. The organization helped her locate a hospital in another state, an 18-hour drive, willing to carry out the procedure.",
      "Thanks to a fundraising campaign, the woman was able to travel and undergo the operation at 30 weeks of pregnancy in late April.",
      "\u201cWe are already victims of violence and are forced to suffer even more,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a right guaranteed by law, but unfortunately still seen as taboo.\u201d",
      "Brazil\u2019s abortion laws are among the most constrictive in Latin America, where several countries \u2014 including Mexico, Argentina and Colombia \u2014 have enacted sweeping reforms to legalize or broadly decriminalize abortion.",
      "This legislative environment is exacerbated by a political landscape in which far-right politicians, supported by Catholic and Evangelical voters who make up a majority in the country, regularly seek to further restrict the limited provisions within the country's penal code.",
      "In 2020, the government of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro issued an ordinance requiring doctors to report rape victims seeking abortions to the police. Current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva revoked the measure in his first month in office in 2023.",
      "But the measure left lasting effects.",
      "\u201cThese changes end up generating a lot of legal uncertainty among health professionals, who fear prosecution for performing legal abortions,\u201d Castro Gomes said.",
      "Last year, conservative lawmaker S\u00f3stenes Cavalcante proposed a bill to equate the termination of a pregnancy after 22 weeks with homicide, sparking widespread protests by feminist groups across Brazil. The protests ultimately led to the proposal being shelved.",
      "But in November, a committee of the Chamber of Deputies approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would effectively outlaw all abortions by determining the \u201cinviolability of the right to life from conception.\u201d The bill is currently on hold, awaiting the formation of a commission.",
      "Earlier this month, Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes, a Lula ally, came under fire after sanctioning a bill mandating anti-abortion messages on posters in municipal hospitals and other health establishments.",
      "Advocates say access to abortion highlights significant disparities: women with financial means dodge legal restrictions by traveling abroad for the procedure, while children, poor women and Black women face greater obstacles.",
      "According to the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety, 61.6% of the 83,988 rape victims in 2023 were under the age of 14. A statistical analysis that year by investigative outlet The Intercept estimated less than 4% of girls aged 10 to 14 who became pregnant as a result of rape accessed a legal abortion between 2015 and 2020.",
      "In Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Mare favela, one of the city\u2019s largest low-income communities, the nonprofit Networks of Mare\u2019s House of Women provides women with information regarding their reproductive rights, including legal provisions for abortions.",
      "It was there, during a recent workshop, that Karina Braga de Souza, a 41-year-old mother of five, found out abortion is legal in certain cases in Brazil.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have access (to information). Doctors don\u2019t tell you,\u201d she said.",
      "Feminist groups in Brazil are campaigning at a federal level for enhanced access to legal abortion services.",
      "Last year, \u201cA Child Is Not a Mother,\u201d a campaign by feminist groups, successfully advocated for the National Council for the Rights of Children and Adolescents to adopt a resolution detailing how to handle cases of pregnant child rape victims. The body, jointly made up of government ministries and civil society organizations, approved the resolution by a slim majority in December.",
      "Brazilian activists also are seeking to improve access to abortion by forging links with organizations abroad.",
      "In May, members of feminist groups in Brazil including Neither in Prison, Nor Dead and Criola met with a delegation of mostly Black U.S. state legislators. The meeting, organized by the Washington, D.C.-based Women\u2019s Equality Center, aimed to foster collaboration on strategies to defend reproductive rights, especially in light of the U.S. Supreme Court 2022 decision to strip away the constitutional right to abortion.",
      "In the meantime, the consequences for women who struggle to access their rights run deep.",
      "The woman in Brasilia who underwent an abortion at home said she is coping thanks to therapy and the support of other women, but has been traumatized by recent events.",
      "By being denied access to a legal abortion, \u201cour bodies feel much more pain than they should,\u201d she said. \u201cWhenever I remember, I feel very angry.\u201d",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisers meet next week, but their agenda suggests they'll skip some expected topics \u2014 including a vote on COVID-19 shots \u2014 while taking up a longtime target of anti-vaccine groups.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes recommendations on how to use the nation's vaccines, setting a schedule for children's vaccines as well as advice for adult shots. Last week, Kennedy abruptly dismissed the existing 17-member expert panel and handpicked eight replacements, including several anti-vaccine voices.",
      "The agenda for the new committee's first meeting, posted Wednesday, shows it will be shorter than expected. Discussion of COVID-19 shots will open the session, but the agenda lists no vote on that. Instead, the committee will vote on fall flu vaccinations, on RSV vaccinations for pregnant women and children and on the use of a preservative named thimerosal that's in a subset of flu shots.",
      "It's not clear who wrote the agenda. No committee chairperson has been named and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not comment.",
      "Missing from the agenda are some heavily researched vaccine policy proposals the advisers were supposed to consider this month, including shots against HPV and meningococcal bacteria, said Dr. Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Instead, the committee is talking about subjects \u201cwhich are settled science,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cEvery American should be asking themselves how and why did we get here, where leaders are promoting their own agenda instead of protecting our people and our communities,\u201d she said. She worried it's \"part of a purposeful agenda to insert dangerous and harmful and unnecessary fear regarding vaccines into the process.\u201d",
      "The committee makes recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The recommendations traditionally go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director. Historically, nearly all are accepted and then used by insurance companies in deciding what vaccines to cover.",
      "But the CDC has no director and the committee's recommendations have been going to Kennedy.",
      "Thimerosal was added to certain vaccines in the early 20th century to make them safer and more accessible by preventing bacterial contamination in multi-dose vials. It's a tiny amount, but because it's a form of mercury, it began raising questions in the 1990s.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 a leading voice in an antivaccine movement before he became President Donald Trump\u2019s health secretary \u2014 has long held there was a tie between thimerosal and autism, and also accused the government of hiding the danger.",
      "Study after study has found no evidence that thimerosal causes autism. But since 2001, all vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine.",
      "Thimerosal now only appears in multidose flu shot vials, not the single-shot packaging of most of today's flu shots.",
      "Targeting thimerosal would likely force manufacturers to switch to single-dose vials, which would make the shots \u201cmore expensive, less available and more feared,\u201d said Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "Last week, 30 organizations called on insurers to continue paying for COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women after Kennedy said the shots would no longer be routinely recommended for that group.",
      "Doctors' groups also opposed Kennedy's changes to the vaccine committee. The new members he picked include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines, a top critic of pandemic-era lockdowns and a leader of a group that has been widely considered to be a source of vaccine misinformation.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics has long put out its own immunization recommendations. In recent decades it has matched what the government recommended. But asked if they might soon diverge, depending on potential changes in the government's vaccination recommendations, Kressly said; \u201cNothing's off the table.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will do whatever is necessary to make sure that every child in every community gets the vaccines that they deserve to stay healthy and safe,\u201d she said.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration has approved the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has approved the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV, maker Gilead Sciences announced Wednesday. It's the first step in an anticipated global rollout that could protect millions \u2013 although it's unclear how many in the U.S. and abroad will get access to the powerful new option.",
      "While a vaccine to prevent HIV still is needed, some experts say the shot \u2014 a drug called lenacapvir \u2014 could be the next best thing. It nearly eliminated new infections in two groundbreaking studies of people at high risk, better than daily preventive pills they can forget to take.",
      "\u201cThis really has the possibility of ending HIV transmission,\u201d said Greg Millett, public policy director at amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research.",
      "Condoms help guard against HIV infection if used properly but what's called PrEP \u2014 regularly using preventive medicines such as the daily pills or a different shot given every two months \u2014 is increasingly important. Lenacapavir's six-month protection makes it the longest-lasting type, an option that could attract people wary of more frequent doctor visits or stigma from daily pills.",
      "But upheaval in U.S. healthcare \u2014 including cuts to public health agencies and Medicaid \u2014 and slashing of American foreign aid to fight HIV are clouding the prospects.",
      "Millett said \"gaping holes in the system\" in the U.S. and globally \"are going to make it difficult for us to make sure we not only get lenacapavir into people\u2019s bodies but make sure they come back\u201d even as little as twice a year.",
      "Gilead\u2019s drug already is sold to treat HIV under the brand name Sunlenca. The prevention dose will be sold under a different name, Yeztugo. It\u2019s given as two injections under the skin of the abdomen, leaving a small \u201cdepot\u201d of medication to slowly absorb into the body.",
      "Gilead didn't immediately announce its price. The drug only prevents HIV transmission \u2013 it doesn\u2019t block other sexually transmitted diseases.",
      "Global efforts at ending the HIV pandemic by 2030 have stalled. There still are more than 30,000 new infections in the U.S. each year and about 1.3 million worldwide.",
      "Only about 400,000 Americans already use some form of PrEP, a fraction of those estimated to benefit. A recent study found states with high use of PrEP saw a decrease in HIV infections, while rates continued rising elsewhere.",
      "About half of new infections are in women, who often need protection they can use without a partner's knowledge or consent. One rigorous study in South Africa and Uganda compared more than 5,300 sexually active young women and teen girls given twice-yearly lenacapavir or the daily pills. There were no HIV infections in those receiving the shot while about 2% in the comparison group caught HIV from infected sex partners.",
      "A second study found the twice-yearly shot nearly as effective in gay men and gender-nonconforming people in the U.S. and in several other countries hard-hit by HIV.",
      "Ian Haddock of Houston had tried PrEP off and on since 2015 but he jumped at the chance to participate in the lenacapavir study and continues with the twice-yearly shots as part of the research follow-up.",
      "\u201cNow I forget that I\u2019m on PrEP because I don\u2019t have to carry around a pill bottle,\u201d said Haddock, who leads the Normal Anomaly Initiative, a nonprofit serving Black LGBTQ+ communities.",
      "\u201cMen, women, gay, straight \u2013 it really just kinds of expands the opportunity for prevention,\u201d he added. Just remembering a clinic visit every six months \u201cis a powerful tool versus constantly having to talk about, like, condoms, constantly making sure you\u2019re taking your pill every day.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone in every country who\u2019s at risk of HIV needs access to PrEP,\u201d added Dr. Gordon Crofoot of Houston, who helped lead the study in men. \u201cWe need to get easier access to PrEP that\u2019s highly effective like this is.\u201d",

      "The COVID-19 variant that may be driving a recent rise in cases in some parts of the world has earned a new nickname: \u201crazor blade throat\u201d COVID.",
      "That's because the variant \u2014 NB.1.8.1. or \u201cNimbus\u201d \u2014 may cause painful sore throats. The symptom has been identified by doctors in the United Kingdom, India and elsewhere, according to media outlets in those countries.",

    "summary": "More employers are putting health insurance decisions in the hands of workers",
    "story": [
      "More employers are putting health insurance decisions in the hands of workers",
      "A small, growing number of employers are putting health insurance decisions entirely in the hands of their workers.",
      "Instead of offering traditional insurance, they\u2019re giving workers money to buy their own coverage in what\u2019s known as Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements, or ICHRAs.",
      "Advocates say this approach provides small companies that couldn\u2019t afford insurance a chance to offer something. It also caps a growing expense for employers and fits conservative political goals of giving people more purchasing power over their coverage.",
      "But ICHRAs place the risk for finding coverage on the employee, and they force them to do something many dislike: Shop for insurance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s maybe not perfect, but it\u2019s solving a problem for a lot of people,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, of the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at how this approach to health insurance is evolving.",
      "Normally, U.S. employers offering health coverage will have one or two insurance options for workers through what\u2019s known as a group plan. The employers then pick up most of the premium, or cost of coverage.",
      "ICHRAs are different: Employers contribute to health insurance coverage, but the workers then pick their own insurance plans. The employers that use ICHRAs hire outside firms to help people make their coverage decisions.",
      "ICHRAs were created during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration. Enrollment started slowly but has swelled in recent years.",
      "They give business owners a predictable cost, and they save companies from having to make coverage decisions for employees.",
      "\u201cYou have so many things you need to focus on as a business owner to just actually grow the business,\u201d said Jeff Yuan, co-founder of the New York-based insurance startup Taro Health.",
      "Small businesses, in particular, can be vulnerable to annual insurance cost spikes, especially if some employees have expensive medical conditions. But the ICHRA approach keeps the employer cost more predictable.",
      "Yuan's company bases its contributions on the employee's age and how many people are covered under the plan. That means it may contribute anywhere from $400 to more than $2,000 monthly to an employee's coverage.",
      "ICHRAs let people pick from among dozens of options in an individual insurance market instead of just taking whatever their company offers.",
      "That may give people a chance to find coverage more tailored to their needs. Some insurers, for instance, offer plans designed for people with diabetes.",
      "And workers can keep the coverage if they leave \u2014 potentially for longer periods than they would be able to with traditional employer health insurance plans. They likely will have to pay the full premium, but keeping the coverage also means they won\u2019t have to find a new plan that covers their doctors.",
      "Mark Bertolini, CEO of the insurer Oscar Health, noted that most people change jobs several times.",
      "\u201cInsurance works best when it moves with the consumer,\u201d said the executive, whose company is growing enrollment through ICHRAs in several states.",
      "Health insurance plans on the individual market tend to have narrower coverage networks than employer-sponsored coverage.",
      "It may be challenging for patients who see several doctors to find one plan that covers them all.",
      "People shopping for their own insurance can find coverage choices and terms like deductibles or coinsurance overwhelming. That makes it important for employers to provide help with plan selection.",
      "The broker or technology platform setting up a company\u2019s ICHRA generally does this by asking about their medical needs or if they have any surgeries planned in the coming year.",
      "There are no good numbers nationally that show how many people have coverage through an ICHRA or a separate program for companies with 50 workers or less.",
      "However, the HRA Council, a trade association that promotes the arrangements, sees big growth. The council works with companies that help employers offer the ICHRAs. It studies growth in a sample of those businesses.",
      "It says about 450,000 people were offered coverage through these arrangements this year. That\u2019s up 50% from 2024. Council Executive Director Robin Paoli says the total market may be twice as large.",
      "Still, these arrangements make up a sliver of employer-sponsored health coverage in the United States. About 154 million people were enrolled in coverage through work last year, according to KFF.",
      "Several things could cause more employers to offer ICHRAs. As health care costs continue to climb, more companies may look to limit their exposure to the hit.",
      "Some tax breaks and incentives that encourage the arrangements could wind up in a final version of the Republican tax bill currently under consideration in the Senate.",
      "More people also will be eligible for the arrangements if extra government subsidies that help buy coverage on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual marketplaces expire this year.",
      "You can\u2019t participate in an ICHRA if you are already getting a subsidy from the government, noted Brian Blase, a White House health policy adviser in the first Trump administration.",
      "\u201cThe enhanced subsidies, they crowd out private financing,\u201d he said.",

      "Cancer patients say they\u2019ve grown sicker since Argentina\u2019s radical libertarian President Javier Milei took his chainsaw to the public health system",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- To outsiders, the Facebook group chat reads like a snarl of nonsensical emojis and letters. To uninsured Argentine cancer patients, it\u2019s a lifeline.",
      "The surreptitious network connects advocates who have spare drugs to Argentines with cancer who lost access to their treatment in March 2024 when President Javier Milei suspended a federal agency, known as DADSE, that paid for their expensive medications.",
      "Whenever Facebook cracks the coded pleas and removes the group for violating its rules on drug sales, another appears, swelling with Argentines who say they\u2019ve grown sicker since the radical libertarian president took a chainsaw to health care.",
      "\u201cAll I need for my body to function is this medication, and Milei is saying, \u2018There\u2019s no money,\u2019\u201d said Ariel Wagener, a 47-year-old pizza chef with leukemia who was hospitalized this year with failing kidneys after losing access to his medication. Without DADSE, a month's worth of his leukemia drug costs $21,000.",
      "Wagener's condition stabilized after he got leftover medication via Facebook, donated by a family whose loved one had died of cancer.",
      "The halting of millions of dollars of free cancer drugs is just one way Milei\u2019s austerity drive has torn through the public health system that once set Argentina apart in Latin America, ensuring that health care was free for pretty much everyone who couldn't afford private insurance.",
      "Since taking office in December 2023, Milei has slashed Argentina\u2019s health care budget by 48% in real terms. His administration fired over 2,000 Health Ministry employees, including 1,400 over just a few days in January.",
      "As part of Milei\u2019s plan to remake Argentina\u2019s troubled economy and cut waste and bureaucracy, officials gutted the National Cancer Institute, suspending early detection programs for breast and cervical cancer.",
      "They froze federal funds for immunization campaigns, hobbling vaccine access as Argentina confronts a measles outbreak for the first time in decades. They dismantled the National Directorate for HIV, Hepatitis and Tuberculosis, leading to testing and treatment delays. They defunded emergency contraception and stopped distributing abortion pills.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing setbacks we haven\u2019t seen in decades,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Fernanda Boriotti, president of Argentina\u2019s Federation of Health Professionals. \"HIV patients without treatment, cancer patients dying for lack of medication, hospitals without resources, health professionals pushed out of the system.\"",
      "The government curtailed medical coverage for retirees and lifted price controls on prescription medication and private health plans, causing prices to spike by 250% and 118% respectively, official data shows.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve stopped buying milk, yogurt, anything that\u2019s not absolutely essential,\u201d said Susana Pecora, 71, who lost the insurance plan that covered her husband's antipsychotic drugs when the price jumped 40% last year.",
      "Milei campaigned on a promise to shrink the state two years before President Donald Trump and Elon Musk took up their own chainsaws.",
      "The Argentine has become a close ally of the Trump administration, including on health policy. Argentina has followed the U.S. out of the World Health Organization, and last month received a visit from U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Meeting Kennedy in Buenos Aires, Argentine Health Minister Mario Lugones announced a review of Argentina's health system to align it with Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement.",
      "\u201cWe have similar visions about the path forward,\u201d Lugones said of Kennedy.",
      "Milei has not yet attempted to replace universal coverage with an insurance-based system, as he vowed on the campaign trail.",
      "But in stripping Argentines of coverage and increasing premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, he is moving Argentina closer to the U.S. model, said Macarena Sabin Paz, health team coordinator at Argentina\u2019s Center for Legal and Social Studies.",
      "\u201cWe are beginning to see the idea ... where if you lose your job, or become seriously ill, you may have to sell your car, whatever you have, to pay for health care,\" she said.",
      "Milei\u2019s staffing cuts have eviscerated agencies tasked with planning, financing and tracking immunization campaigns, disrupting data collection and jeopardizing the country\u2019s respected childhood vaccine program.",
      "The cuts have coincided with a measles outbreak that in April led to Argentina's first measles death in two decades.",
      "\u201cArgentina has been one of the most advanced South American countries and here we see it abandoning public health,\u201d said Dr. Stanley Plotkin, an American physician who helped develop the measles vaccine in the 1960s.",
      "Milei\u2019s spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, did not respond to requests for comment. Lugones also did not respond to questions on the impact of policy changes.",
      "After decades of unbridled spending by left-wing populist governments that brought Argentina infamy for defaulting on its debts, Milei delivered on his campaign promises of taming extreme inflation and notching a fiscal surplus.",
      "But even experts who agree Argentina\u2019s health care system needed reform say the cutbacks have been so deep and fast that they\u2019ve hit like a tidal wave.",
      "\u201cIn terms of the destruction of the state, we\u2019ve never experienced anything like this, not even during the military dictatorship,\u201d said Fabio Nu\u00f1ez, ex-coordinator of the National Directorate for HIV, Hepatitis and Tuberculosis who was among hundreds fired from the agency.",
      "Charged with leading prevention efforts and treatments for infectious diseases, the agency has lost 40% of its staff and 76% of its annual budget. Hospitals now face shortages of everything from virus testing supplies to medications to condoms.",
      "The cuts have coincided with a surge in sexually transmitted infections. Last year HIV cases spiked by 20% and syphilis by 50%.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re avoiding the expense now but will pay for it later as people seek emergency care,\u201d said Cristian Pizzuti, a 31-year-old with HIV who documented 103 cases of patients deprived of their daily antiretroviral pills for weeks at a time last year. Pizzuti said he recently received expired medication and suffered a severe allergic reaction after being switched to a cheaper drug.",
      "Tuberculosis cases also climbed by 25% last year. TB clinics report delays in obtaining test results.",
      "\u201cAs people go about their lives, waiting for results, they are spreading the disease to others,\u201d said Dr. Santiago Jimenez, who treats HIV and TB patients in an impoverished Buenos Aires neighborhood. \"It\u2019s an epidemiological disaster.\u201d",
      "Free public hospitals have become flooded with Argentines who dropped their private insurance due to increased premiums or who lost their job \u2014 and with it, their social security plans funded through payroll contributions. Buenos Aires facilities reported a 20%-30% increase in demand in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year.",
      "The strain was visible at the free public Rodolfo Rossi Hospital in La Plata last month, where crowds jostled in the outpatient clinic and long lines spilled from the pharmacy.",
      "Pharmacists have reported drug shortages as mass layoffs caused administrative chaos and the government froze a program that provided basic medications to Argentine public health centers.",
      "Silvana Mansilla, 43, spent half the day waiting to pick up her monthly supply of thyroid medication \u2014 which has doubled in price to $22 \u2014 only to find the hospital had run out. \u201cWhere\u2019s the government? What are they doing about this?\u201d she asked.",
      "With hiring frozen, doctors said they're handling double the patient load.",
      "Overwhelmed by ever-increasing workloads, Argentina\u2019s leading public Garrahan Pediatric Hospital in Buenos Aires has hemorrhaged 200 medical professionals since Milei took office.",
      "As annual inflation neared 200% last fall, their salaries lost half of their purchasing power. Doctors left for jobs abroad or better-paying work in private clinics. None were replaced. Medical residents ran a weeklong strike in May, displaying their pay slips for a month of 70-hour work weeks: $700.",
      "A lawsuit filed by patient advocacy groups said more than 60 cancer patients have died due to the government\u2019s suspension of the DADSE medication program, and over 1,500 patients were waiting for their drugs.",
      "A federal judge ordered the government to reinstate the drug deliveries, but it appealed, arguing that DADSE no longer exists. It said it had created a new, more efficient program to fulfill outstanding requests. But the timeline varies and sometimes the drugs don't come at all.",
      "Timing was everything for patients like Alexis Almir\u00f3n.",
      "His medical records show the government drug bank received his request for an expensive medication to shrink his malignant tumor on Dec. 11, 2023, the day after Milei\u2019s inauguration. His doctor told the agency immediate treatment was urgently needed for the aggressive cancer.",
      "Months passed. His mother, Claudia Caballero, bombarded DADSE with desperate calls asking what was taking so long as Almir\u00f3n\u2019s lymphoma spread from his neck to his brain and stomach. He vomited blood. He lost his eyesight. Caballero tried to crowd-source the $20,000 for a month\u2019s supply of the drug but couldn't raise enough.",
      "On March 12 last year, Almir\u00f3n died at 22.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t give him the chance to choose to live,\u201d Caballero said, her voice breaking.",
      "The day after she buried her son, Caballero received a call from the Health Ministry. They had good news, the caller said: Her son\u2019s medication had finally arrived.",

      "From 2003 to 2023, death rates from falls rose more than 70% for adults ages 65 to 74, the report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The rate increased more than 75% for people 75 to 84, and more than doubled for seniors 85 and older.",
      "\u201cFalls continue to be a public health problem worth paying attention to,\u201d said Geoffrey Hoffman, a University of Michigan researcher who was not involved in the new report. \u201cIt's curious that these rates keep rising.\u201d",
      "The CDC researchers did not try to answer why death rates from falls are increasing. But experts say there may be a few reasons, like gradually improving our understanding of the the role falls play in deaths and more people living longer \u2014 to ages when falls are more likely to have deadly consequences.",
      "More than 41,000 retirement-age Americans died of falls in 2023, the most recent year for which final statistics based on death certificates are available. That suggests that falls were blamed in about 1 of every 56 deaths in older Americans that year.",
      "More than half of those 41,000 deaths were people 85 and older, the CDC found, and white people accounted for 87% of deaths in the oldest category.",
      "Falls can cause head injuries or broken bones that can lead to permanent disability and trigger a cascade of other health problems. A number of factors can contribute to falls, including changes in hearing and vision and medications that can cause light-headedness.",
      "Death rates varied widely from state to state. In 2023, Wisconsin had the highest death rates from falls, followed by Minnesota, Maine, Oklahoma and Vermont. Wisconsin's rate was more than five times higher than the rate of the lowest state, Alabama.",
      "Ice and wintry weather may partly explain why fatal falls were more common in states in the upper Midwest and New England, but experts also pointed to other things at play, like differences in how well falls are reported and to what extent they are labeled a cause of death.",
      "\u201cWe've yet to unravel why you see such differences in state rates,\u201d said Hoffman, who studies falls among the elderly.",
      "Researchers also can't yet explain why white seniors die of falls at higher rates than people in other racial and ethnic groups. In the 85-and-up age group, the death rate for white Americans is two or three times higher than any other group, while older Black people had the lowest fall-related death rate.",
      "\u201cKind of a flip of the traditional disparity lens,\u201d Hoffman said, referring to the fact that for most other rates of illness and injury, people of color are disproportionately affected.",
      "Staying active can help people avoid falls, experts say.",

      "It's the second such federal ruling to reinstate public health funding for several states.",
      "U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper in Washington, D.C., issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday sought by district attorneys in Harris County, Texas, home to Houston, and three cities: Columbus, Ohio, Nashville, Tennessee, and Kansas City, Missouri. The decision means the federal government must reinstate funding to the four municipalities until the case is fully litigated.",
      "\u201cThe federal government cannot simply ignore Congress and pull the plug on essential services that communities rely on,\u201d Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said. \u201cToday\u2019s decision ensures we can keep doing the work that protects our residents \u2014 from tracking disease outbreaks to providing vaccinations and supporting vulnerable families.\u201d",
      "Their lawsuit, filed in late April, alleged $11 billion in cuts to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention programs had already been approved by Congress and are being unconstitutionally withheld. They also argued that the administration\u2019s actions violate Department of Health and Human Services regulations.",
      "The cities and counties argued the cuts were \u201ca massive blow to U.S. public health at a time where state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases and chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.\u201d The cuts would lead to thousands of state and local public health employees being fired, the lawsuit argued.",
      "The local governments, alongside the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union, wanted the court to reinstate the grants nationwide. But Cooper said in his preliminary injunction that the funds can only be blocked to the four municipalities and in a May 21 hearing expressed skepticism about whether it could apply more widely.",
      "The funding in question was granted during the COVID-19 pandemic but aimed at building up public health infrastructure overall, Menefee said in a statement in April.",
      "The four local governments were owed about $32.7 million in future grant payments, Cooper's opinion notes.",
      "The federal government's lawyers said the grants were legally cut because, \"Now that the pandemic is over, the grants and cooperative agreements are no longer necessary as their limited purpose has run out.\u201d They used the same argument in the case brought by 23 states and the District of Columbia over the HHS funding clawback.",
      "Menefee said the cuts defunded programs in Harris County for wastewater disease surveillance, community health workers and clinics and call centers that helped people get vaccinated. Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein said the cuts forced the city to fire 11 of its 22 infectious disease staffers.",
      "Nashville used some of its grant money to support programs, including a \u201cstrike team\u201d that after the pandemic addressed gaps in health services that kept kids from being able to enroll in school, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Kansas City used one of its grants to build out capabilities to test locally for COVID-19, influenza and measles rather than waiting for results from the county lab. The suit details that after four years of work to certify facilities and train staff, the city \u201cwas at the final step\" of buying lab equipment when the grant was canceled.",
      "Representatives for HHS, the CDC and the cities did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.",

      "Newkirk said her daughter had intense headaches more than four months ago and went to Atlanta\u2019s Northside Hospital, where she received medication and was released.

      "Three years after the fall of Roe v. Wade, the funding system for abortions is battered",
      "The abortion funding system across the U.S. is battered three years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to enforce bans.",
      "An initial surge of donations has subsided, scores of clinics have closed and advocates fear that federal policy changes will result in more shutting down.",
      "\u201cWe're all collectively struggling,\u201d said Ramsie Monk, director of development at the Women's Health Centers of West Virginia and Maryland, which opened a clinic in 2023 in western Maryland after abortion was banned in West Virginia.",
      "\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a sustainable model,\u201d said Mercedes Sanchez, executive director at the Cedar River Clinics in Washington. \u201cClinics, providers, funds are all very committed to making sure people can access care, but it is definitely going to be more of a challenge.\u201d",
      "Bans in some states mean travel has become a bigger part of obtaining an abortion, bring a host of costs.",
      "A mitigating factor is that most abortions are now done with medications. They can be prescribed by telehealth, including to women in states where abortion is banned. But they can't be used in every case, some women prefer procedures, and there are challenges to the legality of pills and how they're prescribed.",
      "Not all private insurance plans cover abortions. Federal taxpayer funds cannot be used for abortions, but state Medicaid funds cover them in some places. And a network of private funding helps cover procedures or travel and other costs.",
      "The increase in contributions that followed the 2022 Supreme Court ruling has declined for most funds and clinics. \u201cThe resources have not kept pace with demand continuing to surge,\u201d Lynn McCann-Yeh, co-executive director of the Baltimore Abortion Fund.",
      "With bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy now being enforced in 12 states and bans at about six weeks' gestation being enforced in four others, travel for abortion has become more frequent. Costs for each trip can include plane tickets or gas for long drives, meals, hotels and child care \u2014 all on top of clinic fees.",
      "Last year, the National Abortion Federation's hotline fund reduced the portion of clinic costs it covers for people with financial needs to 30% from 50% so it could help more people as demand increased. The group's says travel costs now average over $1,000 per person.",
      "Travel needs have made the job for abortion funds not only more expensive but more intricate.",
      "Before the Texas ban started in 2021, Fund Texas Choice got about 40 calls a month, executive director Anna Rupani said. Now, it's over 200. And assisting each caller can take more time because they involve arranging flights and hotels, not just lining up rides to clinics in the state.",
      "Some people cobble together money from a hodgepodge of groups to pay for an abortion. Grace McGarry, who manages the phone line for Whole Woman's Health, which operates five clinics across the U.S., said he talked to a patient who was getting aid from nine different groups.",
      "Since the Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, I Need An A, which operates a website dedicated to providing information about abortion options, has tallied 105 clinics closing.",
      "Twenty-nine closures were in states where abortion is now banned at all stages of pregnancy. Eleven were in states where it's banned at about six weeks' gestation, before many women realize they're pregnant. But 65 of the closures were in other states.",
      "At the same time, 34 clinics have opened anew or moved to states where abortion is legal.",
      "\u201cEach and every one of those has been a blow to that community that hasn\u2019t been refilled,\u201d said Rebecca Nall, the founder of I Need An A.",
      "Planned Parenthood North Central States announced in May that it would close eight locations in Iowa and Minnesota while expanding services at some other clinics.",
      "Ruth Richardson, the CEO of that Planned Parenthood affiliate, said the reorganization recognizes that the number of abortions in Iowa plummeted after the state started enforcing its strict abortion law. It also reflects that the regional group's overall budget is down.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got the compounded challenges of the fact that sexual and reproductive health care has been politicized in this environment,\u201d she said.",
      "Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, said in a statement that the closures are warranted: \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s focus is squarely on abortions, gender transitions and political spending.\u201d",
      "In March, the Department of Health and Human Services withheld $27.5 million that groups were expecting to provide family planning, contraception, cancer screening and sexually transmitted infection tests and treatment. Some of the groups also provide abortions and include at least 11 regional Planned Parenthood affiliates.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely in a public health crisis of epic proportions,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation. \"We\u2019re in a situation where there are reproductive health care deserts, not just abortion care deserts.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump's tax and budget bill that is up for consideration in the Senate after getting House approval would deliver more blows to abortion funding.",

      "The bill also would bar Medicaid funds from flowing to Planned Parenthood, the nation's biggest abortion provider.",
      "Planned Parenthood said those provisions could lead to the closures of about half its clinics that provide abortion \u2014- and about one-fourth of abortion clinics nationwide. The biggest impact on affiliate clinics would be in states where abortion is legal.",

      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. In Canada and in Europe \u2014 where synthetic colors are required to carry warning labels \u2014 manufacturers mostly use natural substitutes.

Thru-hikers, as they're known, are the fraction of the trail's 3 million annual visitors who attempt to walk its entire length in a single, continuous trip.",

      "WASHINGTON -- As Republican senators consider President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill that could slash federal spending and extend tax cuts, a new survey shows most U.S. adults don\u2019t think the government is overspending on the programs the GOP has focused on cutting, like Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "Americans broadly support increasing or maintaining existing levels of funding for popular safety net programs, including Social Security and Medicare, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. They're more divided on spending around the military and border security, and most think the government is spending too much on foreign aid.",
      "The poll points to a disconnect between Republicans\u2019 policy agenda and public sentiment around the domestic programs that are up for debate in the coming weeks.",
      "Here\u2019s the latest polling data on how Americans view federal funding:",
      "Many Americans see Medicaid and food assistance programs as underfunded \u2014 even as Congress proposes significant cuts to Medicaid and food and nutrition assistance programs \u2014 and few say \u201ctoo much\u201d money is going to these programs.",
      "About half of U.S. adults say \u201ctoo little\u201d funding goes to Medicaid, which is a government health care coverage program for low-income people and people with certain disabilities. Nearly half, 45%, say food and nutrition assistance programs like food stamps, SNAP or EBT cards are underfunded, according to the poll. About 3 in 10 U.S. adults in each case say those programs are receiving \u201cabout the right amount\u201d of funding, indicating that most Americans likely do not want to see significant cuts to the two programs.",
      "About 2 in 10 say Medicaid is overfunded, while about one-quarter say that about food assistance programs.",
      "Republicans are especially likely to say \u201ctoo much\u201d is spent on food and nutrition assistance programs when compared with Democrats and independents \u2014 46% of Republicans say this, compared with about 1 in 10 Democrats and independents.",
      "When it comes to Medicaid, fewer Republicans, about one-third, say the government is spending \u201ctoo much.\u201d",
      "About 6 in 10 Americans say there is not enough government money going toward Social Security, Medicare or education broadly. But Democrats overwhelmingly think \u201ctoo little\u201d money is allocated to these areas, while Republicans are happier with the status quo.",
      "Very few think Medicare, Social Security and education are getting \u201ctoo much\u201d funding. Only about 1 in 10 Republicans say this about either Medicare or Social Security. Roughly one-quarter of Republicans say too much is spent on education.",
      "When it comes to Social Security, about half of Republicans say \u201ctoo little\u201d is spent, compared with about 7 in 10 Democrats.",
      "Americans are more divided on whether the government is devoting too much money to the military or border security.",
      "About 3 in 10 say the government is spending \u201ctoo much\u201d on the military, while a similar share say the government is spending \u201ctoo little.\u201d Close to 4 in 10 say the government is spending \u201cabout the right amount.\u201d",
      "Republicans are much less likely to say \u201ctoo little\u201d is being spent on border security than they were before Trump took office again in January. Now, 45% of Republicans say \u201ctoo little\u201d is being spent, down from 79% in a January AP-NORC poll.",
      "On the other hand, Democrats are more likely to say that \u201ctoo much\u201d is being spent on border security. About half of Democrats now say this, compared with about 3 in 10 in January.",
      "The Trump administration has asked Congress for deep reductions to foreign aid programs, including cuts to global health programs and refugee resettlement initiatives.",
      "Foreign aid is one area with more general agreement that there is \u201ctoo much\u201d federal spending. Most U.S. adults, 56%, say the U.S. government is spending too much on assistance to other countries, which is down from 69% in an AP-NORC poll from March 2023.",

      "MADRID -- Suitcases rattle against cobblestones. Selfie-snappers jostle for the same shot. Ice cream shops are everywhere. Europe has been called the world\u2019s museum, but its record numbers of visitors have also made it ground zero for concerns about overtourism.",
      "Last year, 747 million international travelers visited the continent, far outnumbering any other region in the world, according to the U.N.'s World Tourism Barometer. Southern and Western Europe welcomed more than 70% of them.",
      "As the growing tide of travelers strains housing, water and the most Instagrammable hotspots in the region, protests and measures to lessen the effects of overtourism have proliferated.",
      "Here's a look at the issue in some of Europe's most visited destinations.",
      "Among factors driving the record numbers are cheap flights, social media, the ease of travel planning using artificial intelligence and what U.N. tourism officials call a strong economic outlook for many rich countries that send tourists despite some geopolitical and economic tensions.",
      "Citizens of countries like the U.S., Japan, China and the U.K. generate the most international trips, especially to popular destinations, such as Barcelona in Spain and Venice in Italy. They swarm these places seasonally, creating uneven demand for housing and resources such as water.",
      "Despite popular backlash against the crowds, some tourism officials believe they can be managed with the right infrastructure in place.",
      "Italy's Tourism Minister Daniela Santanch\u00e8 said she thinks tourism flows at crowded sites such Florence's Uffizi Galleries that house some of the world's most famous artworks could be better managed with AI, with tourists able to buy their tickets when they book their travel, even months in advance, to prevent surges.",
      "She pushed back against the idea that Italy \u2014 which like all of its Southern European neighbors, welcomed more international visitors in 2024 than its entire population \u2014 has a problem with too many tourists, adding that most visits are within just 4% of the country's territory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenon that can absolutely be managed,\u201d Santanch\u00e8 told The Associated Press in an interview in her office on Friday. \"Tourism must be an opportunity, not a threat \u2014 even for local communities. That\u2019s why we are focusing on organizing flows.\u201d",
      "Countries on the Mediterranean are at the forefront. Olympics-host France, the biggest international destination, last year received 100 million international visitors, while second-place Spain received almost 94 million \u2014 nearly double its own population.",
      "Protests have erupted across Spain over the past two years. In Barcelona, the water gun has become a symbol of the city's anti-tourism movement after marching protests have spritzed unsuspecting tourists while carrying signs saying: \u201cOne more tourist, one less resident!\u201d",
      "The pressure on infrastructure has been particularly acute on Spain's Canary and Balearic Islands, which have a combined population of less than 5 million people. Each archipelago saw upwards of 15 million visitors last year.",
      "Elsewhere in Europe, tourism overcrowding has vexed Italy's most popular sites including Venice, Rome, Capri and Verona, where Shakespeare's \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d was set. On the popular Amalfi Coast, ride-hailing app Uber offers private helicopter and boat rides in the summer to beat the crowds.",
      "Greece, which saw nearly four times as many tourists as its own population last year, has struggled with the strain on water, housing and energy in the summer months, especially on popular islands such as Santorini, Mykonos and others.",
      "In Spain, anti-tourism activists, academics, and the government say that overtourism is driving up housing costs in city centers and other popular locations due to the proliferation of short-term rentals that cater to visitors.",
      "Others bemoan changes to the very character of city neighborhoods that drew tourists in the first place.",
      "In Barcelona and elsewhere, activists and academics have said that neighborhoods popular with tourists have seen local shops replaced with souvenir vendors, international chains and trendy eateries.",
      "On some of Greece's most-visited islands, tourism has overlapped with water scarcity as drought grips the Mediterranean country of 10.4 million.",
      "In France, the Louvre, the world\u2019s most-visited museum, shut down this week when its staff went on strike warning that the facility was crumbling beneath the weight of overtourism, stranding thousands of ticketed visitors lined up under the baking sun.",
      "Angelos Varvarousis, a Barcelona- and Athens-based academic and urban planner who studies the industry, said overtourism risks imposing a \u201cmonoculture\u201d on many of Europe's hotspots.",
      "\u201cIt is combined with the gradual loss and displacement of other social and economic activities,\u201d Varvarousis said.",
      "Spain's government wants to tackle what officials call the country's biggest governance challenge: its housing crunch.",
      "Last month, Spain's government ordered Airbnb to take down almost 66,000 properties it said had violated local rules \u2014 while Barcelona announced a plan last year to phase out all of the 10,000 apartments licensed in the city as short-term rentals by 2028. Officials said the measure was to safeguard the housing supply for full-time residents.",
      "Elsewhere, authorities have tried to regulate tourist flows by cracking down on overnight stays or imposing fees for those visiting via cruises.",
      "In Greece, starting July 1, a cruise tax will be levied on island visitors at 20 euros ($23) for popular destinations like Mykonos and 5 euros ($5.70) for less-visited islands like Samos.",
      "The government has also encouraged visitors to seek quieter locations.",
      "To alleviate water problems, water tankers from mainland Greece have helped parched islands, and the islands have also used desalination technology, which separates salts from ocean water to make it drinkable, to boost their drinking water.",
      "Other measures have included staggered visiting hours at the Acropolis.",
      "Meanwhile, Venice brought back an entry fee this year that was piloted last year on day-trippers who will have to pay between 5 and 10 euros (roughly $6 to $12) to enter the city during the peak season.",

      "His first encounter with Lee seemed positive, despite worries in Japan about South Korea\u2019s stance under a liberal leader known for attacks on Japan\u2019s wartime past.",
      "Lee, in that meeting with Ishiba at the G7, likened the two countries to \u201cneighbors sharing the same front yard\u201d and called for building a future-oriented relationship that moves beyond their \u201csmall differences and disagreements.\u201d",

      "Stonehenge was built in stages 5,000 years ago on the flat lands of Salisbury Plain approximately 75 miles (120 kilometers) southwest of London. The unique stone circle was erected in the late Neolithic period about 2,500 B.C.",
      "Some of the so-called bluestones are known to have come from the Preseli Hills in southwest Wales, nearly 150 miles (240 kilometers) away, and the altar stone was recently discovered to have come from northern Scotland, some 460 miles (740 kilometers) away.",
      "The site\u2019s meaning has been vigorously debated. Theories range from it being a coronation place for Danish kings, a druid temple, a cult center for healing, or an astronomical computer for predicting eclipses and solar events.",
      "The most generally accepted interpretation is that it was a temple aligned with movements of the sun \u2014 lining up perfectly with the summer and winter solstices.",

      "TALLINN, Estonia -- Belarus has freed Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a key dissident figure and the husband of exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, following a rare visit by a senior U.S. official, Tsikhanouskaya\u2019s team announced on Saturday.",
      "Tsikhanouski, a popular blogger and activist who was jailed in 2020, arrived in Vilnius, Lithuania, alongside 13 other political prisoners, his wife's team said. The release came just hours after Belarusian authorities announced that authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko met with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, in Minsk.",
      "A video published on his wife's official Telegram account showed Tsikhanouski disembarking a white minibus, with a shaved head and broad smile. He pulled Tsikhanouskaya into a long embrace as their supporters applauded.",
      "\u201cMy husband is free. It's difficult to describe the joy in my heart,\u201d Tsikhanouskaya told reporters. But she added her team's work is \u201cnot finished\u201d while over 1,100 political prisoners remain behind bars in Belarus.",
      "Tsikhanouski was jailed after announcing plans to challenge Lukashenko in the 2020 election. Following his arrest, his wife ran in his stead, rallying large crowds across the country. Official results of the election handed Lukashenko his sixth term in office but were denounced by the opposition and the West as a sham.",
      "As unprecedented protests broke out in the aftermath of the vote, Tsikhanouskaya left the country under pressure from the authorities. Her husband was later sentenced to 19 1/2 years in prison on charges of organizing mass riots.",
      "Other prominent dissidents remain in Belarusian jails, among them Nobel Peace Prize winner Ales Bialiatski, a human rights advocate serving a 10-year prison sentence on charges widely denounced as politically motivated. Also behind bars is Viktor Babaryka, a former banker who was widely seen in 2020 as Lukashenko\u2019s main electoral rival, and Maria Kolesnikova, a charismatic leader of that year's mass protests.",
      "Released alongside Tsikhanouski was longtime Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty correspondent Ihar Karnei, the U.S. government-funded broadcaster confirmed. Karnei, who had also worked with prominent Belarusian and Russian newspapers, had been serving a three-year service on extremism charges he rejected as a sham.",
      "RFE/RL's Belarusian service had been designated extremist in the country, a common label handed to anyone who criticizes Lukashenko's government. As a result, working for it or spreading its content has become a criminal offense.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply grateful to President Trump for securing the release of this brave journalist, who suffered at the hands of the Belarusian authorities,\u201d the broadcaster's CEO Stephen Capus said Saturday in a press release.",
      "Karnei was detained several times while covering the 2020 protests. Unlike many of his colleagues, he chose to stay in Belarus despite the ensuing repression. He was arrested again in July 2023, as police raided his apartment seizing phones and computers.",
      "Belarus also freed an Estonian national who had set up an NGO to raise funds for Belarusian refugees. According to the Estonian Foreign Ministry, Allan Roio was detained last January, and sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison on charges of establishing an extremist organization.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine\u2019s president said that Russia repatriated at least 20 of its own dead soldiers in recent exchanges with Ukraine, describing it as a result of Moscow's disorganization in carrying out large swaps of wounded POWs and remains of troops.",
      "Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that an Israeli citizen was among the dead Ukraine had received in recent exchanges. He spoke to journalists on Friday but his comments were embargoed until Saturday. Officials did not disclose the identities of the bodies.",
      "\u201cThey threw the corpses of their citizens at us. This is their attitude toward war, toward their soldiers. And this is already documented. Sometimes these bodies even have Russian passports,\u201d he said.",
      "He said the Russian side insisted the dead were all Ukrainians.",
      "Journalists were shown a Russian passport and ID belonging to one of the 20 dead Russians. According to the document, the man came from the Moscow region.",
      "The exchanges of the dead and wounded soldiers are the only tangible result of direct peace talks in Istanbul. In June, Ukraine and Russia agreed to exchange the bodies of fallen soldiers in a 6,000-for-6,000 format during the second round of negotiations. Ukraine was concerned that the number was too high and that the sides did not have enough time for forensic examinations and checking the identities of the dead.",
      "Zelenskyy said he suspected Russia\u2019s plan was to play along with peace talks to appease the U.S. and stave off more sanctions but without ending the war that Russian President Vladimir Putin believes he is winning.",
      "He said that because of this, Ukraine would be \u201cin a really difficult situation\u201d of deciding whether to continue the talks in Istanbul.",
      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine was against Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, because of its military partnership with Russia, but stopped short of expressing explicit support for Israel's strikes. He repeated that the new war in the Middle East will affect Ukraine indirectly.",
      "\u201cIran gave the Russians everything to kill us. They gave them martyrs, they gave them missiles, and they gave them licenses. The fact that their production capacities have now become weaker is (a) positive for us. But at certain points it may already be too late,\u201d he said, also citing Russia's military cooperation with North Korea.",
      "Russia has modified Iran-made Shahed drones and has used them, often hundreds at a time, in barrages targeting Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy said 39 Russian companies were involved in the production of Oreshnik, an intermediate-range ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. He said 21 of them are not under sanctions. \u201cAnd therefore it is absolutely incomprehensible why sanctions should not be imposed urgently,\u201d he said.",
      "Russia attacked Ukraine with the missile in November, marking a serious escalation in the war and Russia's capabilities.",
      "Zelenskyy dispelled reports that Patriots air defense systems were destroyed in recent Russian drone and missile barrages. He also said Ukraine has started using domestically produced interceptors to shoot down Shahed drones and is seeking financing from Germany to ramp up the weapon's production.",
      "He added he sent signals to Western partners asking them to give up 0.25% of their GDP to support Ukraine's local defense industry.",
      "Zelenskyy said it's likely he would attend a NATO summit later this week, but that he would make a final decision on Monday.",
      "Though Zelenskyy did not meet Trump who had left early the Group of Seven summit in Canada last week, Ukraine's Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko and the head of the president's office, Andriy Yermak, gave U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent a list of weapons Ukraine is hoping to purchase. \u201cWe will wait feedback,\u201d Zelenskyy said, adding the package of weapons included Patriot systems.",

      "Though it stole the show in 2024, the cauldron was only meant to be temporary, not engineered for multi-year outdoor exposure.",

The aluminum ring and tether points were rebuilt with tougher components to handle rain, sun and temperature changes over several seasons.

      "On the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, rap battles are performed to the accompaniment of lute and fiddle",
      "LARNACA, Cyprus -- Lyrical duelists in Cyprus spit rhymes in head-to-head contests, keeping alive a tradition known as \u201ctsiattista\u201d that emerged centuries before the likes of Kendrick Lamar and Drake.",
      "Konstantinos Christou Grilias and Adamos Peratikos are among a new group of poets in this Mediterranean country who battle it out live on stage to the rhythms of the lute and fiddle. The battles are fierce, but you won't find any Kendrick-Drake style beef. Tsiattista made UNESCO\u2019s list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2011.",
      "The similarities with American hip-hop diss songs and battle rap are many: two duelists using their wits and turns of phrase to boast how superior they are, giving opponents a schooling in an onslaught of lyrical beatdowns. It's complete with assertive gestures and the hands-behind-the-back patience of the poet waiting to pounce.",
      "\u201cEven if you\u2019d been a paramedic, I\u2019d send you to hospital with a heart attack,\u201d Peratikos told one adversary \u2014 a line with more snap in the Cypriot Greek dialect, whose syntax is akin to ancient Greek. Grilias dissed his opponent as a lightweight and a laughingstock.",
      "The audience of hundreds along a seaside promenade murmured in approval.",
      "Tsiattista battles which have been around since at least the end of the 19th century, are undergoing a bit of a revival, thanks to performers like Grilias and Peratikos.",
      "\u201cWe urge other kids who like it to come along to safeguard this institution,\u201d said Peratikos, 41. \u201cThe goal isn\u2019t about awards, the goal is to keep tradition alive.\u201d",
      "The 44-year-old Grilias said he\u2019s never really delved into the world of Kendrick Lamar or Jay-Z.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I\u2019ve never listened to rappers. They told me that they battle in their own language, in their own way,\u201d Grilias said as he prepared for a tsiattista duel at the peak of a festival for the Orthodox Christian Pentecost.",
      "\u201cRappers don\u2019t know where Cyprus is,\" he added.",
      "The new group of performers, known as tsiattistaes, started to replace the older generation about 15 years ago at the premier competition in Larnaca during the annual Pentecost festival known as Kataklysmos, said ethnomusicologist Nicoletta Demetriou, who is director of the island nation\u2019s Music Archive.",
      "The new generation includes women, though few participate because of lingering social exclusion, Demetriou said.",
      "The current tsiattista format of a two-verse rhyme with a total of 15 syllables was developed in the late 18th to early 19th century, evolving from the introduction of the rhyming verse to the Greek-speaking world in the 15th and 16th centuries, Demetriou said. It draws on a tradition of poets matching wits from the times of Pericles in ancient Greece.",
      "The structure and musical accompaniment are simple, so that the rhymes are clear and understandable for both the audience and the adversary.",
      "Contests can address a range of themes, but the underlying premise is to determine who\u2019s the best at the diss.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s usually a fight, meaning \u2019I\u2019d clobber you, kill you, bury you,\u201d Grilias said. \u201cBut I believe the public likes more a bit of humor, too.\u201d",
      "For contestants, it's about who shows up ready, can stay cool and make the fewest mistakes in front of a crowd.",
      "\u201cTruth is, you\u2019re stressed, you\u2019re under pressure,\" Grilias said, and \u201cthe person who can best handle this has the advantage.\u201d",
      "One useful strategy is guessing how to get into your opponent\u2019s way of thinking, predicting possible responses to your lines, Peratikos said.",
      "He dismissed AI technology as incapable of coming up with effective rhymes in the Cypriot Greek dialect.",
      "\u201cThere are words that we\u2019ve heard but we don\u2019t even know, so there\u2019s no way artificial intelligence does,\u201d Peratikos said.",
      "At the end of a long night of battling, Grilias and Peratikos finished fourth and fifth, respectively. A judging panel composed of men and women determined the winners. The two contestants took their places in stride.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all friends, that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\u201d Grilias said.",

      "\u201cWe cannot go back home because people are still being killed,\u201d the 41-year-old said at the Kakuma camp, where the U.N. World Food Program and U.N. refugee agency help support more than 300,000 refugees.",

      "This year, those cash transfers \u2014 and many other U.N. aid activities \u2014 have stopped, threatening to upend or jeopardize millions of lives.",
      "As the U.N. marks its 80th anniversary this month, its humanitarian agencies are facing one of the greatest crises in their history: The biggest funder \u2014 the United States \u2014 under the Trump administration and other Western donors have slashed international aid spending. Some want to use the money to build up national defense.",
      "Some U.N. agencies are increasingly pointing fingers at one another as they battle over a shrinking pool of funding, said a diplomat from a top donor country who spoke on condition of anonymity to comment freely about the funding crisis faced by some U.N. agencies.",
      "Such pressures, humanitarian groups say, diminish the pivotal role of the U.N. and its partners in efforts to save millions of lives \u2014 by providing tents, food and water to people fleeing unrest in places like Myanmar, Sudan, Syria and Venezuela, or helping stamp out smallpox decades ago.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the most abrupt upheaval of humanitarian work in the U.N. in my 40 years as a humanitarian worker, by far,\u201d said Jan Egeland, a former U.N. humanitarian aid chief who now heads the Norwegian Refugee Council. \u201cAnd it will make the gap between exploding needs and contributions to aid work even bigger.\u201d",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has asked the heads of U.N. agencies to find ways to cut 20% of their staffs, and his office in New York has floated sweeping ideas about reform that could vastly reshape the way the United Nations doles out aid.",
      "Humanitarian workers often face dangers and go where many others don\u2019t \u2014 to slums to collect data on emerging viruses or drought-stricken areas to deliver water.",
      "The U.N. says 2024 was the deadliest year for humanitarian personnel on record, mainly due to the war in Gaza. In February, it suspended aid operations in the stronghold of Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, who have detained dozens of U.N. and other aid workers.",
      "Proponents say U.N. aid operations have helped millions around the world affected by poverty, illness, conflict, hunger and other troubles.",
      "Critics insist many operations have become bloated, replete with bureaucratic perks and a lack of accountability, and are too distant from in-the-field needs. They say postcolonial Western donations have fostered dependency and corruption, which stifles the ability of countries to develop on their own, while often U.N.-backed aid programs that should be time-specific instead linger for many years with no end in sight.",
      "In the case of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning WFP and the U.N.\u2019s refugee and migration agencies, the U.S. has represented at least 40% of their total budgets, and Trump administration cuts to roughly $60 billion in U.S. foreign assistance have hit hard. Each U.N. agency has been cutting thousands of jobs and revising aid spending.",
      "\u201cIt's too brutal what has happened,\u201d said Egeland, alluding to cuts that have jolted the global aid community. \u201cHowever, it has forced us to make priorities ... what I hope is that we will be able to shift more of our resources to the front lines of humanity and have less people sitting in offices talking about the problem.\u201d",
      "With the U.N. Security Council's divisions over wars in Ukraine and the Middle East hindering its ability to prevent or end conflict in recent years, humanitarian efforts to vaccinate children against polio or shelter and feed refugees have been a bright spot of U.N. activity. That's dimming now.",
      "Aside from the cuts and dangers faced by humanitarian workers, political conflict has at times overshadowed or impeded their work.",
      "UNRWA, the aid agency for Palestinian refugees, has delivered an array of services to millions \u2014 food, education, jobs and much more \u2014 in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan as well as in the West Bank and Gaza since its founding in 1948.",
      "Israel claims the agency's schools fan antisemitic and anti-Israel sentiment, which the agency denies. Israel says Hamas siphons off U.N. aid in Gaza to profit from it, while U.N. officials insist most aid gets delivered directly to the needy.",
      "\u201cUNRWA is like one of the foundations of your home. If you remove it, everything falls apart,\u201d said Issa Haj Hassan, 38, after a checkup at a small clinic at the Mar Elias Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut.",
      "UNRWA covers his diabetes and blood pressure medication, as well as his wife\u2019s heart medicine. The United States, Israel's top ally, has stopped contributing to UNRWA; it once provided a third of its funding. Earlier this year, Israel banned the aid group, which has strived to continue its work nonetheless.",
      "Ibtisam Salem, a single mother of five in her 50s who shares a small one-room apartment in Beirut with relatives who sleep on the floor, said: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for UNRWA we would die of starvation. ... They helped build my home, and they give me health care. My children went to their schools.\u201d",
      "Especially when it comes to food and hunger, needs worldwide are growing even as funding to address them shrinks.",
      "\u201cThis year, we have estimated around 343 million acutely food insecure people,\u201d said Carl Skau, WFP deputy executive director. \u201cIt\u2019s a threefold increase if we compare four years ago. And this year, our funding is dropping 40%. So obviously that\u2019s an equation that doesn\u2019t come together easily.\u201d",
      "Billing itself as the world's largest humanitarian organization, WFP has announced plans to cut about a quarter of its 22,000 staff.",
      "One question is how the United Nations remains relevant as an aid provider when global cooperation is on the outs, and national self-interest and self-defense are on the upswing.",
      "The United Nations is not alone: Many of its aid partners are feeling the pinch. Groups like GAVI, which tries to ensure fair distribution of vaccines around the world, and the Global Fund, which spends billions each year to help battle HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, have been hit by Trump administration cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "Some private-sector, government-backed groups also are cropping up, including the divisive Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been providing some food to Palestinians. But violence has erupted as crowds try to reach the distribution sites.",
      "No private-sector donor or well-heeled country \u2014 China and oil-rich Gulf states are often mentioned by aid groups \u2014 have filled the significant gaps from shrinking U.S. and other Western spending.",
      "The future of U.N. aid, experts say, will rest where it belongs \u2014 with the world body's 193 member countries.",
      "\u201cWe need to take that debate back into our countries, into our capitals, because it is there that you either empower the U.N. to act and succeed \u2014 or you paralyze it,\u201d said Achim Steiner, administrator of the U.N. Development Program.",

      "It\u2019s an unlikely setting for a yoga class. In Zimbabwe, the practice is rare and mostly found in the wealthy suburbs. Yet it is quietly taking root here in a beer tavern in Chitungwiza, a low-income town 30 kilometers (18 miles) outside the capital, Harare.",
      "The initiative is led by Actions Winya, a yoga instructor who saw how economic hardship and social pressures were damaging the mental health of people in his hometown.",
      "\u201cYoga is expensive \u2026 but we also got humans in the ghetto. They need mental wellness,\u201d said Winya, who usually teaches in affluent areas, charging between $30 and $100 a month.

      "Since 2023, Winya has been offering free weekend classes to some of those hardest hit by Zimbabwe\u2019s economic problems.",

      "Yoga, an ancient Indian practice, has become a multibillion-dollar industry and a daily ritual for millions around the world. The United Nations over a decade ago designated June 21 as International Day of Yoga.",
      "In Africa, other countries like Kenya and South Africa are introducing yoga to poorer communities, with the Indian government promoting its spread across the continent.",
      "Inside the tavern in Zimbabwe, mellow music played as about a dozen participants moved through poses. They had no mats, just a cold brick floor, but plenty of determination for inner peace. One mother tried to stay focused as her toddler dashed around, disrupting her poses.",
      "For 47-year-old John Mahwaya, the practice has been transforming. A father of four, he also supports relatives in the countryside, a responsibility he said once weighed heavily on his mental health.",
      "\u201cMy head was always spinning. I thought I was losing my mind, and the stress started causing back pains,\u201d he said. \u201cYoga helps me relax and clear my mind. I sleep peacefully these days.\u201d",

      "As they practiced, the sounds of township life seeped in. Taxi drivers shouted for passengers. Vendors pushed carts, calling out to potential customers.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t know why they\u2019re doing this,\u201d said Ellie, whose mother is diabetic, low on insulin and trapped on the outskirts of Tehran. She wants her mother to evacuate the city but cannot communicate that to her.",
      "A request for comment sent to the Iranian mission to the U.N. was not immediately answered.",
      "Most of the voices speak in English, though at least one spoke Farsi. If the caller tries to talk to it, the voice just continues with its message.",
      "A 30-year-old women living in New York, who heard the same message Ellie did, called it \u201cpsychological warfare.\u201d",
      "\u201cCalling your mom and expecting to hear her voice and hearing an AI voice is one of the most scary things I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d she said. \u201cI can feel it in my body.\u201d",
      "And the messages can be bizarre. One woman living in the U.K. desperately called her mom and instead got a voice offering platitudes.",
      "\u201cThank you for taking the time to listen,\u201d it said, in a recording that she shared with the AP. \u201cToday, I\u2019d like to share some thoughts with you and share a few things that might resonate in our daily lives. Life is full of unexpected surprises, and these surprises can sometimes bring joy while at other times they challenge us.\u201d",
      "Not all Iranians abroad encounter the robotic voice. Some said when they try to call family, the phone just rings and rings.",
      "Colin Crowell, a former vice president for Twitter\u2019s global policy, said it appeared that Iranian phone companies were diverting the calls to a default message system that does not allow calls to be completed.",
      "Amir Rashidi, an Iranian cybersecurity expert based in the U.S., agreed and said the recordings appeared to be a government measure to thwart hackers, though there was no hard evidence.",
      "He said that in the first two days of Israel\u2019s campaign, mass voice and text messages were sent to Iranian phones urging the public to gear up for \u201cemergency conditions.\u201d They aimed to spread panic \u2014 similar to mass calls that government opponents made into Iran during the war with Iraq in the 1980s.",
      "The voice messages trying to calm people \u201cfit the pattern of the Iranian government and how in the past it handled emergency situations,\u201d said Rashidi, the director of Texas-based Miaan, a group that reports on digital rights in the Middle East.",
      "Mobile phones and landlines ultimately are overseen by Iran\u2019s Ministry of Information and Communications Technology. But the country\u2019s intelligence services have long been believed to be monitoring conversations.",
      "\u201cIt would be hard for anybody else to hack. Of course, it is possible it is Israeli. But I don\u2019t think they have an incentive to do this,\u201d said Mehdi Yahyanejad, a tech entrepreneur and internet freedom activist.",
      "Marwa Fatafta, Berlin-based policy and advocacy director for digital rights group Access Now, suggested it could be \u201ca form of psychological warfare by the Israelis.\u201d She said it fits a past pattern by Israel of using extensive direct messaging to Lebanese and Palestinians during campaigns in Gaza and against Hezbollah.",
      "The messages, she said, appear aimed at \u201ctormenting\u201d already anxious Iranians abroad.",
      "When contacted with requests for comment, the Israeli military declined and the prime minister's office did not respond.",
      "Ellie is one of a lucky few who found a way to reach relatives since the blackout. She knows someone who lives on the Iran-Turkey border and has two phones \u2014 one with a Turkish SIM card and one with an Iranian SIM.",
      "He calls Ellie\u2019s mother with the Iranian phone \u2014 since people inside the country are still able to call one another \u2014 and presses it to the Turkish phone, where Ellie\u2019s on the line. The two are able to speak.",
      "\u201cThe last time we spoke to her, we told her about the AI voice that is answering all her calls,\u201d said Ellie. \u201cShe was shocked. She said her phone hasn\u2019t rung at all.\u201d",
      "Elon Musk said he has activated his satellite internet provider Starlink in Iran, where a small number of people are believed to have the system, even though it is illegal. Authorities are urging the public to turn in neighbors with the devices as part of an ongoing spy hunt. Others have illegal satellite dishes, granting them access to international news.",
      "M., a woman in the U.K., has been trying to reach her mother-in-law, who is immobile and lives in Tehran's northeast, which has been pummeled by Israeli bombardment throughout the week.",
      "When she last spoke to her family in Iran, they were mulling whether she should evacuate from the city. Then the blackout was imposed, and they lost contact. Since then she has heard through a relative that the woman was in the ICU with respiratory problems.",
      "When she calls, she gets the same bizarre message as the woman in the U.K., a lengthy mantra.",
      "\u201cClose your eyes and picture yourself in a place that brings you peace and happiness,\u201d it says. \u201cMaybe you are walking through a serene forest, listening to the rustle of leaves and birds chirping. Or you\u2019re by the seashore, hearing the calming sound of waves crashing on the sand.\u201d",

      "He said the damage caused overnight was \u201cunacceptable and did not represent a legitimate protest.\u201d",
      "What began as nationwide protests against changes to the social security system morphed Thursday night into people damaging the local airport and the facilities of banana giant Chiquita Brands, which fired thousands of striking workers in the province last month.",
      "Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino had said at the time that the banana workers\u2019 strike was illegal and included some 5,000 workers.",
      "On May 27, the government declared a state of emergency in the province without suspending constitutional protections.",
      "Last week, the government sent some 1,500 more police to the province with the objective clearing protest roadblocks. Security Minister Frank Abrego left open the possibility of sending more on Friday.",
      "But actions by masked people authorities described as criminals overnight led Mulino to announce Thursday night that he would meet with his Cabinet Friday to take action. The perpetrators forced their way into the airport in Changuinola, Bocas del Toro's main city, where they vandalized cars and started a fire in the local baseball stadium. They sacked Chiquita's shuttered facility and destroyed a local office of the National Civil Defense Service.",
      "Flights at the airport were still suspended Friday.",
      "Protests, marches and occasional roadblocks have stretched from one end of the country to the other as teachers, construction workers and other unions rejected changes the government said were necessary to keep the social security system solvent.",
      "Demonstrations have occasionally turned violent, but the forced entrance of people to the airport and banana facility overnight triggered Friday\u2019s government reaction.",
      "Earlier this month, Mulino brought in a Catholic archbishop and a rabbi to act as mediators with protesters.",
      "Last week, Panama\u2019s Congress approved a new law for the banana sector that was part of an agreement to end the strike by protecting workers\u2019 benefits like medical assistance and labor protections under the new social security regime.",

      "The verdict against RFE/RL\u2019s Farid Mehralizada and six journalists from Abzas Media, an independent Azerbaijani investigative outlet, marks the latest escalation in the country's crackdown on media. All seven journalists have dismissed the charges as politically motivated, and international rights groups have called for their release.",
      "Mehralizada, a journalist with RFE/RL's Azerbaijani service and an economist, was sentenced to nine years in prison, RFE/RL reported. Nine-year sentences were also handed to Abzas Media's director Ulvi Hasanli, chief editor Sevinj Abbasova (Vagifqizi) and investigative journalist Hafiz Babali. Reporters Nargiz Absalamova and Elnara Gasimova were sentenced to eight years in prison, and deputy director Mahammad Kekelov \u2014 to 7 1/2 years, Abzas Media said.",
      "Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in a statement Friday condemned the sentences as \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cthe outcome of a purely political trial based on fabricated charges, aimed at silencing voices that expose corruption and injustice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Azerbaijani authorities may imprison journalists, but they cannot imprison the truth,\" the group\u2019s editorial director Anne Bocand\u00e9 said. \u201cRSF calls for the immediate release of all Abzas Media defendants and urges international actors to intensify pressure on Baku.\u201d",

      "Six Abzas Media journalists were arrested in November 2023. The authorities claimed that they had found 40,000 euros in cash in the outlet's office in Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, and accused them of conspiring foreign currency into Azerbaijan.",
      "Mehralizada was arrested in May 2024 as part of the same case, even though both him and Abzas Media said that he never worked for the outlet. Later that year, authorities levied additional charges against Mehralizada and Azbas Media journalists, including illegal entrepreneurship, tax evasion, document forgery and others.",

Unfortunately, journalism in our country today is almost equated with terrorism.\u201d",
      "Weeks before Mehralizada's arrest, in March 2024, Azerbaijani authorities targeted another news outlet, Toplum TV, with raids and arrests on similar charges. In December 2024, Azerbaijani authorities arrested six more journalists on smuggling charges, including five of those working for the independent Meydan TV news outlet.",

      "There were people \u201cat risk, distressed, and in great need\u201d among the 500,000 forcibly returned from Iran to Herat this year, the agency said.",
      "\u201cMany require support to find food and shelter, get hold of everyday essentials, and connect with their families before travelling to their hometowns or villages,\u201d said Mark Calder, the agency's communications and advocacy director for Afghanistan. \u201cBut they are returning to a country in which basic services are already in crisis.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Everyone needs protein \u2014 it's vital for the growth, repair and maintenance of your muscles, bones and skin",
      "The human body needs protein. Proteins carry out countless functions inside cells and they are vital for the growth, repair and maintenance of muscles, bones and skin. And with food companies rolling out high-protein versions of a huge range of foods, including milkshakes and granola bars \u2014 and even pancakes and popcorn \u2014 you might be tempted to think you need to add more to your diet.",
      "But nutritionists say that if you are getting enough food, you are probably getting enough protein.",
      "\u201cAdding protein to foods is very beneficial \u2014 for the profits of that food,\u201d said Federica Amati, nutrition lead at Imperial College London and head nutritionist at the health science company ZOE. \u201cIt is not based on health, it is not backed by science.\u201d",
      "The amount of protein you need depends on your age, weight and personal nutritional needs and it is especially important for children and older adults to make sure they eat protein-rich foods. Here\u2019s what to know about how much protein you need and how to ensure you're getting it from the best sources.",
      "Protein is a macronutrient, or a basic kind of food like fat or carbohydrates that your body needs to function. There are thousands of proteins, assembled from smaller molecules called amino acids \u2014 most of which can be made by the body.",
      "\u201cBecause protein is so important, our body has adapted really well to making sure that it can reassemble and change the building blocks of these amino acids to make sure we have what we need, as long as we\u2019re eating adequate amounts of food,\u201d Amati said.",
      "Still, the body can't make all the amino acids, so some must come from food.",
      "The World Health Organization recommends that healthy adults get about 0.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight (0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight). That's roughly 60 grams for men and 50 grams for women per day, based on body weights of 165 pounds (75 kilograms) for men and 143 pounds (65 kilograms) for women.",
      "In most rich countries, the average adult gets far more, Amati said. Protein deficiencies are mostly seen in malnourished people on subsistence diet in poorer countries, she said.",
      "Bridget Benelam, a nutritionist with the British Nutrition Foundation, said it was important to get protein from different foods, like dairy, fish, beans, nuts, vegetables and meat. She said studies suggest vegetarians and vegans have lower protein intake than meat and fish eaters, but that their average protein levels are still OK.",
      "Having some protein at every meal is also a likely a good idea. \u201cIt appears to be better for preserving muscle function if you have some protein throughout the day, rather than just having it all in one meal,\u201d Benelam said.",
      "Plant-based sources of protein include foods such as beans, lentils, peas, nuts, seeds, tofu, tempeh and meat substitutes. Fish, meat, poultry, eggs and dairy foods such as milk and yogurt are also good sources of protein. Amati said that proteins from animal-based sources may be easier for the body to break down compared to plant-based proteins, which tend to have more fiber.",
      "\u201cIf you eat a piece of beef, you\u2019re getting protein and things like zinc and iron, but you\u2019re also getting more saturated fat,\u201d she said. In comparison, Amati said eating protein-rich foods like chickpeas or beans also provides the body with fiber, something that's lacking in most of our diets.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a specific health issue that requires you to have more protein, most people in countries like the U.S. and the U.K. do not need more,\u201d said Benelam of the British Nutrition Foundation.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has granted a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to keep Harvard University from hosting international students",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to keep Harvard University from hosting international students, delivering the Ivy League school another victory as it challenges multiple government sanctions amid a battle with the White House.",
      "The order from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston preserves Harvard's ability to host foreign students while the case is decided, but it falls short of resolving all of Harvard's legal hurdles to hosting international students. Notably, Burroughs said the federal government still has authority to review Harvard's ability to host international students through normal processes outlined in law.",
      "Harvard sued the Department of Homeland Security in May after the agency abruptly withdrew the school\u2019s certification to host foreign students and issue paperwork for their visas, skirting most of its usual procedures. The action would have forced Harvard\u2019s roughly 7,000 international students \u2014 about a quarter of its total enrollment \u2014 to transfer or risk being in the U.S. illegally. New foreign students would have been barred from coming to Harvard.",
      "The university said it was experiencing illegal retaliation for rejecting the White House\u2019s demands to overhaul Harvard policies related to campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Burroughs temporarily had halted the government's action hours after Harvard sued.",
      "Less than two weeks later, in early June, President Donald Trump tried a new strategy. He issued a proclamation to block foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard, citing a different legal justification. Harvard challenged the move, saying the president was attempting an end-run around the temporary court order. Burroughs temporarily blocked Trump's proclamation as well. That emergency block remains in effect, and Burroughs did not address the proclamation in her order Friday.",
      "\u201cWe expect the judge to issue a more enduring decision in the coming days,\u201d Harvard said Friday in an email to international students. \u201cOur Schools will continue to make contingency plans toward ensuring that our international students and scholars can pursue their academic work to the fullest extent possible, should there be a change to student visa eligibility or their ability to enroll at Harvard.\u201d",
      "The stops and starts of the legal battle have unsettled current students and left others around the world waiting to find out whether they will be able to attend America's oldest and wealthiest university.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s efforts to stop Harvard from enrolling international students have created an environment of \u201cprofound fear, concern, and confusion,\u201d the university said in a court filing. Countless international students have asked about transferring from the university, Harvard immigration services director Maureen Martin said.",
      "Still, admissions consultants and students have indicated most current and prospective Harvard scholars are holding out hope they\u2019ll be able to attend the university.",
      "For one prospective graduate student, an admission to Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Education had rescued her educational dreams. Huang, who asked to be identified only by her surname for fear of being targeted, had seen her original doctoral offer at Vanderbilt University rescinded after federal cuts to research and programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "Harvard stepped in a few weeks later with a scholarship she couldn't refuse. She rushed to schedule her visa interview in Beijing. More than a month after the appointment, despite court orders against the Trump administration's policies, she still hasn't heard back.",
      "\u201cYour personal effort and capability means nothing in this era,\u201d Huang said in a social media post. \u201cWhy does it have to be so hard to go to school?\u201d",
      "Trump has been warring with Harvard for months after the university rejected a series of government demands meant to address conservative complaints that the school has become too liberal and has tolerated anti-Jewish harassment. Trump officials have cut more than $2.6 billion in research grants, ended federal contracts and threatened to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status.",
      "On Friday, the president said in a post on Truth Social that the administration has been working with Harvard to address \u201ctheir largescale improprieties\" and that a deal with Harvard could be announced within the next week. \u201cThey have acted extremely appropriately during these negotiations, and appear to be committed to doing what is right,\u201d Trump's post said.",
      "Trump's administration first targeted Harvard's international students in April. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanded that Harvard turn over a trove of records related to any dangerous or illegal activity by foreign students. Harvard says it complied, but Noem said the response fell short and on May 22 revoked Harvard\u2019s certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.",
      "The sanction immediately put Harvard at a disadvantage as it competed for the world\u2019s top students, the school said in its lawsuit, and it harmed Harvard\u2019s reputation as a global research hub. \u201cWithout its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "The action would have upended some graduate schools that recruit heavily from abroad. Some schools overseas quickly offered invitations to Harvard\u2019s students, including two universities in Hong Kong.",
      "Harvard President Alan Garber previously said the university has made changes to combat antisemitism. But Harvard, he said, will not stray from its \u201ccore, legally-protected principles,\u201d even after receiving federal ultimatums.",

      "A judge could decide Friday whether to advance OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma's $7 billion-plus plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids",
      "OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma 's $7 billion-plus plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids will go before a judge Friday, potentially setting up votes on whether to accept it for local governments, people who became addicted to the drug and other groups.",
      "This month, 49 states announced they have signed on to the the proposal. Only Oklahoma, which has a separate settlement with the company, is not involved.",
      "U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Sean Lane could decide as soon as Friday whether to advance the nationwide settlement, which was hammered out in negotiations between the company, groups that have sued and representatives of members of the Sackler family who own the company.",
      "If Lane moves the plan forward as it's been presented, government entities, emergency room doctors, insurers, families of children born into withdrawal from the powerful prescription painkiller, individual victims and their families and others would have until Sept. 30 to vote on whether to accept the deal.",
      "The settlement is a way to avoid trials with claims from states alone that total more than $2 trillion in damages.",
      "If approved, the settlement would be among the largest in a wave of lawsuits over the past decade as governments and others sought to hold drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies accountable for the opioid epidemic that started rising in the years after OxyContin hit the market in 1996. The other settlements together are worth about $50 billion, and most of the money is to be used to combat the crisis.",
      "In the early 2000s, most opioid deaths were linked to prescription drugs, including OxyContin. Since then, heroin and then illicitly produced fentanyl became the biggest killers. In some years, the class of drugs was linked to more than 80,000 deaths, but that number dropped sharply last year.",
      "Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a version of Purdue\u2019s proposed settlement. The court found it was improper to protect members of the Sackler family from lawsuits over opioids, even though they themselves were not filing for bankruptcy protection.",
      "In the new version, groups that don\u2019t opt in to the settlement would still have the right to sue members of the wealthy family whose name once adorned museum galleries around the world and programs at several prestigious U.S. universities.",
      "Under the plan, the Sackler family members would give up ownership of Purdue. They resigned from the company\u2019s board and stopped receiving distributions from its funds before the company\u2019s initial bankruptcy filing in 2019. The remaining entity would get a new name and its profits would be dedicated to battling the epidemic.",
      "Most of the money would go to state and local governments to address the nation\u2019s addiction and overdose crisis, but potentially more than $850 million would go directly to individual victims. That makes it different from the other major settlements.",
      "The payments would not begin until after a hearing, likely in November, during which Judge Lane would be asked to approve the entire plan if enough of the affected parties agree.",

      "Music streaming service Deezer said Friday that it will start flagging albums with AI-generated songs, part of its fight against streaming fraudsters",
      "LONDON -- Music streaming service Deezer said Friday that it will start flagging albums with AI-generated songs, part of its fight against streaming fraudsters.",
      "Deezer, based in Paris, is grappling with a surge in music on its platform created using artificial intelligence tools it says are being wielded to earn royalties fraudulently.",
      "The app will display an on-screen label warning about \u201cAI-generated content\" and notify listeners that some tracks on an album were created with song generators.",
      "Deezer is a small player in music streaming, which is dominated by Spotify, Amazon and Apple, but the company said AI-generated music is an \u201cindustry-wide issue.\u201d It's committed to \u201csafeguarding the rights of artists and songwriters at a time where copyright law is being put into question in favor of training AI models,\" CEO Alexis Lanternier said in a press release.",
      "Deezer's move underscores the disruption caused by generative AI systems, which are trained on the contents of the internet including text, images and audio available online. AI companies are facing a slew of lawsuits challenging their practice of scraping the web for such training data without paying for it.",
      "According to an AI song detection tool that Deezer rolled out this year, 18% of songs uploaded to its platform each day, or about 20,000 tracks, are now completely AI generated. Just three months earlier, that number was 10%, Lanternier said in a recent interview.",
      "AI has many benefits but it also \"creates a lot of questions\" for the music industry, Lanternier told The Associated Press. Using AI to make music is fine as long as there's an artist behind it but the problem arises when anyone, or even a bot, can use it to make music, he said.",
      "Music fraudsters \u201ccreate tons of songs. They upload, they try to get on playlists or recommendations, and as a result they gather royalties,\u201d he said.",
      "Musicians can't upload music directly to Deezer or rival platforms like Spotify or Apple Music. Music labels or digital distribution platforms can do it for artists they have contracts with, while anyone else can use a \u201cself service\u201d distribution company.",
      "Fully AI-generated music still accounts for only about 0.5% of total streams on Deezer. But the company said it's \u201cevident\" that fraud is \u201cthe primary purpose\" for these songs because it suspects that as many as seven in 10 listens of an AI song are done by streaming \"farms\" or bots, instead of humans.",
      "Any AI songs used for \u201cstream manipulation\u201d will be cut off from royalty payments, Deezer said.",
      "AI has been a hot topic in the music industry, with debates swirling around its creative possibilities as well as concerns about its legality.",
      "Two of the most popular AI song generators, Suno and Udio, are being sued by record companies for copyright infringement, and face allegations they exploited recorded works of artists from Chuck Berry to Mariah Carey.",
      "Gema, a German royalty-collection group, is suing Suno in a similar case filed in Munich, accusing the service of generating songs that are \u201cconfusingly similar\u201d to original versions by artists it represents, including \u201cForever Young\u201d by Alphaville, \u201cDaddy Cool\u201d by Boney M and Lou Bega's \u201cMambo No. 5.\u201d",
      "Major record labels are reportedly negotiating with Suno and Udio for compensation, according to news reports earlier this month.",
      "To detect songs for tagging, Lanternier says Deezer uses the same generators used to create songs to analyze their output.",
      "\u201cWe identify patterns because the song creates such a complex signal. There is lots of information in the song,\u201d Lanternier said.",
      "The AI music generators seem to be unable to produce songs without subtle but recognizable patterns, which change constantly.",
      "\u201cSo you have to update your tool every day,\" Lanternier said. \"So we keep generating songs to learn, to teach our algorithm. So we\u2019re fighting AI with AI.\u201d",
      "Fraudsters can earn big money through streaming. Lanternier pointed to a criminal case last year in the U.S., which authorities said was the first ever involving artificially inflated music streaming. Prosecutors charged a man with wire fraud conspiracy, accusing him of generating hundreds of thousands of AI songs and using bots to automatically stream them billions of times, earning at least $10 million.",

      "North Carolina legislators have finalized a bill that would eliminate an interim greenhouse gas reduction mandate set in a landmark 2021 law",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina legislators finalized a bill Thursday that would eliminate an interim greenhouse gas reduction mandate set in a landmark 2021 law, while still directing regulators to aim to cancel out power plant carbon emissions in the state within the next 25 years.",
      "With some bipartisan support, the state Senate voted to accept the House version that would repeal the 2021 law's requirement that electric regulators take \u201call reasonable steps to achieve\u201d reducing carbon dioxide output 70% from 2005 levels by 2030. The law's directive to take similar steps to meet a carbon neutrality standard by 2050 would remain in place.",
      "The bill's Republican supporters pushing the new measure say getting rid of the interim goal benefits ratepayers asked to pay for future electric-production construction and is more efficient for Duke Energy, the state's dominant electric utility.",
      "The bill now goes to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, who can veto the measure, sign it or let it become law without his signature. Stein previously expressed concerns about the Senate version of the measure, worried that it could hurt electricity users and threaten the state\u2019s clean-energy economy. His office didn't immediately provide comment after Thursday's vote.",
      "With over a dozen House and Senate Democrats voting for the final version, the chances that any Stein veto could be overridden are higher. Republicans in charge of the General Assembly are only one House seat shy of a veto-proof majority.",
      "The bill also contains language that would help Duke Energy seek higher electric rates to cover financing costs to build nuclear or gas-powered plants incrementally, rather than wait until the project\u2019s end.",
      "The 2021 greenhouse gas law marked a rare agreement on environmental issues by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Republican lawmakers.",
      "At least 17 other states \u2014 most controlled by Democrats \u2014 have laws setting similar net-zero power plant emissions or 100% renewable energy targets, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. North Carolina and Virginia are the only ones from the Southeast.",
      "The legislation came about as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has proposed rolling back federal environmental and climate change policies, which critics say could boost pollution and threaten human health. Republicans are promoting them as ways to reduce the cost of living and boost the economy.",
      "The state Utilities Commission, which regulates rates and services for public utilities, already has pushed back the 2030 deadline \u2014 as the 2021 law allows \u2014 by at least four years. The panel acknowledged last year it was \u201cno longer reasonable or executable\u201d for Duke Energy to meet the reduction standard by 2030.",
      "Bill supporters say to meet the goal would require expensive types of alternate energy immediately. If the interim standard can be bypassed, GOP bill authors say, Duke Energy can assemble less expensive power sources now and moderate electricity rate increases necessary to reach the 2050 standard.",
      "\u201cOur residents shouldn\u2019t be saddled with higher power bills to satisfy arbitrary targets,\u201d Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said in a news release after the vote.",
      "Citing an analysis performed by a state agency that represents consumers before the commission, GOP lawmakers say removing the interim goal would reduce by at least $13 billion what Duke Energy would have to spend \u2014 and pass on to customers \u2014 in the next 25 years.",
      "Bill opponents question the savings figure given uncertainty in plant fuel prices, energy demand and construction costs. They say the interim goal still holds an aspirational purpose and was something that Duke Energy had agreed in 2021 to meet.",
      "Provisions in the measure related to recouping plant construction expenses over time would reduce accumulated borrowing interest.",
      "Environmental groups argue the financing option would benefit Duke Energy's bottom line on expensive projects even if they're never completed, and the bill broadly would prevent cleaner energy sources from coming online sooner. They also contend another bill section would shift costs to residential customers.",
      "\u201cThis bill is bad for all North Carolinians, whether they\u2019re Duke Energy customers or simply people who want to breathe clean air,\u201d North Carolina Sierra Club director Chris Herndon said after the vote while urging Stein to veto the measure.",
      "Bill support came from the North Carolina Chamber and a manufacturers' group, in addition to Duke Energy.",
      "\u201cWe appreciate bipartisan efforts by policymakers to keep costs as low as possible for customers and enable the always-on energy resources our communities need,\u201d the company said this week.",

      "Some segments of the U.S. restaurant industry don\u2019t support President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to eliminate federal taxes on tips",
      "Some segments of the U.S. restaurant industry don't support President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to eliminate federal taxes on tips, saying it would help too few people and obscure bigger issues in the way tipped workers are paid.",
      "The Independent Restaurant Coalition, which represents nearly 100,000 restaurant and bars, has appealed to Congress to reconsider the proposal, which is part of the president's spending bill. Even some workers who rely on tips say they oppose making them tax-deductible.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a huge hole in this concept of \u2018no tax on tips\u2019 because a lot of restaurant workers aren\u2019t receiving tips in the first place,\u201d said Elyanna Calle, a bartender in Austin, Texas, and president of the Restaurant Workers United union. \u201cIt\u2019s not helping most kitchen workers, and oftentimes those are the people who are being paid the least.\u201d",
      "For now, making tips tax-free appears to have broad support among lawmakers. Both Trump and his Democratic rival in last year's U.S. presidential election, former Vice President Kamala Harris, campaigned on the concept.",
      "The House included it in a tax cuts package approved last month. The bill would eliminate federal income taxes on tips for people working in jobs that have traditionally received them as long as they make less than $160,000 in 2025.",
      "The Senate Finance Committee passed a modified version on Monday. Senators capped deductions at $25,000 and want to phase them out for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000. Eligibility would be based on earnings as of Dec. 31, 2024.",
      "Both the House and Senate committee measures would apply through the 2028 tax year. The Finance Committee specified that \u201ccash tips\u201d qualify but said the term applied to tips paid in cash, charged to credit cards or received from other employees under a tip-sharing arrangement.",
      "Wary of wading into politics, many restaurant chains contacted by The Associated Press about tax-free tips didn\u2019t respond or referred questions to the National Restaurant Association, including Waffle House, The Cheesecake Factory, First Watch and the parent companies of Olive Garden, Applebee\u2019s and Chili\u2019s.",
      "The National Restaurant Association, a trade organization that represents nearly 500,000 U.S. restaurants and bars, applauded the House's passage of Trump's spending bill and said it wants to see tax-free tips. The association estimates the measure would benefit more than 2 million servers and bartenders.",
      "But the U.S. restaurant industry has more than 12 million workers, including dishwashers and chefs, according to government data. The Independent Restaurant Coalition says the \u201cno tax on tips\u201d proposal leaves out too many of those workers.",
      "The coalition wants Congress to eliminate taxes on service charges, which are being used to compensate employees at an increasing number of restaurants. Around 15% of U.S. restaurants add some form of service charge to customers\u2019 bills, according to the National Restaurant Association.",
      "George Skandalos, a pizza restaurant owner in Moscow, Idaho, was tired of seeing servers count out hundreds of dollars of tips at the end of the night while people in the kitchen scrubbed the floor on their hands and knees. So he started experimenting with different compensation models.",
      "Skandalos tried pooling servers\u2019 tips and distributing them but ran into rules preventing that. He tried raising his menu prices and explaining that a percentage of each order was going to employee compensation, but customers didn\u2019t understand and kept tipping.",
      "Skandalos now has a gratuity-free policy at his restaurant, Maialina. He charges a 20% service fee that is distributed to all employees and helps pay for benefits like paid vacation and parental leave. The vast majority of customers appreciate the effort, he said.",
      "Skandalos said \u201cno tax on tips\u201d doesn\u2019t acknowledge restaurants like his that are trying to distribute pay more equally. He would like to see service charges exempted from taxes.",
      "\u201cThis bill is a very good start in terms of trying to leave more money in people\u2019s pocketbooks, but now let\u2019s finish what we started and make it a great thing for the restaurant industry overall,\u201d he said.",
      "But Ted Pappageorge, the secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 in Las Vegas, said restaurants should just pay their kitchen workers more to compensate for servers earning tips.",
      "\u201c\u2019No tax on tips\u2019 is an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to deliver something to working class folks,\u201d he said.",
      "Pappageorge wants Congress to take up a separate bill introduced by Nevada Democrat Steven Horsford that would eliminate taxes on tips but also require restaurants to pay workers at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. In 43 states, restaurants are currently allowed to pay tipped workers as little as $2.13 per hour.",
      "Yolanda Garcia, a barista at Resorts World in Las Vegas and a member of the Culinary Workers Union, also supports Horsford\u2019s bill. Garcia said she makes $33,000 a year, including up to $600 per month in tips. Tips are never guaranteed, she said, but if they were tax-free, it would help make up for that uncertainty.",
      "\u201cIt would help me get more groceries. Right now, the price of everything has gone up,\u201d Garcia said.",
      "Calle, the Austin bartender and union leader, said she also benefits from tips, but they\u2019re inconsistent. She suspects tipping would decline if the tax-free provision passes, because customers will resent it.",
      "For Calle, the underlying problem that must be solved is low base pay.",
      "\u201cI think that if we continue to make the shift into relying on tips for people, it gives incentives for companies to not raise wages,\u201d she said.",

      "MADRID -- Spain has rejected a NATO proposal to spend 5% of gross domestic product on defense needs that\u2019s due to be announced next week, calling it \u201cunreasonable.\u201d",
      "Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, in a letter sent on Thursday to NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, said that Spain \u201ccannot commit to a specific spending target in terms of GDP\u201d at next week\u2019s NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands.",
      "Most U.S. allies in NATO are on track to endorse U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s demand that they invest 5% of GDP on their defense and military needs. In early June, Sweden and the Netherlands said that they aim to meet the new target.",
      "A NATO official on Thursday said that discussions between allies were ongoing about a new defense spending plan.",
      "\u201cFor Spain, committing to a 5% target would not only be unreasonable, but also counterproductive, as it would move Spain away from optimal spending and it would hinder the EU\u2019s ongoing efforts to strengthen its security and defense ecosystem,\u201d S\u00e1nchez wrote in the letter seen by The Associated Press.",
      "Spain was the lowest spender in the 32-nation military alliance last year, directing less than 2% of its GDP on defense expenditure.",
      "S\u00e1nchez said in April that the government would raise defense spending by 10.5 billion euros ($12 billion) in 2025 to reach NATO\u2019s previous target of 2% of GDP.",
      "On Thursday, S\u00e1nchez called for \u201ca more flexible formula\u201d in relation to a new spending target \u2014 one that either made it optional or left Spain out of its application.",
      "S\u00e1nchez wrote that the country is \u201cfully committed to NATO,\" but that meeting a 5% target \u201cwould be incompatible with our welfare state and our world vision.\" He said that doing so would require cutting public services and scaling back other spending, including toward the green transition.",
      "Instead, Spain will need to spend 2.1% of GDP to meet the Spanish military\u2019s estimated defense needs, S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "At home, corruption scandals that have ensnared S\u00e1nchez's inner circle and family members have put the Spanish leader under increasing pressure to call an early election, even from some allies. In April, when S\u00e1nchez announced that Spain would reach NATO's previous 2% spending target, the move angered some coalition members further to the left of his Socialist Party.",
      "NATO allies agreed to spend 2% of GDP on military expenditure after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. But the alliance's plans for defending Europe and North America against a Russian attack require investments of at least 3%.",
      "The aim now is to raise the bar to 3.5% for core defense spending on tanks, warplanes, air defense, missiles and hiring extra troops. A further 1.5% would be spent on things like roads, bridges, ports and airfields so armies can deploy more quickly, as well as preparing societies for possible attack.",
      "Rutte had been due to table a new proposal on Friday aimed at satisfying Spain. European allies and Canada are keen to finalize the spending pledge before the summit, and not leave it open for any heated debate that might drag the meeting out.",
      "Poland and the Baltic countries \u2014 Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 have already publicly committed to 5%, and Rutte has said that most allies were ready to endorse the goal.",
      "But Spain isn't alone among NATO's low spenders. Belgium, Canada and Italy will also struggle to hike security spending by billions of dollars.",
      "A big question still to be answered is what time frame countries will be given to reach an agreed-upon new spending goal.",
      "A target date of 2032 was initially floated, but Rutte has said that Russia could be ready to launch an attack on NATO territory by 2030.",

      "MILAN -- Global sales of personal luxury goods are \u201dslowing down but not collapsing,\u201d according to a Bain & Co. consultancy study released Thursday.",
      "Personal luxury goods sales that eroded to 364 billion euros ($419 billion) in 2024 are projected to slide by another 2% to 5% this year, the study said, citing threats of U.S. tariffs and geopolitical tensions triggering economic slowdowns.",
      "\u201cStill, to be positive in a difficult moment \u2014 with three wars, economies slowing down, inequality at a maximum ever \u2014 it\u2019s not a market in collapse,\u2019\u2019 said Bain partner and co-author of the study Claudia D\u2019Arpizio. \u201cIt is slowing down but not collapsing.\u201d",
      "Alongside external headwinds, luxury brands have alienated consumers with an ongoing creativity crisis and sharp price increases, Bain said. Buyers have also been turned off by recent investigations in Italy that revealed that sweatshop conditions in subcontractors making luxury handbags.",
      "Sales are slipping sharply in powerhouse markets the United States and China, the study showed. In the U.S., market volatility due to tariffs has discouraged consumer confidence. China has recorded six quarters of contraction on low consumer confidence.",
      "The Middle East, Latin America and Southeast Asia are recording growth. Europe is mostly flat, the study showed.",
      "This has created a sharp divergence between brands that continue with strong creative and earnings growth, such as the Prada Group, which posted a 13% first-quarter jump in revenue to 1.34 billion euros, and brands like Gucci, where revenue was down 24% to 1.6 billion euros in the same period.",
      "Gucci owner Kering last week hired Italian automotive executive Luca De Meo, the former CEO of Renault, to mount a turnaround. The decision comes as three of its brands \u2014 Gucci, Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta \u2014 are launching new creative directors.",

      "\u201cAll of these factors resonate well together in a market like luxury when you are in a phase where growth is still the name of the game, but you also need to make the company more nimble in terms of costs, and turn around some of the brands,\u2019\u2019 she said.",
      "Brands are also making changes to minimize the impact of possible U.S. tariffs. These include shipping directly from production sites and not warehouses and reducing stock in stores.",
      "With aesthetic changes afoot \u201cstuffing the channels doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense,\u2019\u2019 D\u2019Arpizio said.",
      "Still, many of the headwinds buffering the sector are out of companies\u2019 control.",
      "\u201cMany of these (negative) aspects are not going to change soon. What can change is more clarity on the tariffs, but I don\u2019t think we will stop the wars or the political instability in a few months,\u2019\u2019 she said, adding that luxury consumer confidence is tied more closely to stock market trends than geopolitics.",
      "President of Italian luxury brand association Altagamma Matteo Lunelli underlined hat the sector recorded overall growth of 28% from 2019-2024, \u201cplacing us well above pre-pandemic levels.\u201d",
      "While luxury spending is sensitive to global turmoil, it is historically quick to rebound, powered by new markets and pent-up demand.",
      "The 2008-2009 financial crisis plummeted sales of luxury apparel, handbags and footwear from 161 billion euros to 147 billion euros over two years. The market more than recovered the losses in 2010 as it rebounded by 14%, with an acceleration in the Chinese market. Similarly, after sales plunged by 21% during the pandemic, pent-up spending powered sales to new records.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Farmers, cattle ranchers and hotel and restaurant managers breathed a sigh of relief last week when President Donald Trump ordered a pause to immigration raids that were disrupting those industries and scaring foreign-born workers off the job.",
      "\u201cThere was finally a sense of calm,\u2019\u2019 said Rebecca Shi, CEO of the American Business Immigration Coalition.",
      "That respite didn\u2019t last long.",
      "On Wednesday, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin declared, \u201cThere will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine (immigration enforcement) efforts. Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability.\u2019\u2019",
      "The flipflop baffled businesses trying to figure out the government\u2019s actual policy, and Shi says now \u201cthere's fear and worry once more.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not a way to run business when your employees are at this level of stress and trauma,\" she said.",
      "Trump campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally \u2014 an issue that has long fired up his GOP base. The crackdown intensified a few weeks ago when Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, gave the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a quota of 3,000 arrests a day, up from 650 a day in the first five months of Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Suddenly, ICE seemed to be everywhere. \u201cWe saw ICE agents on farms, pointing assault rifles at cows, and removing half the workforce,\u2019\u2019 said Shi, whose coalition represents 1,700 employers and supports increased legal immigration.",
      "One ICE raid left a New Mexico dairy with just 20 workers, down from 55. \u201cYou can\u2019t turn off cows,\u2019\u2019 said Beverly Idsinga, the executive director of the Dairy Producers of New Mexico. \u201cThey need to be milked twice a day, fed twice a day.\u2019\u2019",
      "Claudio Gonzalez, a chef at Izakaya Gazen in Los Angeles\u2019 Little Tokyo district, said many of his Hispanic workers \u2014 whether they're in the country legally or not \u2014 have been calling out of work recently due to fears that they will be targeted by ICE. His restaurant is a few blocks away from a collection of federal buildings, including an ICE detention center.",
      "\u201cThey sometimes are too scared to work their shift,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cThey kind of feel like it\u2019s based on skin color.\u201d",
      "In some places, the problem isn\u2019t ICE but rumors of ICE. At cherry-harvesting time in Washington state, many foreign-born workers are staying away from the orchards after hearing reports of impending immigration raids. One operation that usually employs 150 pickers is down to 20. Never mind that there hasn\u2019t actually been any sign of ICE in the orchards.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve not heard of any real raids,\u2019\u2019 said Jon Folden, orchard manager for the farm cooperative Blue Bird in Washington\u2019s Wenatchee River Valley. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard a lot of rumors.\u2019\u2019",
      "Jennie Murray, CEO of the advocacy group National Immigration Forum, said some immigrant parents worry that their workplaces will be raided and they\u2019ll be hauled off by ICE while their kids are in school. They ask themselves, she said: \u201cDo I show up and then my second-grader gets off the school bus and doesn\u2019t have a parent to raise them? Maybe I shouldn\u2019t show up for work.\u2019\u2019",
      "The horror stories were conveyed to Trump, members of his administration and lawmakers in Congress by business advocacy and immigration reform groups like Shi\u2019s coalition. Last Thursday, the president posted on his Truth Social platform that \u201cOur great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace.\u201d",
      "It was another case of Trump\u2019s political agenda slamming smack into economic reality. With U.S. unemployment low at 4.2%, many businesses are desperate for workers, and immigration provides them.",
      "According to the U.S. Census Bureau, foreign-born workers made up less than 19% of employed workers in the United States in 2023. But they accounted for nearly 24% of jobs preparing and serving food and 38% of jobs in farming, fishing and forestry.",
      "\u201cIt really is clear to me that the people pushing for these raids that target farms and feed yards and dairies have no idea how farms operate,\u201d Matt Teagarden, CEO of the Kansas Livestock Association, said Tuesday during a virtual press conference.",
      "Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, estimated in January that undocumented workers account for 13% of U.S. farm jobs and 7% of jobs in hospitality businesses such as hotels, restaurants and bars.",
      "The Pew Research Center found last year that 75% of U.S. registered voters \u2014 including 59% of Trump supporters \u2014 agreed that undocumented immigrants mostly fill jobs that American citizens don\u2019t want. And an influx of immigrants in 2022 and 2023 allowed the United States to overcome an outbreak of inflation without tipping into recession.",
      "In the past, economists estimated that America\u2019s employers could add no more than 100,000 jobs a month without overheating the economy and igniting inflation. But economists Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson of the Brookings Institution calculated that because of the immigrant arrivals, monthly job growth could reach 160,000 to 200,000 without exerting upward pressure on prices.",
      "Now Trump\u2019s deportation plans \u2014 and the uncertainty around them \u2014 are weighing on businesses and the economy.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, a significant portion of our industry relies on immigrant labor \u2014 skilled, hardworking people who\u2019ve been part of our workforce for years. When there are sudden crackdowns or raids, it slows timelines, drives up costs, and makes it harder to plan ahead,\u201d says Patrick Murphy, chief investment officer at the Florida building firm Coastal Construction and a former Democratic member of Congress. \u201c We\u2019re not sure from one month to the next what the rules are going to be or how they\u2019ll be enforced. That uncertainty makes it really hard to operate a forward-looking business.\u201d",
      "Adds Douglas Holtz Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now president of the conservative American Action Forum think tank: \u201cICE had detained people who are here lawfully and so now lawful immigrants are afraid to go to work ... All of this goes against other economic objectives the administration might have. The immigration policy and the economic policy are not lining up at all.\u2019\u2019",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Buss family's decision to sell a controlling stake in the Los Angeles Lakers at an eye-popping franchise valuation of $10 billion marks the end of nearly a half-century when one of the most valuable properties in the sports world was run by an eccentric father and his sometimes squabbling children.",
      "With high-living playboy Jerry Buss and current team governor Jeanie Buss in charge, the glamorous Lakers essentially have been the professional sports equivalent of a quirky family business for two generations.",
      "Sports became increasingly corporate and monolithic in the 21st century while franchise values skyrocketed and ever-more-wealthy titans seized control of this perpetual growth industry.",
      "Just not around Hollywood's favorite basketball team, with its gold uniforms and 17 golden trophies.",
      "\u201cThe majority of businesses in this country are family-owned businesses,\u201d Jeanie Buss told NPR earlier this year in a rare interview to promote a Netflix comedy series based on her career. \u201cAnd everybody has a family. If you\u2019re in business with them, (disagreements) happen. But at the end of the day, what brings you together is the team or the business, and you want to build something successful.\u201d",
      "The Lakers and the Buss clan have been inextricable since 1979 \u2014 the longest active ownership tenure in the NBA \u2014 but Mark Walter's stunning sports coup Wednesday effectively ends this improbable era. A person with knowledge of the agreement confirmed it to The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because neither side immediately announced the deal.",
      "The sale should make an extraordinarily wealthy woman of Jeanie Buss, one of Jerry\u2019s seven acknowledged children and a longtime employee of his various sporting concerns.",
      "And that's the biggest reason many Lakers fans are rejoicing: This lavish sale comes with the knowledge that the buyers have exponentially more resources than the Buss family \u2014 and Walter has showed he knows how to spend it intelligently.",
      "Walter, who heads a group that already bought 27% of the Lakers in 2021, has a sterling reputation in Southern California for his group's stewardship of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The iconic baseball team has become a perpetual World Series contender with bold, aggressive financial moves grounded in smart organizational planning ever since Walter's firm, Guggenheim Partners, paid $2 billion to wrest the Dodgers from the reviled Frank McCourt in 2012.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s really committed to the city of Los Angeles in various ways, and sports is something that he\u2019s very passionate about, and certainly Los Angeles sports,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \"Speaking (as) a Dodger employee, he\u2019s very competitive and he\u2019s going to do everything he can to produce a championship-caliber team every single year and make sure the city feels proud about the Lakers and the legacy that they\u2019ve already built with the Buss family.\u201d",
      "In the Buss era, the Lakers could sell prospective players on their trophies, sunny Los Angeles and that family-business intimacy. While that was enough to win big in most decades, Walter\u2019s group epitomizes the modern, deep-pocketed approach to building a consistent championship contender. Guggenheim Partners reportedly has $325 billion under management, with Walter particularly leveraging insurance investments to pursue gains across the breadth of the sports world.",
      "\u201cHe does everything he can to provide resources, support,\" Roberts said. \u201cHe wants to win. He feels that the fans, the city, deserve that. I think that that\u2019s never lost, and it\u2019s more of challenging us always. How do we become better and not complacent or stagnant, to continue to stay current with the market, the competition to win?\u201d",
      "Before this sale, the Buss siblings were not thought to be particularly wealthy, at least not by team owner standards. Jeanie Buss occasionally appeared to balk at writing certain checks \u2014 ask any Lakers fan about Alex Caruso's departure \u2014 and the team's front office and infrastructure are thought to be on the NBA's smaller side.",
      "The new ownership group's wealth could knock down some financial barriers in the restrictive, apron era of salary cap management. It definitely will provide the Lakers with every resource in scouting, player development and any other competitive avenue to assemble a team commensurate with the Lakers' brand.",
      "\u201cI know that my sister Jeanie would have only considered selling the Lakers organization to someone she knows and trusts would carry on the Buss legacy, started by her father Dr. Buss,\u201d Magic Johnson wrote on social media. \u201cNow she can comfortably pass the baton to Mark Walter, with whom she has a real friendship and can trust. She\u2019s witnessed him build a winning team with the Dodgers and knows that Mark will do right by the Lakers team, organization, and fans!\u201d",
      "There is a familial symmetry to these two transactions 46 years apart: Jerry Buss got a steal when he bought the Lakers, and his kids might end up with the wealthiest deal in sports history when they sell.",
      "Jerry Buss was a chemist and USC instructor who heavily leveraged his real estate investments to buy the Lakers, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, the Forum arena and a large ranch from Jack Kent Cooke for $67.5 million. Buss loved a good time almost as much as he loved basketball, and he built the Showtime era of Lakers basketball on Magic and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, but also on his own undeniable charisma and hunger for titles.",
      "Buss and his front offices then landed Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in the 1990s, ushering in a second championship era. All told, the Lakers reached the NBA Finals in 16 of Jerry Buss' 34 seasons as their primary owner, winning a whopping 10 championships.",
      "Jeanie Buss succeeded her father as the Lakers\u2019 governor upon his death in 2013. Her brother, Jim, was the Lakers' head of basketball operations until Jeanie fired him in February 2017 and installed Johnson and Rob Pelinka, Bryant's former agent. Pelinka gradually took over basketball operations and presided over a string of Lakers-worthy player additions, including LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Luka Doncic.",
      "The Lakers won the 2020 championship in the Florida bubble, and they reached the 2024 Western Conference finals. Their seismic trade to acquire Doncic last winter rejuvenated the franchise, positioning the Slovenian superstar as the Lakers' centerpiece for years after the matchless career of James, who has essentially confirmed he will return in the fall for his record 23rd NBA season.",
      "Jeanie Buss hasn't yet announced her reasons for agreeing to sell her inheritance, and she will remain the Lakers' governor \u2014 at least for now, because a governor must own at least 15% of the team. But she is following a recent trend of high-profile NBA owners ceding their teams to ownership groups with even more extensive resources.",
      "Buss is close friends with both Mark Cuban, who sold his majority ownership of the Dallas Mavericks for $3.5 billion, and Wyc Grousbeck, who sold the Boston Celtics for $6.1 billion.",

      "\u201cAll I know is I don\u2019t want to be hit again,\u201d Corwin said. \u201cIf I go through this twice, I\u2019m done as a duck farmer.\u201d",
      "For months, Corwin and his reduced staff have been thoroughly sanitizing the farm\u2019s dozens of barns, clearing out hay and debris, and replacing feeders, ventilation systems, wooden and metal structures and more.",
      "At the end of May, the first wave of roughly 900 young ducks arrived from a nearby farm where they had been carefully raised in quarantine these last few months.",
      "Another batch of 900 arrived last week and some 900 more will soon make their way to the roughly 140-acre (55-hectare) farm in Aquebogue, which is tucked among the vineyards and agricultural lands of Long Island\u2019s North Fork, about 80 miles (129 km) east of Manhattan.",
      "By the end of next summer, Corwin hopes the first ducks will be ready to be processed and brought to market.",
      "But he says he won't rush the reopening. It will be many more months \u2014 if ever \u2014 before the operation, which processed about 1 million ducks for consumption annually, returns to full capacity, he said.",
      "\u201cI keep telling people I\u2019m running a high hurdle race,\u201d Corwin said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot a lot of steps to get back to where we were.\u201d",
      "Since 2022, the H5N1 strain of bird flu has been detected in all 50 states, leading to more than 1,700 recorded outbreaks affecting nearly 175 million birds, according to the most recent tally from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The outbreak at Corwin\u2019s farm shows how this strain has inflicted more damage on a wider range of species than past variants, said Dr. Gavin Hitchener, director of Cornell University\u2019s Duck Research Laboratory, located a short drive away in Eastport.",
      "Ducks have generally been less prone to serious illness and death than chickens and turkeys, he said. H5N1 is also vexing American cattle farmers after the virus jumped from fowl to cattle last year.",
      "\u201cSomething has changed in the virus\u2019 makeup that has made it more virulent,\u201d Hitchener said.",
      "With no end to the bird flu pandemic in sight, Corwin worries he won't be able to weather another outbreak.",
      "The farm received federal compensation for its euthanized ducks, but it wasn\u2019t nearly close to the market value of the birds \u2014 never mind the expense of rebuilding in a high cost region that also includes the Hamptons, he said.",
      "Corwin hopes the federal government will, at long last, require poultry operators to vaccinate their livestock against bird flu. It\u2019s an uphill climb, given the Trump administration\u2019s deep skepticism of vaccines and the long-standing opposition of far larger, industrial poultry operations, he acknowledged.",
      "\u201cI would sleep an awful lot better at night. But right now I\u2019m very nervous,\u201d Corwin said. \u201cWe\u2019re just playing with deck chairs on the Titanic.\u201d",
      "The ducks newly arrived to the farm are crucial to its revival.",
      "Fully grown and approaching breeding age, the cohort of white Pekin ducks were all that survived from the more than 15,000 eggs state officials allowed the farm to spare from the winter culling after they tested negative for bird flu.",
      "That means they and their progeny carry on the unique genetic makeup the farm has honed over generations of selective breeding to build its reputation.",
      "Established in 1908 by Corwin\u2019s great-grandfather, Crescent Duck Farms has been the island\u2019s lone commercial duck operation for the better part of a decade. But in the early 1960s, Long Island boasted more than 100 farms producing about two-thirds of the nation\u2019s duck output.",
      "\u201cI feel I owe it to the ancestors of farmers who\u2019ve been here all these years and have come this far to just make a go of it,\u201d Corwin said. \u201cI want to make Long Island proud.\u201d",

      "Redemption Holding Co. has completed its acquisition of Utah-based Holladay Bank & Trust, making it the first time a bank has been owned by a Black-led investment group in the Western U.S.",
      "The newly formed Redemption Bank will be the first Black-owned bank in U.S. history not physically located within an economically vulnerable community, the first in the Rockies, and the only one located in the Black-banking desert that stretches from Houston to Los Angeles.",
      "The bank, with roughly $65 million in assets, will focus primarily on doing commercial lending and creating a dedicated team for small business loans.",
      "Ashley Bell, CEO and chairman of Redemption Holding, told The Associated Press the company will launch a fully digital platform at the end of summer, enabling it to service small businesses across the country. The company will remain headquartered in Salt Lake City, a city with a Black population of under 3%.",

      "MDIs began in the 19th century when Black Americans, who could not get loans from mainstream banks, organized their banks and associations. They also provided financial services and economic opportunities in low-income neighborhoods.",
      "The Civil Rights Movement spurred the creation of more MDIs as Black people experienced a financial boom and began to build stronger communities. In the late 1980s, Congress officially created MDIs through the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA).",

      "The Buss family has agreed to sell the controlling stake of the Los Angeles Lakers to TWG Global CEO Mark Walter, doing so with a franchise valuation of $10 billion \u2014 the highest ever for a professional sports franchise, a person with knowledge of the agreement said Wednesday.",
      "As part of the deal, Jeanie Buss \u2014 whose family has had control of the Lakers since her father bought the team in 1979 \u2014 intends to remain as team governor, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither side immediately announced details.",
      "It is not clear how much more of the Lakers that Walter is acquiring. He was part of a group that bought 27% of the Lakers in 2021. Jeanie Buss will still own at least 15% of the Lakers once this transaction is completed; by NBA rule, a governor must have at least that much of an ownership stake.",
      "Walter and TWG Global already had the controlling interest in the Los Angeles Dodgers, Premier League club Chelsea, the Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League, and \u2014 through TWG Motorsports \u2014 owns several auto racing teams including Cadillac Formula 1.",
      "Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said news of the sale to Walter marks \"a very exciting day for the Lakers, for the city of Los Angeles.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very competitive and he\u2019s going to do everything he can to produce a championship-caliber team every single year and make sure the city feels proud about the Lakers and the legacy that they\u2019ve already built with the Buss family,\" Roberts said.",
      "ESPN first reported the agreement.",
      "\u201cMark Walter is the best choice and will be the best caretaker of the Laker brand,\u201d Lakers legend Magic Johnson, a business partner of Walter's and someone extremely close to Jeanie Buss, posted on social media. \u201cThe proof is in the pudding on what he\u2019s been able to accomplish with the LA Dodgers. Mark has been nothing short of a winner notching 2 World Series and 11 NL West divisional titles in the last 12 years!\u201d",
      "Johnson said he is certain Jeanie Buss made the deal only after being convinced that Walter will do right by the Lakers.",
      "\u201cLaker fans should be (ecstatic),\u201d Johnson said. \u201cA few things I can tell you about Mark \u2014 he is driven by winning, excellence, and doing everything the right way. AND he will put in the resources needed to win! I can understand why Jeanie sold the team to Mark Walter because they are just alike \u2014 they are competitive people, have big hearts, love to give back, and both prefer to be behind the scenes. This makes all the sense in the world.\u201d",
      "Walter is intensely private in shunning the spotlight. He is CEO of the financial services firm Guggenheim Partners, which is estimated to have more than $325 billion in assets. Johnson is among Guggenheim\u2019s investors.",
      "The agreement for the sale of the Lakers comes about three months after Bill Chisholm agreed to buy the Boston Celtics with an initial valuation of $6.1 billion \u2014 which was going to be a record, topping the previous mark of $6.05 billion sale for the NFL's Washington Commanders. The Celtics' sale is not yet finalized, pending final approval by the NBA's board of governors. That board is scheduled to meet in Las Vegas next month.",
      "And now, the Lakers are sold with a valuation of $10 billion \u2014 not just a record, but a total smashing of the previous mark.",
      "The Lakers have been in the control of the Buss family for 46 years, the longest of any current NBA franchise. Herb Simon bought the Indiana Pacers \u2014 currently in the NBA Finals \u2014 in 1983, the second-longest current ownership of an NBA club.",
      "Jerry Buss bought the Lakers for $67.5 million and made it to the NBA Finals 16 times out of his 34 seasons leading the club, winning 10 championships in that span. When he died in 2013, ownership of the Lakers went into a trust controlled by Buss\u2019 six children \u2014 who all worked for the Lakers in various capacities for several years.",
      "Eventually, the family began clashing over control. An agreement was struck in 2017 calling for Jeanie Buss to serve as controlling owner, ending a battle that included her going to court after her brothers Jim and Johnny Buss called for a board meeting that she interpreted as a challenge to her power \u2014 shortly after she removed Jim Buss as the Lakers\u2019 executive vice president of basketball operations.",

      "The U.S. government plans to open what amounts to a fly factory by the end of the year to breed millions of the insects in Texas near the border with Mexico as part of an effort to keep a flesh-eating parasite from infesting American cattle",
      "The U.S. government plans to open what amounts to a fly factory by the end of the year, announcing its intent Wednesday to breed millions of the insects in Texas near the border with Mexico as part of an effort to keep a flesh-eating parasite from infesting American cattle.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said sterile male New World screwworm flies bred at the $8.5 million facility would be released into the wild to mate with females and prevent them from laying the eggs in wounds that become flesh-eating larva. It would be only the second facility for breeding such flies in the Western Hemisphere, joining one in Panama that had largely kept the flies from migrating further north until last year.",
      "The fly's appearance in southern Mexico late last year has worried agriculture and cattle industry officials and veterinarians' groups, and the U.S. last month suspended imports of live cattle, horses and bison from Mexico. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also plans to spend $21 million to convert a facility for breeding fruit flies near Mexico's southernmost border with Guatemala into one for breeding sterile New World screwworm flies, but it won't be ready for 18 months.",
      "The U.S. bred and released sterile New World screwworm flies into the wild decades ago, and it was largely banished from the country in the 1960s. Previously, it had been an annual scourge for cattle ranchers and dairy farmers, particularly in the Southeast.",
      "\u201cThe United States has defeated NWS before, and we will do it again,\" Rollins said. She held a news conference at Moore Air Base with Texas and cattle industry officials.",
      "Mexican Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegu\u00e9 said in a post Wednesday on X that Rollins\u2019 plan \u201cseems to us a positive step in different aspects, it will strengthen the joint Mexico-US work.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe trust the enthusiasm for cooperation that Secretary Rollins mentioned, and based on objective results and the reports from the USDA mission visiting us this week, we will be able to restart exports of our cattle as soon as possible,\" he said.",
      "The new Texas facility would be built at Moore Air Base, less than 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the Mexico border, and the USDA said it would also consider building a companion fly-breeding center there so that up to 300 million flies could be produced a week. The Panama facility breeds about 100 million a week, and the one in Mexico could breed as many as 100 million as well.",
      "The USDA has said the flies have been detected as close as 700 miles (1,127 kilometers) from the U.S. border, and some U.S. agriculture and cattle industry officials have worried that if the migration isn't checked, the flies could reach the border by the end of summer. Pressure from the U.S. prompted Mexico to step up efforts to control the fly's spread.",
      "Buck Wehrbein, a Nebraska cattle rancher and the president of the National Beef Cattlemen's Association, said Moore Air Base had a fly-breeding facility in the 1960s that helped eradicate it in the U.S.",
      "While there are treatments for New World screwworm infestations, cattle industry officials still worry that farmers and ranchers could see huge economic losses. They, agriculture officials and scientists also said the larva can infest any mammal, including household pets, and it has occasionally been seen in humans.",
      "\u201cThe only way to protect the American cattle herd from the devastating threat of New World screwworm is by having a sufficient supply of sterile flies to push this pest away from our border,\u201d Wehrbein said.",
      "Texas officials said they are grateful that the U.S. is taking the screwworm threat serious and pleased with the plans for combating it, including the new facility in Texas.",
      "Officials in other states are watching the fly's migration as well and see having sterile male flies outnumber the non-sterile one is crucial to checking its migration.",
      "\u201cWe have a real concern about wildlife because of their ability to cross the border unchecked somewhat, whether it's feral pigs, deer, wild cattle, whatever the case may be,\u201d Kansas Animal Health Commissioner Justin Smith said in a recent interview. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity for them to be our exposure risk.\u201d",

      "Kade Anderson pitched a three-hitter in his second straight dominant start, and LSU moved within a win of its second national championship in three years with a 1-0 victory over Coastal Carolina in Game 1 of the College World Series finals",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Kade Anderson made his final start in an LSU uniform on Saturday night, and it was a masterpiece that put the Tigers on the cusp of their second national championship in three years.",
      "Anderson pitched a three-hitter and struck out 10 in a 1-0 victory over Coastal Carolina in Game 1 of the College World Series finals, his second straight dominant performance in Omaha.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen all year,\u201d LSU coach Jay Johnson said. \u201cHe\u2019s the best pitcher in the country. And did it again tonight. That\u2019s been on the regular every game one of the entire season. Everybody got to see what we\u2019ve seen and known for an entire season.\u201d",
      "The Chanticleers (56-12) lost for the first time in 27 games and must win Sunday to force a third and deciding game Monday night.",
      "LSU (52-15) made Steven Milam's RBI single in the first inning stand up with Anderson getting stronger as the game progressed against a Coastal Carolina team that had won its first three CWS games by a combined 24-9.",
      "\u201cIf it was going to be easy, there would be more than one national champion,\u201d Chanticleers coach Kevin Schnall said. \"We\u2019ve got to regroup. We\u2019ve won 26 in a row. Let\u2019s just call it is what it is \u2014 the odds were not in our favor to go 28-0 and win this national championship.\"",
      "Anderson, a lefty projected to be a top-three pick in next month's MLB amateur draft, threw 130 pitches and was just as good as he was in LSU's CWS opener against Arkansas last weekend. He has allowed one run and six hits and struck out 17 in 16 innings in Omaha.",
      "Anderson grew up in Madisonville, Louisiana, as a big fan of LSU baseball. Asked how often he dreamed of a CWS performance like Saturday's and winning a title, he said, \u201cProbably every night.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat wasn't necessarily to end the College World Series,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one more that we\u2019re preparing for. We\u2019ll go back to the hotel and start preparing for that one as well.\u201d",
      "Against the Chanticleers he had to deal with traffic on the basepaths after issuing three of his five walks in the first two innings and hitting two batters. He was up to the challenge. The Chanticleers were 0 for 9 with runners in scoring position.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the College World Series. You\u2019re going to pitch with runners on base,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best teams in the country, and that\u2019s one of the best teams in the country. They do a great job of finding their way on base. And they did a few times tonight.\u201d",
      "Anderson (12-1) walked pinch-hitter Domenico Tozzi with two outs in the ninth, prompting a mound visit from pitching coach Nate Yeskie. Anderson then got Wells Sykes to fly out to end the game. Anderson and catcher Luis Hernandez embraced, and then their teammates mobbed them behind the mound to celebrate the first complete-game shutout in the CWS since 2022.",
      "Anderson worked around two walks in the first inning, got out of the third when Sebastian Alexander was caught stealing third base, and he struck out three in a row after Blagen Pado\u2019s double leading off the fourth.",
      "After he gave up LSU's early run, Coastal Carolina\u2019s Cameron Flukey (8-2) matched zeroes with Anderson from the second to sixth inning. Flukey limited the Tigers to four hits, walked two and struck out nine before turning the ball over to Dominick Carbone to start the seventh.",
      "The Tigers are 16-0 when they have a lead at any point when Anderson is pitching. It was Anderson's second shutout of the season. He threw 135 pitches in a 2-0 win over Oklahoma on April 3.",
      "Anderson said he wasn't bothered by the conditions. The temperature was 97 degrees at first pitch with a gusty wind blowing out to left.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s the real benefit of playing in Louisiana,\u201d he said. \u201cGrowing up there, this was honestly not nearly as bad as it was in the super regional.\u201d",
      "LSU will try to lock up its eighth national title Sunday.",
      "Coastal Carolina won the championship in its first trip to Omaha in 2016 and is seeking to become the fifth school to win the title in each of its first two trips to the CWS, but the first since Michigan in 1962.",
      "Schnall reminded reporters that in 2016, Arizona left-hander JC Cloney threw a shutout in Game 1 of the finals and Coastal Carolina came back to win the next two.",
      "\u201cAgain, we\u2019ve got to respond, rebound, regroup,\u201d Schnall said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Jacob Morrison pitching tomorrow. Answer the bell.\u201d",

      "Earnhardt had his wife and two young daughters in tow with him as he made the celebratory walk to victory lane. Oldest daughter Isla Rose clutched the checkered flag while youngest Nicole Lorraine soaked in the scene from her dad's arms.",
      "\u201cI love that they just get to experience things about NASCAR,\u201d Earnhardt said. \u201cI had such a great time growing up as a kid in this sport, just running around here. I want them to have that opportunity and understand that this is a place where they could create opportunities for themselves down the road.\u201d",
      "The win continued a banner season for the NASCAR Hall of Fame driver \u2014 who swept two races at Pocono as a driver in 2014 \u2014 after JR Motorsports and reigning Xfinity Series champion Justin Allgaier qualified for the season-opening Daytona 500 and secured their Cup Series debut.",
      "Earnhardt won two Daytona 500s, in 2004 and 2014, and 26 races overall.",
      "His side hustle Saturday was made a bit easier with Zilisch behind the wheel. Zilisch, who turns 19 in July, raced to his second Xfinity victory of the season and third of his young career. He won his Xfinity debut last year at Watkins Glen International.",
      "Earnhardt even pitched in during the race and tossed tires over the wall during pit stops.",
      "\u201cMidway through the race man, I was feeling it,\u201d Earnhardt said.",
      "Zilisch took the win down to the wire and finally passed Jesse Love with five laps left in the race. Love finished second.",
      "\u201cDale Junior, not too bad on the box,\u201d Zilisch said. \u201cPretty cool to have him up there. Getting him a 1-for-1 win as crew chief is pretty awesome.\u201d",
      "Even with the victory, it just might be one-and-done on the pit box for Earnhardt.",

      "The Panthers in fact celebrated so hard that the Stanley Cup itself got a little banged up. The silver chalice that has endured bumps and bruises throughout its 131-year existence was cracked at the bottom of the bowl the night of Florida's clinching Game 6 win over Edmonton, though Barkov noted the team hasn't received any harsh reprimands from the keepers of the Cup or the Hockey Hall of Fame.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019ve seen worse,\u201d he quipped. \u201cI think every year they have to fix some part of it. But yeah, don\u2019t be stupid. Don\u2019t take it to the ocean, stuff like that. We should know the rules by now.\u201d",

      "All three players have expressed their desire to stay in Florida.",
      "Bennett, who led all players with 15 postseason goals, said at the Miami nightclub E11even that he's not leaving. Marchand has publicly petitioned Zito to give him a contract.",

      "\u201cYou're going to have a different roster each and every year,\" he said, \"but hopefully the core of guys, we can continue building. With that being said, we've got some unbelievable players that are up for contracts that I hope they get every single cent they can because that's what you want for your best friends. It's time to cash in for some of those boys. Hopefully it's here.\u201d",

      "Only two teams remain. For one game. Game 7.",
      "The NBA season ends Sunday night when the Indiana Pacers visit the Oklahoma City Thunder to decide which team will hoist the Larry O'Brien Trophy, take over for the Boston Celtics as champions and become the league's seventh different title winner in the last seven years. It's the first winner-take-all game in the NBA since 2016, when Cleveland beat Golden State.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very much looking forward to Game 7,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cThe last time we\u2019ve had one of these in the finals, I think, was \u201916. These are special moments certainly for both teams but for our league, for the game, for the worldwide interest in the game. It\u2019s a time to celebrate.\u201d",
      "Yes, but only one team will celebrate Sunday night.",
      "For the Pacers, it would be a first NBA title and the capper to a season that started with Indiana banged up and getting off to a 10-15 record through the first 25 games. No team has ever been below .500 that deep into a season and went on to win a championship.",
      "For the Thunder, it would be a first NBA title \u2014 kind of, sort of, Seattle won one in 1979 and even though the franchise moved to Oklahoma City from there, the Thunder don't recognize it as one of their own \u2014 and wrap up a season in which the team scored more points than any other club in NBA history and posted the best record.",
      "\u201cWe have to understand the work is done and we have to trust the work,\u201d Oklahoma City coach Mark Daigneault said Saturday, the final practice day of the season. \u201cThe muscle is built. We have to flex that muscle. That\u2019s what tomorrow will come down to for us.\u201d",
      "It has been the epitome of a back-and-forth series, with both teams having the lead at some point. Indiana led 1-0 and 2-1; Oklahoma City led 3-2 but got blown out in Game 6, its first chance at winning the title.",
      "So, here we are, tied at 3-3, one game away from a decision.",
      "\u201cGrateful for the opportunity,\u201d Thunder guard Jalen Williams said. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing I can say is throughout the whole entire thing, you always have to remain grateful for where you are because there\u2019s a lot of NBA players that will trade their spot with me right now. That\u2019s how I look at it. But as far as history, I want to be on the good side of that, for sure.\u201d",
      "Oklahoma City has looked every bit the part of a championship contender all year; going 68-14 in the regular season cemented the Thunder into the favorite's role. Being the best team in the regular season is for this very privilege, to play host for Game 7.",
      "The Pacers peaked at the right time and took the more circuitous route here. But they've already started this series with a win in Oklahoma City. They see no reason why it can't end the same way.",
      "\u201cI think we just have done a great job of just staying together,\" Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton said. \"There\u2019s not a group of guys I\u2019d rather go to war with. I\u2019m really excited to compete with these guys in a Game 7, and it\u2019s going to be a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "The strained right calf is still an issue for Haliburton, but he played in Game 6 with the injury and \u2014 no surprise \u2014 he's going to play in Game 7.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty much in the same standpoint I was before Game 6,\u201d Haliburton said. \u201cA little sore. Good thing I only had to play like 23 minutes. I\u2019ve been able to get even more treatment and do more things. Just trying to take care of it the best I can. But I\u2019ll be ready to go for Game 7.\u201d",
      "Counting all games this season, Oklahoma City\u2019s two lowest-scoring outputs were 81 points against Milwaukee and 91 points against Indiana.",
      "The Bucks game was in the NBA Cup final.",
      "The Pacers game was Game 6, when OKC had a chance to win the NBA title.",
      "So, in the two \u201cchampionship\u201d games the Thunder have played this season, they\u2019re averaging 86 points. In all other games, they\u2019re averaging 119.7 points.",
      "\u201cWe obviously have to get better offensively,\u201d Thunder guard and NBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cLast game, clearly, was not good enough and not going to cut it, and we know that. We watch film for those type of things. You have games like that. Now, it sucks to have it at that stage obviously, but we know we have to be better, for sure.\u201d",

      "A Connecticut man whose parents were kidnapped after he took part in a $245 million Bitcoin theft has pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges and has agreed to testify against his co-defendants, according to court documents that were unsealed this week.",
      "Veer Chetal, 19, from Danbury, Connecticut, was one of three men charged with stealing 4,100 Bitcoins from a victim in Washington, D.C., in an elaborate online scam last August. The trio lived large after the heist, spending millions of dollars on cars, jewelry, rental mansions and nightclub parties, prosecutors say.",
      "A week after the theft, Chetal's parents were assaulted and kidnapped briefly in Danbury in a failed ransom plot aimed at Chetal, who the attackers believed had a large amount of cryptocurrency, authorities said.",
      "Chetal's criminal case was unsealed on Monday in federal court in Washington, revealing his guilty pleas in November and his agreement to cooperate with federal authorities investigating the Bitcoin theft. It also revealed new allegations that he was involved in about 50 similar thefts that raked in another $3 million between November 2023 and September 2024.",
      "Another man charged in the Bitcoin theft, Malone Lam, was also among 13 people indicted by a federal grand jury in May in an alleged online racketeering conspiracy involving cryptocurrency thefts across the U.S. and overseas that netted more than $260 million, including the $245 million Bitcoin theft.",
      "Chetal is facing 19 to 24 years in prison, a fine between $50,000 and $500,000 and restitution to the victim that has yet to be determined, according federal sentencing guidelines and his plea agreement.",
      "His lawyer, David Weinstein, declined to comment, saying Chetal's case is still pending.",
      "In September, federal agents with a search warrant raided Chetal's apartment in Brunswick, New Jersey, and his parents' home in Danbury in connection with the $245 million Bitcoin heist. Authorities said they found more than $500,000 in cash, expensive jewelry and watches and high-end clothing. Federal agents also said Chetal had $39 million worth of cryptocurrency that he turned over to investigators.",
      "Authorities alleged Chetal, Lam and Jeandiel Serrano were involved in online \u201csocial engineering\u201d attacks against cryptocurrency holders. Lam would send victims alerts about unauthorized attempts to access their crypto accounts, while the others would call the victims posing as representatives from well-known companies like Google and Yahoo and gain access to their accounts, authorities said.",
      "Messages seeking comment were left with lawyers for Lam and Serrano on Friday.",
      "A week after the theft, six Florida men were accused of kidnapping Chetal's parents in broad daylight in Danbury. One of them crashed a car into the parents' Lamborghini, while others pulled up in a van, police said. The attackers forced the couple out of their vehicle, beat them, put them in the van and tied them up, police said.",
      "The plot was foiled, and the attackers were arrested quickly because there were eyewitnesses who immediately called police, and an off-duty FBI agent happened to be driving by at the time of the kidnapping, authorities said. Federal agents said a seventh man who was later arrested in connection with the kidnapping had previously gotten into a dispute with Chetal that turned physical at a Miami nightclub.",
      "The attack on the couple is part of an increasing trend worldwide in robbers using violence to steal cryptocurrency.",
      "Chetal, who was attending Rutgers University in New Jersey at the time of the $245 million theft and later withdrew, was born in India and came to the U.S. with his family when he was 4 years old in 2010, according to court documents. His father was granted a foreign worker's visa, and his wife and children obtained related dependent visas.",
      "Federal authorities said Chetal could face deportation as a result of the criminal case.",
      "Authorities say Chetal's father lost his job at Morgan Stanley because of the kidnapping and his son's connection to it.",
      "Chetal was initially released from federal custody on his own recognizance. But a judge ordered him detained until trial earlier this year after federal prosecutors said they discovered Chetal was involved in another crypto theft worth $2 million in October that he didn't tell them about, after he had begun cooperating with federal authorities.",

      "According to a report published this week, Cybernews researchers have recently discovered 30 exposed datasets that each contain a vast amount of login information \u2014 amounting to a total of 16 billion compromised credentials. That includes user passwords for a range of popular platforms including Google, Facebook and Apple.",
      "Sixteen billion is roughly double the amount of people on Earth today, signaling that impacted consumers may have had credentials for more than one account leaked. Cybernews notes that there are most certainly duplicates in the data and so \u201cit's impossible to tell how many people or accounts were actually exposed.\u201d",
      "It's also important to note that the leaked login information doesn't span from a single source, such as one breach targeting a company. Instead, it appears that the data was stolen through multiple events over time, and then compiled and briefly exposed publicly, which is when Cybernews reports that its researchers discovered it.",

      "As the war between Israel and Iran hits the one-week mark, Iranians have spent nearly half of the conflict in a near-communication blackout, unable to connect not only with the outside world but also with their neighbors and loved ones across the country",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- As the war between Israel and Iran hits the one-week mark, Iranians have spent nearly half of the conflict in a near-communication blackout, unable to connect not only with the outside world but also with their neighbors and loved ones across the country.",
      "Civilians are left unaware of when and where Israel will strike next, despite Israeli forces issuing warnings through their Persian-language online channels. When the missiles land, disconnected phone and web services mean not knowing for hours or days if their family or friends are among the victims. That\u2019s left many scrambling on various social media apps to see what\u2019s happening \u2014 again, only a glimpse of life able to reach the internet in a nation of over 80 million people.",
      "Activists see it as a form of psychological warfare for a nation all-too familiar with state information controls and targeted internet shutdowns during protests and unrest.",
      "\u201cThe Iranian regime controls the information sphere really, really tightly,\u201d Marwa Fatafta, the Berlin-based policy and advocacy director for digital rights group Access Now, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe know why the Iranian regime shuts down. It wants to control information. So their goal is quite clear.\u201d",
      "But this time, it\u2019s happening during a deadly conflict that erupted on June 13 with Israeli airstrikes targeting nuclear and military sites, top generals and nuclear scientists. At least 657 people, including 263 civilians, have been killed in Iran and more than 2,000 wounded, according to a Washington-based group called Human Rights Activists.",
      "Iran has retaliated by firing 450 missiles and 1,000 drones at Israel, according to Israeli military estimates. Most have been shot down by Israel\u2019s multitiered air defenses, but at least 24 people in Israel have been killed and hundreds others wounded. Guidance from Israeli authorities, as well as round-the-clock news broadcasts, flows freely and consistently to Israeli citizens, creating in the last seven days an uneven picture of the death and destruction brought by the war.",
      "The Iranian government contended Friday that it was Israel who was \u201cwaging a war on truth and human conscience.\" In a post on X, a social media platform blocked for many of its citizens, Iran's Foreign Ministry asserted Israel banned foreign media from covering missile strikes.",
      "The statement added that Iran would organize \u201cglobal press tours to expose Israel's war crimes\u201d in the country. Iran is one of the world\u2019s top jailer of journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and in the best of times, reporters face strict restrictions.",
      "Internet-access advocacy group NetBlocks.org reported on Friday that Iran had been disconnected from the global internet for 36 hours, with its live metrics showing that national connectivity remained at only a few percentage points of normal levels. The group said a handful of users have been able to maintain connectivity through virtual private networks.",
      "Those lucky few have become lifelines for Iranians left in the dark. In recent days, those who have gained access to mobile internet for a limited time describe using that fleeting opportunity to make calls on behalf of others, checking in on elderly parents and grandparents, and locating those who have fled Tehran.",
      "The only access to information Iranians do have is limited to websites in the Islamic Republic. Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s state-run television and radio stations offer irregular updates on what\u2019s happening inside the country, instead focusing their time on the damage wrought by their strikes on Israel.",
      "The lack of information going in or out of Iran is stunning, considering that the advancement of technology in recent decades has only brought far-flung conflicts in Ukraine, the Gaza Strip and elsewhere directly to a person's phone anywhere in the world.",
      "That direct line has been seen by experts as a powerful tool to shift public opinion about any ongoing conflict and potentially force the international community to take a side. It has also turned into real action from world leaders under public and online pressure to act or use their power to bring an end to the fighting.",
      "But Mehdi Yahyanejad, a key figure in promoting internet freedom in Iran, said that the Islamic Republic is seeking to \u201cpurport an image\u201d of strength, one that depicts only the narrative that Israel is being destroyed by sophisticated Iranian weapons that include ballistic missiles with multiple warheads.",
      "\u201cI think most likely they\u2019re just afraid of the internet getting used to cause mass unrest in the next phase of whatever is happening,\u201d Yahayanejad said. \u201cI mean, some of it could be, of course, planned by the Israelis through their agents on the ground, and some of this could be just a spontaneous unrest by the population once they figure out that the Iranian government is badly weakened.",

      "U.K. lawmakers have backed a bill to allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives in a historic vote in Parliament that takes it a step nearer to becoming law",
      "LONDON -- U.K. lawmakers on Friday approved a bill to allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives in a historic vote in Parliament that takes it a step nearer to becoming law.",
      "Members of Parliament voted 314-291 to back the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill following an impassioned and respectful debate. The majority of 23 was less than the 55 when they last voted on the issue in November, meaning that some lawmakers changed their minds in the intervening months.",
      "Since November, the bill has been scrutinized, leading to some changes in the proposed legislation, which has been shepherded through Parliament by Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater rather than the government.",
      "\u201cI appreciate it's a huge moment for the country.\u201d she told Sky News after the vote. \u201cIt was a huge sense of relief because this is the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "It's not quite law yet as the bill now goes to the unelected House of Lords, which can amend or delay policy, though it can\u2019t overrule the lower chamber.",
      "The vote is potentially the biggest change to social policy since abortion was partially legalized in 1967.",
      "The bill would allow terminally ill adults over age 18 in England and Wales, who are deemed to have less than six months to live, to apply for an assisted death. This particular bill doesn\u2019t apply to Northern Ireland and Scotland, the latter of which is holding its own vote on the issue.",
      "Perhaps the most important change to the bill from last November was the dropping of the requirement that a judge sign off on any decision. Many in the legal profession had objected.",
      "Now any request would be subject to approval by two doctors and a panel featuring a social worker, senior legal figure and psychiatrist.",
      "Changes were also made to ensure the establishment of independent advocates to support people with learning disabilities, autism or mental health conditions and the creation of a disability advisory board.",
      "Having received the go-ahead from doctors and the panel, the terminally ill person would have to be capable of taking the fatal drugs themselves.",
      "Another big change made was that \u201cno person,\u201d including doctors, social care workers and pharmacists, will be obliged to take part.",
      "For months, the bill has divided lawmakers, political parties, as well as the country.",
      "Proponents of the bill argued that those with a terminal diagnosis must be given a choice at the end of their lives to relieve their suffering. They also said that the current situation discriminates against the poor as wealthy individuals can already travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones die.",
      "However, opponents warned that the most vulnerable people in society, such as the disabled and older people, could be at risk of being coerced, directly or indirectly, into ending their lives to save money or relieve the burden on family members.",
      "Supporters of both sides all agreed of the need to make improvements in palliative care and greater investments in hospices to ease suffering.",
      "Passions were running high outside of Parliament where hundreds of people gathered to make their voices heard.",
      "Supporters were dressed in clothing emblazoned with the phrase \u201cCampaign for Dignity in Dying,\u201d while opponents held up banners urging lawmakers not to make the state-run National Health Service the \u201cNational Suicide Service.\u201d",
      "The legislation now goes to the unelected House of Lords, Any amendments would then go back to the House of Commons.",
      "Backers of the bill say implementation will take four years, rather than the initially suggested two. That means it could become law in 2029, around the time that the next general election must be held.",
      "There is clearly no consensus in the Cabinet about the measure.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer backed the bill on Friday, while his health secretary, Wes Streeting, voted against.",
      "The government has said it will respect the outcome.",
      "However, it's not clear what the cost implications are, or how it would impact the NHS, hospice care and the legal system.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves health care practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances.",

      "Summer gets its official start in the Northern Hemisphere with the arrival of the summer solstice",
      "Peak sunshine has arrived in the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 the summer solstice.",
      "Friday is the longest day of the year north of the equator, where the solstice marks the start of astronomical summer. It's the opposite in the Southern Hemisphere, where it is the shortest day of the year and winter will start.",
      "The word \u201csolstice\u201d comes from the Latin words \u201csol\u201d for sun and \u201cstitium\u201d which can mean \u201cpause\u201d or \u201cstop.\u201d The solstice is the end of the sun's annual march higher in the sky, when it makes its longest, highest arc. The bad news for sun lovers: It then starts retreating and days will get a little shorter every day until late December.",
      "People have marked solstices for eons with celebrations and monuments, including Stonehenge, which was designed to align with the sun's paths at the solstices. But what is happening in the heavens? Here\u2019s what to know about the Earth\u2019s orbit.",
      "As the Earth travels around the sun, it does so at an angle relative to the sun. For most of the year, the Earth\u2019s axis is tilted either toward or away from the sun. That means the sun\u2019s warmth and light fall unequally on the northern and southern halves of the planet.",
      "The solstices mark the times during the year when this tilt is at its most extreme, and days and nights are at their most unequal.",
      "During the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s summer solstice, the upper half of the earth is tilted toward the sun, creating the longest day and shortest night of the year. This solstice falls between June 20 and 22.",
      "Meanwhile, at the winter solstice, the Northern Hemisphere is leaning away from the sun \u2014 leading to the shortest day and longest night of the year. The winter solstice falls between December 20 and 23.",
      "During the equinox, the Earth\u2019s axis and its orbit line up so that both hemispheres get an equal amount of sunlight.",
      "The word equinox comes from two Latin words meaning equal and night. That\u2019s because on the equinox, day and night last almost the same amount of time \u2014 though one may get a few extra minutes, depending on where you are on the planet.",
      "The Northern Hemisphere\u2019s spring \u2014 or vernal \u2014 equinox can land between March 19 and 21, depending on the year. Its fall \u2013 or autumnal \u2014 equinox can land between Sept. 21 and 24.",
      "On the equator, the sun will be directly overhead at noon. Equinoxes are the only time when both the north and south poles are lit by sunshine at the same time.",
      "These are just two different ways to carve up the year.",
      "While astronomical seasons depend on how the Earth moves around the sun, meteorological seasons are defined by the weather. They break down the year into three-month seasons based on annual temperature cycles. By that calendar, spring starts on March 1, summer on June 1, fall on Sept. 1 and winter on Dec. 1.",

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 \u201cHave you seen the cats?\u201d",
      "That's a common refrain in my household because our two felines, Maple and Juniper, can venture outside through a flap in the backdoor. Like many other London house cats, they're free to come and go, roaming the surrounding backyards and beyond, equipped with microchips to identify them if they get lost.",
      "If your cat likes to prowl outdoors for long stretches, or your dog has a tendency to run off, it can be distressing when they don't return as expected.",
      "If you're worried about your furry friend's whereabouts, technology can help you keep tabs on them.",
      "Dedicated pet trackers are collar-worn devices that typically use GPS signals to pinpoint the location of the animal wearing them. They use a 4G cellphone signal or your home Wi-Fi connection to relay the position to a smartphone app.",
      "There are many products on the market. Tractive, Jiobit and Pawfit are among brands that offer trackers for both dogs and cats. Devices for the latter are generally smaller and lighter.",
      "Dog trackers with integrated collars are available from Fi and Whistle. PetTracer is a cat collar that uses both GPS and radio signals from a home base station. FitBark, also for dogs, has an Apple Watch app to monitor location and other activity.",
      "Garmin has a range of GPS dog collars that work with handheld devices resembling walkie-talkies, but they're pricey and aimed at outdoors enthusiasts like hunters.",
      "Most trackers let you designate a safe zone on a map, usually your house and surrounding area, and alert you if your pet has left it.",
      "They usually operate on the 4G LTE spectrum commonly used by wireless carriers. It typically has the longest range of any cellular signal, said Andrew Bleiman, Tractive's executive vice president for North America.",
      "That means strong connectivity in most of Europe and North America \u201cunless you\u2019re in a really far flung place like the middle of a national park,\u201d Bleiman said.",
      "Exact price depends on brand and model. Most devices sell for less than $100. However, keep in mind you'll also have to pay a subscription fee for the cell service to function.",
      "While that could cost $100 or more a year, for some pet owners it's worth the \u201cpeace of mind,\u201d Bleiman said.",
      "The collars usually have a built-in rechargeable battery but battery life varies. Most will be last at least two to three days before they need charging, and a lot longer in ideal conditions.",
      "One big factor is signal strength. The battery will drain faster if the device has to work harder to pick up the GPS or connect to Wi-Fi. Some save power by not sending coordinates in the safe zone.",
      "Like fitness watches for humans, pet tracking apps offer health and activity monitoring features. You can see how long your cat or dog has spent resting or exercising on a daily or hourly basis.",
      "But be aware, a tracker is \u201cnot going to keep your pet in the backyard,\" Bleiman said. It will only \"alert you when they leave the virtual fence area that you set up.\u201d",
      "This One TechTip was inspired by Maple, who once went AWOL for days. It turned out he was hanging out in a backyard 10 doors down the street. We only found out after the residents got hold of a pet microchip scanner to look up our contact details to let us know so we could retrieve him.",
      "Tractive provided a loaner device to try. Using the included breakaway collar, we put it on Maple, who clearly didn\u2019t like it at first. He dashed out the back door and jumped through a hole in the fence.",
      "Over the next day, I used the Tractive app to monitor his movements. It showed his travels back and forth onto various neighboring properties. He came back to rest for a few hours around midnight, went out to prowl again around 3 a.m, then came back after an hour to nap some more.",
      "It was fascinating to see where he was spending his time. According to the app's \u201cheatmap,\" one of Maple's favorite spots was the same backyard where we had to retrieve him previously.",
      "About 24 hours after I attached the Tractive collar on Maple, I noticed he was no longer wearing it. It had somehow come off.",
      "If you can't find your pet's exact location, or the device gets lost, Tractive has a \u201cradar\u201d feature to pinpoint it with your phone's Bluetooth. Other brands have similar features.",
      "On the app's map, I could see it was in a nearby backyard and that I was getting closer because the circle was getting bigger. But I couldn\u2019t figure out where it was and, not wanting to disturb the neighbors, I gave up.",
      "Bleiman recommends using a harness for cats that don't like collars, but I'm not convinced.",
      "It's common for cats and dogs to be implanted with microchips, with the details added to a database. That makes it much easier to reunite owners with lost dogs and cats, even if they've strayed hundreds of miles away or gone missing for years.",
      "Pet microchips, about the size of a grain of rice implanted just below the skin, are legally required in some European countries. There's no federal law in the U.S., though some places like Hawaii now require them, so check with state or local authorities.",
      "But there's some confusion about what microchips can do. Because they don't have a power supply, they can't be tracked in real time. Whoever finds your pet would need to take it to a vet or a shelter to can scan the device for contact details.",
      "Many pet owners use Bluetooth trackers like Apple's Air Tags, Samsung's SmartTags or similar devices from Tile, Cube and Chipolo, which rely on low-power signals relayed by passing smartphones.",
      "Bluetooth trackers have a range of 100 to 500 feet (30 to 150 meters), depending on the model. The batteries last for months if not longer, and there's no need to pay for a subscription.",
      "However, they're not specifically marketed for pets. That hasn't stopped pet owners, judging from many recommendations they've posted in online forums.",
      "Chipolo advises that its round plastic trackers are only for \u201cin-house pets like house-trained cats and smaller dogs\u201d and warns against using them on \"larger dog breeds and outdoor cats.\"",
      "Still, they can be a solution for some pet owners.",
      "\u201cBluetooth is a totally reasonable solution if you\u2019re in a downtown urban core,\u201d Bleiman said. \u201cBut pets move fast. And if you\u2019re in a wooded park, or you\u2019re in a suburban area \u2014 let alone a more rural or wilderness area \u2014 it\u2019s pretty unlikely your pet is going to be close to a Bluetooth device.\"",

    "story": [
      "For European drone manufacturers, being able to say that their equipment has been tried in war by Ukrainian forces is becoming a sales pitch",
      "LE BOURGET, France -- About once a month, French drone manufacturer Henri Seydoux makes what has become a necessary pilgrimage for many in his business \u2014 he goes to Ukraine.",
      "Because for drone technology, there is no harder place to survive than the frontlines of the war against Russia\u2019s invasion, where both sides are using unmanned aerial machines of all shapes and sizes to kill and to observe, reshaping modern warfare.",
      "And because the battlefields also bristle with electronic countermeasures and weapons to confuse, jam and shoot down drones, Ukraine has also become an extreme real-life proving ground for advances in drone technology, some of which has started to spill over into non-military sectors.",
      "For manufacturers, being able to say that their drones and related equipment have been battle-tried and tested by Ukrainian forces is becoming a sales pitch as they market their wares not just to national defense departments, but also to police forces, border authorities, rescue services and civilian users.",
      "\u201cWhen we say, \u2018This is a good machine, it works,\u2019 people can believe us or not. But when it\u2019s guys in Ukraine and others saying they\u2019re happy, it has greater value,\" says Bastien Mancini, president and co-founder of French drone manufacturer Delair, which has teamed up with European defense contractor KNDS to supply Ukrainian forces with 100 exploding drones. KNDS' sales literature notes that they are \u201ccombat-proven.\"",
      "Mancini says civilian users of Delair's other non-military drones \u201csee things that work in Ukraine and say to themselves, \u2018It resists jamming, it resists the loss of a radio connection and whatnot and so it\u2019s going to be fine for civilian use, like inspecting electric cables or whatever.\"",
      "\u201cIt really has helped us win markets. It gives people confidence,\" he told The Associated Press at the Paris Air Show, a major shop-window for the aviation and defense industries.",
      "Henri Seydoux, the founder and head of French drone maker Parrot, says Ukraine is \u201cfascinating\u201d from a drone-technology perspective because \u201cit changes so quickly, there are new ideas non-stop.\u201d He's been making regular trips since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 to meet Ukrainian drone manufacturers, drone software developers and the military authorities.",
      "\u201cEvery quarter, the situation changes completely,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cEvery company, let\u2019s say, that makes military equipment or every army is very interested by drones. But the ones that really use them and understand how to use them is the Ukrainians.\"",
      "For Ukraine, trying to defend against swarms of Russian drones that target cities and waves of drone-supported Russian troops is a matter of survival. So, too, is finding workarounds to counter electronic warfare systems that Russia deploys to jam and disable Ukrainian drones, igniting what has become a drone-technology arms race between the two sides and for manufacturers outside of Ukraine, too.",
      "Small drones that drop bombs and explode against targets \u2014 mass-produced at a fraction of the cost of other more complex weapons systems that its allies have supplied \u2014 have become increasingly vital for Ukraine's resistance. Its Defense Ministry has said that it plans to buy 4.5 million drones this year, all Ukrainian-made, that allow their operators to see what the machines see, so they can guide the flights in real time \u2014 exploding in a Russian trench, for example, or even against a single enemy soldier. That's three times more drones than the ministry bought last year, it says.",
      "\u201cDrones saved Ukraine,\u201d said Alex Vorobei, the Ukrainian sales representative for Ailand Systems, a Ukrainian start-up developing a drone that detects land mines.",
      "Vorobei and others in the drone business say that manufacturers not involved in Ukraine risk being left behind.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re in the defense field and still not in Ukraine, it means you are nowhere,\" Vorobei said at the Paris show.",
      "A micro surveillance drone unveiled by Parrot at the Paris show has a nod to Ukraine in its name \u2014 the Anafi UKR \u2014 and also has been field-tested in what Seydoux describes as the \u201cvery harsh environment\u201d on the frontline. It\u2019s equipped with artificial intelligence technology to enable it to find its way when radio and navigational signals are jammed.",

      "Amazon is gearing up to make as 10,000 robotaxis annually at a sprawling plant near Silicon Valley as it prepares to challenge self-driving cab leader Waymo",
      "HAYWARD, Calif. -- Amazon is gearing up to make as many as 10,000 robotaxis annually at a sprawling plant near Silicon Valley as it prepares to challenge self-driving cab leader Waymo. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is also vying to join the autonomous race.",
      "The 220,000-square-foot (20,440-square-meters) robotaxi factory announced Wednesday heralds a new phase in Amazon's push into a technological frontier that began taking shape in 2009, when Waymo was launched as a secret project within Google.",
      "Amazon began eyeing the market five years ago when it shelled out $1.2 billion for self-driving startup Zoox, which will be the brand behind a robotaxi service that plans to begin transporting customers in Las Vegas late this year before expanding into San Francisco next year.",
      "Zoox, conceived in 2014, will be trying to catch up to Waymo, which began operating robotaxis in Phoenix nearly five years ago then charging for rides in San Francisco in 2023 before expanding into Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. Waymo says it has already more than 10 million paid rides while other would-be rivals such as Amazon and Tesla are still fine-tuning their self-driving technology while tackling other challenges, such how to ramp up their fleet.",
      "Amazon feels like has addressed that issue with Zoox's manufacturing plant that spans across the equivalent of three-and-a-half football fields located in Hayward, California \u2014 about 17 miles (27 kilometers) north of a factory where Tesla makes some of the electric vehicles that Musk believes will eventually be able to operate without a driver behind the wheel.",
      "Since moving into the former bus manufacturing factory in 2023, Zoox has transformed it into a high-tech facility where its boxy, gondola-like vehicles are put together and tested along a 21-station assembly line. For now, Zoox is only making one robotaxi per day, but by next year hopes to be churning them out at the rate of three vehicles per hour.",
      "By 2027, Zoox hopes to making 10,000 robotaxis annually in Hayward for a fleet that it hopes to take into other major markets, including Miami, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Although Zoox will be assembling its robotaxis in the U.S., about half of the parts are imported from outside the country, according to company officials.",
      "\u201cIt's an exciting time to be heading on this journey,\u201d Zoox CEO Aicha Evans said during a Tuesday tour of the robotaxi factory that she co-hosted with Jesse Levinson, the company's co-founder and chief technology officer.",
      "Although Zoox will be lagging well behind, it believes it can lure passengers with vehicles that look more like carriages that cars with seating for up to four passengers. Waymo, in contrast, builds its self-driving technology on to cars made by other major automakers, making its robotaxi look similar to vehicles steered by humans. Zoox isn't even bothering to put a steering wheel in its robotaxis.",
      "As it continues to test its robotaxis in Las Vegas, Zoox recently struck a partnership to give rides to guests of Reorts World. It's also still testing its robotaxis in San Francisco, where Waymo already has turned driverless cars into an everyday site in a city that has been renowned for cable cars since the 1870s. While testing in San Francisco last month, a minor collision between a Zoox robotaxi and a person riding an electric scooter last month prompted the company to issue a voluntary recall to update its self-driving technology. No injuries were reported in the incident.",
      "Tesla is still angling to compete against Waymo too, although it remains unclear when Musk will fuflil his long-running promise to build the world's largest robotaxi service. Musk still hasn't given up on the goal, though his current ambitions are more modest than they were in 2019. when he predicted Tesla would be running a fleet of 1 million robotaxis by now. He is currently aiming for a limited rollout of Tesla robotaxis in Austin this Sunday, although that date could change because Musk is \u201cbeing super paranoid about safety.\u201d",
      "Zoox, in contrast, is planning to operate 500 to 1,000 of its robotaxis in small to medium-sized markets and about 2,000 robotaxis in major cities where it eventually operates, according to Evans. The company thinks each robotaxi produced in its Hayward plan should be on the road for about five years, or about 500,000 miles",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Humans are the only animal that lives in virtually every possible environment, from rainforests to deserts to tundra.",
      "This adaptability is a skill that long predates the modern age. According to a new study published Wednesday in Nature, ancient Homo sapiens developed the flexibility to survive by finding food and other resources in a wide variety of difficult habitats before they dispersed from Africa about 50,000 years ago.",
      "\u201cOur superpower is that we are ecosystem generalists,\u201d said Eleanor Scerri, an evolutionary archaeologist at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Jena, Germany.",
      "Our species first evolved in Africa around 300,000 years ago. While prior fossil finds show some groups made early forays outside the continent, lasting human settlements in other parts of the world didn't happen until a series of migrations around 50,000 years ago.",
      "\u201cWhat was different about the circumstance of the migrations that succeeded \u2014 why were humans ready this time?\u201d said study co-author Emily Hallett, an archaeologist at Loyola University Chicago.",
      "Earlier theories held that Stone Age humans might have made a single important technological advance or developed a new way of sharing information, but researchers haven\u2019t found evidence to back that up.",
      "This study took a different approach by looking at the trait of flexibility itself.",
      "The scientists assembled a database of archaeological sites showing human presence across Africa from 120,000 to 14,000 years ago. For each site, researchers modeled what the local climate would have been like during the time periods that ancient humans lived there.",
      "\u201cThere was a really sharp change in the range of habitats that humans were using starting around 70,000 years ago,\u201d Hallet said. \u201cWe saw a really clear signal that humans were living in more challenging and more extreme environments.\u201d",
      "While humans had long survived in savanna and forests, they shifted into everything from from dense rainforests to arid deserts in the period leading up to 50,000 years ago, developing what Hallet called an \"ecological flexibility that let them succeed.\u201d",
      "While this leap in abilities is impressive, it\u2019s important not to assume that only Homo sapiens did it, said University of Bordeaux archaeologist William Banks, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Other groups of early human ancestors also left Africa and established long-term settlements elsewhere, including those that evolved into Europe\u2019s Neanderthals, he said.",
      "The new research helps explain why humans were ready to expand across the world way back when, he said, but it doesn\u2019t answer the lasting question of why only our species remains today.",

      "When temperatures heat up, nocturnal Bogong moths fly about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) to cool down in caves by the Australian Alps. They later return home to breed and die.",
      "Birds routinely navigate by starlight, but the moths are the first known invertebrates, or creatures without a backbone, to find their way across such long distances using the stars.",
      "Scientists have long wondered how the moths travel to a place they've never been. A previous study hinted that Earth's magnetic field might help steer them in the right direction, along with some kind of visual landmark as a guide.",
      "Since stars appear in predictable patterns each night, scientists suspected they might help lead the way. They placed moths in a flight simulator that mimicked the night sky above them and blocked out the Earth's magnetic field, noting where they flew. Then they scrambled the stars and saw how the moths reacted.",
      "When the stars were as they should be, the moths flapped in the right direction. But when the stars were in random places, the moths were disoriented. Their brain cells also got excited in response to specific orientations of the night sky.",
      "The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
      "It \u201cwas a very clean, impressive demonstration that the moths really are using a view of the night sky to guide their movements,\u201d said Kenneth Lohmann, who studies animal navigation at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and was not involved with the new research.",
      "Researchers don't know what features of the night sky the moths use to find their way. It could be a stripe of light from the Milky Way, a colorful nebula or something else entirely. Whatever it is, the insects seem to rely on that along with Earth's magnetic field to make their journey.",
      "Other animals harness the stars as a guide. Birds take celestial cues as they soar through the skies and dung beetles roll their remains short distances while using the Milky Way to stay on course.",

      "New York's law, which Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul signed late last year, is poised to take effect later this year. X maintains that the measure impinges on free speech rights and on a 1996 federal law that, among other things, lets internet platforms moderate posts as they see fit.",

      "New York Attorney General Letitia James' office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.",
      "The law requires social media companies to report twice a year on whether and how they define hate speech, racist or extremist content, disinformation and some other terms. The platforms also have to detail their content moderation practices and data on the number of posts they flagged, the actions they took, the extent to which the offending material was seen or shared, and more.",
      "Sponsors Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Grace Lee, both Democrats, have said the measure will make social media more transparent and companies more accountable.",
      "The law applies broadly to social media companies. But X is among those that have faced intense scrutiny in recent years, and in a 2024 letter to an X lobbyist, the sponsors said the company and Musk in particular have a \u201cdisturbing record\u201d that \u201cthreatens the foundations of our democracy.\u201d",

He has restored the accounts of conspiracy theorists and incentivized engagement on the platform with payouts and content partnerships.",
      "Outside groups have since documented a rise in hate speech and harassment on the platform. X sued a research organization that studies online hate speech \u2013 that lawsuit was dismissed last March.",

      "A proposal by Senate Republicans would adjust the pace at which some crucial home energy efficiency and electric vehicle tax credits are phased out in timelines different from what House Republicans proposed in the multitrillion-dollar tax bill they pa...",
      "Tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, albeit less quickly, under Senate Republicans' latest proposed changes to a massive tax bill. Electric vehicle incentives and other provisions intended to move the United States away from fossil fuels would be gutted rapidly.",
      "Senate Republicans cast their version of the bill as less damaging to the clean energy industry than the version House Republicans passed last month, but Democrats and advocates criticized it, saying it would still have significant consequences for wind, solar and other projects.",
      "Ultimately, wherever Congress ends up could have a big impact on consumers, companies and others that were depending on tax credits for green energy investments. It could also impact long-term how quickly America transitions to renewable energies.",
      "\u201cThey want everybody to believe that after the flawed House bill, that they have come up with a much more moderate climate approach,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the finance committee, during a conference call with reporters Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, if the early projections on the clean energy cuts are accurate, the Senate Republican bill does almost 90%\" as much damage as the House proposal, added Wyden, who authored clean energy tax credits included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act passed during former President Joe Biden\u2019s term. \u201cLet\u2019s not get too serious about this new Senate bill being a kinder, gentler approach.\u201d",
      "The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association representing investor-owned electric companies, issued a statement applauding the Senate proposal for including \u201cmore reasonable timelines for phasing out energy tax credits.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese modifications are a step in the right direction,\u201d said the statement from Pat Vincent-Collawn, the institute\u2019s interim chief executive officer, adding that the changes balance \u201cbusiness certainty with fiscal responsibility.\u201d",
      "Whether all of the changes will be enacted into law isn't clear yet. The Senate can still modify its proposals before they go to a vote. Any conflicts in the draft legislation will have to be sorted out with the House as the GOP looks to fast-track the bill for a vote by President Donald Trump\u2019s imminent Fourth of July target.",
      "Notably, many Republicans in Congress have advocated to protect the clean-energy credits, which have overwhelmingly benefited Republican congressional districts. A report by the Atlas Public Policy research firm found that 77% of planned spending on credit-eligible projects are in GOP-held House districts.",
      "The clean energy tax credits stem from Biden\u2019s climate law, which aimed to boost to the nation\u2019s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.",
      "The House version of the bill took an ax to many of the credits and effectively made it impossible for wind and solar providers to meet the requirements and timelines necessary to qualify for the incentives. After the House vote, 13 House Republicans lobbied the Senate to preserve some of the clean energy incentives that GOP lawmakers had voted to erase.",
      "Language included Monday in the reconciliation bill from the Senate Finance Committee would still phase out \u2014 though more slowly than House lawmakers envisioned \u2014 some Biden-era green energy tax breaks.",
      "The Senate proposal further \u201cachieves significant savings by slashing Green New Deal spending and targeting waste, fraud and abuse in spending programs while preserving and protecting them for the most vulnerable,\u201d said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho and chairman of the committee.",
      "On the chopping block are tax credits for residential rooftop solar installations, ending within 180 days of passage, and a subsidy for hydrogen production. Federal credits for wind and solar would have a longer phaseout than in the House version, but it would still be difficult for developers to meet the rules for beginning construction in order to receive the credit.",
      "At the same time, it would boost support for geothermal, nuclear and hydropower projects that begin construction by 2033.",
      "\u201cThe bill will strip the ability of millions of American families to choose the energy savings, energy resilience, and energy freedom that solar and storage provide,\u201d said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. \u201cIf this bill passes as is, we cannot ensure an affordable, reliable and secure energy system.\u201d",
      "Opponents of the Senate\u2019s text also decry domestic manufacturing job and economic losses as a result.",
      "\u201cThis is a 20-pound sledgehammer swung at clean energy. It would mean higher energy prices, lost manufacturing jobs, shuttered factories, and a worsening climate crisis,\u201d said Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "The bill would also cancel incentives such as the Energy Efficient Home Improvement credit \u2014 which helps homeowners make improvements such as insulation or heating and cooling systems that reduce their energy usage and energy bills \u2014 180 days after enactment. An incentive for builders constructing new energy-efficient homes and apartments would end 12 months after signing. The House\u2019s proposed end date for both is Dec. 31.",
      "\u201cCanceling these credits would increase monthly bills for American families and businesses,\u201d Steven Nadel, executive director of the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy said in a statement.",
      "The Senate proposal moves up the timeline for ending the consumer electric vehicle tax credit from the end of this year to 180 days after passage. It also cuts the provision that would have extended until the end of 2026 a credit for automakers that had not made 200,000 qualifying EVs for U.S. sale. It would also immediately eliminate the $7,500 credit for leased EVs.",
      "This administration has staunchly gone after EVs amid Trump's targeting of what he calls a \u201cmandate,\u201d incorrectly referring to a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales by 2030 be electric.",

      "Built by Alameda, California-based company Saildrone, the vessels will patrol Danish and NATO waters in the Baltic and North Seas, where maritime tensions and suspected sabotage have escalated sharply since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Two of the Voyagers launched Monday from Koge Marina, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the Danish capital, Copenhagen. Powered by wind and solar energy, these sea drones can operate autonomously for months at sea. Saildrone says the vessels carry advanced sensor suites \u2014 radar, infrared and optical cameras, sonar and acoustic monitoring.",
      "Their launch comes after two others already joined a NATO patrol on June 6.",
      "Saildrone founder and CEO Richard Jenkins compared the vessels to a \u201ctruck\u201d that carries sensors and uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to give a \u201cfull picture of what's above and below the surface\" to about 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) in the open ocean.",
      "He said that maritime threats like damage to undersea cables, illegal fishing and the smuggling of people, weapons and drugs are going undetected simply because \u201cno one\u2019s observing it.\u201d",
      "Saildrone, he said, is \"going to places ... where we previously didn\u2019t have eyes and ears.\u201d",

And then they\u2019ll move from area to area within the Danish waters.\"",
      "The trial comes as NATO confronts a wave of damage to maritime infrastructure \u2014 including the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline explosions and the rupture of at least 11 undersea cables since late 2023. The most recent incident, in January, severed a fiber-optic link between Latvia and Sweden\u2019s Gotland island.",

      "A pair of European satellites have created the first artificial solar eclipses through precise and fancy formation flying",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A pair of European satellites have created the first artificial solar eclipses by flying in precise and fancy formation, providing hours of on-demand totality for scientists.",
      "The European Space Agency released the eclipse pictures at the Paris Air Show on Monday. Launched late last year, the orbiting duo have churned out simulated solar eclipses since March while zooming tens of thousands of miles (kilometers) above Earth.",
      "Flying 492 feet (150 meters) apart, one satellite blocks the sun like the moon does during a natural total solar eclipse as the other aims its telescope at the corona, the sun's outer atmosphere that forms a crown or halo of light.",
      "It's an intricate, prolonged dance requiring extreme precision by the cube-shaped spacecraft, less than 5 feet (1.5 meters) in size. Their flying accuracy needs to be within a mere millimeter, the thickness of a fingernail. This meticulous positioning is achieved autonomously through GPS navigation, star trackers, lasers and radio links.",
      "Dubbed Proba-3, the $210 million mission has generated 10 successful solar eclipses so far during the ongoing checkout phase. The longest eclipse lasted five hours, said the Royal Observatory of Belgium's Andrei Zhukov, the lead scientist for the orbiting corona-observing telescope. He and his team are aiming for a wondrous six hours of totality per eclipse once scientific observations begin.",
      "Scientists already are thrilled by the preliminary results that show the corona without the need for any special image processing, said Zhukov.",
      "\"We almost couldn\u2019t believe our eyes,\u201d Zhukov said in an email. \u201cThis was the first try, and it worked. It was so incredible.\u201d",
      "Zhukov anticipates an average of two solar eclipses per week being produced for a total of nearly 200 during the two-year mission, yielding more than 1,000 hours of totality. That will be a scientific bonanza since full solar eclipses produce just a few minutes of totality when the moon lines up perfectly between Earth and the sun \u2014 on average just once every 18 months.",
      "The sun continues to mystify scientists, especially its corona, which is hotter than the solar surface. Coronal mass ejections result in billions of tons of plasma and magnetic fields being hurled out into space. Geomagnetic storms can result, disrupting power and communication while lighting up the night sky with auroras in unexpected locales.",
      "While previous satellites have generated imitation solar eclipses \u2014 including the European Space Agency and NASA's Solar Orbiter and Soho observatory \u2014 the sun-blocking disk was always on the same spacecraft as the corona-observing telescope. What makes this mission unique, Zhukov said, is that the sun-shrouding disk and telescope are on two different satellites and therefore far apart.",
      "The distance between these two satellites will give scientists a better look at the part of the corona closest to the limb of the sun.",
      "\"We are extremely satisfied by the quality of these images, and again this is really thanks to formation flying\u201d with unprecedented accuracy, ESA\u2019s mission manager Damien Galano said from the Paris Air Show.",

      "He said Friday it would give time for Iranians to \"come to their senses.\"",
      "It was just on Thursday that President Donald Trump said he would decide \"within the next two weeks\" on whether to order a U.S. military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities -- ostensibly to give diplomacy a chance, at least temporarily.",
      "\u201cBased on the fact that there\u2019s a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,\u201d Trump said in a statement read to reporters by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.",
      "On Friday, asked by a reporter to explain his thinking, he responded it was to give time for the Iranians to \"come to their senses.\"",
      "The president also dismissed the talks held in Geneva Friday between European diplomats and Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, playing down the already low expectations for a breakthrough.",
      "\"They didn't help,\" Trump said of the discussions. \"Iran doesn't want to speak to Europe. They want to speak to us. Europe is not going to be able to help in this one.\"",
      "He added, \"we are ready, willing and able and have been speaking to Iran and we'll see what happens.\"",
      "When a reporter asked, \"Does Iran have two weeks or could you strike before that? Are you essentially giving them a two-week timeline?\" Trump answered, \"Well I\u2019m giving them a period of time. We're going to see what that period of time is. But I'm giving them a period of time, and I would say two weeks would be the maximum.\"",
      "In recent days, Iran has rebuffed a standing offer from the U.S to resume nuclear negotiations.",
      "The president's announcement Thursday about a possible delay in hitting Iran frustrated Israeli officials, who have been privately pushing their case for U.S. military involvement for months, according to officials familiar with the matter.",
      "Meanwhile, as sharp differences between Israeli and American assessments on Iran's nuclear abilities came to the forefront, Trump also showcased distrust for his own intelligence community, including his own director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard.",
      "On Friday, Trump was asked about Gabbard's testimony to Congress in March that the U.S. assessed that Iran was not \"building\" a nuclear weapon and that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003.",
      "\"She's wrong,\" Trump said flatly.",
      "Shortly after Trump spoke, Gabbard criticized the news media, posting on X, \"America has intelligence that Iran is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly. President Trump has been clear that can't happen, and I agree.\"",
      "Speaking to the nation late Saturday night -- about two hours after he announced the strikes -- Trump said, \"Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace. If they do not, future attacks will be far greater and a lot easier.\"",

      "Read the live transcript of Trump's speech below.",
      "\"A short time ago, the U.S. military carried out massive precision strikes on the three key nuclear facilities in the Iranian regime: Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. Everybody heard those names for years as they built this horribly destructive enterprise. Our objective was the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity, and a stop to the nuclear threat posed by the world's No. 1 state sponsor of terror.",
      "\"Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success. Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.",
      "\"Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace. If they do not, future attacks will be far greater and a lot easier.",
      "\"For years, Iran has been saying death to America, death to Israel. They have been killing our people, blowing off their arms, blowing off their legs with roadside bombs. That was their specialty. We lost over a thousand people and hundreds of thousands throughout the Middle East and around the world have died as a direct result of their hate.",
      "\"In particular, so many were killed by their general, Qasem Soleimani. I decided a long time ago that I would not let this happen. It will not continue. I want to thank and congratulate Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu. We worked as a team. Like perhaps no team has ever worked before. And we've gone a long way to erasing this horrible threat to Israel.",
      "\"I want to thank the Israeli military for the wonderful job they've done. And most importantly, I want to congratulate the great American patriots who flew those magnificent machines tonight and all of the United States military on an operation the likes of which the world has not seen in many, many decades.",
      "\"Hopefully, we will no longer need their services in this capacity. I hope that's so. I also want to congratulate the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan \"Raizin'\" Cain -- spectacular general -- and all of the brilliant military minds involved in this attack.",
      "\"With all of that being said, this cannot continue. There will be either peace or there will be tragedy for Iran, far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days. Remember, there are many targets left. Tonight's was the most difficult of them all by far, and perhaps the most lethal. But if peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill. Most of them can be taken out in a matter of minutes.",
      "\"There is no military in the world that could have done what we did tonight. Not even close. There has never been a military that could do what took place just a little while ago.",
      "\"Tomorrow, Gen. Caine, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, will have a press conference at 8 a.m. at the Pentagon. And I want to just thank everybody, and in particular, God.",
      "\"I want to just say, we love you, God, and we love our great military. Protect them. God bless the Middle East. God bless Israel, and god bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you.\"",

      "The full ramifications of the U.S. action, announced by President Donald Trump as \"very successful\" were not clear. Trump and his closest advisers had been weighing for days how to proceed, debating the costs of involvement and inaction. Democrats and some Republicans had already criticized the strike just minutes after it was announced.",
      "According to a U.S. official, B-2 stealth bombers were used in the strikes, but it was not clear which of the locations -- Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan -- were hit by them. Dozens of other U.S. aircraft were involved in the attacks, the official said.",
      "The B-2 bombers dropped a number of 30,000-pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bombs on their Iranian targets, devices that have never been used in combat but could tunnel 200 feet into the ground before exploding, a U.S. official said. The MOPs had been tested but never before used in combat and were believed necessary to access underground nuclear sites like those at Fordo.",
      "The U.S. also used Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from submarines in the region and targeted more than just nuclear sites, a source told ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl.",
      "Hours earlier, sources told ABC News that B-2 stealth bombers, the only planes capable of carrying the MOP \"bunker-buster\" bombs, were headed to Guam. It was not clear if any of those aircraft were involved in the strikes.",
      "According to an Israeli official, the U.S. notified Israel ahead of the strike. Sources said House Speaker Mike Johnson was also briefed ahead of time. But other sources said that the full Gang of 8, including key Democrats, was not briefed until after the strikes. Some Democrats reacted harshly to the precarious military action in the volatile region, with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling it \"ground for impeachment\" and that Trump was in in \"grave violation of the Constitution\" by not seeking congressional authorization.",
      "'Tremendous success,' Trump says",
      "Trump first announced the strikes on Truth Social, a move that surprised many given his statement on Friday that there was a \"substantial chance\" of negotiations.",
      "\"A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow,\" Trump posted on Truth Social. \"All planes are safely on their way home.\"",
      "\"There is not another military in the World that could have done this,\" he added. \"NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE! Thank you for your attention to this matter.\"",

      "\"This invasion occurred in violation of the international law, unfortunately amid indifference, and even companionship, of the IAEA,\" the organization added.",
      "Days of missile barrages",
      "Israel and Iran have been exchanging missile barrages since Israel launched a preemptive strike against Iran's nuclear program. Israeli officials said they felt Iran was getting too close to being able to produce a nuclear weapon.",
      "Israel's operation, \"Rising Lion,\" came after Israeli officials felt that Iran had enough nuclear material for several bombs, according to the Israel Defense Forces and an Israeli official familiar with the operation. In the initial preemptive attack, Israel hit the same three sites targeted by the U.S.",
      "Several top Iranian nuclear scientists and the top general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were killed in the operation, according to Iran.",
      "In the wake of the Israeli strike on June 13, the two countries exchanged strikes daily, and Trump weighed whether or not to get involved. The U.S. was the only country with the plane -- the B-2 -- capable of carrying the Massive Ordnance Penetrator -- that could penetrate the mountain under which the Fordo centrifuge operation was hidden.",
      "On Friday, Trump, who has long criticized U.S. involvement in overseas wars, said in a statement read by press secretary Karoline Leavitt that there was a \"substantial chance\" of negotiations. Trump gave the two-week time frame hoping Iran would \"come to their senses.\"",
      "The White House said last week they felt that Iran had all of the materials it needed for a nuclear weapon and could produce one in a \"couple of weeks.\"",
      "In March, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard testified before Congress that Iran was not \"building\" a nuclear bomb.",

      "\"The President gave Iran's leader every opportunity to make a deal, but Iran refused to commit to a nuclear disarmament agreement,\" he continued.",
      "Similarly, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said in a statement that Iran \"has rejected all diplomatic pathways to peace.\"",
      "\"The mullahs' misguided pursuit of nuclear weapons must be stopped,\" said Thune. \"As we take action tonight to ensure a nuclear weapon remains out of reach for Iran, I stand with President Trump and pray for the American troops and personnel in harm's way.\"",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said, \"Trump made the courageous and correct decision to eliminate the Iranian nuclear threat.\"",
      "But Republican Thomas Massie wrote on X, \"This is not Constitutional.\" Democrats, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, joined the chorus.",
      "\"Not only is this news that I've heard this second alarming -- all of you have just heard -- but it is so grossly unconstitutional,\" Sanders said at an event in Oklahoma. \"All of you know that the only entity that can take this country to war is the U.S. Congress. The president does not have the right,\" Sanders told the crowd at an event in Tulsa, Oklahoma.",
      "Many within Trump's own party were opposed to striking Iran and feared the consequences, including prominent MAGA podcaster and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said that Trump \"misled\" the country.",
      "\"President Trump misled the country about his intentions, failed to seek congressional authorization for the use of military force and risks American entanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East,\" Jeffries said in a statement.",

      "Nearly 10 years ago, the United States and other world powers reached a landmark nuclear agreement with Iran.",
      "Known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, the deal followed two years of negotiations. Then-President Barack Obama, who campaigned on resolving the Iranian nuclear threat, called the issue the \"most consequential foreign policy debate that our country has had since the invasion of Iraq.\"",
      "Two years after the deal went into effect, President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the nuclear accord, in one of the most significant foreign policy actions during his first term as president.",
      "Iran's nuclear program is at the heart of its conflict with Israel, which has been engaged in aerial strikes with Iran in the days since a surprise attack on Tehran that Israeli officials said killed several nuclear scientists as well as high-ranking military leaders.",
      "Here's what to know about the Iran nuclear deal, which is now \"essentially defunct,\" according to the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "What was in the deal?",
      "The JCPOA, which imposed restrictions on Iran\u2019s civilian nuclear enrichment program in exchange for sanctions relief, was signed on July 14, 2015. It was agreed to by Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States -- as well as Germany and the European Union.",
      "The JCPOA was designed to ensure that Iran\u2019s nuclear program would be exclusively peaceful and provided for the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions in order to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.",
      "\"It blocks every possible pathway Iran could use to build a nuclear bomb while ensuring -- through a comprehensive, intrusive, and unprecedented verification and transparency regime -- that Iran\u2019s nuclear program remains exclusively peaceful moving forward,\" Obama's White House said at the time.",
      "Under the 159-page deal, Iran \"significantly reduced its nuclear program and accepted strict monitoring and verification safeguards to ensure its program is solely for peaceful purposes,\" the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation said.",
      "\"In exchange, Iran received economic sanctions relief from nuclear-related sanctions\" only after the International Atomic Energy Agency verified Tehran had completed certain requirements under the deal.",
      "The deal went into effect on Jan. 16, 2016, after the IAEA verified that Iran had completed steps, including shipping 25,000 pounds of enriched uranium out of the country, dismantling and removing two-thirds of its centrifuges and allowing for more extensive international inspections of its nuclear facilities.",
      "The U.S. and many European nations lifted oil and financial sanctions and released about $100 billion in frozen Iranian assets.",
      "If all parties adhered to the deal, experts held that it likely would have prevented Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon for more than a decade, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Should Iran try to build a nuclear weapon, sanctions would go back into effect.",
      "Many of the restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program \"have expiration dates,\" according to the Council on Foreign Relations, noting for example that centrifuge restrictions would be lifted after 10 years and limits on how much low-enriched uranium Iran can possess after 15 years.",
      "\"Some of the deal\u2019s opponents faulted these so-called sunset provisions, saying they would only delay Iran building a bomb while sanctions relief would allow it to underwrite terrorism in the region,\" the organization said.",
      "Israel was among those who opposed the agreement, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it a \"historic mistake\" at the time.",
      "Why did Trump drop out of the deal?",
      "Trump campaigned prior to his first election on pulling the U.S. out of the deal, and on May 8, 2018, he did just that, terminating U.S. participation in the JCPOA and reimposing economic sanctions on Iran.",
      "Trump argued at the time that the deal was so \"horrible\" it had to be discarded to move forward.",
      "\"It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement,\" he said. \"The Iran deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing, we know exactly what will happen.\"",
      "The Trump administration said at the time that Iran \"negotiated the JCPOA in bad faith, and the deal gave the Iranian regime too much in exchange for too little.\"",
      "Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal after ignoring the advice of America\u2019s allies, who had urged him to stay in the agreement and build upon it. The leaders of France, Germany and the U.K. noted their \"regret and concern\" at Trump's decision, calling on Iran to maintain its commitments under the deal.",
      "What's happened since?",
      "After Qassem Soleimani, the leader of Iran's elite Quds Force, was killed in a U.S. airstrike in January 2020, the Iranian government announced it would no longer abide by any of the operational restraints on its nuclear program under the Iran nuclear deal.",
      "In early 2023, the IAEA reported they had detected traces of uranium at Iran's Fordow nuclear facility that was enriched to \"near weapons-grade level that Iran\u202fclaimed\u202fwas accidental.\"",
      "\"Since the United States abrogated the deal and Iran in turn stopped honoring some of its commitments, Iran has reduced its breakout time -- the amount of time it would take to accumulate enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon -- from more than a year to about 3-4 months, although the IAEA remains on the ground to verify the peaceful nature of its nuclear program,\" the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation said.",
      "As some provisions of the JCPOA were set to expire in October 2023, former President Joe Biden's administration imposed new sanctions on Iran\u2019s ballistic missile and drone programs, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "Biden sought to negotiate a return to the JCPOA. However, in the last few months of his term last year, a State Department spokesperson said they were \"far away\" from returning to negotiations with Iran.",

      "Trump vowed speedy ends to the Israel-Hamas war and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, two conflicts that broke out in the previous administration that Trump has labeled \"Biden's wars.\" On the campaign trail, he often railed against \"endless wars\" and \"forever wars\" and mused that he could resolve the Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours -- a comment that once in office he walked back as an \"exaggeration.\"",
      "\"He has made comments on all of them that this could be done quickly or easily and that there are solutions to these three problems,\" Miller said. \"And yet, he has not been successful in even identifying what I would consider to be a potentially effective strategy for managing or let alone resolving them. And therein lies the challenge.\"",
      "While Trump has made new diplomatic efforts a priority amid his flurry of initiatives during his first months, he's expressed increasing frustration with the foreign leaders involved and continually condemns what he calls \"the death\" the conflicts have wrought.",
      "\"He has followed through on his promises to try,\" said Elliott Abrams, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations who worked as special representative for Iran and Venezuela in Trump's first administration. \"He has tried in Ukraine and he has tried in Gaza and he's tried in Iran, and none of them has worked out.\"",
      "One claim of success on the foreign policy front that Trump frequently makes, and says he can replicate by pushing trade deals, is how he says he stopped the recent fighting between India and Pakistan. Trump's claimed he hasn't received enough credit: \"I got it stopped. I don't think I had one story.\"",

      "Trump departed a Group of Seven summit early, citing tensions in the Middle East and ordering his national security team to huddle in the Situation Room upon his return to Washington. He's received a range of options, including using U.S. military assets to strike Iranian nuclear facilities.",
      "Trump didn't rule out the possibility, telling reporters on Wednesday: \"I may do it. I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do.\"",
      "The president's messaging on the conflict was mixed.",
      "Trump had publicly warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu any strikes could derail talks between the U.S. and Iran on a nuclear deal. But after Israel's attacks last Friday on Tehran, Trump seemed to change his tune, telling ABC News they were \"excellent\" and saying they could drive Tehran to the negotiating table.",
      "At one point, he floated sending Vice President JD Vance and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff to speak with the Iranians while also demanding Iran's \"unconditional surrender.\" Officials have said the U.S. has not been involved in Israel's offensive, while Trump claimed \"we now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran.\"",
      "\"His words and deeds are chaotic and inconsistent,\" Miller said of Trump. \"And the notion that he's unpredictable and that helps him certainly hasn't proven to be the case so far in these three conflicts.\"",
      "The White House and Vice President Vance have defended Trump's position on Iran, saying he's long been clear and consistent that the nation can't have a nuclear weapon.",
      "Abrams concedes Trump's messaging might be \"confusing\" but is representative of a rapidly changing situation on the ground in Tehran.",
      "\"One thing he's trying to make clear to the Ayatollah is that if he attacks American ships from bases he's done, that's the end of the regime. That is something any president should do,\" Abrams said.",
      "Peace in Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars remains out of reach",
      "As the administration ramps up its focus on Israel and Iran, other areas are at a standstill.",
      "\"On Gaza, no one has come up with a workable plan,\" Abrams said. \"It's a wicked problem. [Joe] Biden didn\u2019t come up with a plan in his 15 months after October 7 and Trump hasn't come up with a workable one.\"",
      "An initial three-phrase peace deal aimed at ending the war in Gaza, which was brokered by members of both the Biden and Trump administrations, collapsed in March. Since then, proposals for a temporary ceasefire have fallen through.",
      "In Eastern Europe, Trump took a different approach than his predecessor in engaging with both the leaders of Ukraine and Russia, often saying his personal relationship with Vladimir Putin would produce results.",
      "Some progress appeared to be made when Russian and Ukrainian officials held their first face-to-face meeting since the invasion began back in mid-May. But talks have since stalled, with the Trump administration taking a step back while Ukraine and Russia have been intensifying attacks in recent weeks.",
      "\"The president did a lot of huffing and puffing on the need for peace, but he hasn't been prepared to really push Putin in that direction,\" said Stephen Sestanovich, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who served as the State Department's ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet Union.",
      "William Taylor, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine during the Obama administration currently serving as a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said Putin is not going to be swayed diplomatically.",
      "\"Putin is going to be swayed by a combination of military and economic pressure,\" Taylor said. \"So President Trump should do that.\"",
      "No new commitments have been made for U.S. arms deliveries to Ukraine and no new sanctions have been placed on Russia, however, and there are now reports that the Trump administration disbanded a group focused on pressuring Russia.",
      "\"For someone who claims to have mastered the art of the deal, this is a pretty spectacular failure,\" Sestanovich said of Trump's approach to the Russia-Ukraine war so far.",
      "Anna Kelly, White House Deputy press secretary, responded to the criticism, saying in a statement, \u201cPresident Trump is leading the world in ending this brutal war, which he inherited from his incompetent predecessor Joe Biden. No one cares about the opinions of armchair quarterback \u2018experts\u2019 who have done nothing to make the world safer.\u201d",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Jun 2025 17:34:27 -0400",
    "summary": "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson unloaded on her Supreme Court colleagues in a series of sharp dissents, castigating a \"pure textualism\" approach to interpreting laws.",
    "story": [
      "She said the court gives the perception that \"moneyed interests\" are favored.",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson unloaded on her Supreme Court colleagues Friday in a series of sharp dissents, castigating what she called a \"pure textualism\" approach to interpreting laws, which she said had become a pretext for securing their desired outcomes, and implying the conservative justices have strayed from their oath by showing favoritism to \"moneyed interests.\"",
      "The attack on the court's conservative majority by the junior justice and member of the liberal wing is notably pointed and aggressive but stopped short of getting personal. It laid bare the stark divisions on the court and pent-up frustration in the minority over what Jackson described as inconsistent and unfair application of precedent by those in power.",
      "Jackson took particular aim at Justice Neil Gorsuch's majority opinion in a case brought by a retired Florida firefighter with Parkinson's disease who had tried to sue under the Americans with Disabilities Act after her former employer, the City of Sanford, canceled extended health insurance coverage for retirees who left the force before serving 25 years because of a disability.",
      "Gorsuch wrote that the landmark law only protects \"qualified individuals\" and that retirees don't count. The ADA defines the qualified class as those who \"can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.\"",
      "\"This court has long recognized that the textual limitations upon a law's scope must be understood as no less a part of its purpose than its substantive authorizations,\" Gorsuch concluded in his opinion in Stanley v. City of Sanford. It was joined by all the court's conservatives and liberal Justice Elena Kagan.",
      "Jackson fired back, accusing her colleagues of reaching a \"stingy outcome\" and willfully ignoring the \"clear design of the ADA to render a ruling that plainly counteracts what Congress meant to -- and did -- accomplish\" with the law. She said they had \"run in a series of textualist circles\" and that the majority \"closes its eyes to context, enactment history and the legislature's goals.\"",
      "\"I cannot abide that narrow-minded approach,\" she wrote.",
      "Gorsuch retorted that Jackson was simply complaining textualism didn't get her the outcome she wanted, prompting Jackson to take the rare step of using a lengthy footnote to accuse her colleague of the same.",
      "Saying the majority has a \"unfortunate misunderstanding of the judicial role,\" Jackson said her colleagues' \"refusal\" to consider Congress' intent behind the ADA \"turns the interpretative task into a potent weapon for advancing judicial policy preferences.\"",
      "\"By 'finding' answers in ambiguous text,\" she wrote, \"and not bothering to consider whether those answers align with other sources of statutory meaning, pure textualists can easily disguise their own preferences.\"",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who joined parts of Jackson's dissent, explicitly did not sign-on to the footnote.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan, a member of the liberal wing, joined the conservative majority in all three cases in which Jackson dissented, but she did not explain her views. In 2015, Kagan famously said, \"we're all textualists now\" of the court, but years later disavowed that approach over alleged abuse by conservative jurists.",
      "In two other cases decided Friday, Jackson accused her colleagues of distorting the law to benefit major American businesses and in so doing \"erode the public trust.\"",
      "She dissented from Justice Amy Coney Barrett's majority opinion siding with major tobacco manufacturer, R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co., that gives retailers the ability to sue the Food and Drug Administration over the denial of new product applications for e-cigarettes.",
      "Barrett concluded that a federal law meant to regulate the manufacture and distribution of new tobacco products also allows retailers who would sell the products to seek judicial review of an adverse FDA decision.",
      "Jackson blasted the conclusion as \"illogical\" again taking her colleagues to task for not sufficiently considering Congress' intent or longstanding precedent. \"Every available indictor reveals that Congress intended to permit manufacturers -- not retailers -- to challenge the denial,\" she wrote.",
      "Of the court's 7-2 decision by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, giving gasoline producers the right to sue California over limits on emission-producing cars, Jackson said her colleagues were favoring the fuel industry over \"less powerful plaintiffs.\"",
      "\"This case gives fodder to the unfortunate perception that moneyed interests enjoy an easier road to relief in this Court than ordinary citizens,\" she wrote.",
      "Jackson argued that the case should have been mooted, since the Trump administration withdrew EPA approval for California's emissions standards thereby eliminating any alleged harm to the auto and fuel industry.",
      "\"Those of us who are privileged to work inside the Court must not lose sight of this institution's unique mission and responsibility: to rule without fear or favor,\" she wrote, admonishing her colleagues.",
      "The court is next scheduled to convene Thursday, June 26, to release another round of opinions in cases argued this term. Decisions are expected in a dispute over online age verification for adult websites, parental opt-out rights for kids in public schools exposed to LGBTQ themes, and, the scope of nationwide injunctions against President Donald Trump's second-term policies.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Farmers, cattle ranchers and hotel and restaurant managers breathed a sigh of relief last week when President Donald Trump ordered a pause to immigration raids that were disrupting those industries and scaring foreign-born workers off the job.",
      "\u201cThere was finally a sense of calm,\u2019\u2019 said Rebecca Shi, CEO of the American Business Immigration Coalition.",
      "That respite didn\u2019t last long.",
      "On Wednesday, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin declared, \u201cThere will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine (immigration enforcement) efforts. Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability.\u2019\u2019",
      "The flipflop baffled businesses trying to figure out the government\u2019s actual policy, and Shi says now \u201cthere's fear and worry once more.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not a way to run business when your employees are at this level of stress and trauma,\" she said.",
      "Trump campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally \u2014 an issue that has long fired up his GOP base. The crackdown intensified a few weeks ago when Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, gave the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a quota of 3,000 arrests a day, up from 650 a day in the first five months of Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Suddenly, ICE seemed to be everywhere. \u201cWe saw ICE agents on farms, pointing assault rifles at cows, and removing half the workforce,\u2019\u2019 said Shi, whose coalition represents 1,700 employers and supports increased legal immigration.",
      "One ICE raid left a New Mexico dairy with just 20 workers, down from 55. \u201cYou can\u2019t turn off cows,\u2019\u2019 said Beverly Idsinga, the executive director of the Dairy Producers of New Mexico. \u201cThey need to be milked twice a day, fed twice a day.\u2019\u2019",
      "Claudio Gonzalez, a chef at Izakaya Gazen in Los Angeles\u2019 Little Tokyo district, said many of his Hispanic workers \u2014 whether they're in the country legally or not \u2014 have been calling out of work recently due to fears that they will be targeted by ICE. His restaurant is a few blocks away from a collection of federal buildings, including an ICE detention center.",
      "\u201cThey sometimes are too scared to work their shift,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cThey kind of feel like it\u2019s based on skin color.\u201d",
      "In some places, the problem isn\u2019t ICE but rumors of ICE. At cherry-harvesting time in Washington state, many foreign-born workers are staying away from the orchards after hearing reports of impending immigration raids. One operation that usually employs 150 pickers is down to 20. Never mind that there hasn\u2019t actually been any sign of ICE in the orchards.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve not heard of any real raids,\u2019\u2019 said Jon Folden, orchard manager for the farm cooperative Blue Bird in Washington\u2019s Wenatchee River Valley. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard a lot of rumors.\u2019\u2019",
      "Jennie Murray, CEO of the advocacy group National Immigration Forum, said some immigrant parents worry that their workplaces will be raided and they\u2019ll be hauled off by ICE while their kids are in school. They ask themselves, she said: \u201cDo I show up and then my second-grader gets off the school bus and doesn\u2019t have a parent to raise them? Maybe I shouldn\u2019t show up for work.\u2019\u2019",
      "The horror stories were conveyed to Trump, members of his administration and lawmakers in Congress by business advocacy and immigration reform groups like Shi\u2019s coalition. Last Thursday, the president posted on his Truth Social platform that \u201cOur great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace.\u201d",
      "It was another case of Trump\u2019s political agenda slamming smack into economic reality. With U.S. unemployment low at 4.2%, many businesses are desperate for workers, and immigration provides them.",
      "According to the U.S. Census Bureau, foreign-born workers made up less than 19% of employed workers in the United States in 2023. But they accounted for nearly 24% of jobs preparing and serving food and 38% of jobs in farming, fishing and forestry.",
      "\u201cIt really is clear to me that the people pushing for these raids that target farms and feed yards and dairies have no idea how farms operate,\u201d Matt Teagarden, CEO of the Kansas Livestock Association, said Tuesday during a virtual press conference.",
      "Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, estimated in January that undocumented workers account for 13% of U.S. farm jobs and 7% of jobs in hospitality businesses such as hotels, restaurants and bars.",
      "The Pew Research Center found last year that 75% of U.S. registered voters \u2014 including 59% of Trump supporters \u2014 agreed that undocumented immigrants mostly fill jobs that American citizens don\u2019t want. And an influx of immigrants in 2022 and 2023 allowed the United States to overcome an outbreak of inflation without tipping into recession.",
      "In the past, economists estimated that America\u2019s employers could add no more than 100,000 jobs a month without overheating the economy and igniting inflation. But economists Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson of the Brookings Institution calculated that because of the immigrant arrivals, monthly job growth could reach 160,000 to 200,000 without exerting upward pressure on prices.",
      "Now Trump\u2019s deportation plans \u2014 and the uncertainty around them \u2014 are weighing on businesses and the economy.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, a significant portion of our industry relies on immigrant labor \u2014 skilled, hardworking people who\u2019ve been part of our workforce for years. When there are sudden crackdowns or raids, it slows timelines, drives up costs, and makes it harder to plan ahead,\u201d says Patrick Murphy, chief investment officer at the Florida building firm Coastal Construction and a former Democratic member of Congress. \u201c We\u2019re not sure from one month to the next what the rules are going to be or how they\u2019ll be enforced. That uncertainty makes it really hard to operate a forward-looking business.\u201d",
      "Adds Douglas Holtz Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now president of the conservative American Action Forum think tank: \u201cICE had detained people who are here lawfully and so now lawful immigrants are afraid to go to work ... All of this goes against other economic objectives the administration might have. The immigration policy and the economic policy are not lining up at all.\u2019\u2019",

      "The U.S. still provides around 30% of Ukraine's weaponry, Zelenskyy has said.",
      "LONDON -- President Donald Trump -- frustrated by the failure of his diplomatic efforts to date -- has raised the prospect of entirely abandoning U.S. engagement in Russia's 3-year-old invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\"Sometimes you see two young children fighting in the park,\" Trump said in June about the ongoing war, which is the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II.",
      "\"Sometimes you're better off letting them fight more before you pull them apart,\" the president added -- his remarks the latest in several months of public skepticism over the U.S. continuing to back Ukraine.",
      "In practice and rhetoric, American aid to Ukraine appears to be drying up. The administration approved a $50 million sale of military aid to Ukraine in April, but only after Kyiv signed off on a controversial minerals sharing deal. But the White House is also yet to dip into some $3.9 billion earmarked to fund military aid to Ukraine -- to be drawn from existing U.S. stocks, meaning it can be delivered quickly -- that Biden was not able to spend before the end of his term.",
      "It would be Russia that would benefit from a permanent halt to U.S. aid, Ukraine has warned.",
      "\"Without American weaponry, the situation on the battlefield will of course be more difficult,\" Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament representing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's party and the chair of the body's foreign affairs committee, told ABC News.",
      "Zelenskyy said early this year that American aid accounts for 30% of Ukrainian weaponry. Though other estimates go as low as 20%, it is clear that Washington remains a key benefactor.",
      "A nine-month pause on U.S. aid in 2024, due to a gridlocked Congress, forced Kyiv to consider a future without American assistance. Those fears materialized in March 2025 when Trump imposed a week-long freeze on all American military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine.",
      "The flow soon resumed, but Trump's frustration has only deepened as U.S.-brokered peace talks floundered.",
      "The U.S. remained the most generous single contributor of aid to Ukraine as of April 2025, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a research group based in Germany that tracks support from foreign governments toward Ukraine.",
      "The U.S. has contributed around $130 billion in total aid to Ukraine since 2022, of which $74 billion is military assistance. Combined, European Union nations have contributed more overall -- $157 billion -- but less than the U.S. on the military front, at slightly less than $73 billion.",
      "Ukraine's budget for military and security spending approved by lawmakers in late 2024 was around $53.7 billion.",
      "Oleksandr V. Danylyuk, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute think tank in the U.K., told ABC News that American military assistance is important but not vital.",
      "\"I wouldn't underestimate it, but I wouldn't overestimate it either,\" he said. Around half of American weapons systems and ammunition provided could be replaced by alternatives, he said.",
      "How to find replacements for weapons the U.S. would withhold may be the most salient question, Pavel Luzin -- an analyst at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts -- told ABC News.",
      "\"The previous administration decided that the American taxpayers should\" shoulder the burden, he said. \"The current administration wants to share this burden.\"",
      "\"Europe can pay for the American arms for Ukraine and it has enough money for this,\" Luzin said. \"Ukraine also can pay for the arms using long-term European and/or American loans. Even the Russian frozen assets could be used for this purpose.\"",
      "Europe has been criticized for its slow mobilization of its vast resources. But Tina Fordham, a geopolitical strategist and the founder of Fordham Global Foresight, told ABC News, \"I think we saw during the during the pandemic, for example, and after the Russian invasion, that Europe is initially slow to act, but then it can act decisively.\"",
      "Perhaps the most vital single U.S. weapon system now in Ukrainian hands is the Patriot surface-to-air missile system, which has proven its value in downing drones, ballistic missiles and Russian aircraft since arriving in the country in the spring of 2023.",
      "Ukraine now fields at least six Patriots, two of which were provided by the U.S. and the others by different NATO allies.",
      "Ukraine has other air defense platforms -- among them the European IRIS-T and SAMP-T systems -- but none have been so publicly celebrated by Ukraine for blunting Russian attacks. The system, which entered U.S. service in the 1980s, has even been able to shoot down Russian hypersonic missiles.",
      "Zelenskyy said this month that his nation needs to \"urgently\" strengthen its air defense capabilities in response to Russia's intensifying missile and drone attacks on cities nationwide.",
      "\"We urgently need positive signals from the United States -- concrete signals regarding air defense systems,\" he said. \"We are still waiting for a response to our request to purchase systems that can help -- concrete signals, not words.\"",
      "Danylyuk said air defense is one area in which American support is particularly key.",
      "American-made defenses help enhance Kyiv's security in particular, he said. Without them, \"Kyiv would be hit in the same way as Odesa or Zaporizhizha,\" Danylyuk said.",
      "\"That's not nice. It will make life -- especially for Western diplomats including the U.S. diplomats -- much worse,\" he continued. \"Will it change our will to fight? No. There will be more civilians dying, that's the only difference.\"",
      "Behind and far above the front line, America's enormous intelligence capabilities have also been helping Kyiv resist Russia's war. American reconnaissance flights over eastern Europe, for example, have offered Kyiv otherwise unattainable forewarning on Russian activity and assistance in targeting.",
      "The Center for Strategic and International Studies said in May that U.S. intelligence aid has been \"extensive,\" including signals, imagery and human intelligence. \"This support has enabled Ukraine to counter missile barrages, disrupt covert operations and track force movements,\" CSIS wrote.",
      "Notably, Ukraine's air raid alerts are heavily informed by U.S. satellite data. When intelligence sharing was frozen in March, Ukrainian politicians warned that the result would be more dead civilians from Russia's nightly barrages.",
      "Shell hunger has also been a major problem for both sides throughout the war. Russia has turned to North Korea and Iran for sustenance, while Ukraine has turned to the West. During President Joe Biden's term, the U.S. sent more than 3 million 155mm shells to Ukraine. Any loss of supply could prove deadly for frontline Ukrainian units.",
      "The disappearance of other weapons from the battlefields would serve as a potent signal of an American pivot.",
      "Kyiv relies on the U.S. for ammunition for the HIMARS rocket artillery system, for example, including the long-range ATACMS.",
      "British-French Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missile, Ground Launched Small Diameter Bombs, M777 howitzers, AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missiles and F-16 fighter jets are all systems either produced by the U.S. or relying on American components and systems -- thus giving Washington power to veto their transfer to Kyiv.",
      "An end to American aid, Danylyuk said, \"Would create some problems,\" though would not \"be a complete disaster\" if Kyiv is able to quickly source replacements.",
      "Regardless, \"Ukraine is not going to collapse,\" Danylyuk said, recalling the two past windows during which American aid flows froze over.",
      "\"We could survive that terrible nine months without U.S. aid. So, it's not like Ukrainians are going to surrender.\"",

      "The humble water gun \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 has become the weapon of choice and symbol of Spain's anti-tourism protests",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- A group of tourists were sitting at an outdoor table in the Spanish city of Barcelona, trying to enjoy their drinks, when a woman raised a cheap plastic water gun and shot an arc of water at them.",
      "Her weapon of choice \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 is an increasingly common fixture at anti-tourism protests in the southern European country, where many locals fear that an overload of visitors is driving them from their cherished neighborhoods.",
      "How did the humble water gun become a symbol of discontent?",
      "The phenomenon started last July, when a fringe, left-wing activist group based in Barcelona that promotes the \u201cdegrowth\u201d of the city\u2019s successful tourism sector held its first successful rally. Some brought water guns to shoot one another and stay cool in the summer heat.",
      "\u201cWhat happened later went viral, but in reality it was just kind of a joke by a group of people who brought water guns because it was hot,\" Adriana Coten, one of the organizers of Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth, told The Associated Press.",
      "Then, some turned their water guns from each other to tourists. The images went around the world, becoming a publicity coup for the anti-tourism cause.",
      "The guns reappeared in April when the same group stopped a tour bus in Barcelona, the Catalan capital.",
      "On Sunday, around a thousand people marched from a luxury shopping boulevard popular with affluent foreigners before police stopped them from getting closer to Barcelona's top sight-seeing destination: La Sagrada Familia church.",
      "The marchers spritzed unsuspecting tourists along the way, chanting slogans and carrying protest signs. One read: \u201cOne more tourist, one less resident!\u201d",
      "They left a trail of stickers on hotel doors, lampposts and outdoor caf\u00e9 tables showing a squirting water gun encircled by a message in English: \u201cTourist Go Home!\u201d",
      "Still, the number of Barcelona protesters carrying water guns was a minority \u2014 and in the gun-toting group, many were only shooting in the air or at each other. One dad was toting his baby in a front-pack, water gun in hand.",
      "Outside the protests, Barcelona locals are not toting water guns or taking aim at tourists. And many in the city still support tourism, which is a pillar of the local economy.",
      "Can the water gun really change the minds of tourists, authorities or the businesses that drive the industry? Depends on who you ask.",
      "Protester Lourdes S\u00e1nchez and her teenage daughter, each holding a water gun, said the gun \"really isn\u2019t to hurt anyone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a symbol to say that we are fed up of how tourism industry is transforming our country into a theme park,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "Another demonstrator, Andreu Mart\u00ednez, acknowledged it was \u201cto bother the tourists a bit.\"",
      "Laurens Schocher, a 46-year-old architect, said he didn't shoot any suspected tourists but hoped that carrying a water gun would bring more attention to their cause.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the tourists will get it,\" he said. \"I think this is to send a message to authorities.\u201d",
      "The marchers had no monster, pump-action water cannons most kids use for backyard battles in the summer. Theirs were the old-school, cheap-o water guns that send a slim jet of water not that far away.",
      "Some tourists who were sprayed took it in stride, even claiming it was refreshing on a day with temperatures pushing up to around 30 degrees Celsius (87 Fahrenheit).",
      "But there were moments of tension. When several marchers squirted workers at a large hostel, tempers flared and one worker spat at his attackers as he slammed the hostel door shut.",
      "Nora Tsai, who had just arrived from Taiwan on a short visit, was among those spritzed on Sunday. She said she was a bit frightened and saddened. The \u201cTourist go home!\" chants didn't help either.",
      "\u201cI still like Barcelona,\" she said. \"I have met a lot of people who were kind.\u201d",

      "The Senate parliamentarian has advised that a Republican proposal that would shift some food stamp costs from the federal government to the states would violate the chamber\u2019s strict rules",
      "WASHINGTON -- In another blow to the Republicans\u2019 tax and spending cut bill, the Senate parliamentarian has advised that a proposal to shift some food stamps costs from the federal government to states \u2014 a centerpiece of GOP savings efforts \u2014 would violate the chamber\u2019s rules.",
      "While the parliamentarian's rulings are advisory, they are rarely, if ever, ignored. The Republican leadership was scrambling on Saturday, days before voting is expected to begin on President Donald Trump's package that he wants to be passed into law by the Fourth of July.",
      "The loss is expected to be costly to Republicans. They have been counting on some tens of billions of potential savings from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, to help offset the costs of the $4.5 trillion tax breaks plan. The parliamentarian let stand for now a provision that would impose new work requirements for older Americans, up to age 65, to receive food stamp aid.",
      "\u201cWe will keep fighting to protect families in need,\u201d said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, which handles the SNAP program.",
      "\u201cThe Parliamentarian has made clear that Senate Republicans cannot use their partisan budget to shift major nutrition assistance costs to the states that would have inevitably led to major cuts,\u201d she said.",
      "The committee chairman, Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., said in a statement that his team is examining options that would comply with Senate rules to achieve savings and \"to ensure SNAP serves those who truly need it while being responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars.\u201d",
      "The parliamentarian's ruling is the latest in a series of setbacks as staff works through the weekend, often toward midnight, to assess the 1,000-page proposal. It all points to serious trouble ahead for the bill, which was approved by the House on a party-line vote last month over unified opposition from Democrats and is now undergoing revisions in the Senate.",
      "At its core, the goal of the multitrillion-dollar package is to extend tax cuts from Trump's first term that would otherwise expire if Congress fails to act. It also adds new ones, including no taxes on tips or overtime pay. To help offset the costs of lost tax revenue, the Republicans are proposing cutbacks to federal Medicaid, health care and food programs \u2014 some $1 trillion. Additionally, the package boosts national security spending by about $350 billion, including to pay for Trump's mass deportations, which are running into protests nationwide.",
      "Trump has implored Republicans, who have the majority in Congress, to deliver on his top domestic priority, but the details of the package, with its hodgepodge of priorities, is drawing deeper scrutiny.",
      "All told, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the package, as approved by the House, would add at least $2.4 trillion to the nation's red ink over the decade and leave 10.9 million more people without health care coverage. Additionally, it would reduce or eliminate food stamps for more than 3 million people.",
      "The parliamentarian's office is tasked with scrutinizing the bill to ensure it complies with the so-called Byrd Rule, which is named after the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., and bars many policy matters in the budget reconciliation process now being used.",
      "Late Friday, the parliamentarian issued its latest findings. It determined that Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee\u2019s proposal to have the states pick up more of the tab for covering food stamps \u2014 what Republicans call a new cost-sharing arrangement \u2014 would be in violation of the Byrd Rule.",
      "Many lawmakers said the states would not be able to absorb the new requirement on food aid, which has long been provided by the federal government. They warned many would lose access to SNAP benefits used by more than 40 million people.",
      "Initially, the CBO had estimated about $128 billion in savings under the House\u2019s proposal to shift SNAP food aid costs to the states. Cost estimates for the Senate\u2019s version, which made changes to the House approach, have not yet been made publicly available.",
      "The parliamentarian's office rulings leave GOP leaders with several options. They can revise the proposals to try to comply with Senate rules or strip them from the package altogether. They can also risk a challenge during floor voting, which would require the 60-vote threshold to overcome. That would be unlikely in the split chamber with Democrats opposing the overall package.",
      "The parliamentarian's latest advice also said the committee's provision to make certain immigrants ineligible for food stamps would violate the rule. It found several provisions from the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, which is led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, to be in violation. They include one to provide $250 million to Coast Guard stations damaged by fire in 2025, namely one on South Padre Island in Texas.",
      "Still to come are some of the most important rulings from the parliamentarian. One will assess the GOP's approach that relies on \u201ccurrent policy\u201d rather than \u201ccurrent law\u201d as the baseline for determining whether the bill will add to the nation's deficits.",
      "Already, the parliamentarian delivered a serious setback Thursday, finding that the GOP plan to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was a core proposal coming from the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, would be in violation of the Byrd Rule.",
      "The parliamentarian has also advised of violations over provisions from the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee that would rollback Environmental Protection Agency emissions standards on certain vehicles and from the Senate Armed Services Committee to require the defense secretary to provide a plan on how the Pentagon intends to spend the tens of billions of new funds.",
      "The new work requirements in the package would require many of those receiving SNAP or Medicaid benefits to work 80 hours a month or engage in other community or educational services.",

      "A man accused of brandishing a rifle at a \u201cNo Kings\u201d rally in Utah \u2014 prompting an armed safety volunteer to open fire and accidentally kill a protester \u2014 has been released from jail while the investigation continues",
      "A man accused of brandishing a rifle at a \u201cNo Kings\u201d rally in Utah \u2014 prompting an armed safety volunteer to open fire and accidentally kill a protester \u2014 has been released from jail while the investigation continues.",
      "Salt Lake District Attorney Sim Gill's office said Friday that it was unable to make a decision on charges against Arturo Gamboa, who had been jailed on suspicion of murder following the June 14 shooting.",
      "Salt Lake City police had said Gamboa brought an assault-style rifle to the rally and was allegedly moving toward the crowd with the weapon raised when a safety volunteer for the event fired three shots, wounding Gamboa and killing a nearby demonstrator, Arthur Folasa Ah Loo.",
      "Gamboa did not fire his rifle and it is unclear what he intended to do with it. His father Albert Gamboa, told The Associated Press earlier this week that his son was \u201can innocent guy\u201d who was \u201cin the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d",
      "Utah is an open-carry state, meaning people who can legally own a firearm are generally allowed to carry it on a public street. The volunteer has not been publicly identified as investigators have worked to determine who was at fault.",
      "Judge James Blanch said in the release order that Gamboa must live with his father and is forbidden from possessing firearms. The conditions terminate after two months or if criminal charges against him are pursued, Blanch wrote.",
      "Gamboa's attorney, Greg Skordas, did not immediately respond to a telephone message left for him seeking comment.",
      "Police said the day after the shooting that witnesses reported seeing Gamboa lift the rifle when he was ordered to drop it and that instead he began running toward the crowd. He fled but was arrested nearby, accused of creating the dangerous situation that led to Ah Loo\u2019s death.",
      "Salt Lake City police said in a statement the next day that Gamboa \u201cknowingly engaged in conduct ... that ultimately caused the death of an innocent community member.\u201d",
      "But three days after Gamboa was booked into jail, with no formal charges filed, police acknowledged that the circumstances surrounding the shooting remained uncertain. They issued a public appeal for any video footage related to the shooting or Gamboa, and said detectives were still trying \u201cto piece together exactly what happened.\u201d",
      "The volunteer who confronted Gamboa was described by event organizers as a military veteran whose role as a safety volunteer was to maintain order.",
      "Experts say it\u2019s extremely rare for such individuals, often called safety marshals, to be armed. They typically rely on calm demeanor, communication and relationships with police and protesters to help keep order, said Edward Maguire, an Arizona State University criminology and criminal justice professor.",
      "Police said the permit for the protest did not specify that there would be armed security.",
      "Protest organizers have not said whether or how the safety volunteer who shot Ah Loo was trained or explained why he was armed. All attendees, including those in safety roles, were asked not to bring weapons, according to Sarah Parker, a national coordinator for the 50501 Movement. Parker's organization on Thursday said it was disassociating from a local chapter of the group that helped organize the Utah protest.",
      "The demonstration involving some 18,000 people was otherwise peaceful. It was one of hundreds nationwide against President Donald Trump\u2019s military parade in Washington, which marked the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary and coincided with Trump\u2019s birthday.",

      "House and Senate Republicans are taking different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax bill",
      "WASHINGTON -- House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.",
      "Republicans in the two chambers don't agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.",
      "The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.",
      "While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:",
      "The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.",
      "The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump's second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.",
      "The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.",
      "Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.",
      "The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.",
      "The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that\u2019s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.",
      "The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.",
      "The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.",
      "And on Social Security, the bills don't directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.",
      "Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.",
      "The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.",
      "The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.",
      "The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That's a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.",
      "The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.",
      "Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or \u201cObamacare,\u201d until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.",
      "Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.",
      "\u201cThis needs a lot of work. It\u2019s really concerning and I\u2019m really surprised by it,\u201d he said. \u201cRural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.\u201d",
      "The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.",
      "Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden's climate law. It aimed to boost the nation\u2019s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.",
      "Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.",
      "The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn't include such a provision.",
      "The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.",
      "Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.",

      "As the United Nations marks its 80th anniversary, its humanitarian operations are increasingly in doubt as its top donor \u2014 the United States \u2014 has cut funding under the Trump administration and some other top Western countries have followed suit",
      "KAKUMA, Kenya -- At a refugee camp in northern Kenya, Aujene Cimanimpaye waits as a hot lunch of lentils and sorghum is ladled out for her and her nine children \u2014 all born while she has received United Nations assistance since fleeing her violence-wracked home in Congo in 2007.",
      "\u201cWe cannot go back home because people are still being killed,\u201d the 41-year-old said at the Kakuma camp, where the U.N. World Food Program and U.N. refugee agency help support more than 300,000 refugees.",
      "Her family moved from Nakivale Refugee Settlement in neighboring Uganda three years ago to Kenya, now home to more than a million refugees from dozens of conflict-hit east African countries.",
      "A few kilometers (miles) away at the Kalobeyei Refugee Settlement, fellow Congolese refugee Bahati Musaba, a mother of five, said that since 2016, \u201cU.N. agencies have supported my children\u2019s education \u2014 we get food and water and even medicine,\u201d as well as cash support from WFP to buy food and other basics.",
      "This year, those cash transfers \u2014 and many other U.N. aid activities \u2014 have stopped, threatening to upend or jeopardize millions of lives.",
      "As the U.N. marks its 80th anniversary this month, its humanitarian agencies are facing one of the greatest crises in their history: The biggest funder \u2014 the United States \u2014 under the Trump administration and other Western donors have slashed international aid spending. Some want to use the money to build up national defense.",
      "Some U.N. agencies are increasingly pointing fingers at one another as they battle over a shrinking pool of funding, said a diplomat from a top donor country who spoke on condition of anonymity to comment freely about the funding crisis faced by some U.N. agencies.",
      "Such pressures, humanitarian groups say, diminish the pivotal role of the U.N. and its partners in efforts to save millions of lives \u2014 by providing tents, food and water to people fleeing unrest in places like Myanmar, Sudan, Syria and Venezuela, or helping stamp out smallpox decades ago.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the most abrupt upheaval of humanitarian work in the U.N. in my 40 years as a humanitarian worker, by far,\u201d said Jan Egeland, a former U.N. humanitarian aid chief who now heads the Norwegian Refugee Council. \u201cAnd it will make the gap between exploding needs and contributions to aid work even bigger.\u201d",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has asked the heads of U.N. agencies to find ways to cut 20% of their staffs, and his office in New York has floated sweeping ideas about reform that could vastly reshape the way the United Nations doles out aid.",
      "Humanitarian workers often face dangers and go where many others don\u2019t \u2014 to slums to collect data on emerging viruses or drought-stricken areas to deliver water.",
      "The U.N. says 2024 was the deadliest year for humanitarian personnel on record, mainly due to the war in Gaza. In February, it suspended aid operations in the stronghold of Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, who have detained dozens of U.N. and other aid workers.",
      "Proponents say U.N. aid operations have helped millions around the world affected by poverty, illness, conflict, hunger and other troubles.",
      "Critics insist many operations have become bloated, replete with bureaucratic perks and a lack of accountability, and are too distant from in-the-field needs. They say postcolonial Western donations have fostered dependency and corruption, which stifles the ability of countries to develop on their own, while often U.N.-backed aid programs that should be time-specific instead linger for many years with no end in sight.",
      "In the case of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning WFP and the U.N.\u2019s refugee and migration agencies, the U.S. has represented at least 40% of their total budgets, and Trump administration cuts to roughly $60 billion in U.S. foreign assistance have hit hard. Each U.N. agency has been cutting thousands of jobs and revising aid spending.",
      "\u201cIt's too brutal what has happened,\u201d said Egeland, alluding to cuts that have jolted the global aid community. \u201cHowever, it has forced us to make priorities ... what I hope is that we will be able to shift more of our resources to the front lines of humanity and have less people sitting in offices talking about the problem.\u201d",
      "With the U.N. Security Council's divisions over wars in Ukraine and the Middle East hindering its ability to prevent or end conflict in recent years, humanitarian efforts to vaccinate children against polio or shelter and feed refugees have been a bright spot of U.N. activity. That's dimming now.",
      "Aside from the cuts and dangers faced by humanitarian workers, political conflict has at times overshadowed or impeded their work.",
      "UNRWA, the aid agency for Palestinian refugees, has delivered an array of services to millions \u2014 food, education, jobs and much more \u2014 in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan as well as in the West Bank and Gaza since its founding in 1948.",
      "Israel claims the agency's schools fan antisemitic and anti-Israel sentiment, which the agency denies. Israel says Hamas siphons off U.N. aid in Gaza to profit from it, while U.N. officials insist most aid gets delivered directly to the needy.",
      "\u201cUNRWA is like one of the foundations of your home. If you remove it, everything falls apart,\u201d said Issa Haj Hassan, 38, after a checkup at a small clinic at the Mar Elias Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut.",
      "UNRWA covers his diabetes and blood pressure medication, as well as his wife\u2019s heart medicine. The United States, Israel's top ally, has stopped contributing to UNRWA; it once provided a third of its funding. Earlier this year, Israel banned the aid group, which has strived to continue its work nonetheless.",
      "Ibtisam Salem, a single mother of five in her 50s who shares a small one-room apartment in Beirut with relatives who sleep on the floor, said: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for UNRWA we would die of starvation. ... They helped build my home, and they give me health care. My children went to their schools.\u201d",
      "Especially when it comes to food and hunger, needs worldwide are growing even as funding to address them shrinks.",
      "\u201cThis year, we have estimated around 343 million acutely food insecure people,\u201d said Carl Skau, WFP deputy executive director. \u201cIt\u2019s a threefold increase if we compare four years ago. And this year, our funding is dropping 40%. So obviously that\u2019s an equation that doesn\u2019t come together easily.\u201d",
      "Billing itself as the world's largest humanitarian organization, WFP has announced plans to cut about a quarter of its 22,000 staff.",
      "One question is how the United Nations remains relevant as an aid provider when global cooperation is on the outs, and national self-interest and self-defense are on the upswing.",
      "The United Nations is not alone: Many of its aid partners are feeling the pinch. Groups like GAVI, which tries to ensure fair distribution of vaccines around the world, and the Global Fund, which spends billions each year to help battle HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, have been hit by Trump administration cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "Some private-sector, government-backed groups also are cropping up, including the divisive Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been providing some food to Palestinians. But violence has erupted as crowds try to reach the distribution sites.",
      "No private-sector donor or well-heeled country \u2014 China and oil-rich Gulf states are often mentioned by aid groups \u2014 have filled the significant gaps from shrinking U.S. and other Western spending.",
      "The future of U.N. aid, experts say, will rest where it belongs \u2014 with the world body's 193 member countries.",
      "\u201cWe need to take that debate back into our countries, into our capitals, because it is there that you either empower the U.N. to act and succeed \u2014 or you paralyze it,\u201d said Achim Steiner, administrator of the U.N. Development Program.",

    "story": [
      "A New Hampshire city that served as the backdrop for \u201cJumanji\u201d is celebrating the 30th anniversary of the film this weekend",
      "Madeline Murphy remembers the instructions she was given on the set of \u201cJumanji\u201d when she was an extra some 30 years ago: \u201cPretend you\u2019re frightened and you\u2019re screaming because an elephant\u2019s coming after you.\u201d",
      "So, that's what she did in the Central Square of Keene, New Hampshire, running back and forth, over and over, on a long day in November 1994.",
      "\u201cI was pretty tired by the end of the day, and it was cold,\" said Murphy, 61. She got a check for $60.47 \u2014 and several seconds of screen time.",
      "Murphy was one of about 125 extras cast in the classic Robin Williams film, which is marking its 30th anniversary. It's spawned several sequels, including one planned for next year. The city of about 23,000 people in the southwestern corner of the state is celebrating its ties to \u201cJumanji\u201d this weekend.",
      "A featured event is a \u201cRhino Rumble Road Race\u201d saluting the film\u2019s stampede scenes of elephants, rhinos and zebras on Saturday. Runners in inflatable animal costumes are sprinting about a quarter mile (less than half a kilometer) around the square.",
      "There's also a cast party, a parade, and a scavenger hunt, among other events.",
      "Based on the 1981 children\u2019s book by Chris Van Allsburg about a mysterious jungle adventure board game, the movie version of \u201cJumanji\u201d is set in the fictional small town of Brantford, New Hampshire.",
      "Veteran location manager Dow Griffith was crisscrossing New England in search of the right spot. A coffee lover who grew up in Seattle, he recalled feeling desperate one day for a good brew. He was a bit east of Keene at the time, and someone suggested a shop that was near the square.",
      "\u201cI took my cherished cup of double dry cappuccino out to the front porch, took a sip, looked to my left \u2014 and by God \u2014 there was the place I had been looking for!\" he told The Associated Press. \u201cSo really, we have coffee to thank for the whole thing.\u201d",
      "Scenes were filmed at the square that fall and the following spring. The fall scenes show a present-day town that had declined. Extras played homeless people and looters, in addition to panicked runners fleeing from the jungle animals.",
      "Joanne Hof, now 78, had needed her son's help to spot herself behind the elephants, running with her hands up. Hof, a reading specialist, bought a videotape of \u201cJumanji\u201d and showed it to the kids she worked with.",
      "\u201cThey were very impressed that I was in the movie,\u201d she said.",
      "The spring scenes, appearing early in the film, depict the town in 1969. Extras drove classic cars around the pristine-looking square and others walked around, dressed for that time period.",
      "\u201cI told the makeup person, \u2018Do you know how to do a French twist?\u2019\" recalled Kate Beetle, 74, of Alstead, who said she can be seen for \"a micro-second\" crossing a street. \u201cThey just found me the right lady's suit and right flat shoes, and then the hair is kind of what I suspect did it.\u201d",
      "The \u201cJumanji\u201d crews worked well with the city in getting the permits to transform Central Square into a dilapidated, neglected piece of public property, recalled Patty Little, who recently retired as Keene's clerk.",
      "\u201cThey brought in old, dead shrubbery and threw it around and made the paint peel on the gazebo,\u201d she said. Items such as parking meters and lilac bushes were removed and a large Civil War-era statue was brought in to cover a fountain. Graffiti was on the walls and crumpled vehicles in the stampede scene were anchored in place.",

      "NEW YORK -- As the U.S. marks the 250th anniversary of the Battle of Bunker Hill, it might take a moment \u2014 or more \u2014 to remember why.",
      "Start with the very name.",
      "\u201cThere's something percussive about it: Battle of Bunker Hill,\u201d says prize-winning historian Nathaniel Philbrick, whose \u201cBunker Hill: A City, A Siege, A Revolution\u201d was published in 2013. \u201cWhat actually happened probably gets hazy for people outside of the Boston area, but it's part of our collective memory and imagination.\u201d",
      "\u201cFew \u2018ordinary\u2019 Americans could tell you that Freeman\u2019s Farm, or Germantown, or Guilford Court House were battles,\u201d says Paul Lockhart, a professor of history at Wright University and author of a Bunker Hill book, \u201cThe Whites of Their Eyes,\" which came out in 2011. \"But they can say that Gettysburg,D-Day, and Bunker Hill were battles.\u201d",
      "Bunker Hill, Lockhart adds, \u201cis the great American battle, if there is such a thing.\u201d",
      "Much of the world looks to the Battles of Lexington and Concord, fought in Massachusetts on April 19, 1775, as the start of the American Revolution. But Philbrick, Lockhart and others cite Bunker Hill and June 17 as the real beginning, the first time British and rebel forces faced off in sustained conflict over a specific piece of territory.",
      "Bunker Hill was an early showcase for two long-running themes in American history \u2014 improvisation and how an inspired band of militias could hold their own against an army of professionals.",
      "\u201cIt was a horrific bloodletting, and provided the British high command with proof that the Americans were going to be a lot more difficult to subdue than had been hoped,\u201d says the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Rick Atkinson, whose second volume of a planned trilogy on the Revolution, \u201cThe Fate of the Day,\u201d was published in April.",
      "The battle was born in part out of error; rebels were seeking to hold off a possible British attack by fortifying Bunker Hill, a 110-foot-high (34-meter-high) peak in Charlestown across the Charles River from British-occupied Boston. But for reasons still unclear, they instead armed a smaller and more vulnerable ridge known as Breed's Hill, \u201cwithin cannon shot of Boston,\u201d Philbrick says. \"The British felt they had no choice but to attack and seize the American fort.\u201d",
      "Abigail Adams, wife of future President John Adams, and son John Quincy Adams, also a future president, were among thousands in the Boston area who looked on from rooftops, steeples and trees as the two sides fought with primal rage. A British officer would write home about the \u201cshocking carnage\u201d left behind, a sight \u201cthat never will be erased out of my mind 'till the day of my death.\u201d",
      "The rebels were often undisciplined and disorganized and they were running out of gunpowder. The battle ended with them in retreat, but not before the British had lost more than 200 soldiers and sustained more than 1,000 casualties, compared to some 450 colonial casualties and the destruction of hundreds of homes, businesses and other buildings in Charlestown. Bunker Hill would become characteristic of so much of the Revolutionary War: a technical defeat that was a victory because the British needed to win decisively and the rebels needed only not to lose decisively.",
      "\u201cNobody now entertains a doubt but that we are able to cope with the whole force of Great Britain, if we are but willing to exert ourselves,\u201d Thomas Jefferson wrote to a friend in early July. \u201cAs our enemies have found we can reason like men, now let us show them we can fight like men also.\u201d",

      "SAN DIEGO -- Adam Greenfield was home nursing a cold when his girlfriend raced in to tell him Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicles were pulling up in their trendy San Diego neighborhood.",
      "The poet and podcast producer grabbed his iPhone and bolted out the door barefoot, joining a handful of neighbors recording masked agents raiding a popular Italian restaurant nearby, as they yelled at the officers to leave. An hour later, the crowd had grown to nearly 75 people, with many in front of the agents\u2019 vehicles.",
      "\u201cI couldn't stay silent,\u201d Greenfield said. \u201cIt was literally outside of my front door.\u201d",
      "More Americans are witnessing people being hauled off as they shop, exercise at the gym, dine out and otherwise go about their daily lives as President Donald Trump's administration aggressively works to increase immigration arrests. As the raids touch the lives of people who aren\u2019t immigrants themselves, many Americans who rarely, if ever, participated in civil disobedience are rushing out to record the actions on their phones and launch impromptu protests.",
      "Greenfield said on the evening of the May 30 raid, the crowd included grandparents, retired military members, hippies, and restaurant patrons arriving for date night. Authorities threw flash bangs to force the crowd back and then drove off with four detained workers, he said.",
      "\u201cTo do this, at 5 o\u2019clock, right at the dinner rush, right on a busy intersection with multiple restaurants, they were trying to make a statement,\u201d Greenfield said. \"But I don\u2019t know if their intended point is getting across the way they want it to. I think it is sparking more backlash.\u201d",
      "Previously many arrests happened late at night or in the pre-dawn hours by agents waiting outside people's homes as they left for work or outside their work sites when they finished their day. When ICE raided another popular restaurant in San Diego in 2008, agents did it in the early morning without incident.",
      "White House border czar Tom Homan has said agents are being forced to do more arrests in communities because of sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with ICE in certain cities and states. ICE enforces immigration laws nationwide but seeks state and local help in alerting federal authorities of immigrants wanted for deportation and holding that person until federal officers take custody.",
      "Vice President JD Vance during a visit to Los Angeles on Friday said those policies have given agents \u201ca bit of a morale problem because they've had the local government in this community tell them that they're not allowed to do their job.\"",
      "\u201cWhen that Border Patrol agent goes out to do their job, they said within 15 minutes they have protesters, sometimes violent protesters who are in their face obstructing them,\u201d he said.",
      "Melyssa Rivas had just arrived at her office in the Los Angeles suburb of Downey, California one morning last week when she heard the frightened screams of young women. She went outside to find the women confronting nearly a dozen masked federal agents who had surrounded a man kneeling on the pavement.",
      "\u201cIt was like a scene out of a movie,\u201d Rivas said. \u201cThey all had their faces covered and were standing over this man who was clearly traumatized. And there are these young girls screaming at the top of their lungs.\u201d",
      "As Rivas began recording the interaction, a growing group of neighbors shouted at the agents to leave the man alone. They eventually drove off in vehicles, without detaining him, video shows.",
      "Rivas spoke to the man afterward, who told her the agents had arrived at the car wash where he worked that morning, then pursued him as he fled on his bicycle. It was one of several recent workplace raids in the majority-Latino city.",
      "The same day, federal agents were seen at a Home Depot, a construction site and an LA Fitness gym. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how many people had been detained.",
      "\u201cEveryone is just rattled,\u201d said Alex Frayde, an employee at LA Fitness who said he saw the agents outside the gym and stood at the entrance, ready to turn them away as another employee warned customers about the sighting. In the end, the agents never came in.",
      "Arrests at immigration courts and other ICE buildings have also prompted emotional scenes as masked agents have turned up to detain people going to routine appointments and hearings.",
      "In the city of Spokane in rural eastern Washington state, hundreds of people rushed to protest outside an ICE building June 11 after former city councilor Ben Stuckart posted on Facebook. Stuckart wrote that he was a legal guardian of a Venezuelan asylum seeker who who went to check in at the ICE building only to be detained. His Venezuelan roommate was also detained.",
      "Both men had permission to live and work in the U.S. temporarily under humanitarian parole, Stuckart told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI am going to sit in front of the bus,\u201d Stuckart wrote, referring to the van that was set to transport the two men to an ICE detention center in Tacoma. \u201cThe Latino community needs the rest of our community now. Not tonight, not Saturday but right now!!!!\u201d",
      "The city of roughly 230,000 is the seat of Spokane County, where just over half of voters cast ballots for Trump in the 2024 presidential election.",
      "Stuckart was touched to see his mother\u2019s caregiver among the demonstrators.",
      "\u201cShe was just like, \u2018I\u2019m here because I love your mom, and I love you, and if you or your friends need help, then I want to help,\u2019\u201d he said through tears.",
      "By evening, the Spokane Police Department sent over 180 officers, with some using pepper balls, to disperse protesters. Over 30 people were arrested, including Stuckart who blocked the transport van with others. He was later released.",
      "Aysha Mercer, a stay-at-home mother of three, said she is \u201cnot political in any way, shape or form.\" But many children in her Spokane neighborhood -- who play in her yard and jump on her trampoline -- come from immigrant families, and the thought of them being affected by deportations was \u201cunacceptable,\" she said.",
      "She said she wasn't able to go to Stuckart's protest. But she marched for the first time in her life on June 14, joining millions in \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests across the country.",

      "A holiday and a juror's illness shortened the sixth week of the Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs' sex trafficking trial as prosecutors nearly concluded their case, setting the stage for the defense presentation",
      "NEW YORK -- The sixth week of the Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs\u2019 sex trafficking trial was shortened by a holiday and a juror's illness as prosecutors nearly concluded their case, setting the stage for a one- or two-day defense presentation next week.",
      "In the trial's first five weeks, jurors repeatedly heard testimony about drug-fueled marathon sex events described as \u201cfreak-offs\u201d by one of Combs' ex-girlfriends and as \u201chotel nights\u201d by another. In the sixth week, they were shown about 20 minutes of video recordings from the dayslong events.",
      "Combs, the founder of Bad Boy Entertainment, has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges in the trial, which continues Monday.",
      "Here are key moments from the past week:",
      "Jurors largely kept their reactions muted when they were shown about 20 minutes of recordings made by Combs of his then-girlfriends having sex with male sex workers at the elaborately staged \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors say the events were proof of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges because Combs coerced his employees, associates and even his girlfriends to recruit and arrange flights for sex workers while his workers obtained drugs, stocked hotel rooms with baby oil, lubricant, condoms, candles and liquor and delivered cash.",
      "In her opening statement, defense lawyer Teny Geragos had called the videos \u201cpowerful evidence that the sexual conduct in this case was consensual and not based on coercion.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors played about 2 minutes of the recordings before the defense team aired about 18 minutes of the videos.",
      "The public and the press were unable to observe whether the prosecutors or defense lawyers had the better arguments after the judge ruled that neither the recordings nor the sound could be seen or heard by anyone except lawyers, the judge and the jury.",
      "Several jurors seemed to cast their eyes and sometimes turn their bodies away from the screens directly in front of them while the recordings played. The jurors listened through earphones supplied by the court, as did Combs and lawyers.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian started the week by dismissing a juror whose conflicting answers about whether he lived in New Jersey or New York convinced the judge he was a threat to the integrity of the trial.",
      "Subramanian said the juror's answers during jury selection and in the week before he was excused \u201craised serious concerns as to the juror\u2019s candor and whether he shaded answers to get on and stay on the jury.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe inconsistencies \u2014 where the juror has lived and with whom \u2014 go to straightforward issues as to which there should not have been any doubts, and the answers also go to something vital: the basic qualifications of a juror to serve,\u201d the judge said.",
      "Residents of New Jersey would not be permitted to sit on a New York federal jury.",
      "A day before Subramanian ruled, defense lawyers argued fiercely against dismissal, saying that replacing the Black juror with a white alternate juror so late in the trial would change the diverse demographics of the jury and require a mistrial.",
      "The jurors are anonymous for the Combs trial.",
      "It wasn't the only issue regarding jurors for the week. The judge, angered by a media report about the questioning of another juror the week before that occurred in a sealed proceeding, warned lawyers that they could face civil and criminal sanctions if such a leak happened again. That juror was not dismissed.",
      "And Wednesday's court session had to be canceled after a juror reported \"vertigo symptoms\" on the way to the courthouse.",
      "Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo seemed to close the door on any chance Combs would testify when he said Friday that the defense presentation would be finished Tuesday or Wednesday the following week, even if prosecutors don't rest until late Monday.",
      "It is not uncommon for defendants to choose not to testify at criminal trials. Besides being exposed to cross-examination by prosecutors, the testimony can be used by the government against the defendant should there be a need for a retrial. Also, if there is a conviction, the judge can conclude that the jury believed the defendant lied on the stand.",
      "Brendan Paul, fresh off the college basketball courts where he once played in a cameo role for Syracuse University, joined Combs' companies as a personal assistant in late 2022 and was warned by a friend who had worked for Combs about what was ahead.",
      "\u201cHe told me to get in and get out,\u201d Paul recalled for the jury, citing the endless days and always-on-edge existence. \u201cIf you have a girlfriend, break up with her. And you\u2019re never going to see your family.\u201d",
      "The friend also instructed him to \u201cbuild a rolodex of clientele and get out,\u201d he said.",
      "Paul said he worked 80 to 100 hours a week for a music power broker who received \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of text messages and emails a day. He was paid $75,000 salary initially, but it was raised in January 2024 to $100,000.",
      "He said Combs told him he \u201cdoesn't take no for an answer\u201d and wanted his staff to \u201cmove like Seal Team Six.\u201d",
      "Several times, Paul said, he picked up drugs for Combs and knew to keep his boss out of the drug trade because \u201cit was very important to keep his profile low. He's a celebrity.\u201d",
      "The job came to an abrupt end in March 2024 when Paul was arrested at a Miami airport on drug charges after a small amount of cocaine that he said he picked up in Combs' room that morning was mistakenly put in his travel bag as he prepared to join Combs on a trip to the Bahamas. The charges were later dropped in a pretrial diversion program.",
      "Paul said he hadn't seen Combs since.",

      "Rhode Island\u2019s Democratic-controlled state House has advanced legislation that would ban sales of certain semiautomatic rifles",
      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Rhode Island\u2019s Democratic-controlled state House on Friday approved legislation that would ban the sale and manufacturing of many semiautomatic rifles commonly referred to as assault weapons.",
      "The proposal now heads to the desk of Democratic Gov. Dan McKee, who has said he supports assault weapons bans. If the bill is signed into law, Rhode Island will join 10 states that have some sort of prohibition on high-powered firearms that were once banned nationwide and are now largely the weapon of choice among those responsible for most of the country\u2019s devastating mass shootings.",
      "Gun control advocates have been pushing for an assault weapons ban in Rhode Island for more than a decade. However, despite being a Democratic stronghold, lawmakers throughout the country\u2019s smallest state have long quibbled over the necessity and legality of such proposals.",
      "The bill only applies to the sale and manufacturing of assault weapons and not possession. Only Washington state has a similar law. Residents looking to purchase an assault weapon from nearby New Hampshire or elsewhere will also be blocked. Federal law prohibits people from traveling to a different state to purchase a gun and returning it to a state where that particular of weapon is banned.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have bans on the possession of assault weapons, covering major cities like New York and Los Angeles. Hawaii bans assault pistols.",
      "Democratic Rep. Rebecca Kislak described the bill during floor debates Friday as an incremental move that brings Rhode Island in line with neighboring states.",
      "\u201cI am gravely disappointed we are not doing more, and we should do more,\" she said. \"And given the opportunity to do this or nothing, I am voting to do something.\u201d",
      "Critics of Rhode Island\u2019s proposed law argued that assault weapons bans do little to curb mass shootings and only punish people with such rifles.",
      "\u201cThis bill doesn\u2019t go after criminals, it just puts the burden on law-abiding citizens,\u201d said Republican Sen. Thomas Paolino.",
      "Republican Rep. Michael Chippendale, House minority leader, predicted that if the legislation were to become law, the U.S. Supreme Court would eventually deem it unconstitutional.",
      "\u201cWe are throwing away money on this,\" he said.",
      "It wasn\u2019t just Republicans who opposed the legislation. David Hogg \u2014 a gun control advocate who survived the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida \u2014 and the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence described the proposed ban as the \u201cweakest assault weapons ban in the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know that Rhode Islanders deserve a strong bill that not only bans the sale, but also the possession of assault weapons. It is this combination that equals public safety,\u201d Hogg said in a statement.",
      "Elisabeth Ryan, policy counsel at Everytown for Gun Safety, rejected claims that the proposed law is weak.",
      "\u201cThe weakest law is what Rhode Island has now, no ban on assault weapons,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThis would create a real, enforceable ban on the sale and manufacture of assault weapons, just like the law already working in Washington state, getting them off the shelves of Rhode Island gun stores once and for all.\u201d",
      "Nationally, assault weapons bans have been challenged in court by gun rights groups that argue the bans violate the Second Amendment. AR-15-style firearms are among the best-selling rifles in the country.",
      "The conservative-majority Supreme Court may soon take up the issue. The justices declined to hear a challenge to Maryland\u2019s assault weapons ban in early June, but three conservative justices \u2014 Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas \u2014 publicly noted their disagreement. A fourth, Brett Kavanaugh, indicated he was skeptical that the bans are constitutional and predicted the court would hear a case \u201cin the next term or two.\u201d",

      "An internal State Department memo says the military flight, the second known to have occurred this week, left Tel Aviv for Sofia, Bulgaria, where some or all of the passengers were to get a connecting charter flight to Washington.",
      "The document, which was obtained by The Associated Press, also said that more than 6,400 U.S. citizens in Israel had filled out an online form on Friday alone asking for information about when and if the U.S. government would organize evacuation flights. An additional 3,265 people, some of whom may also have competed the form, called an emergency number seeking assistance.",
      "The document estimated that between 300 and 500 people per day could need evacuation assistance should the U.S. decide to offer flights or ships to get Americans out, as the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has said is being considered.",
      "There are some 700,000 Americans in Israel, many of them dual nationals, according to estimates, although the exact number at any given time is unclear because U.S. citizens are not required to notify the embassy if they are there or when they might leave.",
      "Earlier Friday, before the memo was distributed, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters that more than 25,000 Americans had reached out for information on leaving Israel, the West Bank and Iran.",
      "She told reporters that those people had sought \u201cinformation and support\u201d and were \u201cseeking guidance\u201d on departing. She would not give a breakdown of where the queries had come from and would not comment on embassy evacuations.",
      "In Iran, the document said that at least 84 U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, or Green Card holders, had crossed into neighboring Azerbaijan by land since the conflict began and that an additional 774 had been granted permission to enter as of Friday.",

      "A fast-moving fire fueled by high winds has destroyed a dozen structures, including homes, and forced some in a rural area of southwest Utah to evacuate",
      "PINE VALLEY, Utah -- A fast-moving fire fueled by high winds on Friday has destroyed a dozen structures, including homes, and forced some in a rural area of southwest Utah to evacuate.",
      "The Forsyth Fire started Thursday in the Pine Valley Mountains and has already burned about 2.3 square miles (5.96 square kilometers), said Karl Hunt, a spokesperson for the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire & State Lands. It has forced people to evacuate from the Pine Valley Community and nearby campgrounds, although the number of people who have fled was not immediately clear.",
      "The blaze, which is about 15 miles (24.1 kilometers) northeast of St. George and includes steep, mountainous terrain, has also threatened 400 structures.",
      "By Friday evening, the fire remained uncontained despite 150 people battling the blaze, including two hotshot crews from Utah and Nevada, according to Hunt. Teams were using helicopters, more than a dozen engines and water tenders.",
      "The cause of the fire has not been determined and is under investigation, Hunt said.",
      "He urged the public to stay away, saying: \u201cLet the firefighters do what they do best and try to get this fire under control.\u201d",
      "There has been a red flag warning in the area since Thursday because of high wind gusts, low humidity and high temperatures.",
      "Hunt said the blaze came fairly early in the year, following a drought declaration by Utah's governor.",
      "\u201cSo the fuel is drier this year as well. And so if you combine the drier fuel with the high winds and it\u2019s ripe for a wildfire,\u201d he said. \u201cKind of like the perfect storm.\u201d",
      "There have been no injuries or deaths, according to Hunt.",
      "Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said on the social media site X that they are closely monitoring the fire and urged the public to follow local officials' instructions.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re in the area, please evacuate immediately,\" he said. \u201cFirst responders are doing heroic work, but they need your cooperation to save lives.\u201d",

      "Vice President JD Vance is accusing California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of encouraging violent immigration protests",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Vice President JD Vance on Friday accused California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of encouraging violent immigration protests as he used his appearance in Los Angeles to rebut criticism from state and local officials that the Trump administration fueled the unrest by sending in federal officers.",
      "Vance also referred to U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, the state\u2019s first Latino senator, as \u201cJose Padilla,\u201d a week after the Democrat was forcibly taken to the ground by officers and handcuffed after speaking out during a Los Angeles news conference by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on immigration raids.",
      "\u201cI was hoping Jose Padilla would be here to ask a question,\u201d Vance said, in an apparent reference to the altercation at Noem\u2019s event. \u201cI guess he decided not to show up because there wasn\u2019t a theater. And that\u2019s all it is.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey want to be able to go back to their far-left groups and to say, \u2018Look, me, I stood up against border enforcement. I stood up against Donald Trump,\u2019\u201d Vance added.",
      "A spokesperson for Padilla, Tess Oswald, noted in a social media post that Padilla and Vance were formerly colleagues in the Senate and said that Vance should know better. \u201cHe should be more focused on demilitarizing our city than taking cheap shots,\u201d Oswald said.",
      "Vance\u2019s visit to Los Angeles to tour a multiagency Federal Joint Operations Center and a mobile command center came as demonstrations calmed down in the city and a curfew was lifted this week. That followed over a week of sometimes-violent clashes between protesters and police and outbreaks of vandalism and looting that followed immigration raids across Southern California.",
      "Trump\u2019s dispatching of his top emissary to Los Angeles at a time of turmoil surrounding the Israel-Iran war and the U.S.\u2019s future role in it signals the political importance Trump places on his hard-line immigration policies. Vance echoed the president's harsh rhetoric toward California Democrats as he sought to blame them for the protests in the city.",
      "\u201cGavin Newsom and Karen Bass, by treating the city as a sanctuary city, have basically said that this is open season on federal law enforcement,\u201d Vance said after he toured federal immigration enforcement offices.",
      "\u201cWhat happened here was a tragedy,\u201d Vance added. \u201cYou had people who were doing the simple job of enforcing the law and they had rioters egged on by the governor and the mayor, making it harder for them to do their job. That is disgraceful. And it is why the president has responded so forcefully.\u201d",
      "Newsom\u2019s spokesperson Izzy Gardon said in a statement, \u201cThe Vice President\u2019s claim is categorically false. The governor has consistently condemned violence and has made his stance clear.\u201d",
      "Speaking at City Hall, Bass said Vance was \u201cspewing lies and utter nonsense.\u201d She said hundreds of millions of dollars were wasted by the federal government on a \u201cstunt.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow dare you say that city officials encourage violence? We kept the peace,\u201d Bass said.",
      "In a statement on X, Newsom responded to Vance's reference to \u201cJose Padilla,\u201d saying the comment was no accident.",
      "Jose Padilla also is the name of a convicted al-Qaida terrorism plotter during President George W. Bush's administration, who was sentenced to two decades in prison. Padilla was arrested in 2002 at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport during the tense months after the 9/11 attacks and accused of the \u201cdirty bomb\u201d mission. It later emerged through U.S. interrogation of other al-Qaida suspects that the \u201cmission\u201d was only a sketchy idea, and those claims never surfaced in the South Florida terrorism case.",
      "Responding to the outrage, Taylor Van Kirk, a spokesperson for Vance, said of the vice president: \u201cHe must have mixed up two people who have broken the law.\u201d",
      "Federal immigration authorities have been ramping up arrests across the country to fulfill Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations. Todd Lyons, the head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has defended his tactics against criticism that authorities are being too heavy-handed.",
      "The friction in Los Angeles began June 6, when federal agents conducted a series of immigration sweeps in the region that have continued since. Amid the protests and over the objections of state and local officials, Trump ordered the deployment of roughly 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to the second-largest U.S. city, home to 3.8 million people.",
      "Trump has said that without the military's involvement, Los Angeles \u201cwould be a crime scene like we haven\u2019t seen in years.\u201d",
      "Newsom has depicted the military intervention as the onset of a much broader effort by Trump to overturn political and cultural norms at the heart of the nation\u2019s democracy.",
      "Earlier Friday, Newsom urged Vance to visit victims of the deadly January wildfires while in Southern California and talk with Trump, who earlier this week suggested his feud with the governor might influence his consideration of $40 billion in federal wildfire aid for California. \u201cI hope we get that back on track,\u201d Newsom wrote on X. \u201cWe are counting on you, Mr. Vice President.\u201d",
      "Vance did not mention either request during his appearance on Friday.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has moved on several fronts to block Harvard University\u2019s enrollment of international students as his administration presses its demands for a series of policy and governance changes at the Ivy League school",
      "President Donald Trump and his administration have tried several tactics to block Harvard University's enrollment of international students, part of the White House's effort to secure policy changes at the private, Ivy League college.",
      "Targeting foreign students has become the administration's cornerstone effort to crack down on the nation's oldest and wealthiest college. The block on international enrollment, which accounts for a quarter of Harvard's students and much of its global allure, strikes at the core of Harvard's identity. Courts have stopped some of the government's actions, at least for now \u2014 but not all.",
      "In the latest court order, a federal judge on Friday put one of those efforts on hold until a lawsuit is resolved. But the fate of Harvard's international students \u2014 and its broader standoff with the Trump administration \u2014 remain in limbo.",
      "Here are all the ways the Trump administration has moved to block Harvard's foreign enrollment \u2014 and where each effort stands.",
      "In May, the Trump administration tried to ban foreign students at Harvard, citing the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s authority to oversee which colleges are part of the Student Exchange and Visitor Program. The program allows colleges to issue documents that foreign students need to study in the United States.",
      "Harvard filed a lawsuit, arguing the administration violated the government\u2019s own regulations for withdrawing a school\u2019s certification.",
      "Within hours, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston put the administration\u2019s ban on hold temporarily \u2014 an order that had an expiration date. On Friday, she issued a preliminary injunction, blocking Homeland Security's move until the case is decided. That could take months or longer.",
      "The government can and does remove colleges from the Student Exchange and Visitor Program, making them ineligible to host foreign students on their campus. However, it\u2019s usually for administrative reasons outlined in law, such as failing to maintain accreditation, lacking proper facilities for classes, failing to employ qualified professional personnel \u2014 even failing to \u201coperate as a bona fide institution of learning.\u201d Other colleges are removed when they close.",
      "Notably, Burroughs' order Friday said the federal government still has authority to review Harvard\u2019s ability to host international students through normal processes outlined in law. After Burroughs' emergency block in May, DHS issued a more typical \u201cNotice of Intent to Withdraw\u201d Harvard's participation in the international student visa program.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s order does not affect the DHS\u2019s ongoing administrative review,\u201d Harvard said Friday in a message to its international students. \u201cHarvard is fully committed to compliance with the applicable F-1 (student visa) regulations and strongly opposes any effort to withdraw the University\u2019s certification.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, Trump himself moved to block entry to the United States for incoming Harvard students, issuing a proclamation that invoked a different legal authority.",
      "Harvard filed a court challenge attacking Trump\u2019s legal justification for the action \u2014 a federal law allowing him to block a \u201cclass of aliens\u201d deemed detrimental to the nation\u2019s interests. Targeting only those who are coming to the U.S. to study at Harvard doesn\u2019t qualify as a \u201cclass of aliens,\u201d Harvard said in its filing.",
      "Harvard's lawyers asked the court to block the action. Burroughs agreed to pause the entry ban temporarily, without giving an expiration date. She has not yet ruled on Harvard's request for another preliminary injunction, which would pause the ban until the court case is decided. \u201cWe expect the judge to issue a more enduring decision in the coming days,\u201d Harvard told international students Friday.",
      "At the center of Trump\u2019s pressure campaign against Harvard are his assertions that the school has tolerated anti-Jewish harassment, especially during pro-Palestinian protests. In seeking to keep Harvard students from coming to the U.S., he said Harvard is not a suitable destination. Harvard President Alan Garber has said the university has made changes to combat antisemitism and will not submit to the administration\u2019s demands for further changes.",
      "In late May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio directed U.S. embassies and consulates to start reviewing social media accounts of visa applicants who plan to attend, work at or visit Harvard University for any signs of antisemitism.",
      "On Wednesday, the State Department said it was launching new vetting of social media accounts for foreigners applying for student visas, and not just those seeking to attend Harvard. Consular officers will be on the lookout for posts and messages that could be deemed hostile to the United States, its government, culture, institutions or founding principles, the department said, telling visa applicants to set their social media accounts to \u201cpublic.\u201d",
      "In reopening the visa process, the State Department also told consulates to prioritize students hoping to enroll at colleges where foreigners make up less than 15% of the student body, a U.S. official familiar with the matter said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to detail information that has not been made public.",
      "Foreign students make up more than 15% of the total student body at almost 200 U.S. universities \u2014 including Harvard and the other Ivy League schools, according to an Associated Press analysis of federal education data from 2023. Most are private universities, including all eight Ivy League schools.",
      "Some Harvard students are also caught up in the government's recent ban against travel to the U.S. by citizens of 12 nations, mostly in Africa and the Middle East. The Trump administration last weekend called for 36 additional countries to commit to improving vetting of travelers or face a ban on their citizens visiting the United States.",
      "Harvard sponsors more than 7,000 people on a combination of F-1 and J-1 visas, which are issued to students and to foreigners visiting the U.S. on exchange programs such as fellowships. Across all the schools that make up the university, about 26% of the student body is from outside the U.S.",
      "But some schools and programs, by nature of their subject matter, have significantly more international students. At the Harvard Kennedy School, which covers public policy and public administration, 49% of students are on F-1 visas. In the business school, one-third of students come from abroad. And within the law school, 94% of the students in the master\u2019s program in comparative law are international students.",
      "The administration has imposed a range of sanctions on Harvard since it rejected the government\u2019s demands for policy reforms related to campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Conservatives say the demands are merited, decrying Harvard as a hotbed of liberalism and antisemitism. Harvard says the administration is illegally retaliating against the university.",

      "Controllers were able to continue directing planes across five states in the Southeast because a backup system kicked in immediately as designed. The Federal Aviation Administration said no flights were disrupted.",

A contractor was working on repairing the severed fiber line Friday afternoon. Authorities didn't specify what caused the severed line or where it happened.",

In that case, the backup system didn't work immediately. Those outages led to major disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey because five controllers went on trauma leave afterward, and that facility in Philadelphia directs planes in and out of the airport.",

That center is responsible for planes flying across roughly 160,000 square miles (414,000 square kilometers) of airspace across most of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina.",
      "The problems in Newark were blamed on the failure of aging copper wires that much of the nation's air traffic control system still relies on. Transportation officials said the Newark problems demonstrated the need for a multimillion-dollar overhaul of the system that they are lobbying Congress to approve.",

      "Some migrants have been arrested at the court by federal immigration officers. The Rev. Scott Santarosa, a Jesuit priest who was lead organizer of the group, said the purpose of the visitation \u201cis more than anything just to provide some sense of presence.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are longing for people of faith to walk with vulnerable migrants,\u201d added Santarosa, the pastor of San Diego\u2019s Our Lady of Guadalupe Church. \u201cOur goal is not trying to prevent arrests \u2014 but we can witness it.\u201d",
      "The visit was preceded by a Mass at San Diego\u2019s Catholic Cathedral with bishops and other clergy \u2014 including Bishop Michael Pham, the top-ranking official in the group and one of the first bishops to be appointed by Pope Leo XIV after his election as pontiff \u2014 offering prayers for refugees and migrants on World Refugee Day.

But the company argued that it wasn't on the hook because the actions leading to Ferguson's arrest and imprisonment occurred before its coverage began.",
      "While Ferguson sought to collect, the officers argued that St. Paul was acting in bad faith, shifting the burden to them as individuals and forcing them to face bankruptcy. Ferguson's lawyers took up those claims, and Missouri courts concluded that St. Paul was obligated to pay $5.3 million for the time Ferguson was in prison while it covered the officers. It paid in 2020.",
      "But the payment didn't end the dispute, and in November, a jury concluded that St. Paul had acted in bad faith and engaged in a \u201cvexatious refusal\u201d to pay. Cole County Circuit Judge S. Cotton Walker upheld that finding in his order Monday as he calculated how much money the company would pay \u2014 mostly as punishment \u2014 under a Missouri law capping such punitive damages.",
      "\u201cIt's a way to send a message to insurance companies that if there's coverage, they need to pay,\u201d said Kathleen Zellner, whose firm represents Ferguson.",
      "She added: \u201cYou can\u2019t just pull the rug out from under people when they've paid the premiums.\u201d",
      "The company can appeal the decision. An attorney representing St. Paul did not immediately return a telephone message seeking comment.",
      "Under an agreement between Ferguson and the six officers, they stand to split about $5 million of the $44 million.",
      "The award of nearly $44 million includes $3.2 million to compensate Ferguson and the officers, another $24.2 million in punitive damages, $535,000 million for the \u201cvexatious refusal\u201d allegation and interest on all of the damages totaling about $16 million.",

      "A Connecticut man whose parents were kidnapped after he took part in a $245 million Bitcoin theft has pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges and has agreed to testify against his co-defendants",
      "A Connecticut man whose parents were kidnapped after he took part in a $245 million Bitcoin theft has pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges and has agreed to testify against his co-defendants, according to court documents that were unsealed this week.",
      "Veer Chetal, 19, from Danbury, Connecticut, was one of three men charged with stealing 4,100 Bitcoins from a victim in Washington, D.C., in an elaborate online scam last August. The trio lived large after the heist, spending millions of dollars on cars, jewelry, rental mansions and nightclub parties, prosecutors say.",
      "A week after the theft, Chetal's parents were assaulted and kidnapped briefly in Danbury in a failed ransom plot aimed at Chetal, who the attackers believed had a large amount of cryptocurrency, authorities said.",
      "Chetal's criminal case was unsealed on Monday in federal court in Washington, revealing his guilty pleas in November and his agreement to cooperate with federal authorities investigating the Bitcoin theft. It also revealed new allegations that he was involved in about 50 similar thefts that raked in another $3 million between November 2023 and September 2024.",
      "Another man charged in the Bitcoin theft, Malone Lam, was also among 13 people indicted by a federal grand jury in May in an alleged online racketeering conspiracy involving cryptocurrency thefts across the U.S. and overseas that netted more than $260 million, including the $245 million Bitcoin theft.",
      "Chetal is facing 19 to 24 years in prison, a fine between $50,000 and $500,000 and restitution to the victim that has yet to be determined, according federal sentencing guidelines and his plea agreement.",
      "His lawyer, David Weinstein, declined to comment, saying Chetal's case is still pending.",
      "In September, federal agents with a search warrant raided Chetal's apartment in Brunswick, New Jersey, and his parents' home in Danbury in connection with the $245 million Bitcoin heist. Authorities said they found more than $500,000 in cash, expensive jewelry and watches and high-end clothing. Federal agents also said Chetal had $39 million worth of cryptocurrency that he turned over to investigators.",
      "Authorities alleged Chetal, Lam and Jeandiel Serrano were involved in online \u201csocial engineering\u201d attacks against cryptocurrency holders. Lam would send victims alerts about unauthorized attempts to access their crypto accounts, while the others would call the victims posing as representatives from well-known companies like Google and Yahoo and gain access to their accounts, authorities said.",
      "Messages seeking comment were left with lawyers for Lam and Serrano on Friday.",
      "A week after the theft, six Florida men were accused of kidnapping Chetal's parents in broad daylight in Danbury. One of them crashed a car into the parents' Lamborghini, while others pulled up in a van, police said. The attackers forced the couple out of their vehicle, beat them, put them in the van and tied them up, police said.",
      "The plot was foiled, and the attackers were arrested quickly because there were eyewitnesses who immediately called police, and an off-duty FBI agent happened to be driving by at the time of the kidnapping, authorities said. Federal agents said a seventh man who was later arrested in connection with the kidnapping had previously gotten into a dispute with Chetal that turned physical at a Miami nightclub.",
      "The attack on the couple is part of an increasing trend worldwide in robbers using violence to steal cryptocurrency.",
      "Chetal, who was attending Rutgers University in New Jersey at the time of the $245 million theft and later withdrew, was born in India and came to the U.S. with his family when he was 4 years old in 2010, according to court documents. His father was granted a foreign worker's visa, and his wife and children obtained related dependent visas.",
      "Federal authorities said Chetal could face deportation as a result of the criminal case.",
      "Authorities say Chetal's father lost his job at Morgan Stanley because of the kidnapping and his son's connection to it.",
      "Chetal was initially released from federal custody on his own recognizance. But a judge ordered him detained until trial earlier this year after federal prosecutors said they discovered Chetal was involved in another crypto theft worth $2 million in October that he didn't tell them about, after he had begun cooperating with federal authorities.",

    "story": [
      "North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein has vetoed his first bills",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein vetoed his first bills on Friday, blocking for now Republican legislation that would let adults carry concealed handguns without a permit and make state agencies and local sheriffs more active in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.",
      "Stein, who took office in January, issued his formal objections to three measures backed by the GOP-controlled General Assembly presented to him last week. The former attorney general also had the option to sign any of them into law, or let them become law if he hadn't acted on the legislation soon.",
      "The vetoed measures now return to the legislature, where Republicans are one House seat shy of holding a veto-proof majority. Its leaders will decide whether to attempt overrides as early as next week.",
      "Voting so far followed party lines for one of the immigration measures, which in part would direct heads of several state law enforcement agencies, like the State Highway Patrol and State Bureau of Investigation, to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But one House Democrat ended up voting for the other immigration bill that Stein vetoed. It toughens a 2024 law that required sheriffs to help federal agents seeking criminal defendants.",
      "GOP prospects for enacting the permitless concealed gun measure, a longtime aspiration for gun-rights advocates, appear dimmer, because two House Republicans voted against the bill and 10 others were absent.",
      "In one veto message, Stein said the gun legislation, which would allow eligible people at least 18 years old to carry a concealed handgun, \"makes North Carolinians less safe and undermines responsible gun ownership.\" Democratic lawmakers argued the same during legislative debate.",
      "Current law requires a concealed weapons holder to be at least 21 to obtain a permit. The person must submit an application to the local sheriff, pass a firearms safety training course and cannot \u201csuffer from a physical or mental infirmity that prevents the safe handling of a handgun\" to obtain the permit. No safety training would be required if getting a permit is no longer necessary.",
      "\u201cAuthorizing teenagers to carry a concealed weapon with no training whatsoever is dangerous,\u201d Stein wrote.",
      "Gun-control groups praised the veto.",
      "Conservative advocates for the bill say removing the permit requirement would strengthen the safety of law-abiding citizens.",
      "\u201cLaw-abiding North Carolinians shouldn\u2019t have to jump through hoops to effectively exercise their Second Amendment rights,\" Senate leader Phil Berger said in a press release criticizing the veto and planning for an override vote in his chamber.",
      "Permitless carry is already lawful in 29 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. North Carolina would also be one of the last states in the Southeast to implement that legislation.",
      "One vetoed immigration bill would require four state law enforcement agencies to officially participate in the 287(g) program, which trains officers to interrogate defendants and determine their immigration status. An executive order by President Donald Trump urged his administration to maximize the use of 287(g) agreements.",
      "Stein wrote Friday the bill takes officers away from existing state duties at a time when law enforcement is already stretched thin. The measure also would direct state agencies to ensure noncitizens don\u2019t access certain state-funded benefits. But Stein said that people without lawful immigration status already can't receive them.",
      "The other vetoed bill attempts to expand a 2024 law \u2014 enacted over then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s veto \u2014 that directed jails to hold temporarily certain defendants whom ICE believe are in the country illegally, allowing time for immigration agents to pick them up.",
      "The vetoed bill would expand the list of crimes that a defendant is charged with that would require the jail administrator to attempt to determine the defendant\u2019s legal status. A jail also would have to tell ICE promptly that it is holding someone and essentially extends the time agents have to pick up the person.",
      "Stein said Friday while he supports sheriffs contacting federal immigration agents about defendants charged with dangerous crimes that they are holding, the law is unconstitutional because it directs sheriffs to keep defendants behind bars 48 hours beyond when they otherwise could be released for a suspected immigration violation.",
      "With the veto of this bill, House Speaker Destin Hall said, Stein sided with the \u201cmost radical elements of his party\u2019s base over the safety and security of North Carolinians.\u201d",
      "Latino advocates and other bill opponents had urged Stein to veto both immigration measures. They say the legislation would cause Hispanic residents to feel intimidated and fear law enforcement.",
      "Stein's vetoes help \u201censure North Carolina remains a safe state for everyone, including immigrants, who deserve equal treatment under the law,\" the group El Pueblo said in a news release.",

    "story": [
      "The husband of a Colorado woman whose remains were found after more than three years of searching has been rearrested on suspicion of first-degree murder",
      "DENVER -- The husband of Colorado woman Suzanne Morphew, whose remains were discovered over three years after she was reported missing on Mother's Day 2020, was arrested again Friday on a first-degree murder charge, authorities said.",
      "Barry Morphew was arrested Friday in Arizona after a Colorado grand jury returned an indictment Wednesday, three years after the initial case was dropped because of prosecutorial issues with evidence.",
      "His bond was set at $3 million, cash only, according to court documents. The 12th District Attorney\u2019s office said in a statement that it is seeking to bring him back to Colorado.",
      "District Attorney Anne Kelly declined to elaborate beyond the indictment at a news conference, saying only that her office never gave up on getting justice for Suzanne Morphew.",
      "\u201cWe have worked very hard to move forward in this case,\" Kelly said.",
      "A 2024 autopsy report said Suzanne Morphew died of \u201cunspecified means\u201d but ruled it a homicide. While there was no indication of trauma in her remains, a drug cocktail used to tranquilize wildlife was found in one of her bones, the report said.",
      "A tranquilizer gun and accessories were found in the Morphews\u2019 home, according to investigators.",
      "Barry Morphew has maintained his innocence since his wife disappeared, and his attorney David Beller blasted the new indictment.",
      "\u201cYet again, the government allows their predetermined conclusion to lead their search for evidence,\u201d Beller said in a statement. \u201cBarry maintains his innocence. The case has not changed, and the outcome will not either.\u201d",
      "Morphew was first charged with murder in May 2021, but prosecutors dropped that case the following year just as Morphew was about to stand trial.",
      "A judge barred prosecutors from calling key witnesses for repeatedly failing to follow rules for turning over evidence in Morphew\u2019s favor. That included DNA from an unknown male that was found in Suzanne Morphew\u2019s SUV. At the time, prosecutors said they wanted more time to find her body.",
      "The judge agreed to drop the case against Morphew but allowed prosecutors the option of filing charges against him later.",
      "Barry Morphew filed a $15 million lawsuit against county officials, accusing them of violating his constitutional rights. His lawyers also filed a complaint asking that the prosecutors be disciplined for allegedly intentionally withholding evidence.",
      "Iris Eytan, who was Morphew\u2019s attorney in 2021 but no longer represents him, said prosecutors \u201cfumbled\u201d the case.",
      "\u201cNot only is he is a loving father, but he was a loving husband,\u201d Eytan told The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "The previous district attorney who oversaw Morphew's prosecution, Linda Stanley, was ordered disbarred partially because of her mismanagement of the case. Stanley, then-prosecutor in the 11th District where the Morphews lived, made inappropriate comments about the case to the media, a state regulatory panel concluded.",
      "The mystery surrounding Suzanne Morphew began when the 49-year-old mother of two daughters, who lived near the small town of Salida, was reported missing on Mother's Day 2020.",
      "Suzanne Morphew's mountain bike and helmet were found in separate spots not far from her home, but investigators suspected the bike had been purposefully thrown down into a ravine because there was no indications of a crash. A week after she went missing, Barry Morphew posted a video on Facebook pleading for her safe return.",
      "\u201cNo questions asked, however much they want, I will do whatever it takes to get you back,\u201d he said.",
      "When he was initially charged, the arrest affidavit laying out investigators\u2019 case against Barry Morphew said his wife insisted on leaving him. He later changed his statements as evidence developed.",
      "Morphew, an avid hunter, did not initially tell investigators that he went out of his way as he left for work on Mother\u2019s Day, driving toward the place where his wife\u2019s bicycle helmet was eventually found. Later, he said he went that way because he had seen an elk cross the road, according to the initial arrest affidavit.",
      "Colorado Bureau of Investigation agents stumbled upon Suzanne Morphew's skeletal remains in September 2023 in a shallow grave during an unrelated search near the small southern Colorado town of Moffat, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) south of the Morphews' home.",
      "Most of Suzanne Morphew\u2019s bones were recovered, and many were \u201csignificantly bleached,\u201d according to the affidavit.",
      "Investigators removed a port through which Morphew could receive medicine to treat follicular lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, and found clothing similar to bicyclist clothes she was known to wear. Based on the status of the remains and clothing, a forensic anthropologist theorized that the body decomposed elsewhere, the affidavit says.",
      "Toxicology testing revealed all three drugs in a sedative used for wildlife called \u201cBAM\u201d were in the bones. The presence of a metabolite for one of the drugs, butorphanol, suggested the remains would not have been contaminated with BAM after death, the affidavit says.",
      "The coroner\u2019s office determined the cause of death was \u201chomicide by unspecified means\u201d through intoxication of the three drugs, butorphanol, azaperone and medetomidine.",
      "Barry Morphew obtained and filled several prescriptions for BAM while living in Indiana, shortly before the Morphews moved to Colorado in 2018. Barry Morphew was a deer farmer in Indiana and allegedly told investigators he used BAM to tranquilize deer in Indiana and Colorado, according to the indictment.",
      "In the area surrounding their home in Colorado, no private citizens or businesses, only Colorado Parks and Wildlife and National Park Service officials, had obtained BAM between 2017 and 2020, records show. No government officials reported missing BAM supplies.",
      "\u201cUltimately, the prescription records show that when Suzanne Morphew disappeared, only one private citizen living in that entire area of the state had access to BAM: Barry Morphew,\u201d the indictment concluded.",

    "story": [
      "Tyler Perry has been accused in a civil lawsuit of repeatedly sexually assaulting and harassing an actor on \"The Oval,\" a TV drama that Perry created, according to a new lawsuit. The suit, filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court by the actor Derek Dixon, alleges Perry used his influence in the entertainment industry to prevent Dixon from speaking out until now.",
      "Matthew Boyd, an attorney representing Perry, denied the allegations in a statement obtained by CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "\"This is an individual who got close to Tyler Perry for what now appears to be nothing more than setting up a scam,\" the statement said. \"But Tyler will not be shaken down and we are confident these fabricated claims of harassment will fail.\"",
      "Dixon appeared on 85 episodes of \"The Oval,\" which has had a six-season run on the network BET. The actor's most recent appearances came during the latest season of the series earlier this year, according to IMDB. His lawsuit seeks at least $260 million in damages.",
      "\"Mr. Perry took his success and power and used his considerable influence in the entertainment industry to create a coercive, sexually exploitative dynamic with Mr. Dixon\u2014initially promising him career advancement and creative opportunities, such as producing his pilot and casting him in his show, only to subject him to escalating sexual harassment, assault and battery, and professional retaliation when Mr. Dixon did not reciprocate Mr. Perry's unwanted advances,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "It alleges the behavior happened during Dixon's time as a series regular on \"The Oval,\" when Perry \"held direct control over his employment, compensation, and creative opportunities.\"",
      "The lawsuit, first reported Tuesday by TMZ, says that Perry first noticed Dixon in 2019 when Dixon was part of the event staff at a Perry party, and later offered an audition.",
      "Dixon would first appear in a small role on the Perry series \"Ruthless\" before getting the bigger role on the political drama \"The Oval.\"",
      "Perry soon began sending unwanted sexual text messages to Dixon, according to the lawsuit, which includes alleged screenshots of several of them.",
      "\"What's it going to take for you to have guiltless sex?\" one of the messages says.",
      "The lawsuit claims Perry offered Dixon an increasingly prominent role on the show as his sexual advances became more aggressive.",
      "In the lawsuit, the actor says he tried to remain friendly while maintaining boundaries.",
      "\"Dixon did his best to tiptoe around Mr. Perry's sexual aggression while keeping on Mr. Perry's good side,\" the lawsuit says. \"Mr. Perry made it clear to Dixon that if Dixon ignored Perry or failed to engage with the sexual innuendoes, Dixon's character would 'die.'\"",
      "The lawsuit alleges Perry eventually sexually assaulted Dixon on \"multiple occasions,\" including an instance where he \"forcibly pulled off Mr. Dixon's clothing, groped his buttocks, and attempted to force himself on Dixon.\"",
      "Dixon clearly told Perry \"No,\" but was initially ignored until he was able to de-escalate the situation and change the subject, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The following day, the suit claims, Perry apologized, and told Dixon he would work with Dixon on a TV pilot Dixon was seeking to produce.",
      "Dixon says he later received a raise that the lawsuit suggests was part of an attempt to keep him quiet.",
      "He said the fear of his character dying kept him quiet as intended.",
      "Perry also produced and bought the rights to the pilot, called \"Losing It,\" but the lawsuit alleges Perry had no intention of selling the show and was using it only for leverage over Dixon.",
      "The lawsuit describes several other alleged assaults. In one of those alleged instances, the suit claims Perry climbed into bed with Dixon, uninvited, and groped him while Dixon was staying in a guest room at Perry's house.",
      "It also alleges that Dixon eventually moved from Atlanta, home to Perry's production studio, to Los Angeles to put distance between the two of them, but \"Mr. Perry continued to sexually harass Mr. Dixon.\"",
      "Dixon in 2024 filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, according to the lawsuit. The suit alleges that Dixon quit the show when its producer's did not take action to investigate his accusations, even after he had filed that complaint with the EEOC.",
      "CBS News and The Associated Press do not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Dixon has.",
      "\"The Oval\" is one of many television series executive produced by, written by and directed by the 55-year-old Perry, who first became known as creator and star of the \"Madea\" films and has since built a major production empire in TV and movies. As an actor he has also appeared in the films \"Gone Girl\" and \"Don't Look Up.\"",

    "summary": "The Cuban-born entertainer broke conventions when he co-starred with wife Lucille Ball in \"I Love Lucy,\" playing a straight-man sitcom dad. Now, a new biography reveals his lesser-known contributions to television.",
    "story": [
      "In the fall of 1951, television audiences were introduced to a show biz-obsessed redhead and her bandleader husband, played by the real-life couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. While Lucy was undeniably the star on-camera, off-camera it was Desi, a refugee from Cuba with no connection to the world of entertainment, who would change the way television worked.",
      "The most significant thing about Arnaz that people don't know, according to biographer Todd Purdum, is that he and his colleagues made the decision to film \"I Love Lucy\" on 35mm black-and-white film, \"making possible its preservation, and essentially the invention of the rerun, and then syndication sales, and the whole modern way that television economics work.\"",
      "One of the most striking revelations in Purdum's book, \"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television,\" is why the show was even created. \"It was partly created to save their marriage,\" he said. \"Desi was on the road, which enabled him to philander, and that bothered Lucy a great deal. She'd kind of reached the limits of her career in movies, and she'd gotten a radio show called 'My Favorite Husband,' in which she played a kind of a zany housewife, married to the fifth vice president of a bank. And CBS then said, 'We'd like this show to make the transition to television.' And Lucy said, 'Well, I only want to do a television show if Desi can be in it with me and play my husband.'\"",
      "CBS and sponsors were worried that audiences wouldn't accept them as a couple. (Never mind they'd been married for ten years.) Desi and Lucy also wanted to shoot the show in Los Angeles, where they'd laid down roots. Back then, New York City was the hub of television production.",
      "\"Everything was about the family,\" said daughter Lucie Arnaz, who was born just six weeks before her parents shot the first episode of \"I Love Lucy.\" \"It was always about, 'No, no, no. We have a plan. We wanna be together. We wanna be in California.' Which is crazy when you're nobody. He wasn't a big star. She was a decent star, you know, B pictures. And that they would put their foot down like that and say, 'Well, no, we don't wanna do that'? It's crazy!\"",
      "But Desi and Lucy were willing to gamble. CBS agreed to their terms only after the stars agreed to a pay cut. But in return, Arnaz demanded that the couple own the rights to the show. The gamble paid off: with the very first episode, America fell in love with Lucy and Desi.",
      "Lucy was 39. The man born Desiderio Arnaz was 33, and a world away from his upbringing as an only child to a prominent family in Santiago, Cuba. His father had been mayor of the city; his mother, the daughter of a cofounder of Bacardi Rum. During the Cuban Revolution of 1933, the family lost everything. Teenaged Desi and his father fled to Miami, and lived in a rat-infested warehouse.",
      "He referred to himself as a refugee, not an immigrant. \"He was dislocated; he was not a voluntary arrival on our shores,\" said Purdum. \"He came here as a result of tragedy, really. And I think he never got over that.\"",
      "But he could play the guitar. Hired by bandleader Xavier Cugat, Desi introduced nightclub audiences to the Afro-Cuban conga, and what became his signature song, \"Babalu.\"",
      "In 1940, Arnaz jumped to the big screen in \"Too Many Girls,\" where he met his match in co-star Lucille Ball. The two married six months later.",
      "\"I Love Lucy\" would make the couple very rich. It was Desi's idea to buy RKO Studios, which he and Lucy renamed Desilu, which became a television producing juggernaut, with more sound stages than MGM, 20th Century Fox or Warner Brothers. \"That was their peak,\" said Purdum. \"And then, it went downhill from there because of Desi's drinking, really.\"",
      "But drinking wasn't his only addiction. \"People say he had affairs,\" said Lucie. \"He never had an affair. He didn't even know these dames' names, you know? They were hookers.",
      "\"He loved my mother. He loved his family. It was a very unique, weird problem to have, and I think that's the reason she stayed with him so long, is that she understood it. I don't think I could do what she did. But somehow at the time, with what they had, with what they needed from each other, they stuck it out as long as they could.\"",
      "In 1960, when Lucie Arnaz was eight and her brother, Desi Jr., was seven, America's most famous couple announced the end of their show \u2013 and their marriage.",
      "\"We were at their house in Palm Springs,\" Lucie recalled. \"And they said that, 'We love each other, but the being-husband-and-wife part is broken. And we can't live together anymore.' And I remember that my brother said, 'But if it's broken, can't you just fix it? Can't you put stuff on it and fix it?' And they said, 'I don't think so.'",
      "\"The truth of it is, Mo, they were happier after they got divorced. The screaming and the arguing and all that stuff stopped,\" Lucie said.",
      "I asked, \"And when you were told, did you sort of instinctively become protective of your little brother?\"",
      "\"I wish you'd been my therapist growing up, Mo!\" Lucie laughed. \"I think mostly I sort of was very protective of my dad, believe it or not. I felt really sorry for my dad.\"",
      "Why? \"I don't know. I think because I felt like he was the one that got ousted. We were still in the house. And I felt like he got a lotta the blame. Even though I was too young to understand what it was all about, I knew that he had problems. I knew that he would, you know, drink sometimes. But that really became worse when I was older, when I was, like, a teenager. But I just felt bad for him.\"",
      "Both Ball and Arnaz remarried, he to family friend Edith Hirsch. Lucy went on to star in several TV shows. Desi produced the series \"The Mothers-in-Law,\" wrote an autobiography, and eventually got sober with the help of his son, himself a recovered drug abuser.",
      "\"It was fantastic,\" said Lucie. \"It, like, my greatest memory of him to this day, to have him, the guy who said, 'I don't air my dirty laundry in front of other people,' and then when he finally made his decision after his wife, Edie, darling, wonderful Edie died, he said, 'I can't do this anymore.' And he got up and said, 'My name is Desi and I'm an alcoholic.' And that's my proudest moment, that he stood up next to me and I watched him do that, to take responsibility and to try to solve it.\"",
      "Less than a year later, Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer. \"My mother came down to visit my dad in Del Mar when he was sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I ran and got as many VHS tapes as I could find, and they did sit there for a couple hours and look at old 'I Love Lucy' shows and laugh and remember.\"",
      "On November 30, 1986, what would've been their wedding anniversary, Desi and Lucy spoke for a final time.",
      "\"He was very, very sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I said, 'I'm gonna put him on the phone now, so say what you wanna say.' And I just held the phone to his ear. And all I could hear her saying was, 'I love you,' like, five times in a row. And he listened and he said, 'I love you too, honey.' And then he said, 'Good luck with your shows.'\"",
      "Two days later, Desi Arnaz died at 69.",
      "We end with the man himself, during a 1954 tribute hosted by Ed Sullivan, reflecting on his extraordinary journey: \"We came to this country and we didn't have a cent in our pockets. From cleaning canary cages to this night here in New York, it's a long ways. And I don't think there's any other country in the world that would give you that opportunity. I want to say, 'Thank you, thank you, America.'\"",

      "Prologue",
      "He was adored as the man who loved Lucy, the combustible Cuban bandleader whose spluttering Spanish and long-suffering straight man's frustration at the comic antics of his crazy wife softened into a loving embrace at the end of each episode. But Desi Arnaz was so much more than Ricky Ricardo. If Ball's brilliant clowning\u2014her beauty, her mimicry, her flexible face and fearless skill at physical comedy\u2014was the artistic spark that animated I Love Lucy, Arnaz's pioneering show-business acumen was the essential driving force be- hind it. He was, as NPR's Planet Money once put it, the man who \"invented television.\"",
      "\"There's a misconception that we\u2014that Desi wasn't all that important to the show,\" Madelyn Pugh Davis, the founding cowriter of I Love Lucy, would recall years after his death. \"And Desi was what made the show go. And he also knew that she was the tremendous talent. He knew that. But he was the driving force, and he was the one who held it together. People don't seem to realize that.\"",
      "Today, nearly four decades after his death, Arnaz the performer remains a widely recognizable figure\u2014\"one of the great personalities of all time,\" as his friend the dancer Ann Miller once put it. Much less well understood is the seminal role he played in the nascent years of television, helping to transform its production methods, and transforming himself, a successful but second-tier Latin bandleader, and his wife, a journeyman actress in mostly forgettable B movies, into cultural icons.",
      "It was Arnaz (and I Love Lucy's head writer and producer, Jess Oppenheimer) who assembled the world-class team of Hollywood technicians who figured out how to light and film the show in front of a live studio audience, with three cameras in sync at once\u2014a then-pathbreaking method that soon became an industry standard for situation comedies that endures to this day. It was his ability to preserve those episodes on crystalline black-and-white 35-millimeter film stock that led to the invention of the rerun and later to the syndication of long-running series to secondary markets. This innovation also made it possible for the center of network television production to move from New York to Los Angeles and created the business model that lasted unchallenged for the better part of seven decades, until the streaming era established a competing paradigm.",
      "\"I Love Lucy was a crucial part of entertainment in this country,\" said Norman Lear, the creator of the landmark situation comedy All in the Family and many other shows. \"Lucy and Desi\u2014I think it can be said they pretty much opened the door of Hollywood to America, and to the situation comedy. There was only one Lucy and one Desi, and between them, they knew what it took. He was a great businessman in the persona of a wonderful entertainer.\"",

      "Duke University Hospital, where Kelly was taken, deferred comment to the Bureau of Prisons.",

      "Kelly was moved to solitary confinement earlier in June, according to the motion filed Monday. He had his medication for anxiety and to help him sleep with him and had shown that to prison staff, Brindley said.",
      "But, on Thursday evening, prison personnel \"provided him with additional medication and instructions to take it,\" Brindley alleges. Kelly took the medication and the next morning he felt faint and dizzy.",
      "\"He started to see black spots in his vision. Mr. Kelly tried to get up, but fell to the ground. He crawled to the door of the cell and lost consciousness,\" according to Brindley's motion.",
      "Kelly was taken to a hospital where he was told he was given an overdose quantity of his medications, Brindley said.",
      "Additionally, at the hospital, Kelly showed doctors his swollen leg, which Brindley said he had been seeking medical attention for because he has a history of blood clots. Prison medical staff had allegedly taken him off blood thinners.",
      "A scan at the hospital \"revealed blood clots in his right leg, blood clots in his left leg, and blood clots in his lungs,\" Brindley said.",
      "Kelly was told he would need to stay at the hospital for seven days and was scheduled for a surgery for the clots, according to the motion. However, officers then came into his hospital room and removed Mr. Kelly.",
      "\"He was taken from the hospital against his will and against the directives of the doctors,\" Brindley said. \"Mr. Kelly's life is in jeopardy right now because the Bureau of Prisons denied him necessary surgery to clear clots from his lungs. He could die from this condition, and they are letting it happen.\"",

      "Inside the stone walls of Ardross Castle, reality television contestants are plotting betrayals, forming alliances and committing metaphorical murder, all while host Alan Cumming orchestrates the chaos in increasingly outrageous outfits.",
      "The Scottish castle serves as the backdrop for Peacock's hit reality series \"The Traitors,\" which is currently filming its fourth season with a star-studded cast that includes Olympic figure skating icons Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir,\u00a0NFL mom Donna Kelce,\u00a0and favorites from\u00a0\"Big Brother,\"\u00a0\"Survivor\"\u00a0and \"The Real Housewives\" franchise.",

      "The production team uses the entire castle estate for elaborate missions designed to test contestants and provide opportunities to win money and immunity.",
      "\"I think the way we do deceit is popular,\" said Ben Archard, the show's director. \"It's just like a safe space. Right? It's a safe space for murdering. It's a safe space for deceit.\"",

      "Dr. Salvador Plasencia agreed to plead guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine, according to the signed document filed in federal court in Los Angeles. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors agreed to drop three additional counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of falsifying records.",
      "Federal prosecutors said in a statement that the plea carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. They said Plasencia is expected to formally plead guilty in the coming weeks.",
      "According to a co-defendant, Plasencia in a text message called the actor a \"moron\" who could be exploited for money.",
      "The physician had been one of the primary targets of the prosecution, along with a woman accused of being a ketamine dealer. Three other defendants, including another doctor, agreed to plead guilty last year in exchange for their cooperation.",
      "Plasencia and the woman, Jasveen Sangha, had been scheduled to face trial in August. An email to his attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "Perry, 54, was found unresponsive and floating face-down in his jacuzzi on\u00a0Oct. 28, 2023, according to\u00a0an autopsy report\u00a0from the Los Angeles County medical examiner. His cause of death was \"the acute effects of ketamine,\" with contributing factors including drowning, coronary artery disease, and the effects of buprenorphine, a medication used to treat opioid addiction.",
      "Ketamine is a Schedule III hallucinogen. It is a controlled substance with legitimate uses, but it is also used illegally, U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California Martin Estrada told reporters during a news conference last year, CBS News Los Angeles reported.",
      "\"It can cause serious health effects, serious health problems including loss of consciousness, including spikes in blood pressure and respiratory issues that can deprive the brain of oxygen,\" Estrada said. \"For that reason, it is a drug that must be administered by medical professionals and the patient must be monitored closely.\"",
      "\"That did not occur here,\" he said.",
      "Perry had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal but off-label treatment for depression, which has become increasingly common. He began seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him.",
      "Plasencia admitted in his plea agreement that another patient connected him with Perry, and that starting about a month before Perry's death, he illegally supplied the actor with 20 vials of ketamine totaling 100 mg of the drug, along with ketamine lozenges and syringes.",
      "He admitted to enlisting the other doctor, Mark Chavez, to supply the drug for him, according to the court filings.",
      "\"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Plasencia texted Chavez, according to Chavez's plea agreement. The two met up the same day in Costa Mesa, halfway between the Los Angeles area where Plasencia practiced and San Diego, where Chavez practiced, and exchanged several vials of ketamine, the filings said.",
      "After selling the drugs to Perry for $4,500, Plasencia allegedly asked Chavez if he could keep supplying them so they could become Perry's \"go-to,\" prosecutors said.",
      "Plasencia admitted to visiting Perry's house twice and injecting him with ketamine. He also left ketamine behind and showed Perry's personal assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, how to inject it, according to Iwamasa's plea agreement. The doctor later met up with Iwamasa and gave him more ketamine for Perry, according to the document.",
      "Perry was also getting ketamine from another source, Sangha, who prosecutors allege was a major dealer and supplied the dose that killed the actor.",
      "Sangha has pleaded not guilty \u2014 making her the only one of the five people charged in Perry's death who has not entered a plea agreement. She remains jailed as she awaits trial. Plasencia was freed on bond after his initial court appearances.",
      "Erik Fleming, a friend of Perry who said he acted as a middleman and drug messenger, has also pleaded guilty and has been cooperating with prosecutors.",
      "None of the defendants have yet been sentenced. Plasencia's plea deal makes no specific sentencing guarantees.",
      "Perry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time on \"Friends,\" when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC's megahit.",

    "story": [
      "At least 3% of measles cases confirmed so far this year have been in people who received two doses of the measles vaccine, meaning they were fully vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.",
      "About three dozen of the nearly 1,200 measles infections in 2025 have been in people with two vaccine doses, the agency said Friday in its weekly update on cases. An additional 2% of cases were in people who received at least one dose of the measles vaccine.",
      "Many of the cases were in Texas, which on Tuesday\u00a0counted\u00a0a 21st confirmed measles case in someone with at least two doses of the vaccine.",
      "Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said Monday that their first 20 cases were in children 8 years old or younger. Anton did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the additional case, which was reported on Tuesday.",
      "A CDC spokesperson said in an email their data reflects vaccination status at the time someone was exposed to the virus. This means none of the 36 vaccinated cases they confirmed Friday received their second dose as a result of post-exposure prophylaxis. Post-exposure prophylaxis is offering someone a drug or vaccine after they are exposed to a germ, to reduce the chance they will be infected or develop severe disease.",
      "The CDC says people exposed to measles can get vaccinated within 72 hours of when they were first exposed, if they are not fully immunized. \"If administered within 72 hours of initial measles exposure, MMR vaccine might provide some protection against infection or modify the clinical course of disease,\" the agency's recommendations say.",
      "The CDC spokesperson said, \"The MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles and its complications.\"",
      "\"Disease symptoms are generally milder in vaccinated people,\" the spokesperson said. \"People who are vaccinated are also less likely to spread the disease to other people.\"",
      "\"The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,\" the spokesperson said. \"People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.\"",

      "\"Additional cases have been seeded from the outbreak in Texas, as well as related outbreaks in Mexico and Canada. Additionally, measles importation from international travel continues, especially as the busy summer of travel season ramps up,\" Brian Wakeman, deputy lead of the CDC's measles laboratory task force, said Monday.",
      "Wakeman, who spoke on a nationwide call for testing laboratories, said the U.S. is now on pace to top the 1,274 cases of measles seen in 2019. That was the most cases the U.S. has seen in a single year since endemic spread of the virus was declared \"eliminated\" at the end of the 20th century.",
      "\"We're also on pace to be the greatest number of measles cases since the early 90s,\" Wakeman said.",
      "None of the confirmed measles cases that led to hospitalizations this year had documented evidence of receiving two doses of vaccine, the CDC spokesperson said. More than 8 in 10 of the cases have been in people 20 years old or older.",
      "Six cases of measles in people who received at least two doses of the vaccine were in Colorado, that state's health department says.",
      "\"None of the six cases with 2+ doses were seniors or required hospitalization,\" Hope Shuler, a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said in an email.",
      "Health authorities and experts have called for some seniors to check if they need a measles booster, especially if they are planning to travel, because of the kind of measles vaccines that were used before 1968.",

    "summary": "The GOP's \"big beautiful bill\" would require people up to age 64 to certify they're working to get aid. Here's what the research shows.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican's\u00a0\"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0would add new work requirements for millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid and food stamps. Tying federal aid in exchange for work is \"common sense,\" according to House Speaker Mike Johnson, who\u00a0said\u00a0it would encourage people to get jobs.",
      "While the food stamp program already has a work requirement, the GOP bill tightens the regulation for beneficiaries, requiring those who are so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, to prove they're working up to age 64, up from the current threshold of 54 years old.",
      "Taken together, the new requirements would add reporting requirements for millions of low-income Americans, who would need to prove they're working or else volunteering or enrolled in an educational program to qualify for health care or food assistance. Republican lawmakers say it makes sense to tack on these restrictions to ensure that people aren't \"gaming the system,\" in Johnson's words, while also encouraging them to seek employment.",
      "There are millions of people on Medicaid \"right now nationwide who are able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system,\" Johnson told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on May 25.",
      "\"The One, Big, Beautiful Bill's work requirements \u2014 which include activities such as volunteering, job training, or looking for a job \u2014 are commonsense reforms that are overwhelmingly popular among the American people,\" a White House official told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These reforms will not only address waste, fraud and abuse, but protect and preserve Medicaid for the Americans whom the program was intended to serve as a lifeline for: seniors, disabled individuals, and low income families.\"",
      "About two-thirds of Americans back work requirements for SNAP and Medicaid, according to a 2023 Axios poll.",
      "Growing body of research",
      "Work requirements were first\u00a0introduced\u00a0into the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \u2014 the formal name for the food-stamp program \u2014 under President Bill Clinton. And two states, Arkansas and Georgia, have in recent years introduced work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped its plan after a judge blocked it in 2019.",
      "That's allowed economists and policy experts to study work requirements and how they have impacted people who rely on food assistance and public health insurance. So far, there's little evidence to show work requirements boost employment among the low-income Americans who rely on the programs.",
      "Instead, some recipients end up losing their benefits after work requirements are introduced due to administrative hurdles of proving employment, failure to find enough work to qualify, or other issues like disability or illness, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Take a 2019 research paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which examined what happened when Virginia reinstated work requirements for some food stamp recipients in 2013. The researchers found that after work requirements went into effect, SNAP enrollment of people who were subject to the regulation dropped by about 50%.",
      "\"But it did not lead to any meaningful increase in employment or earnings on average,\" Adam Leive, an assistant professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at University of California, Berkeley, and a coauthor of the paper, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And so, what we instead found was that work requirements largely functioned as a way to remove people from the program, but without improving their employment prospects.\"",
      "He added, \"Our results probably provide some evidence as to what would be expected in Medicaid.\"",
      "The GOP budget measure passed in the House in May with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee unveiled its portion of the bill. While it changes some of the House version's provisions, it continues to include the Medicaid work requirement for adults between 19 to 64 who aren't disabled and don't have children.",
      "The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry's portion of the bill, also released Tuesday, maintains the House version's higher age threshold for the food stamp program.",
      "Medicaid and work",
      "About 18.5 million Medicaid recipients, or roughly 1 in 4 enrollees, would be subject to the new work requirement if the GOP package becomes law, according to a June 4 analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Of those, roughly 4.8 million people are likely to lose health insurance due to the new policy, it projected.",
      "\"Research and real-world experience both show that work requirements don't help people find or maintain work,\" wrote Allie Gardner, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy think tank, in a June 12 research report.",
      "The new Medicaid work requirements would be particularly stringent, she added. First, the provision would deny coverage to applicants who can't show they're already working, volunteering or enrolled in an educational program for 80 hours a month before they are enrolled.",
      "States, which administer Medicaid to their residents, would be permitted to block enrollment to people who can't show they have already had months of work under their belt, she added. States could also require people to verify their employment as frequently as once per month, and require up to six months of consecutive work to keep their Medicaid enrollment, she said.",
      "The two states that have sought to introduce work requirements for Medicaid enrollees have had mixed results. In Arkansas, about 18,000 adults\u00a0lost coverage\u00a0in the first four months after the policy went into effect, out of the state's roughly 800,000 enrollees. More than half of those reported they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 said they delayed taking medications because of cost, according to a 2020 analysis by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The requirements didn't boost employment, the researchers also found.",
      "Burdensome requirements",
      "Georgia is the only state with a current work requirement for Medicaid, offering a program targeted to certain low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify. Like the GOP budget bill's provision, Georgia requires beneficiaries to perform 80 hours a month of work or other activities, such as volunteering or schooling.",
      "But that program has cost the state $86 million while enrolling 6,500 people in its first 18 months, far short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative burdens of verifying employment as well as technical glitches, Pro Publica has reported.",
      "One enrollee, BeShea Terry, 51, told the Associated Press that maintaining her standing in the program has been difficult, including encountering numerous erroneous messages that she hadn't uploaded proof of her work hours. When her coverage was mistakenly canceled in December, it took months of calls to a caseworker and visits to a state office to resolve, she said.",
      "\"It's a process,\" she said. \"Keep continuing to call because your health is very important.\"",
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's administration has defended the program as a way to transition people to private health care. At least 1,000 people have left the program and obtained private insurance because their income increased, according to the governor's office.",
      "Older Americans at risk",
      "Some policy experts are particularly concerned about the bill that would require people up to age 64 to prove they're working in exchange for food aid or health insurance because older Americans can face greater employment struggles due to ageism, health issues or needing to care for an ill spouse or relative.",
      "The SNAP program's current work requirement only applies to people up to age 54.",
      "If the bill's higher age threshold is enacted, about 1 million Americans between 55 to 64 would be at risk of losing food stamps, according to the CBPP.",
      "\"It's so much harder at that age to find a job, based on age discrimination, outdated skills and you may have health issues that don't rise up to a full disability,\" Salaam Bhatti, director of the SNAP program at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"What it ultimately does is just remove them from the program that's helping them put food on the table.\"",
      "Some advocacy groups for older Americans are urging lawmakers to rethink hiking SNAP's work requirement to age 64, as well as adding the employment requirement for Medicaid.",
      "\"We oppose efforts to add new burdens that could cost people their health care coverage not because they are ineligible, but because they missed a deadline or could not navigate a complex system,\" wrote AARP President Nancy LeaMond in a May 21 letter\u00a0to Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.",
      "The higher age limit for SNAP's work requirements \"is especially harmful to older adults who often face age discrimination, longer unemployment, chronic health conditions and caregiving responsibilities that limit their ability to stay in the workforce,\" she added.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge struck down sweeping Trump administration orders that resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of National Institutes of Health research grants because they were linked to topics like diversity, gender identity and vaccine hesitancy.",
      "\"The ideologically motivated directives to terminate grants alleged to constitute DEI, 'gender ideology,' or other forbidden topics were, in fact, arbitrary and capricious, and have now been ruled unlawful,\" Dr. Peter Lurie, head of the Center for Science in the Public Interest said in a statement Tuesday. Lurie's group was among those that filed the lawsuit.",
      "Judge William Young of the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts capped a trial Monday for multiple lawsuits that were filed against the Trump administration: one by a coalition of public health groups and another by several Democratic state attorneys general.",
      "It is possible that the Trump administration could seek to block the ruling by Young, who was nominated to the court by President Reagan in 1985.",
      "\"HHS is exploring all legal options, including filing an appeal and moving to stay the order,\" Andrew Nixon, communications director for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement.",
      "Nixon said the department \"stands by its decision to end funding for research that prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigor and meaningful outcomes for the American people,\" saying the department wanted taxpayer dollars to support \"gold standard science\" and not \"divisive DEI mandates or gender ideology.\"",
      "The court has not yet published Young's order in the case, but notes from the clerk announced that the challenged directives have been vacated and that the Trump administration was ordered to \"promptly comply.\"",
      "Separate court cases are underway for other cuts to medical research funding sought by the Trump administration, like the terminations of funding to universities like Harvard and Columbia that have disrupted studies for cancer and diseases.",
      "Another federal judge in Massachusetts earlier this year blocked the NIH from implementing a policy change that would have cut funding for research overhead costs, which is now being appealed by the Trump administration.",
      "\"Today's court ruling halted the cancellation of millions of dollars that have already been awarded to address important public health needs and will allow funding for life-saving medical research to continue,\" the Massachusetts attorney general's office said Monday in a statement.",
      "They said that the judge had \"denounced these actions\" at the trial, saying he had \"never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable\" and would \"be blind not to call it out.\"",
      "Young's ruling came after opponents challenged the process used by the Trump administration to come up with and implement its steep cuts to grants, saying the law requires federal agencies changing their policies to \"supply a reasoned analysis for the change.\"",
      "Flaws cited by a trial brief brought by the groups included the lack of a definition for what qualified as banned \"DEI studies\" and NIH Acting Director Dr. Matthew Memoli having spent only minutes deciding which grants and funding opportunities to cut.",
      "\"Defendants do not explain how lightning speed implementation of the Directives could possibly reflect reasoned decisionmaking,\" they wrote.",

    "summary": "Dr. Fiona Havers' resignation follows RFK Jr.'s orders to change the CDC's vaccine recommendations.",
    "story": [
      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official who led the agency's network to study hospitalization trends from infectious diseases like COVID-19 has resigned in protest following Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s orders to change the agency's vaccine recommendations and the committee that makes them.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers' last day at the CDC was Monday, according to an announcement sent by an agency official to her branch within the agency's Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division. They received the notice shortly after Reuters first reported on the resignation.",
      "\"I no longer have confidence that these data will be used objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence-based vaccine policy decisions,\" Havers wrote in an email sent to colleagues before the announcement.",
      "An infectious disease researcher who has worked with Havers, and received her email voicing concerns with how the data would be used, described the resignation as the latest in the \"dismantling\" of the agency's expertise.",
      "\"It's a big loss to the CDC,\" the researcher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News.",
      "CBS News sent a request for comment to the CDC about the concerns that Havers expressed, but did not hear back from the agency's spokesperson. Instead, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services responded.",
      "\"Under Secretary Kennedy's leadership, HHS is committed to following the gold standard of scientific integrity. Vaccine policy decisions will be based on objective data, transparent analysis, and evidence \u2013 not conflicts of interest or industry influence,\" Emily Hilliard, the department spokesperson, said in an email.",
      "Havers had led the CDC's Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network, or RESP-NET, that collects and studies trends in hospitalizations from COVID-19, RSV and influenza. Her presentations of RESP-NET's findings have figured prominently into past meetings of the agency's Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices as they weighed updates to the CDC's vaccine recommendations.",
      "\"Of all the work we have accomplished, I am most proud of how COVID-NET and RSV-NET hospitalization data, presented at nearly every public ACIP meeting since 2020, have been critical drivers of COVID-19 and RSV vaccine policy in recent years,\" Havers wrote in her email.",
      "The CDC's vaccine recommendations are closely watched by doctors and health authorities because they are tied to federal policies enabling access to vaccines, including liability protections and requirements for insurance coverage.",
      "Usually, the ACIP deliberates and votes on updated recommendations, which are later adopted by the CDC director. In an unprecedented move this year, Kennedy bypassed the process to order his own changes.",
      "In late May, Kennedy first ordered narrowing the guidance to exclude children and pregnant women without other underlying health conditions, sidestepping an ACIP process that had been already underway to discuss changing the recommendations.",
      "He then fired the current roster of ACIP members in June \u2014 in what he described as a \"clean sweep\" of the panel \u2014 as well as removed the agency officials who oversee the panel's vetting and agenda.",
      "In a viewpoint published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the 17 members of the panel fired by Kennedy denounced the health secretary for \"dismantling the process by which vaccines have been recommended.\"",
      "\"As former ACIP members, we are deeply concerned that these destabilizing decisions, made without clear rationale, may roll back the achievements of US immunization policy, impact people's access to lifesaving vaccines, and ultimately put US families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses,\" they wrote.",
      "Kennedy later replaced the panel with a list of picks that included several allies of the health secretary and opponents of recommendations for COVID-19 and some other vaccines.",
      "The committee's new membership is set to meet next week to vote on updated vaccine recommendations for COVID-19 and RSV, among other diseases.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Jun 2025 21:31:33 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump entertained the idea of firing Jerome Powell on Friday, a legally untested and contentious move.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump suggested Friday he may try to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling the central bank leader a \"Total and Complete Moron\" for leaving interest rates steady.",
      "The president has been lashing out against Powell for months, criticizing the central banker \u2014 whom Mr. Trump appointed in his first term \u2014 for not lowering interest rates at a faster pace. It's unclear whether the president is legally allowed to fire Powell before his term ends in May 2026, and Mr. Trump said in April he has \"no intention\" of doing so.",
      "But in a post criticizing Powell on Friday, Mr. Trump floated the idea, writing: \"Maybe, just maybe, I'll have to change my mind about firing him?\"",
      "\"But regardless, his Term ends shortly!\" the president added.",
      "Any attempt to fire Powell would be legally contentious. Federal law and prior court precedent says members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, including the chair, can only be fired \"for cause.\" The Supreme Court ruled last month that the Trump administration can fire members of other independent federal agencies \u2014 but specifically exempted the Fed, calling the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\"",
      "Powell said last year he will not resign if Mr. Trump asks him to step down. The two met at the White House last month.",
      "Mr. Trump also called Powell a \"dumb guy\" in his Friday evening post.",
      "\"I fully understand that my strong criticism of him makes it more difficult for him to do what he should be doing, lowering Rates, but I've tried it all different ways,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"I've been nice, I've been neutral, and I've been nasty, and nice and neutral didn't work! He's a dumb guy, and an obvious Trump Hater, who should have never been there.\"",
      "The Fed declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "Why has Trump criticized Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump's issues with Powell hinge on the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies. The central bank's interest rate-setting committee, which is chaired by Powell, has kept its benchmark rate steady so far this year, after lowering it slightly from a two-decade high last year \u2014 following a series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 to quell inflation.",
      "Most recently, the committee opted against lowering rates earlier this week, drawing backlash from Mr. Trump.",
      "The decision comes with tradeoffs. High interest rates can slow down economic growth and make it more expensive for Americans to borrow money, which is why Mr. Trump wants cuts. But lowering interest rates too quickly could overheat the economy and cause inflation to spike yet again. While inflation has cooled off in recent years, it's still higher than the Fed's 2% annual target, and the Fed warns Mr. Trump's tariffs could push prices up.",
      "\"Because the economy is still solid, we can take the time to actually see what's going to happen,\" Powell said earlier this week.",
      "Mr. Trump disagrees, nicknaming Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" and arguing that inflation is already low.",
      "On Friday, the president amped up his criticism, calling Powell a \"numbskull\" and suggesting the other members of the rate-setting Federal Open Monetary Committee \"override\" him. Mr. Trump also said Powell should lower interest rates immediately and just hike them again if inflation spikes \u2014 an idea that's at odds with the Fed's cautious strategy.",
      "\"Don't say that you think there will be Inflation sometime in the future, because there isn't now but, if there is, raise the Rates!\" wrote Mr. Trump.",
      "The attacks are a redux of Mr. Trump's first-term criticism. The president pushed back against Powell after the Fed hiked interest rates in 2018, but called Powell his \"most improved player\" for slashing rates during the 2020 pandemic.",

    "summary": "Tesla is giving a select group of people the chance to try out its robotaxis this weekend in Austin, Texas.",
    "story": [
      "After years of teasing a new line of self-driving vehicles, billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk is finally making good on his promise with the rollout of Tesla's robotaxi service.",
      "When is the robotaxi event?",
      "This Sunday, June 22, Tesla will give a select group of people the chance to ride in its Model Y Robotaxis \u00a0in Austin, Texas, where the EV maker moved its headquarters from California in 2021.",
      "Tesla did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's email seeking information about the launch. However, details shared on social media and past comments from Musk offer some clues as to what it will look like.",
      "Where will the robotaxi event take place?",
      "The pilot will likely involve a small number of cars and rides will take place in a \"geofenced area\" in Austin. In a CNBC interview in\u00a0May, Musk suggested there could be around 10 robotaxis in circulation during the pilot in Austin, and said Tesla would scale up the number from there.",
      "According to a note from Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives, there could be up to 20 Model Y cars circling around Austin on Sunday.",
      "It's unclear how many people were invited to participate in the pilot, although it appears \"Early Access\" invites went primarily to Tesla investors and enthusiasts. In a copy of the\u00a0invitation\u00a0shared on social media, it says these riders will be \"among the first to use our new Robotaxi App\" and that they will be able to provide \"valuable feedback.\"",
      "Those invited to Austin's pilot can hail the self-driving cars via the Robotaxi App and go anywhere except the airport from 6 a.m. to midnight on Sunday, the invitation says.",
      "What has Elon Musk said about robotaxis?",
      "Musk previewed the launch in January during an earnings call, saying the cars will be \"in the wild with no one in them, in June in Austin.\" A\u00a0video posted by the company that same month offers a glimpse of the interiors and exteriors of Tesla's autonomous vehicles.",
      "The robotaxi event comes just weeks after Musk stepped back from the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump administration's cost-cutting effort. With Tesla's sales tumbling amid widespread protests against his government work, some Tesla investors had asked him\u00a0to refocus on the EV carmaker.",
      "In an X post from earlier this month, Musk\u00a0teased the June 22 launch date and said the first driverless trip \"from factory end of line all the way to a customer house\" is set to take place on June 28.",
      "From there, he has said he expects services to scale rapidly. It's likely that the Tesla robotaxi could be rolled out in 25 U.S. cities over the next year, according to Ives.",
      "Are there safety concerns about robotaxis?",
      "Autonomous vehicles have drawn scrutiny from the government officials and independent groups like the Dawn Project, a computer safety advocacy company, which argues that Tesla's self-driving technology puts children in harm's way.",
      "Tesla is also under the microscope of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which\u00a0launched an investigation in October\u00a0after four vehicles with Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" system were involved in crashes.",
      "In May, the agency's investigatory arm shifted its focus to the impending pilot program in Austin, saying in a\u00a0letter\u00a0that it wants information from Tesla on how it plans to evaluate its fleet of robotaxis for use on public roads.",
      "These concerns seems to have caught the attention of Musk, who earlier this month wrote, \"We are being super paranoid about safety\" in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0discussing the rollout.",
      "On Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers from Texas signed a letter asking Tesla to delay its launch until September 1, when a new law regulating the safety of autonomous vehicles takes effect. Under the laws new framework, commercial vehicles would be required to get authorization for the Department of Motor Vehicles \"before operating on public streets without a human driver.\"",
      "It's unlikely that will hobble this weekend's launch, which appears to be moving ahead, albeit with certain safety provisions built in. According to the invite\u00a0shared on social media, the robotaxis in Austin pilot will have a \"Tesla Safety Monitor\" in the front right passenger seat. Remote monitors will also be keeping track of the rides, according to\u00a0CNBC.",
      "How important are robotaxis for Tesla?",
      "The rollout of the robotaxi service, if successful, could help boost the company's fortunes after it faced intense backlash over Musk's involvement in the Trump administration's DOGE, noted Wedbush's Ives.",
      "Tesla's first-quarter results fell short of expectations, with its profit tumbling 71% and its sales sliding 9% during the three-month period. While its stock has regained some lost ground since Musk said he would return his focus to Tesla, it's still 33% below its December peak of about $480 per share.",
      "The robotaxi rollout could help Tesla reach a $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026, or double its current valuation, according to Ives.",
      "\"The golden era of autonomous for Tesla officially kicks off on Sunday in Austin,\" Ives wrote in a research report. \"We view this autonomous chapter as one of the most important for Musk and Tesla.\"",
      "In ramping up robotaxi service, Tesla is hoping to slingshot past Waymo, another autonomous car service that operates in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, according to its\u00a0website. Last week, Waymo\u00a0applied for a permit to test its vehicles in New York City.",
      "\"I don't really think about competitors. I just think about making the product as perfect as possible,\" Musk has said of his robotaxi venture.",
      "Either way, Tesla will have some catching up to do. Waymo currently gets 250,000 paid trips each week for its driverless taxis service.",

    "story": [
      "Social Security is on track to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast, when the federal retirement program will be required to cut monthly benefits by about 20%.",
      "The new projection, issued Wednesday in the Social Security Board of Trustees'\u00a0annual report,\u00a0is partly due to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which boosted benefits for millions of retirees, the report said. Last year's report had forecast\u00a0that the program would need to cut benefits starting in 2035, impacting Social Security's 70 million beneficiaries.",
      "The Social Security program has been staring down a financial crunch for years, although the trust funds' depletion date can change from year to year due to fluctuations in the economy and the number of beneficiaries. The trust fund is slated to be depleted partly due to the wave of baby boomer retirements and an aging U.S. population, which means its reserves are drawing down because spending is outpacing income.",
      "\"Congress, along with the Social Security Administration and others committed to eliminating waste, fraud and abuse, must work together to protect and strengthen the trust funds for the millions of Americans who rely on it \u2014 now and in the future \u2014 for a secure retirement or in the event of a disability,\" said Frank Bisignano, commissioner of Social Security, in a statement.",
      "Here's the impact on your benefits",
      "Even if the trust funds are depleted \u2014 which may not occur if Congress makes changes to how the program is funded, for instance \u2014 benefits won't suddenly disappear.",
      "Instead, Social Security beneficiaries would see a cut of between 19% to 23% to their benefits, the report said.",
      "The current average Social Security benefit for a retiree stands at $1,976, which means a 19% reduction would take their monthly check down to about $1,600.",
      "The new report is a wake-up call that lawmakers need to move quickly to shore up the program, some advocacy groups for seniors said on Wednesday.",
      "\"Congress must act to protect and strengthen the Social Security that Americans have earned and paid into throughout their working lives,\" said AARP CEO Myechia Minter-Jordan in an email. \"More than 69 million Americans rely on Social Security today and as America's population ages, the stability of this vital program only becomes more important.\"",
      "Shoring up Social Security",
      "There are two ways to shore up Social Security, by either raising more revenue or cutting benefits, said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the program, in an email. \"Any politician who doesn't support increasing Social Security's revenue is, by default, supporting benefit cuts,\" she said.",
      "One method of raising more revenue for the program would be lift its income cap, which stands at $176,100. Earnings over that amount are exempt from the payroll tax, which funds Social Security.",
      "\"In poll after poll, the American people are clear that they strongly support making the wealthy pay their fair share into Social Security, and overwhelmingly oppose benefit cuts,\" Altman said.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have suggested increasing the retirement age to as high as 70 as a way to fix the program's finances, but that would effectively act as a benefits cut for retirees, said Max Richtman, CEO of National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, in a statement.",
      "\"Current and future seniors (nearly 50% of whom rely on their benefits for all or most of their income) \u2014 should not be asked to bear the cost of improving the program's finances,\" he added.",
      "Changes to Social Security",
      "One of the changes to Social Security this year that will have a \"substantial\" impact on the program is the Social Security Fairness Act, which went into effect on January 5, the report said.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act expanded benefits for millions by eliminating two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "Under the new law, about 3.2 million recipients are getting higher benefits, ranging from modest increases to more than $1,000 a month in additional money, the agency has said.",
      "Americans are also filing for Social Security benefits at a record rate this year, the program's data shows. The number of people claiming benefits jumped 17% to 1.8 million\u00a0in 2025 through May versus the same period a year earlier, putting the program on track to enroll 4 million new beneficiaries in 2025.",
      "The spike in early benefits claims comes as the\u00a0Trump administration has slashed jobs\u00a0at the agency and made other changes at the Social Security Administration, which had already been struggling to provide services to retirees, disabled people and survivors of deceased workers who rely on the program.",
      "Anxieties about the stability of the program likely prompted some of the new filings, experts have told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Medicare's outlook",
      "Separately, the Medicare Board of Trustees issued a report Wednesday that said the health insurance program for people over 65 is facing a financial crunch in 2033, at which point it wouldn't be able to pay 100% of benefits.",
      "Instead, the program's revenues would only cover 89% of its costs at that point, the report said.",

      "Looking to travel this summer but not sure which airline to fly for the best experience? The Points Guy (TPG), an online site dedicated to improving consumers' travel experiences while helping them save money, has revealed its annual ranking of the best airlines in the U.S.",
      "Founder and CEO Brian Kelly said the site ranks airlines based on four criteria: a carrier's reliability and performance; passenger experience; its cost and reach; and the quality of its loyalty or rewards program. Recent carrier meltdowns have travelers thinking more carefully about which airline \u2014 and through which airports \u2014 they want to fly.",
      "\"This is not just my personal decision,\" Kelly told CBS Mornings. He also explained how the company weighs each metric. \"We have a formula. We use lots of data. This isn't us just sticking our finger up in the air and kind of playing favorites. We look at reliability, first and foremost.\"",
      "\"When you buy airfare, you need to get to where you're going, so we give a huge amount \u2014 30% \u2014 to reliability,\" Kelly explained.",
      "Some airlines are going the extra mile to make flying more enjoyable for customers, from the minute they step foot in an airport through touchdown. For that reason, TPG assigned a 25% weight to an airline passenger's experience score to determine its overall ranking.",
      "An airline's cost and reach \u2014 including how expansive its network of destinations is \u2014 was assigned a 20% weight. And one-quarter of an airline's score was determined by the quality of its loyalty of rewards program.",
      "How the airlines stack up",
      "Delta Air Lines topped the list for the seventh year in a row, with its relative strength across all categories earning it the highest ranking, according to TPG. It is the most reliable on-time airline in America. It also provides passengers with free wi-fi, a wide selection of inflight entertainment options and meals from Shake Shack.",
      "United came in second place, rising from third place last year, aided by an improved onboard experience. It could continue to climb the rankings next year after announcing a partnership with JetBlue that will expand the airline's reach and improve perks for its loyalty members, TPG said.",
      "Weighing on the airline, though, is United's outsized presence at Newark Airport, which is suffering from persistent equipment and staffing issues.",
      "Southwest Airlines moved up two spots to earn the No. 3 position. Working in the airline's favor is its low flight cancellation rate, which is the best of any of its competitors. While it scored points in the cost and reach category, recent changes in fee structures could end its reign. It recently ended its popular \"bags fly free\" policy and offers a new, basic economy fare.",

      "Suppliers of materials, including lumber, steel and aluminum, have already hiked prices for builders. Sixty percent of homebuilders say suppliers have either already raised prices or intend to, according to data from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) and Wells Fargo's April 2025 Housing Market Index. They attribute the price hikes to the Trump administration's sweeping levies on the U.S.'s trade partners.",
      "Extra costs for materials can add up quickly, leading to a typical price increase of around $10,000 per home renovation project, according to the NAHB.",
      "Pre-ordering materials, before prices rise, is one way to save on roofing supplies such as shingles, according to Connecticut-based builder David Perotti, founder of Fine Home Contracting. He told CBS News that he saved a \"few thousand dollars\" on behalf of a client by ordering the roofing shingles early.",
      "Most materials that are used to build homes in the U.S. are imported, Perotti explained. For example, one-quarter of the country's available lumber supply comes from Canada, and could be subject to a 15% levy.",
      "Steel and aluminum are integral to building roofs, homes' plumbing systems, electrical equipment and HVAC systems.",
      "Tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminum took effect earlier this month\u00a0and can apply to everything from coil roofing nails to metal flashing used to prevent leaks.",
      "Perotti's advice to homeowners looking for a refresh is to press pause on purchasing new appliances, and opt for a fresh paint job, which can go a long way toward making a home look new again.",
      "\"If you were to do one project, painting is usually really nice to freshen things up,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Perotti is also urging his clients to budget up to an additional 30% for extra, tariff-related costs on materials, particularly those that can go into remodeling bathrooms.",
      "Another tip is to work with materials suppliers to lock in prices when possible, even before materials become available. As far as repairs go, Perotti's advice is to prioritize fixing exterior damage, which can quickly lead to a home's degradation and cause more problems.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has once again delayed the enforcement of a bipartisan law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. as a deal to separate TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, has remained elusive.",
      "The president announced Thursday that he signed an executive order pushing back the deadline for enforcing a law passed by Congress until mid-September \u2014 the third delay in the law's implementation since his inauguration in January. The previous extension expired Thursday. Citing national security concerns, Congress passed the law last year with bipartisan support giving ByteDance until Jan. 19 to fully sever ties with TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "\"I've just signed the Executive Order extending the Deadline for the TikTok closing for 90 days (September 17, 2025),\" the president wrote on Truth Social Thursday. \"Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "The orders have directed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular video-sharing app from their platforms.",
      "TikTok released a statement thanking the president for the extension.",
      "\"We are grateful for President Trump's leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users and 7.5 million U.S. businesses that rely on the platform as we continue to work with Vice President Vance's office,\" the TikTok statement said.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this week that the president would sign the executive order delaying enforcement of the law for 90 days.",
      "\"As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark. This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,\" Leavitt said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the last extension in early April, his administration had reached an agreement that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time. But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "However, ByteDance said after the April announcement that a deal had not been reached because there were still key issues to be resolved, and noted that any deal would be subject to the Chinese government's approval.",
      "Mr. Trump acknowledged as much in May, telling reporters that \"we'll probably have to get China's approval.\"",
      "\"China's never easy,\" he said. \"I'd like to save TikTok. I mean, TikTok was very good to me.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that China would sign off on an eventual deal, saying that \"I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.\"",
      "The president also reiterated his support for TikTok on June 12, touting his popularity on the app that he unsuccessfully tried to ban during his first term.",
      "\"I was No. 1 on TikTok in its history. Can you believe that?\" Mr. Trump claimed. \"So I guess I like TikTok.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month in a 90-minute conversation that the U.S. leader said \"was focused almost entirely on trade.\" Neither countries' summaries of the call mentioned TikTok. Days later, senior U.S. and Chinese trade representatives met in London and reached a \"framework deal\" to ease the trade war.",
      "Testifying to the Senate Finance Committee on June 12 after the trade talks, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said TikTok \"was not discussed at the meetings in London.\"",
      "\"I have no visibility into TikTok,\" he told the committee.",
      "TikTok briefly and voluntarily shut down before a January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action. Still, Apple and Google waited nearly a month to restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores after Mr. Trump issued the first executive order.",
      "But there's been little action from Congress in response to the Trump administration ignoring the law, despite lawmakers sounding the alarm for years that TikTok could serve as a vessel for China to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data or serve them propaganda.",
      "\"The courts have been really clear on this,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters in early June. \"I think we ought to enforce the law.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 11:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Unauthorized immigrants make up nearly 5% of the U.S. workforce, according to 2022 estimates, and a higher share in construction and agriculture.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration resumed more aggressive workplace immigration enforcement earlier this week after briefly pausing arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants last week.",
      "\"The message is clear now that we're going to continue doing worksite enforcement operations, even on farms and hotels, but based on a prioritized basis,\" President Trump's \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, said Thursday, adding, \"Criminals come first.\"",
      "The White House argues that undocumented workers drive down wages and take jobs from American-born workers. But some farming and hospitality industry leaders have warned the administration that large-scale deportations could disrupt operations, as many of these workers fill essential jobs that are difficult to replace with domestic labor.",
      "Undocumented immigrants make up a sizable slice of the workforce in not only hospitality and farming but also construction and manufacturing.",
      "Additionally, undocumented workers are spread across the U.S., including in blue states like California and New Jersey, and in states that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election, like Texas, Florida, and Nevada, which have some of the biggest shares of unauthorized workers.",
      "Here's a closer look at the industries most dependent on undocumented workers and the states where these workers are concentrated.",
      "Undocumented workers in key industries",
      "The Center for Immigration Studies estimated in 2024 that there are about 14 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.",
      "The most recent detailed breakdown by sector and state comes from the Pew Research Center's analysis of Census data from 2022. According to that study, there were an estimated 8.3 million undocumented immigrants who were part of the workforce, out of 11 million total in the country at that time.",
      "These workers made up 4.8% of the overall U.S. workforce, according to Pew, but they were a much larger share of the workforce in several essential industries.",
      "Nearly 1 in 5\u00a0 household workers and landscapers, 16% of crop workers and meat processors, 14% of apparel manufacturing workers and 13% of construction workers were undocumented immigrants, Pew estimated.",
      "The numbers were even higher depending on the occupation. One-third of roofers and workers who install drywall and ceiling tiles were undocumented, as were a quarter of maids and housekeepers, and nearly one-fifth of brickmasons.",
      "Because the U.S. Census does not directly ask about legal status, the number of unauthorized immigrants and their participation in the workforce is inexact. Pew Research Center analyzed the American Community Survey from 2022, and Goldman Sachs produced similar estimates based on the 2023 version of the survey.",
      "The share of undocumented workers in a given industry may be even higher than estimates based on the Census. A survey by the Department of Agriculture from 2021 to 2022 found that 42% of 2,600 crop workers interviewed did not have work authorization.",
      "Industry leaders have said the renewed deportation push is making it harder to operate. American Farm Bureau Federation president Zippy Duvall expressed disappointment on Tuesday in the administration's decision to restart immigration arrests on farms, forecasting that it could lead to inflated food prices for American consumers.",
      "\"Unfortunately, domestic workers do not apply for farm jobs, despite aggressive hiring efforts. Without farm workers, vegetables will be left in the fields, fruit will remain unpicked, and cows will go unmilked. The end result is a reduced food supply and higher grocery prices for all of America's families,\" Duvall said in a statement.",
      "Research also indicates that deportation can actually lead to fewer jobs for native-born workers. One study of the Obama administration's Secure Communities program, which deported nearly half a million undocumented immigrants, estimated that for every 1 million people deported, the number of jobs held by U.S.-born people would be reduced by 88,000.",
      "\"You can think about foreign-born workers taking jobs like a construction worker or a dishwasher at a local restaurant, and then once people are in those jobs employers are also able to hire construction managers and waiters and waitresses. And those are jobs typically taken by U.S.-born workers,\" economist Chloe East, the study's author, told CBS News.",
      "Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, estimate that if all of the unauthorized workers in the country were deported, U.S. GDP could fall as much as 7.4% below baseline by 2028.",
      "Share of undocumented workers by state",
      "President Trump said in a recent post on social media that his administration would focus on deportation efforts in Democrat-led cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, which he characterized as the places where \"millions upon millions of illegal aliens reside.\"",
      "But research indicates the undocumented population is spread across the country in both blue- and red-leaning states.",
      "Unauthorized immigrants make up the greatest share of both the population and workforce in Nevada and Texas \u2014 two states Mr. Trump won in 2024 \u2014 where the Pew Research Center estimates over 8% of workers were undocumented as of 2022.",
      "In California, where immigration enforcement raids sparked protests last week, Pew estimated that as of 2022, 7.2% of the workforce was undocumented. In New York, the figure was about 5%.",
      "Texas Restaurant Association CEO and president Emily Williams Knight told CBS News that some restaurants in the state are experiencing staffing issues because workers are afraid to come to work amid the crackdown.",
      "\"You have to remember, if people stop going to work in restaurants, that means restaurants can't serve their community. That means the dollar that restaurants put into each community, for a dollar spent, goes away, and then those workers are also not spending,\" Knight said.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, \"While the President remains focused on immediately removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens from the country, including those given safe harbor in Democrat-run sanctuary cities, anyone who is here illegally is liable to be deported.\"",
      "Jackson added, \"Any suggestion that enforcing immigration law will hurt the workforce misses the forest for the trees \u2014 there is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force.\"",

    "summary": "Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, said he expects the company to reduce its workforce over the next few years as it rolls out more generative AI and agents.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon's CEO envisions an \"agentic future\" in which AI robots, or agents, replace humans working in the company's offices.",
      "In a\u00a0memo\u00a0to employees made public by Amazon on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy said he expects the company to reduce its corporate workforce in as soon as the next few years, as it leans more heavily on generative AI tools to help fulfill workplace duties.",
      "\"As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,\" Jassy stated. \"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"",
      "Jassy added that this move toward AI would eventually \"reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\" With approximately 1.5 million employees worldwide, the e-commerce giant is the second largest private employer in the United States.",
      "Reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson deferred to the original memo.",
      "Amazon shares dipped slightly on Tuesday, down 0.4% as of 3:45 p.m. EST.",
      "Amazon investing \"quite expansively\" in AI",
      "Amazon is \"investing quite expansively\" in generative AI technology, according to Jassy, adding that \"the progress we are making is evident.\"",
      "\"Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming, and coming fast,\" the CEO stated in the memo.",
      "Amazon ramped up its participation in the generative AI arms race with the release of the Amazon Echo smart speaker in 2014, its first product to include its virtual assistant Alexa. This February, the company\u00a0announced it was unveiling Alexa+, a new version of the AI-powered voice assistant that's \"more conversational, smarter, personalized.\"",
      "AI features have since been incorporated across Amazon's e-commerce websites through tools like \"Buy for Me\" which allow customers to ask a shopping assistant to buy an item for them and \"Recommended Size\" which predicts your clothing size based on past purchases. Amazon's\u00a0AI shopping assistant is used by tens of millions of customers, according to Jassy.",
      "AI replaces creativity for some",
      "In the Tuesday memo, Jassy sketched out a future in which AI agents are used to conduct tedious tasks, freeing up human workers to take on more creative roles.",
      "\"Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point,\" Jassy said. \"We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones.\"",
      "However, this hard-pivot into AI has generated negative feedback from some white-collar employees at the company. Amazon software engineers interviewed recently by the New York Times\u00a0describe\u00a0an intensified work environment in which they are pushed to use AI to increase productivity and meet higher output goals, making their jobs \"more routine, less thoughtful and, crucially, much faster paced.\"",
      "All told, Amazon currently has 1,000 generative AI services and applications either in the works or already built, a \"small fraction\" of what the company ultimately plans to build, said Jassy.",
      "Jassy's pledge to invest in AI comes after the company announced in May that it would cut 100 jobs in its devices and services\u00a0unit, an Amazon spokesperson confirmed.",

    "summary": "Utilities are racing to build data centers to meet surging demand for AI and other tech services. Ratepayers will pick up the tab, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "New Jersey residents got some bad news earlier this year when the state's public utilities board warned that their electricity bills could surge up to 20% starting on June 1. A key driver in that rate hike: data centers.",
      "The spread of these large-scale computing facilities across the U.S. amid growing demand for artificial intelligence, data storage and other technology services is projected to increase electricity consumption to record highs in the coming years, according to experts.",
      "A report from Schneider Electric, a company that specializes in digital automation and energy management, projects that electricity demand will increase 16% by 2029, mainly due to the proliferation of data centers. Most data centers rely on the nation's electrical grid for energy, meaning it will be Americans ratepayers who pick up the tab, Mark Wolfe, executive director of the\u00a0National Energy Assistance Directors Association, a group that represents states on energy issues.",
      "\"As utilities race to meet skyrocketing demand from AI and cloud computing, they're building new infrastructure and raising rates, often without transparency or public input,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"That means higher electricity bills for everyday households, while tech companies benefit from sweetheart deals behind closed doors.\"",
      "More data centers, more power",
      "Thousands of data centers now dot the country, with the\u00a0largest concentrations\u00a0in Virginia, California and Texas. The number of data centers in the U.S. nearly doubled between 2021 and 2024, according to a report from Environment America, a network of environmental groups.",
      "It's not just the number of data centers that are expected to rise, but the size. \"The trend has been bigger data centers,\" Dave Turk, the\u00a0former deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy, told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0\"They tend to be more energy efficient.\"",
      "Spurring that expansion is the rapid growth of \"generative\" AI companies that are consuming vast amounts of electricity to train so-called Large Language Models like ChatGPT and power. AI searches use 10 times more electricity than normal internet searches, according to a\u00a0study from the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit organization.",
      "\"AI is an increasing part of data centers and certainly responsible for increased electricity demand,\" Turk said.",
      "Data centers, which contain thousands of computer servers, networking gear and other infrastructure, also require power to cool their systems and keep them from overheating.",
      "Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chief economist at asset management firm Apollo Global Management, estimates that data centers will require an additional 18 gigawatts of power capacity by 2030. To put that into context, New York City power demand is about 6 gigawatts.",
      "About 4.4% of U.S. electricity went to power data centers in 2023, according to a Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study. Not all of that demand is related to AI, but it represents a portion, Turk said.",
      "Other factors pushing up prices",
      "The spread of data centers isn't the only reason U.S. electricity prices are surging. The price of natural gas, inflation, ongoing electrification of buildings and vehicles, and other factors also play an important role. But utilities are factoring the high demand from data centers into their pricing models.",
      "For example, when Dominion Energy, one of the Virginia's largest utilities, in April\u00a0proposed\u00a0a price hike of $8.51 per month in 2026, the company also floated the idea of a \"new rate class for high energy users, including data centers.\"",
      "Electricity prices have risen 4.5% in the last year, according to recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Labor Department, and are estimated to\u00a0surge this summer. Energy costs also drift higher if a Republican-backed budget package, dubbed the \"big beautiful bill,\" is passed and signed into law by President Trump. Analysts from Rhodium Group\u00a0predict\u00a0that the bill, which would repeal a slate of tax credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act, could increase a family's energy expenditures by nearly $400 a year.",
      "Beyond price increases, the heightened energy demand from data centers could also compromise the reliability of the grid, according to experts. In a recent\u00a0report, the North American Electric Reliability Corp said that facilities that service AI and cryptocurrency companies are being developed at a faster pace than the power plants and transmission lines to support them, \"resulting in lower system stability.",
      "PJM, a grid operator in 13 states plus Washington, D.C., cited data center demand as one of the factors that could lead to capacity shortages in its 2025 forecast.",

After scoring cities across these metrics, WalletHub then compared the data against each city's per-capita budget to determine which are run the best.",
      "\"The best-run cities in America use their budgets most effectively to provide high-quality financial security, education, health, safety and transportation to their residents,\" said Chip Lupo, a WalletHub analyst, wrote in the study. \"Many of the top cities also have a very low amount of outstanding government debt per capita, which can prevent financial troubles in the future.\"",
      "Read on to find out where your city falls on WalletHub's list.",
      "What are the best-run cities?",
      "Provo, Utah, ranks as the best-run city in the U.S., according to the WalletHub study. Home to 115,000 people, the western city is probably best known for its towering mountains and as the birthplace of Brigham Young University.",
      "A constellation of factors pushed Provo to the top of the list, including its robust business growth (5.2%), impressive high school graduation rate (91%), infrastructure and safety ratings, with it the fourth-lowest violent crime rate in the country. The nation's average high school graduation rate stands at 87%.",
      "Trailing Provo at number two and number three are Nampa, Idaho, which stands out due to its low government debt and safety ratings, and Manchester, New Hampshire, respectively. The latter notched points for low pollution levels and steady growth in home values.",
      "Here are the best and worst-run cities, as ranked by WalletHub. You can also search for your city by name in the bar at the top of the chart.",

      "The changes, to be rolled out over the next few months according to Meta, expand and monetize the functions of WhatsApp's \"Updates\" tab, which has historically been a place for users to follow news and updates from their favorite companies, news organizations and celebrities. A new subscription model on the tab will allow channel admins to offer users exclusive content for a monthly fee.",

      "\"People really want to chat to businesses on their own terms, and they want to do it in a place where they already spend their time, which is on WhatsApp,\" said Srinivasan.",

    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, President Trump announced Saturday evening, calling them a \"spectacular military success.\"",
      "\"The U.S. military carried out massive precision strikes on the three key nuclear assemblies in the Iranian regime: Fordo, Natanz and Esfahan,\" President Trump said in a national address from the White House Saturday night. \"Our objective was the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and a stop to the nuclear threat posed by the world's number one state sponsor of terror.\"",
      "Prior to his address, the president\u00a0wrote\u00a0on his Truth Social platform that a \"full payload of BOMBS\" was dropped on the \"primary site\" Fordo. The president also said all U.S. planes made it safely out of Iranian air space.",
      "And in second post, Mr. Trump wrote: \"This is an HISTORIC MOMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ISTAEL (sic), AND THE WORLD. IRAN MUST NOW AGREE TO END THIS WAR. THANK YOU!\"",
      "Trump warns Iran against retaliating after U.S. strikes",
      "The president\u00a0addressed the nation\u00a0regarding the strikes late Saturday night, saying that \"Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated\" and issuing a warning to Iran to strive for a peace deal in its war with Israel.",
      "\"There will be either peace, or there will be tragedy for Iran far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days,\" Mr. Trump said while flanked by Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. \"Remember, there are many targets left.\"",
      "Mr. Trump added that \"if peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill. Most of them can be taken out in a matter of minutes.\"",
      "Iran has pledged to retaliate if the U.S. joined the Israeli assault, which began with airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites and military targets on June 13. Iran has responded with missile and drone attacks on Israeli cities.",
      "But in a follow-up social media post following his national address, Mr. Trump said that \"ANY RETALIATION BY IRAN AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL BE MET WITH FORCE FAR GREATER THAN WHAT WAS WITNESSED TONIGHT.\"",
      "What we know so far about the U.S. strikes",
      "Two senior Defense Department officials confirmed to CBS News that three American B-2 bombers were used to strike Fordo early Sunday local time, with each of those B-2s armed with 2 U.S.-produced\u00a0\"bunker-buster\" bombs\u00a0known as the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, or MOPs \u2014 bombs so heavy that they could only be dropped by a B-2.",
      "Fordo, the site of a high-grade uranium enrichment facility\u00a0that international experts believe is key to Iran's nuclear program, is buried almost 300 feet beneath a mountain and protected by significant air defenses. The MOP is believed to be the best chance at destroying the Fordo facility.",
      "The officials told CBS News Natanz and Isfahan were struck by tomahawk missiles launched by submarines. It's unclear how many missiles were launched at those two sites.",
      "The U.S. reached out to Iran diplomatically Saturday to say the strikes are all the U.S. plans and that regime change efforts are not planned, the sources said. Earlier this week, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News that Mr. Trump opposed an Israeli plan to kill Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader.",
      "Not all U.S. allies in the region who house U.S. troops that are part of U.S. Central Command were informed in advance of the coming U.S. plan to strike in Iran, according to diplomatic sources. Some of the allies were informed as the planes were in the air.",
      "The United Nation's International Atomic Energy Agency stated in a social media post that it confirm \"no increase in off-site radiation levels\" in the wake of the U.S. strikes.",
      "What Israeli and Iranian officials are saying",
      "The U.S. alerted Israel ahead of the strikes, two White House officials told CBS News. Mr. Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke following the strikes, the officials said. And in a video address, Netanyahu praised the president for conducting the strikes.",
      "\"President Trump and I often say peace through strength. First comes strength, then comes peace. And tonight President Trump and the United States acted with a lot of strength.\"",
      "According to the Iranian state media outlet IRNA, Morteza Heidari, a spokesman for crisis headquarters in Iran's Qom province, acknowledged there had been attacks on all three nuclear sites. Iran's Atomic Energy Organization also confirmed the attacks in a statement, but claimed the strikes will not stop it from progressing in its nuclear program. It also called on the international community to condemn the attacks.",
      "And in a social media post Sunday morning, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi  said that \"in accordance with\" the United Nations Charter \"and its provisions Iran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people.\"",
      "Araghchi alleged that the U.S. in its attack had \"committed a grave violation of the UN Charter.\"",
      "Homeland Security officials are monitoring for potential physical and cyber reprisals from the U.S. attack, domestically amid a \"very high\" threat level and with the \"red line\" of the Iranian response doctrine now crossed, CBS News has learned.",
      "\"We're in unchartered territory,\" one U.S. intelligence official told CBS News, while speaking about potential Iranian threats to the U.S. homeland. \"We don't know how Iran will react to this because this is the highest rate of tension and conflict we've had in recent history. We're just not sure how the Khomeini regime will react.\"",
      "The official added that assessments range from little to no action on the part of Iranians to desperate and drastic action.",
      "U.S. lawmakers give mixed response",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson was briefed ahead of the strikes, according to a source familiar.",
      "The response from U.S. lawmakers\u00a0has been mixed. Some Republicans, including Johnson, expressed support for the strikes, while others, like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, an ardent Trump supporter, posted on X that \"this is not our fight.\"",
      "Both Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the president for not seeking congressional authorization for the strikes.",
      "\"President Trump misled the country about his intentions, failed to seek congressional authorization for the use of military force and risks American entanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East,\" Jeffries said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement that Mr. Trump campaigned on a promise to \"'end the endless foreign wars.'\"",
      "\"Tonight, he took steps that could drag the United States into another one, without consulting Congress, without a clear strategy, without regard to the consistent conclusions of the intelligence community, and without explaining to the American people what's at stake,\" Warner said.",
      "The events that led up to the surprise strikes",
      "Earlier Saturday, multiple U.S. officials had confirmed to CBS News that B-2 bombers had departed Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri en route to Guam. Multiple U.S. aerial refueling tankers were spotted on commercial flight trackers flying flight patterns consistent with escorting aircraft from the central U.S. to the Pacific.",
      "The U.S. strikes come after Araghchi met with European officials in Geneva Friday and said he was open to further dialogue.",
      "\"Iran is ready to consider diplomacy once again,\" Araghchi said, adding, \"I stress that Iran's defense capabilities are not negotiable. (But) I express our readiness to meet again in the near future.\"",
      "On Thursday, the president said he would decide whether to strike Iran \"within the next two weeks.\" One source told CBS News at the time that Mr. Trump \"believes there's not much choice. Finishing the job means destroying Fordo.\"",
      "U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said earlier Saturday that the U.S. had begun evacuating Americans and green card holders out of Israel aboard assisted departure flights. Two flights departed from Tel Aviv to Athens with approximately 70 U.S. citizens, their accompanying immediate family members and lawful permanent residents, the State Department said prior to Mr. Trump's announcement of the strikes.",
      "Meanwhile, the White House released photos of the Situation Room during the strikes. In the room with the president were Vance, Hegseth, Rubio, chairman of the Joint Chiefs Dan Caine, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino, deputy national security adviser Andy Baker, White House general counsel David Warrington and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.",
      "Gabbard's presence in the room was significant, as on Friday, Mr. Trump told reporters that she was \"wrong\" when she testified to Congress in March that Iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon.",
      "Hegseth and Caine were scheduled to hold a news briefing from the Pentagon at 8 a.m. Eastern Time Sunday to provide an update on the assault.",

      "Many Republican lawmakers back U.S. strikes in Iran, but not all",
      "\"Good. This was the right call. The regime deserves it. Well done, President @realDonaldTrump,\" Sen. Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said on X.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a social media post that \"the military operations in Iran should serve as a clear reminder to our adversaries and allies that President Trump means what he says.\"",
      "\"The President gave Iran's leader every opportunity to make a deal, but Iran refused to commit to a nuclear disarmament agreement,\" Johnson\u00a0said in the post. \"President Trump has been consistent and clear that a nuclear-armed Iran will not be tolerated. That posture has now been enforced with strength, precision, and clarity.\"",
      "Texas Sen. Cruz, who has backed of Israeli strikes against Iranian targets, said in a statement: \"As long as Iran was able to access and conduct activities at Fordow, they could still rush to build a nuclear arsenal. Tonight's actions have gone far in foreclosing that possibility, and countering the apocalyptic threat posed by an Iranian nuclear arsenal.\"",
      "Rep. Rick Crawford, Republican chair of the House Intelligence Committee, praised Mr. Trump in a statement and said, \"I have been in touch with the White House before this action and will continue to track developments closely with them in the coming days.\"",
      "The strikes announced by Mr. Trump Saturday evening further escalated the conflict between\u00a0Iran and Israel\u00a0that started June 13. Mr. Trump, on Wednesday,\u00a0was still mulling over\u00a0whether the U.S. military would join Israel's ongoing attacks on Iran.",
      "Before the announcement of the strikes, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia was among the few Republicans who opposed the U.S. action, arguing on social media, \"This is not our fight.\"",

Thomas Massie of Kentucky, reshared Mr. Trump's post on the strikes with a terse comment: \"not constitutional.\" Massie\u00a0introduced a resolution on Tuesday to prohibit U.S. involvement in the conflict. A few days earlier, He pointed out that the power to authorize use of military force rests with Congress, and\u00a0said\u00a0of the Israel-Iran conflict on X, \"This is not our war.

Confronting Iran's ruthless campaign of terror, nuclear ambitions, and regional aggression demands strength, resolve, and strategic clarity. The danger of wider, longer, and more devastating war has now dramatically increased.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Warner, vice chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence, said that while there is \"no question that Iran poses a serious threat to regional stability,\" the president's actions threaten to drag the U.S. into an open-ended conflict \"without consulting Congress\" and \"without a clear strategy.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who cosponsored Massie's resolution seeking to limit Mr. Trump's war powers, said in a statement early Sunday that Congress \"needs to come back to DC immediately to vote\" on the resolution \"to ensure there is no further conflict and escalation.\"",

      "Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been trying to limit Mr. Trump's ability to order U.S. strikes on Iran amid its ongoing war with Israel, emphasizing that only Congress has the power to declare war under the Constitution. The extent of the president's authority to enter foreign conflicts without the approval of the legislative branch has been questioned in recent years. The last time Congress authorized the use of military force was in 2002, against Iraq.

      "Vance is the highest-ranking Trump administration official to visit the Los Angeles area since protests broke out in the nation's second-largest city over Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. He gave brief remarks after touring a multi-agency Federal Joint Operations Center and a federal mobile command center, and meeting with leadership and Marines on the ground.",
      "President Trump federalized\u00a0thousands of troops\u00a0from the California National Guard in response to the Los Angeles-area protests and ordered about 700 Marines to be deployed to protect federal property. The president\u00a0has directed\u00a0federal immigration authorities to prioritize deporting individuals from Democratic-run cities, including Los Angeles, and a series of ICE operations in L.A.\u00a0sparked the protests\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "The deployments drew a lawsuit from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who argued the presence of military forces could inflame the situation. Late Thursday, a federal appeals court\u00a0allowed\u00a0the president to keep control of the National Guard troops he deployed to the Los Angeles region, halting a ruling from a lower court judge who said the president acted illegally when he activated the troops over objections from Newsom. The protests have waned, but the troops remain.",

      "\"He knows my name,\" Padilla said, adding, \"He's the vice president of the United States. You'd think he'd take the situation in Los Angeles more seriously.\"",

      "Columbia University activist\u00a0Mahmoud Khalil\u00a0exited an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Louisiana on Friday night, after a federal judge ordered his release while his immigration proceedings play out.",
      "Khalil \u2014 who spent months in custody as the Trump administration attempted to deport him due to \"foreign policy\" concerns \u2014 addressed reporters after leaving the facility, ahead of his return to New York.",
      "\"Trump and his administration, they chose the wrong person for this,\" Khalil said.",
      "During a hearing hours earlier before U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz, Khalil's attorneys asked him to free Khalil from detention or transfer him to New Jersey. The New Jersey judge agreed, determining that Khalil is not a threat to the community, not a flight risk and that his detention has been \"highly unusual.\"",
      "Farbiarz denied the government's request to stay his decision. In his written order, Farbiarz said \"the Petitioner shall be released from immigration custody today.\" His bail conditions restrict his travel to New Jersey, New York, Michigan, Washington, D.C., and Louisiana, where he must attend all of his immigration proceedings.",
      "Khalil is a green card holder who was detained by immigration agents in March. His wife Noor Abdalla was 8 months pregnant with their first child when he was first taken into custody, and gave birth\u00a0to a baby boy in April. Immigration officials denied Khalil's request for temporary release to attend the birth, and a judge later allowed him to see his son during a brief visit last month.",
      "\"Now I can actually hug him and Noor, my wife, without looking at the clock,\" Khalil said Friday, when asked about his plans after returning home.",
      "\"My husband was taken away from me in the middle of the night. It was one of the most terrifying times of my life. I don't think I've ever experienced anything scarier than that,\" Abdalla said in a March interview with \u00a0\"CBS Sunday Morning.\"",
      "In a statement released by the ACLU, which represents Khalil, Abdalla said \"we can finally breathe a sigh of relief and know that Mahmoud is on his way home to me and Deen, who never should have been separated from his father.\"",
      "Abigail Jackson, a spokeswoman for the White House, said prior to his release the administration would appeal.",
      "\"[T]here is no basis for a local federal judge in New Jersey \u2014 who lacks jurisdiction \u2014 to order Khalil's release from a detention facility in Louisiana,\" Jackson said. \"We expect to be vindicated on appeal, and look forward to removing Khalil from the United States.\"",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the order was \"yet another example of how out of control members of the judicial branch are undermining national security.\"",
      "\"The Trump Administration acted well within its statutory and constitutional authority to detain Khalil, as it does with any alien who advocates for violence, glorifies and supports terrorists, harasses Jews, and damages property,\" McLaughlin said. \"An immigration judge has already vindicated this position. We expect a higher court to do the same.\"",
      "Khalil was initially detained under a determination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that his \"presence or activities would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\" Farbiarz ruled last week that Khalil cannot be detained simply based on that determination, but the Department of Homeland Security has kept Khalil detained based on allegations that he omitted details from his green card application. Farbiarz said the new justification wasn't enough to continue his detention.",
      "\"It's overwhelmingly unlikely that a lawful permanent resident would be held on the remaining charge here,\" Farbiarz said, adding that \"there is an effort to use the immigration charge here to punish the petitioner\" for his anti-Israel speech. As a graduate student at Columbia, Khalil was among the leaders of students who protested Israel's war in Gaza in 2024. Khalil has since graduated.",
      "\"What all of that evidence adds up to is a lack of violence, a lack of property destruction, a lack of anything that would be characterized as inciting violence,\" Farbiarz added, saying that he has given government attorneys ample opportunity to address the lack of evidence and that they have provided none.",
      "During the hearing, Khalil's attorneys said that a Louisiana immigration judge denied a bond hearing for Khalil and has denied asylum, in addition to finding him removable on Rubio's declaration, conflicting with Farbiarz's order last week.",
      "\"There has been a thick record developed here,\" Farbiarz said, adding that he will not order electronic monitoring of Khalil.",
      "Farbiarz   ruled that Khalil's travel will be limited between New York and Michigan to visit family, along with New Jersey and Louisiana for court hearings and attorney visits only.",
      "Farbiarz   ordered Khalil surrender his passport, but said he could have his green card returned to him in order to facilitate his travel to New York. He is not allowed to travel internationally.",
      "Khalil was also ordered to update his current address with DHS within 48 hours of his release.",

His wife told investigators they were going to visit friends after her husband posted in a family group text \"they needed to get out of the house and people with guns may be showing up.\"",
      "The affidavit states Boelter's wife told the investigator they were \"preppers,\" meaning they \"prepare for major or catastrophic incidents.\" She says her husband gave her a \"bailout plan,\" including a directive to go to her mother's home in southwestern Wisconsin.",
      "She also told investigators her husband \"has a business partner from Worthington\" who lives in the state of Washington. She allegedly said the two were\u00a0 \"partners \u2026 in Red Lion, a security company and fishing outfit in Congo, Africa,\" the affidavit states.",
      "Empty rifle cases found in storage locker, search warrant says",

      "Police encountered Boelter at about 3:30 a.m. Saturday outside the Hortmans' home, where they exchanged gunfire, the federal criminal complaint notes. After allegedly killing the Hortmans, he fled the area on foot.",
      "Officers pursued, finding a ballistic vest, handgun magazines, a flashlight, face mask and Beretta 92 9mm pistol along the way.",
      "The federal complaint notes investigators identified Boelter from a storage unit bill found at the scene that listed his name; license plates found that were removed from the vehicle left outside the Hortmans' home, registered to Boelter and his wife; and pieces of the Beretta handgun \u2014 bought by Boelter in 2020 \u2014 and abandoned ammo magazine found in the Hortmans' neighborhood.

      "The Hoffmans' daughter, Hope, shut and locked the door before calling 911, triggering a warning that a \"politically motivated act was potentially underway,\" according to the statement.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Jun 2025 22:51:10 -0400",
    "summary": "Harvard can continue hosting foreign students, a federal judge ruled Friday.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students \u2014 but President Trump said\u00a0Friday he could strike a \"deal\" to resolve his battles with the Ivy League school within days.",
      "The preliminary injunction from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs bars the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, a federal database that keeps track of student visa applications. The Boston-based judge had previously blocked the policy through a temporary restraining order.",
      "Minutes later on Friday, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that his administration has been \"working closely with Harvard, and it is very possible that a Deal will be announced over the next week or so.\"",
      "\"They have acted extremely appropriately during these negotiations, and appear to be committed to doing what is right,\" the president wrote. \"If a Settlement is made on the basis that is currently being discussed, it will be \"mindbogglingly\" HISTORIC, and very good for our Country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not provide further details on the settlement talks. CBS News has reached out to Harvard and the White House for comment on the discussions.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security told Harvard in May it was revoking its student visa system certification, telling the school \"it is a privilege to enroll foreign students\" \u2014 and the school \"lost this privilege\" by allegedly failing to deal with campus antisemitism. Harvard quickly sued, arguing the school was being punished for defying the administration's political agenda, and Burroughs sided with Harvard.",
      "Mr. Trump issued a separate order earlier this month barring most international students from entering the U.S. to study at Harvard. Burroughs blocked that move two weeks ago, though her ruling Friday did not address Mr. Trump's order.",
      "In reaction to the judge's Friday ruling, a Harvard spokesperson said: \"The Court order allows Harvard to continue enrolling international students and scholars while the case moves forward. Harvard will continue to defend its rights\u2014and the rights of its students and scholars.\"",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Burroughs' ruling is \"in direct conflict with the President's constitutionally vested powers under Article II and those granted by federal law.\"",
      "\"It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments. The Trump administration is committed to restoring common sense to our student visa system; no lawsuit, this or any other, is going to change that,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "The battle over international students could have grave consequences for Harvard, where about one in four students hail from outside the United States. Mr. Trump suggested last month that Harvard should cap its foreign student enrollment at 15%, and share more information with the government so it can determine whether prospective students are \"troublemakers.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also ordered \"additional vetting\" for anybody who wants to travel to Harvard from abroad, including students as well as staff, faculty, guest speakers and tourists, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "It's part of a wider back-and-forth between Harvard and the Trump administration. In April, the administration pushed the school to make a range of policy changes in order to maintain its \"financial relationship\" with the government, including external audits of some academic departments and an end to diversity, equity and inclusion programs. When the school refused, the government said it would cut off billions of dollars in grants to Harvard.",
      "Other universities have faced similar pressure, including demands for policy changes \u2014 often zeroing in on the schools' handling of pro-Palestinian protests \u2014 and grant freezes.",
      "Earlier this week, the State Department announced guidelines for vetting student visa applicants' social media accounts, telling staff to look for signs of \"hostility\" toward the U.S.",
      "And some international students who are already in the U.S. have faced scrutiny. Authorities have detained several students linked to pro-Palestinian activism, including Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi from Columbia and Rumeysa Ozturk from Tufts. Mahdawi and Ozturk have since been released, and a judge ordered Khalil's release Friday.",

    "summary": "President Trump entertained the idea of firing Jerome Powell on Friday, a legally untested and contentious move.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump suggested Friday he may try to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling the central bank leader a \"Total and Complete Moron\" for leaving interest rates steady.",
      "The president has been lashing out against Powell for months, criticizing the central banker \u2014 whom Mr. Trump appointed in his first term \u2014 for not lowering interest rates at a faster pace. It's unclear whether the president is legally allowed to fire Powell before his term ends in May 2026, and Mr. Trump said in April he has \"no intention\" of doing so.",
      "But in a post criticizing Powell on Friday, Mr. Trump floated the idea, writing: \"Maybe, just maybe, I'll have to change my mind about firing him?\"",
      "\"But regardless, his Term ends shortly!\" the president added.",
      "Any attempt to fire Powell would be legally contentious. Federal law and prior court precedent says members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, including the chair, can only be fired \"for cause.\" The Supreme Court ruled last month that the Trump administration can fire members of other independent federal agencies \u2014 but specifically exempted the Fed, calling the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\"",
      "Powell said last year he will not resign if Mr. Trump asks him to step down. The two met at the White House last month.",
      "Mr. Trump also called Powell a \"dumb guy\" in his Friday evening post.",
      "\"I fully understand that my strong criticism of him makes it more difficult for him to do what he should be doing, lowering Rates, but I've tried it all different ways,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"I've been nice, I've been neutral, and I've been nasty, and nice and neutral didn't work! He's a dumb guy, and an obvious Trump Hater, who should have never been there.\"",
      "The Fed declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "Why has Trump criticized Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump's issues with Powell hinge on the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies. The central bank's interest rate-setting committee, which is chaired by Powell, has kept its benchmark rate steady so far this year, after lowering it slightly from a two-decade high last year \u2014 following a series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 to quell inflation.",
      "Most recently, the committee opted against lowering rates earlier this week, drawing backlash from Mr. Trump.",
      "The decision comes with tradeoffs. High interest rates can slow down economic growth and make it more expensive for Americans to borrow money, which is why Mr. Trump wants cuts. But lowering interest rates too quickly could overheat the economy and cause inflation to spike yet again. While inflation has cooled off in recent years, it's still higher than the Fed's 2% annual target, and the Fed warns Mr. Trump's tariffs could push prices up.",
      "\"Because the economy is still solid, we can take the time to actually see what's going to happen,\" Powell said earlier this week.",
      "Mr. Trump disagrees, nicknaming Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" and arguing that inflation is already low.",
      "On Friday, the president amped up his criticism, calling Powell a \"numbskull\" and suggesting the other members of the rate-setting Federal Open Monetary Committee \"override\" him. Mr. Trump also said Powell should lower interest rates immediately and just hike them again if inflation spikes \u2014 an idea that's at odds with the Fed's cautious strategy.",
      "\"Don't say that you think there will be Inflation sometime in the future, because there isn't now but, if there is, raise the Rates!\" wrote Mr. Trump.",
      "The attacks are a redux of Mr. Trump's first-term criticism. The president pushed back against Powell after the Fed hiked interest rates in 2018, but called Powell his \"most improved player\" for slashing rates during the 2020 pandemic.",

    "story": [
      "Diplomacy will have a \"last shot\" within the next two weeks to bring the Israel-Iran conflict to an end, according to one American and one European diplomatic official, a window set by President Trump this week as he decides whether to involve the U.S. in Israel's offensive against Iran.",
      "Those efforts were underway Friday as Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European foreign ministers in Geneva in the face of Israel's ongoing bombing campaign and the U.S. military buildup in the region.",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and the top European Union diplomat, Kaja Kallas, attended the Geneva meeting with Aragchi. Lammy had met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff at the White House Thursday.",
      "The Geneva meeting lasted nearly four hours \u2014 twice as long as scheduled \u2014 and afterward, Barrot indicated there would be further talks and told reporters \"the problem of Iran's nuclear program cannot be solved by military means\" alone. Lammy said, \"We were clear: Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "Araghchi, too, spoke after the meeting and said Iran supported continuing discussions.",
      "\"Iran is ready to consider diplomacy once again,\" he said, adding, \"I stress that Iran's defense capabilities are not negotiable. (But) I express our readiness to meet again in the near future.\"",
      "Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei remains the ultimate decision-maker, and it's not yet clear whether the ongoing Israeli airstrikes and impending threat of U.S. involvement will move him any closer toward a diplomatic off ramp than when Witkoff last offered a proposal a few weeks ago. The U.S. offer, which is still on the table, would have allowed Iran to have a civilian nuclear program if it agreed not to enrich uranium on its soil. Instead, Iran would be able to purchase enriched fuel from other countries. One suggestion involved an Omani idea to establish a regional consortium that would allow enrichment for civilian purposes under monitoring by the IAEA and U.S.",
      "Khamenei, 86, is thought to still be battling cancer and is in hiding from the Israeli strikes. He has not responded to overtures from multiple countries seeking to help de-escalate the conflict.",
      "It's not entirely clear how functional the Iranian government is at this moment. Internet connectivity and international calls into Iran are difficult to complete, according to sources in the region. Cyber attacks have paralyzed the banking system, and as of Thursday, multiple diplomats acknowledged factors like these have made it more difficult to arrange in-person talks with Aragchi.",
      "The ongoing Israeli assault may also make Khamenei fearful about communicating, given concerns about avoiding signals intelligence intercepts that could be used to target him, one diplomatic source suggested.",
      "Anything Aragchi discusses with the West will ultimately need the supreme leader's approval, and U.S. expectations for a breakthrough during this meeting are low. But it's a start.",
      "It remains to be seen if the conversation in Geneva produced some indication of whether Iran is still open to direct talks with the U.S. \u2014 not just the European nations \u2014 which is what Witkoff has also been trying to initiate through his own personal outreach, one U.S. official said.",
      "Turkey and Oman, as well as European countries including Italy and Norway, have offered to host direct or indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran, if Tehran were to choose that path, according to two European diplomatic sources. The Italian foreign minister said Rubio told him Thursday that the U.S. is ready for direct negotiations with Iranian counterparts, and a French diplomat also said Rubio had also conveyed the same message to Barrot. The French foreign minister and secretary of state are expected to speak again after the Geneva consultations.",
      "Mr. Trump has expressed frustration in recent weeks that although Iran has come to the negotiating table, its leaders have shown no willingness to actually negotiate. Iran offered no response for two weeks to Witkoff's most recent U.S. proposal and neither declined nor accepted its terms, a U.S. official familiar with the efforts told CBS News. Instead, Iranian leaders issued press statements, but negotiators did not directly engage on the specifics or discuss the terms of the offer. That lack of substantive engagement raised doubts from the Trump administration about whether Iran was engaging in good-faith negotiations or simply running out the clock.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has openly questioned whether Iran's leaders were playing with Mr. Trump and used that uncertainty to justify his unilateral decision to launch military strikes. Multiple U.S. and foreign diplomats indicated that Mr. Trump did not bless the strikes or explicitly tell Netanyahu he should proceed with them. Diplomatic sources acknowledge that Iran's leaders may also be wondering about the degree of coordination between the U.S. and Israel and may also be uncertain about whether the U.S.-initiated diplomacy was a ruse to justify the use of military force that Netanyahu has long advocated.",
      "But one U.S. official maintained that Mr. Trump's interest in diplomacy was genuine, as is his aversion to drawing the U.S. military into a Mideast war \u2014 especially without a clear sense of what would come next, should the Iranian regime collapse.",

A secure suite is set up before he arrives at any out-of-town location, and he also has access to secure communications that would allow him to give an order while en route. While at his Florida golf resort, Mar-a-Lago, he ordered a strike on Syria in 2017, and on an Iranian general in 2020.",

It remains an open question whether bombing Fordo would trigger Iran's leaders to sprint toward creating a bomb or end the program altogether.",

      "A panel of three federal appellate judges has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in each of the state's public school classrooms is unconstitutional.",
      "The ruling on Friday marked a major win for civil liberties groups who say the mandate violates the separation of church and state, and that the poster-sized displays would isolate students \u2014 especially those who are not Christian.",
      "\"Parents and students challenge a statute requiring public schools to permanently display the Ten Commandments in every classroom in Louisiana,\" the court said in its ruling. \"The district court found the statute facially unconstitutional and preliminarily enjoined its enforcement. We AFFIRM.\"",
      "The mandate, which took effect Jan. 1, has been touted by Republicans, including President Trump, and marks one of the latest pushes by conservatives to incorporate religion into classrooms. Backers of the law argue the Ten Commandments belong in classrooms because they are historical and part of the foundation of U.S. law.",
      "The ruling from the largely conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stems from a lawsuit filed last year by parents of Louisiana school children from various religious backgrounds, who said the law violates First Amendment language guaranteeing religious liberty and forbidding government establishment of religion.",
      "\"As noted, if H.B. 71 goes into effect, Students will be subjected to unwelcome displays of the Ten Commandments for the entirety of their public school education,\" the judges wrote. \"There is no opt-out option.\"",
      "Louisiana in June 2024 became the first state to require the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every public school classroom when Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the mandate into law. The law required a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities.",
      "The court's ruling backs an order issued last fall by U.S. District Judge John deGravelles, who declared the mandate unconstitutional and ordered state education officials not to take steps to enforce it and to notify all local school boards in the state of his decision.",
      "Law experts have long said they expect the Louisiana case to make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, testing the conservative court on the issue of religion and government.",
      "In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law violated the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but served a plainly religious purpose.",
      "In 2005, the Supreme Court held that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin.",

      "The policy, McConnell wrote, \"is arbitrary and capricious in its scope and lacks specificity in how the States are to cooperate on immigration enforcement in exchange for Congressionally appropriated transportation dollars \u2014 grant money that the States rely on to keep their residents safely and efficiently on the road, in the sky, and on the rails.\"",
      "The Rhode Island judge added that \"Congress did not authorize or grant authority to the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on federal dollars specifically appropriated for transportation purposes.\"",
      "In a statement, Duffy called the ruling \"judicial activism pure & simple\" and said he will \"continue to fight in the courts.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Thursday extended its block of a judge's order that directed President Trump to return control of California's National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "The unanimous order from a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit is a victory for the president and allows for the continued deployment of roughly 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, where they have been protecting federal property and U.S. immigration agents during enforcement operations.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked a law known as Title 10 to call the Guard into federal service earlier this month in response to demonstrations against immigration raids conducted across Los Angeles. Since then, a total of roughly 4,100 National Guard troops and 700 active-duty U.S. Marines have deployed to Los Angeles.",
      "Newsom, a Democrat, objects to the use of troops in California's largest city and sued the president over his decision to federalize the California Guard. A federal judge, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, concluded last week that Mr. Trump's actions were illegal and exceeded the scope of his authority.",
      "The judge blocked the administration from deploying members of the California National Guard in Los Angeles and directed the president to return control of the troops to Newsom. His decision applied only to Mr. Trump's deployment of the National Guard, and not the Marines.",
      "The Trump administration swiftly appealed the decision and won a temporary stay of Breyer's order from the 9th Circuit. It held a hearing Tuesday to consider a Justice Department request to halt the judge's decision while the case proceeds.",
      "The 9th Circuit judges sided with Mr. Trump on Thursday. They wrote \"it is likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority\" to federalize the National Guard under Title 10, which allows the president to call the Guard into federal service whenever \"there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion,\" or when the president is unable to \"execute the laws\" of the U.S.",
      "The panel of judges \u2014 made up of two Trump appointees and one Biden appointee \u2014 rejected the Trump administration's argument that the courts don't have the power to review whether the president is allowed to call up the Guard. But they said judges need to be \"highly deferential\" to the president if he decides that troops need to be deployed, citing prior rulings.",
      "The court said administration officials \"have presented facts to allow us to conclude that the President had a colorable basis for invoking\" Title 10, noting instances of protesters in Los Angeles interfering with immigration agents.",
      "The 9th Circuit also said the Trump administration did not need to seek Newsom's permission to call up the Guard. The state has pointed to a provision of Title 10 that said orders to federalize the Guard should go \"through the governors\" \u2014 but the court said that \"does not give governors any veto power.\"",
      "In a post to his Truth Social platform, Mr. Trump wrote late Thursday: \"BIG WIN in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on the President's core power to call in the National Guard! The Judges obviously realized that Gavin Newscum is incompetent and ill prepared, but this is much bigger than Gavin, because all over the United States, if our Cities, and our people, need protection, we are the ones to give it to them should State and Local Police be unable, for whatever reason, to get the job done.\"",
      "In his own statement, Newsom expressed disappointment with the ruling, saying: \"The court rightly rejected Trump's claim that he can do whatever he wants with the National Guard and not have to explain himself to a court. The President is not a king and is not above the law. We will press forward with our challenge to President Trump's authoritarian use of U.S. military soldiers against citizens.\"",
      "Trump alleges \"rebellion\" \u2014 but California calls Guard deployment \"extraordinary\"",
      "The Justice Department argued that Mr. Trump properly invoked the authorities laid out in Title 10 when he federalized National Guard troops in response to the protests in Los Angeles. In his June 7 memorandum deploying members of the National Guard, Mr. Trump said the protests constituted a \"form of rebellion\" against the U.S.",
      "The Justice Department further argued that courts had no role to play in reviewing the president's directive, as the law leaves decisions of whether to call forth the National Guard to the president's discretion. Courts, administration lawyers said, should not second-guess the commander-in-chief's military judgments.",
      "During arguments before the 9th Circuit, Brett Shumate, a Justice Department lawyer, warned that Breyer's order, if left intact, risked putting federal judges \"on a collision course with the commander in chief\" and would put \"lives and property at risk.\"",
      "But California officials argued that the Trump administration should have considered more \"modest measures\" to quell the demonstrations in Los Angeles before taking the \"extraordinary step\" of deploying the National Guard.",
      "Sam Harbourt, a deputy solicitor general for the state, warned that the continued presence of troops on California streets would only escalate tensions and the risk of violence. Plus, he said Mr. Trump failed to adhere to the requirements of Title 10 by not consulting with Newsom before calling forth members of the California National Guard.",
      "In his memo, Mr. Trump had directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to effectuate the federalization of the Guard. The secretary then issued memoranda to the adjutant general of the California National Guard to transfer authority over the Guard from the state to the federal government.",
      "It had been 60 years since a president last sent in the National Guard without a request from a state's government, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. President Lyndon B. Johnson deployed the guard to Alabama in 1965 to protect a voting rights march.",
      "Mr. Trump said in his memo that the protests in Los Angeles threatened the security of a federal immigration detention facility in the city, as well as other government property. The demonstrations broke out earlier this month in response to the immigration raids across Los Angeles, conducted as part of Mr. Trump's promise of mass deportations of people in the country illegally. Protests against the president's immigration crackdown have spread to other cities.",
      "Mr. Trump has continued to step up immigration enforcement and announced Sunday on social media that federal immigration authorities should \"do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest mass deportation program in history.\"",

I know this is a federal holiday. I want to thank all of you for showing up to work. We are certainly here. We're working 24/7 right now.\"",

      "A federal judge has blocked President Trump's administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation.",
      "U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston struck down on Friday a policy change that could have stripped universities of tens of millions of dollars in research funding. The universities argued the move threatened critical work in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, semiconductors and other technology fields.",
      "Talwani said the change, announced by the NSF in May, was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law.",
      "An email by the Associated Press on Saturday to the NSF was not immediately returned.",
      "At issue are \"indirect\" costs, expenses such as building maintenance and computer systems that aren't linked directly to a specific project. Currently, the NSF determines each grant recipient's indirect costs individually and is supposed to cover actual expenses.",
      "The Trump administration has dismissed indirect expenses as \"overhead\" and capped them for future awards by the NSF to universities at 15% of the funding for direct research costs.",
      "The University of California, one of the plaintiffs, estimated the change would cost it just under $100 million a year.",
      "Judges have blocked similar caps that the Trump administration placed on grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health.",
      "In a recent interview on \"CBS Mornings Plus,\" Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors \u2014 whose organization sued the Trump administration over federal funding cuts to Columbia University \u2014 said examples of research that has been cut includes a research project that looks at discerning when AI is making fake videos or a project that examines when people start to believe lies that are repeatedly told.",

      "French scientists have discovered a new blood type in a woman from the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, France's blood supply agency announced Friday.",
      "The woman is the only known carrier of a new blood type, dubbed \"Gwada negative,\" the French Blood Establishment (EFS) said. The discovery was made 15 years after researchers received a blood sample from a patient who was undergoing routine tests ahead of a surgery.",
      "\"The EFS has just discovered the 48th blood group system in the world!\" the agency said in a statement on social network LinkedIn, adding that the discovery was officially recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion in early June.",
      "The scientific association had until now recognized 47 blood group systems.",
      "Thierry Peyrard, a medical biologist at the EFS involved in the discovery, told AFP that a \"very unusual\" antibody was first found in the patient in 2011. However, resources at the time did not allow for further research, he added.",
      "Scientists were finally able to unravel the mystery in 2019 thanks to \"high-throughput DNA sequencing\", which highlighted a genetic mutation, Peyrard said.",
      "The patient, who was 54 at the time and lived in Paris, was undergoing routine tests before surgery when the unknown antibody was detected, Peyrard said.",
      "This woman \"is undoubtedly the only known case in the world,\" he said, adding: \"She is the only person in the world who is compatible with herself.\"",
      "The medical biologist said the woman inherited the blood type from her father and mother, who each had the mutated gene.",
      "The name \"Gwada negative\", which refers to the patient's origins and \"sounds good in all languages\", has been popular with the experts, said Peyrard.",
      "The ABO blood group system was first discovered in the early 1900s. Thanks to DNA sequencing, the discovery of new blood groups has accelerated in recent years.",

    "story": [
      "The dramatic explosion of a SpaceX Starship upper stage rocket during a test at the company's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf coast late Wednesday may have been triggered by the rupture of a high-pressure nitrogen tank, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said Thursday.",
      "The sudden explosion, fueled by ignition of methane propellant, created a huge fireball, billowing clouds of smoke and brilliant arcs of flaming debris shooting out like burning chunks of lava in a volcanic eruption.",
      "The blast was reminiscent of the sudden explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during fueling at Cape Canaveral in August 2016 that destroyed an Israeli communications satellite. The Falcon 9 failure was blamed on the rupture of a high-pressure helium tank, known as a composite overwrapped pressure vessel, or COPV.",
      "But the company said there is \"no commonality\" between the Falcon COPVs and those used in the Starship.",
      "\"Preliminary data suggests that a nitrogen COPV in the payload bay failed below its proof pressure,\" Musk said of the latest mishap on his social media platform X. \"If further investigation confirms that this is what happened, it is the first time ever for this design.\"",
      "The Starship upper stage exploded during the final stages of a countdown expected to end with a test firing of the rocket's six methane-powered Raptor engines on a test stand at the Starbase manufacturing facility. A single-engine test firing was carried out earlier this week.",
      "Such \"hotfire\" tests are a normal precursor to actual flights, allowing engineers to verify upgrades and overall performance prior to committing the rocket to launch. A successful test Wednesday would have helped pave the way to launch atop a Super Heavy booster around the end of the month for the program's 10th \"integrated flight test.\"",
      "But the test did not go well. Video from LabPadre, a company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, showed the Starship suddenly exploding in a huge fireball just after 11 p.m. CDT, 10 to 15 minutes before the anticipated engine test firing.",
      "The video showed what appeared to be two major explosions, the first detonation near the nose of the rocket followed a moment later by a second eruption of flame and debris on the left side of the spacecraft. The test stand disappeared in a billowing orange fireball that rose into the overnight sky like a bomb blast.",
      "The Starship was being filled with a full load of liquid oxygen and a partial load of high-energy methane fuel when the detonations occurred. Ninety minutes after the initial blast, fires were still burning at the test site, where cryogenic testing and hotfires are typically conducted.",
      "\"On Wednesday, June 18 at approximately 11 p.m. CT, the Starship preparing for the tenth flight test experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,\" SpaceX said in a statement on X.",

During the third, most recent flight on May 27, the Starship reached its planned trajectory, but then spun out of control and broke up when it fell back into the atmosphere.",
      "NASA is counting on the giant rocket to launch a Starship variant to the moon that will carry astronauts to a landing near the lunar south pole in the next two or three years.",
      "It will not be easy.",
      "To get the Human Landing System \u2014 HLS \u2014 Starship variant to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships to Earth orbit in rapid-fire fashion where they will have to autonomously dock, transfer excess propellants to a \"depot\" Starship, undock, and return to Earth.",
      "The HLS then would rendezvous and dock with the depot, reload its tanks and head for the moon to await the arrival of the Artemis astronauts aboard a Lockheed Martin-built Orion crew capsule.",
      "SpaceX has not said how many refueling flights might be necessary. But given that both the lander and tanker Starships will use up most of their propellant just getting into orbit, some independent observers estimate as many as 10 to 20 launches will be needed to gas up the lander for the flight to the moon.",
      "NASA officials have said the number likely will be in the \"high teens.\"",
      "It's not known what might happen if one of those refueling flights suffers a catastrophic failure, but it's difficult to imagine launches would continue without first finding out what went wrong and fixing it.",
      "Along with mastering autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid oxygen and hydrogen while in space \u2014 a task never attempted at this scale \u2014 SpaceX will need to develop a reliable system to keep those propellants cold enough in the glare of the sun to minimize the amount that will boil off and be vented out to space.",

      "The need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships, the requirement to perfect the autonomous transfer of cryogenic propellants in space and new technology to keep the liquid methane and oxygen from warming and wasting away add up to a complex mission architecture with little margin for error under the current schedule.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/plastic-bag-bans-fees-curbs-litter-study-says/",
    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 15:57:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers conducted the first systematic review of policies around the U.S. to limit plastic bag use.",
    "story": [
      "State and local policies to regulate the use of plastic bags have significantly reduced how many of them are found littered along U.S. shorelines \u2014 potentially cutting that type of waste in half in certain places, a new study published Thursday in the journal Science found.",
      "More than 600 bag policies, along with records from more than 45,000 shoreline cleanups between 2017 and 2023, were reviewed by researchers to see whether implementing bans or fees on plastic bags led to fewer discarded bags found near coastlines, rivers and lakes \u2013 and if they did, to what extent.",
      "Co-authors environmental economist Anna Papp and Kimberly Oremus, a marine science and policy professor at the University of Delaware, found that the number of plastic bags collected as shoreline litter in places with bag policies dropped by at least 25%, and up to 47% over six years than in locations that did not have regulations.",
      "\"When we found the database that had information on different shoreline cleanups, we realized we could look at the composition of litter before and after a policy to see what effect it had,\" Oremus said in a statement. \"And then we could compare that to places that never got a plastic bag policy.\"",
      "These results bring fresh insights to an issue that gained prominence over the last decade or so, as awareness spread about the harms of plastic pollution and its threats to marine environments. Oremus said it's the first attempt to comprehensively review the effectiveness of plastic bag policies on shoreline litter, using a database of global shoreline cleanup initiatives from the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy.",
      "Since 2018, more than 100 countries around the world have implemented some form of policy to either ban or limit the use of plastic bags, according\u00a0to a report by the United Nations Environment Program. The U.S. doesn't have a federal bag policy, but individual towns, cities and states have policies of their own.",
      "Some states, like New York, have completely banned retailers from distributing plastic bags. Others, like Washington, passed partial bans in recent years, where thinner plastic bags deemed \"single use\" are prohibited, but thicker plastic bags are not. Oremus and Papp noted in the study that, although those thicker bags are usually considered \"reusable\" under partial bans, \"there is evidence that some consumers still treat them as single-use.\"",
      "In multiple states without bans, local jurisdictions such as counties have taken steps to regulate plastic bag use. For example, Arlington County, Virginia, requires stores to collect a fee from customers who purchase plastic bags, at 5 cents per bag. But 17 states prevent plastic bag regulations even at the county level, with statewide \"preemption\" laws in place to ensure the distribution of these bags isn't regulated at all.",
      "During the study period, plastic bag litter was collected less often in shoreline cleanups that took place in areas where some form of regulation existed to curb their distribution and use, the authors said.",
      "\"Our findings make clear that plastic bag policies have been broadly effective in limiting\u2014but not eliminating\u2014shoreline plastic bag debris in jurisdictions where it was previously prevalent,\" Oremus and Papp wrote in the study. They also found evidence that suggests fees on plastic bags are more effective at limiting shoreline litter than bans, especially partial bans, but understanding why would require more research.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-ceo-generative-ai-corporate-workforce/",
    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 17:28:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, said he expects the company to reduce its workforce over the next few years as it rolls out more generative AI and agents.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon's CEO envisions an \"agentic future\" in which AI robots, or agents, replace humans working in the company's offices.",
      "In a\u00a0memo\u00a0to employees made public by Amazon on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy said he expects the company to reduce its corporate workforce in as soon as the next few years, as it leans more heavily on generative AI tools to help fulfill workplace duties.",
      "\"As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,\" Jassy stated. \"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"",
      "Jassy added that this move toward AI would eventually \"reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\" With approximately 1.5 million employees worldwide, the e-commerce giant is the second largest private employer in the United States.",
      "Reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson deferred to the original memo.",
      "Amazon shares dipped slightly on Tuesday, down 0.4% as of 3:45 p.m. EST.",
      "Amazon investing \"quite expansively\" in AI",
      "Amazon is \"investing quite expansively\" in generative AI technology, according to Jassy, adding that \"the progress we are making is evident.\"",
      "\"Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming, and coming fast,\" the CEO stated in the memo.",
      "Amazon ramped up its participation in the generative AI arms race with the release of the Amazon Echo smart speaker in 2014, its first product to include its virtual assistant Alexa. This February, the company\u00a0announced it was unveiling Alexa+, a new version of the AI-powered voice assistant that's \"more conversational, smarter, personalized.\"",
      "AI features have since been incorporated across Amazon's e-commerce websites through tools like \"Buy for Me\" which allow customers to ask a shopping assistant to buy an item for them and \"Recommended Size\" which predicts your clothing size based on past purchases. Amazon's\u00a0AI shopping assistant is used by tens of millions of customers, according to Jassy.",
      "AI replaces creativity for some",
      "In the Tuesday memo, Jassy sketched out a future in which AI agents are used to conduct tedious tasks, freeing up human workers to take on more creative roles.",
      "\"Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point,\" Jassy said. \"We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones.\"",
      "However, this hard-pivot into AI has generated negative feedback from some white-collar employees at the company. Amazon software engineers interviewed recently by the New York Times\u00a0describe\u00a0an intensified work environment in which they are pushed to use AI to increase productivity and meet higher output goals, making their jobs \"more routine, less thoughtful and, crucially, much faster paced.\"",
      "All told, Amazon currently has 1,000 generative AI services and applications either in the works or already built, a \"small fraction\" of what the company ultimately plans to build, said Jassy.",
      "Jassy's pledge to invest in AI comes after the company announced in May that it would cut 100 jobs in its devices and services\u00a0unit, an Amazon spokesperson confirmed.",

    "summary": "Jane Dorotik was convicted of her husband's murder but says some so-called bloodstains presented at trial were never tested and others were not blood at all.",
    "story": [
      "\"I thought truth and justice was at the front of everything. And it certainly has not been in my case,\" Jane Dorotik told \"48 Hours\" correspondent Erin Moriarty in an encore of \u00a0\"The Troubled Case Against Jane Dorotik,\"\u00a0now streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Dorotik reported her husband Bob missing the evening of Sunday, Feb. 13, 2000. She told the San Diego County Sheriff's Department she had last seen him that afternoon, when he said he was going out for a jog. Bob Dorotik's body was found early the next morning on the side of the road several miles from their Valley Center, California, home. He had been bludgeoned in the head and strangled.",
      "\"It was obvious to me that it was a homicide,\" sheriff's detective Rick Empson told Moriarty.",
      "Investigators quickly determined Bob Dorotik wasn't killed where his body was found, because there wasn't enough blood there. When they searched the Dorotiks' home, they found spots of blood all over the bedroom. Jane Dorotik explained that Bob had had a nosebleed recently, and they had dogs who had bled. But authorities dismissed her explanations.",
      "\"There was no question in our mind that this assault occurred in the master bedroom,\" Empson said.",
      "Three days after Bob Dorotik's body was found, Jane Dorotik, 53, was arrested for his murder. She later posted bail, and though she was under a cloud of suspicion, she invited \"48 Hours\" into her home in 2000.",
      "\"It felt like a nightmare, and I kept saying 'when am I gonna wake up?'\" she told Moriarty.",
      "When the case went to trial in May 2001, prosecutor Bonnie Howard-Regan described the 20 locations where investigators found blood.",
      "\"There was blood on the comforter. There was blood on the pillow sham \u2026on the wall behind the bed \u2026 on the ceiling above the bed,\" she said.",
      "Howard-Regan also told jurors there was a large blood stain on the underside of the mattress. The prosecution theorized that Jane Dorotik hit her husband with an object in the bedroom and strangled him. She then dressed him in his jogging suit, put him in their truck and dumped him along the side of the road where his body was found.",
      "\"The evidence will show that all this blood that has been described to you, the observations made in this bedroom, that it was all sent out for DNA analysis, and it all came back Bob Dorotik's blood,\" Howard-Regan told the jury.",
      "The jury deliberated for four days before finding Jane Dorotik guilty. She was sentenced to 25 years to life.",
      "\"I just, I can't see my way clear to a life in prison. I just can't see it,\" she told Moriarty in an interview in jail.",
      "Dorotik spent years behind bars asking for a new examination of the evidence. She argued authorities focused on her from the beginning of the investigation and failed to follow other leads. But motion after motion was denied.",
      "By 2016, she began working with a team from Loyola Project for the Innocent. They reviewed the bedroom blood evidence the prosecutor told the jury was fully tested and was Bob Dorotik's. According to the appeal, not every single spot in the bedroom believed to be blood, was tested. Instead, representative samples were tested.",
      "The appellate team says that several blood-like stains on items including a pillow sham, the nightstand and a lampshade turned out not to be blood. And some stains on the bedspread, which were described at trial as Bob Dorotik's blood, were never tested at all.",
      "\"If you just look at all of the pieces of evidence that Loyola was able to absolutely take apart \u2026 and yet we know what was told to the jury in the original conviction\u2026 How can that happen?\" Jane Dorotik told Moriarty when they spoke again two decades after her conviction.",
      "The state stood by its original investigation, maintaining the bedroom was the murder scene and that the evidence still pointed to Jane Dorotik as the killer. It also claimed the defense arguments were \"largely derived from speculation and misstatements of fact.\"",
      "In April 2020, Jane Dorotik was temporarily released from prison due to COVID health concerns. The San Diego County District Attorney's Office recommended her conviction be overturned due to new evidence in the case, but in October 2020, it made the decision to retry her.",
      "The judge ruled that the new trial could go ahead, but that some key evidence presented in her original trial would not be admissible. In May 2022, just as jury selection was about to begin, the prosecutors dropped the charges.",
      "\"We no longer feel that the evidence is sufficient to show proof beyond a reasonable doubt and convince 12 members of the jury,\" said Deputy District Attorney Christopher Campbell.",
      "At a news conference outside the courthouse, Jane Dorotik expressed her relief.",
      "\"It just is overwhelming to realize that now I can determine my own future. It's something I've prayed for and hoped for,\" she said.",

    "summary": "The Pelley family murders tore two friends apart for 20 years; when they finally reconnected, they discovered a funny coincidence",
    "story": [
      "For 20 years, Stephanie Fagan grieved not only for the loss of the murdered Pelley family, but also for the loss of her friend Jessica Pelley.",
      "\"After the Pelleys were gone and after they were buried, there was no more laughing. There was no more running. There was no more playing. There was just no more of anything,\" Stephanie recalled.",
      "On April 30, 1989, police responded to a quadruple murder in a Lakeville, Indiana home. Reverend Robert Pelley, his wife Dawn, and Dawn's daughters Janel and Jolene were shot at close range with a shotgun. Parishioners discovered the four bodies when Bob Pelley and his family did not show up for services that morning. Stephanie Fagan was at the church when the Pelley's were found murdered next door, and ever since then her life was never the same.",
      "Jessica then 9, was away at a sleepover the night of the murders and survived. But not long after the murders, she says she went to live in Michigan with relatives who cut off all contact from friends in Indiana, including Stephanie.",
      "\"They just wanted me to forget and move on,\" Jessi said. \"It's like they wanted me to be in this bubble to protect me, but it wasn't really protecting me. It was isolating me and hurting me.\"",
      "It was also painful for Fagan, who said she never stopped trying to contact her friend. \"I had sent letters and I was told not to send any more letters. I just would sit at night and think to myself, I can't imagine what she's going through \u2026 I couldn't figure out why they wouldn't just let me you know keep in contact with her.\"",
      "As soon as she got her driver's license, Fagan would go to the cemetery to clean the Pelley family gravestones, scrubbing them with a bucket of water and a toothbrush.",
      "\"I would just sit and talk to them,\" Fagan said. \"It was a huge way to cope with the loss.\" Fagan always hoped that one day she might find Jessica at the cemetery during a visit. \"Every time I came out, I was always thinking, 'I'll run into her someday, if I just come out here enough she'll be here.'\"",
      "Jessica says she eventually ran away from her relative's home and entered foster care, never knowing her old friend was searching for her. \"I did not realize anybody was out there looking for me,\" she recalled. \"I pretty much thought everybody forgot about me and had moved on with their lives because it wasn't their family that they lost.\"",
      "Jessica's older stepbrother Jeff Pelley was the main suspect for the murder of his family for years. Investigators believed Jeff killed his father in an argument over prom and then had to get rid of the surviving witnesses. But with no forensic evidence, no confession, no weapon and no eyewitnesses implicating Jeff, prosecutors declined to charge him for the murders until 2002, 13 years after the murders.",
      "In 2006, when Jeff Pelley went to trial for the murders, Fagan made an extra effort to clean the graves and to place plastic orchids at the site.",
      "Because both women were witnesses at the trial, Fagan was not allowed to approach Jessi. The two women, however, just missed each other at the cemetery. Jessi said she visited her family's graves for the first time during that trial. \"There were two baskets of fake flowers, one on Janel's grave and one on Jolene's, and I normally would not do this, but I took them home as, like, keepsakes.\"",
      "A few days later, after a jury convicted Jeff Pelley for the murders of Bob, Dawn Janel and Jolene Pelley, Fagan went to the cemetery again, only to find some of the flowers missing. \"Bob and Dawn's was there, but Janel and Jolene's were gone. I was pretty mad. I was pretty mad,\" she recalled.",
      "For Fagan, it was a small mystery connected to a larger tragedy, the case of the stolen flowers.",
      "Then, in 2009, the women finally reunited after 20 years when, through some Facebook sleuthing, Fagan discovered Jessica Pelley was now Jessi Toronjo. Years earlier, Jessica\u00a0 decided to change her name to \"Jessi,\" and when she married, her last name became Toronjo. \u00a0Fagan said she sent Jessi a message immediately. \"I just told her I'd been looking for you my whole life. And I told her I took care of your parent's graves, and I've thought about you, and I've talked to you in my sleep. I've talked to you when I wake up.\"",
      "When she opened the message, Jessi was stunned. \"I'm bawling as I'm reading it and just crying hysterically. And the feeling I got was someone reached out to me and has been looking for me this whole time and wants to get to know me again and wants to be around me and remembers everything.\"",
      "Fagan and Jessi became fast friends, and now call each other \"sister.\" Later in 2009, when Fagan made her first trip north to Jessi's Michigan home, another mystery was solved. \u00a0Fagan said she walked in the door, \"and on each side of her TV were these beautiful flowers that looked extremely familiar.\" They were the same flowers Fagan bought three years earlier during the trial.",
      "Jessi says the two women still laugh at the coincidence, the missed connection, and the lifelong friendship they now have after 20 years apart. \"She thought someone had just stolen them. And I said, 'Well, someone did. It was me.'\""

      "\"It's been torturous in many ways,\" explained Jane. \"I suppose many moments when I thought, \"How do I keep going?'",
      "WHO KILLED BOB DOROTIK?",
      "When \"48 Hours\" first met Jane Dorotik in 2000, the life she had once found so serene in the foothills outside of San Diego \u2014 a life she had shared with her husband Bob \u2014 had taken an unimaginable turn.",
      "Jane Dorotik: How can this be? How can this happen? Surely I'll wake up and it's a dream.",

      "Bob spent most of his career as an engineer. Jane worked as a nurse, and later, as an executive in the health care industry. The couple raised three children, Alex, Claire and Nick.",
      "Jane Dorotik: The family has always been incredibly important to both of us.",
      "Also important to Jane, were their horses. While Jane's passion was breeding and riding, Bob was an avid jogger. And that, says Jane, is the last image she has of her husband.",
      "Jane Dorotik: Bob was sitting, actually, in this chair, facing the TV.",
      "Although Jane was under suspicion, she allowed \"48 Hours\" into her home.",
      "Jane Dorotik: He said he was going out for a jog, and he was actually \u2014 had his jogging suit on, was tying his shoes. \u2026 That was the last I talked to him.",
      "It was around 1 p.m. on Feb. 13, 2000, when Jane says Bob left to go for that run. As hours passed without any word from him, Jane says she grew concerned.",
      "Jane Dorotik: It was beginning to get dark \u2026 I \u2014 decided to go out and look.",
      "Jane says she searched for Bob, driving up and down the hill where he sometimes ran. By 7:45 p.m., Jane's concern turned to fear.",
      "Jane Dorotik: I said, \"Enough. This is enough. Something is wrong.\" \u2026 And that's when I made the call to the Sheriff's Department.",
      "Deputy James Blackmon: My first \u2026 thought that night was maybe this man had a heart attack and \u2026 fell down the embankment along\u00a0 Lake Wohlford Road .",
      "As Deputy James Blackmon, and others from the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, searched for Bob, concerned friends and family gathered at the Dorotik house.",
      "Claire Dorotik: The minute I saw my mom's face, I knew right away something terrible had happened.",
      "The Dorotik's daughter, Claire, 24 at the time, had spent the weekend visiting her aunt and returned home to a distraught Jane.",
      "Claire Dorotik: She was freaked out, she was scared, she was nervous, she was crying.",
      "Jane Dorotik: It was a horrifying feeling that got more and more horrifying when he wasn't found.",
      "And then, in the predawn hours of Feb. 14, Deputy Blackmon turned into a driveway, several miles from the Dorotik home, and noticed a body off the road.",
      "Deputy Blackmon (2001): At this point, I could see the shirt, the \u2026 pants \u2026 And he was laying on his back.",

      "Jane Dorotik: I do know when Bob had a nosebleed he made a comment about getting\u00a0 some blood on the mattress.",
      "Jane says there was a logical explanation for some of the other blood, too \u2014 they had dogs who were injured and had bled.",
      "Jane Dorotik: This little dog had an abscess on her cheek that was openly draining at the time and little drops of blood we'd find when she sat on the couch. \u2026 The carpet pieces are what the detectives removed, feeling that there was blood on the carpet.",

      "Erin Moriarty: On the ceiling, on the window, on the walls?",
      "Jane Dorotik: No.",

      "Jane Dorotik: You know, I guess I've been through that one a billion times. I don't know.",
      "But investigators thought they knew, believing the motive was money, and escaping a troubled marriage. Jane was the main breadwinner, and they learned the couple had split up for a year in 1997.",
      "Jane Dorotik:\u00a0 I don't make any apologies for the fact that we had rough times. But that doesn't change the fact that we loved each other.",
      "And that love, says Jane, is why they reconciled. They had been back living together as a couple for a year-and-a-half before Bob was killed.",
      "Jane Dorotik: I really think the separation caused us to really regroup and think about what was important.",
      "Claire Dorotik: They were getting along better than they ever had in the past. I was living there. I can tell you that.",
      "But law enforcement was unmoved, and three days after Bob Dorotik's body was found, Jane was arrested, and charged with first-degree murder.",

      "Released on bail, Jane started preparing her defense, hiring attorney Kerry Steigerwalt.",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt: She knows she's placed as the killer and she's not the killer.",
      "And at trial, Jane's attorney would present a surprise suspect, who he felt was responsible for Bob Dorotik's murder.",
      "THE TRIAL OF JANE DOROTIK",
      "Jane Dorotik: I know that I am innocent, but I don't have any more faith in the legal system. I believe I could be convicted for something that I didn't do. And that's very scary.",
      "While Jane worried about her outcome at trial, Claire Dorotik was much more confident about her mother's chances.",
      "Claire Dorotik: My mom could not have done this crime. She didn't have the motive, and she didn't have the opportunity.",
      "But when the case went to trial in 2001, a year after the murder, prosecutor Bonnie Howard\u2013Regan described the Dorotik's marriage as seriously troubled and told jurors that Jane didn't want to pay Bob alimony in a divorce.",
      "Bonnie Howard\u2013Regan (in court): Bob Dorotik never went jogging. And he never left that residence alive.",
      "According to the state, Bob had actually been killed Saturday night, nearly a day before Jane reported him missing. The autopsy performed, by Dr. Christopher Swalwell, showed undigested food consistent with what Jane said they had for dinner that night.",
      "Bonnie Howard\u2013Regan (in court): Are you able to give us an estimate of how long after Mr. Dorotik ate, how long after that, he \u2014 he was killed?",
      "Dr. Christopher Swalwell: Yes. It was very shortly after he ate. \u2026I would say it was probably within a couple of hours.",
      "And he wasn't killed on the side of the road, the prosecutor said. There wasn't enough blood there. Instead, she said Bob's blood was all over the bedroom. Lead detective Rick Empson testified he had asked Jane to explain that.",
      "Det. Rick Empson (in court): She indicated initially that she had a dog that \u2014 had been bleeding, and then indicated that approximately a week prior, Bob had a bloody nose over in the corner by the stove, and that Bob had cleaned it up.",
      "There was evidence someone cleaned the bedroom. The carpet next to the potbelly stove and tiled floor was wet and had blood stains underneath.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Did any of the blood from his nosebleed get on the carpet?",
      "Jane Dorotik: Uh huh (affirms).",
      "Erin Moriarty: Do you know where?",
      "Jane Dorotik: Uh huh. Right next to the tile. 'Cause I \u2014 I'm the one that helped him clean it.",
      "Authorities dismissed Jane's explanations. Their theory was that Jane hit Bob in the head in their bedroom with an object while he was lying in bed, although they never identified or found any weapon. Charles Merritt, a criminalist and bloodstain pattern analyst for the San Diego County Sheriff's Crime Lab, recounted 20 locations where he saw blood stains.",
      "Charles Merritt (in court): On one of the pillows \u2026 on a lamp \u2026 this particular nightstand. \u2026 on the potbelly stove \u2026 on the ceiling itself. \u2026 and then on the underside of the mattress.",
      "The jury was also shown this evidence of tire tracks found near Bob's body. The state's expert Anthony DeMaria said he matched the three different types of tires on Dorotik's truck",
      "Bonnie Howard\u2013Regan (in court): Are you saying the measurements taken at the scene were equal to the measurements \u2026 taken off the actual vehicle?",
      "Anthony DeMaria: Yes.",
      "The most telling evidence connecting Jane to the murder, according to the prosecutor, was that syringe found in the bathroom. It had traces of a horse tranquilizer inside. And even though there was no evidence that Bob had been injected with anything, it had Bob's blood and a bloody fingerprint on it.",
      "Bonnie Howard\u2013Regan (in court): The evidence will show that the fingerprint on this syringe was Jane Dorotik's.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Can you explain that?",
      "Jane Dorotik: I can't really explain it, other than \u2013 I know that I helped Bob clean up a nosebleed. And if that's the same time when I took the syringes and threw them in the trash \u2026 and there was some blood on my hand, that could have \u2014 made that happen.",
      "But perhaps the most powerful witnesses were the Dorotiks' two sons, Nick and Alex. They both testified against their mother.",
      "Bonnie Howard\u2013Regan (in court): Did you say anything specifically about the syringe?",
      "Nick Dorotik: Well, I asked her \u2014 how it got there and what it was doing there.",
      "Bonnie Howard-Regan: And what was your mother's response?",
      "Nick Dorotik: She said that \u2014 her biggest fear in all this was that the \u2014 that us family members would start questioning her.",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt (in court): Your mother always settled things logically, tried to?",
      "Alex Dorotik: No.",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt: \u2014 you wouldn't agree with that statement?",
      "Alex Dorotik: Nope. \u2026It would be my mom basically saying, \"This is what you have to accept.\"\u00a0 And then my dad would either accept it or there would be threats of divorce or something. That's what I remember from growing up.",
      "Jane's attorneys Kerry Steigerwalt and Cole Casey admitted it was a big blow.   Erin Moriarty: Would you say that's been the most damaging testimony?",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt: Yeah.",
      "Cole Casey: It's not what they said. It's the fact that they were there testifying for the prosecution.",
      "When it came time for the defense to present its case, Steigerwalt actually agreed with the prosecution on a major point \u2014 that the murder took place in the bedroom. But he had a jaw-dropping alternative suspect: Claire Dorotik.",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt (in court): Ladies and gentlemen, Claire hated her father.",
      "He claimed Claire, an avid horsewoman, hated her father because he threatened to sell the animals she loved \u2013 and suggested that she was capable of murder.",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt (in court): That's what Claire is. A hot-tempered, explosive individual.",
      "It was a risky strategy that Jane reluctantly agreed to.",
      "Jane Dorotik: All I can do is trust what Kerry says is the best way to go.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Are you at all concerned that the jury will wonder about a woman who would allow herself to be defended by pointing the finger at her daughter? Could that work against the two of you?",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt: It may. I don't know. \u2026 \u00a0I think it is the most viable defense. And I think it's supported by the best evidence.",
      "Steigerwalt insisted Jane wasn't physically able to commit the murder, but Claire was.",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt (in court): She runs marathons. And she's a personal trainer. She is as fit a woman as you will see at the age of 24.",
      "But remember, Claire and her aunt said they were together, two hours away.",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt (in court): They called the aunt ...That's the extent of the investigation on the alibi of Claire Dorotik. \u2026 That alibi is nonsense.",
      "The jurors never heard from Claire, who took the fifth, or Jane, who chose not to testify. But they did hear from a woman who said she thought she saw Bob the day he disappeared \u2013 sitting between two men in a black pickup truck not far from where his body was found.",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt (in court): Who killed Robert Dorotik? \u2026 Was it Claire Dorotik? \u2026 Or ladies and gentlemen, was it someone else?",
      "In his closing argument, Steigerwalt accused investigators of dismissing witnesses like that woman and focusing only on Jane.",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt (in court): The prosecution had focused on one person and that's not the way to conduct an investigation. That's not the way to run a case.",
      "Bonnie Howard-Regan (in court): Jane Dorotik and Bob Dorotik were the only two people in that home that weekend.",
      "Bonnie Howard-Regan said there is no need to investigate further when you have sufficient evidence.",
      "Bonnie Howard-Regan\u00a0(in court): They searched that bedroom and they saw all the blood and they knew that was the crime scene \u2026 What more investigation do they need to do?",
      "It took the jury four days to return a verdict.",
      "COURT CLERK: We the jury in the above titled cause find the defendant Jane Marguerite Dorotik guilty of the crime of murder in the first degree in violation of penal code \u2026\"",
      "Erin Moriarty: Did Jane Dorotik get a fair trial?",
      "Matthew Troiano: No. No. \u2026 Because fairness means that you're presenting things accurately, and it \u2014 it appears like it was not done accurately.",
      "JANE DOROTIK ADVOCATES FOR HER INNOCENCE",
      "Jane Dorotik (jail interview with Erin Moriarty): It almost didn't register for a minute. It's like \"No, this can't be.\" \u2026 I was so certain that I was walking out \u2026 I thought they would see the truth.",
      "Jane Dorotik never imagined she'd be found guilty.",
      "Jane Dorotik (jail interview): It's hard to keep going (crying).",
      "At the time of her conviction for the murder of her husband, she was 54 years old and sentenced to 25 years-to-life.",
      "Jane Dorotik (jail interview): I mean, I just, I can't see my way clear to a life in prison. I just can't see it.",
      "Determined to prove the jury got it wrong, Jane became her own advocate, working on her case for many years. \"48 Hours\" spoke with Jane again two decades later about her efforts.",
      "Jane Dorotik: All through the prison \u2014 my prison journey, I continued to write to \u2026 all\u00a0 innocence projects I could think of, asking for help. \u2026 At the same time, realized \u2026 that I had to fight for myself.",
      "Jane filed motions from prison citing such issues as insufficient evidence and ineffective assistance of counsel.",
      "Jane Dorotik: I would describe my defense as limited and inadequate.",
      "In her filings, Jane indicated that she wanted to testify at her trial but had left that decision up to her attorney. And that had she testified, she could have explained Bob's stomach contents \u2014 stating that he sometimes ate leftovers from the previous night. She also described her attorney's alternate suspect theory, pointing to her daughter Claire as the killer, as absurd.",
      "Erin Moriarty: \u00a0Do you believe that your daughter Claire had anything to do with the death of her dad?",
      "Jane Dorotik: Absolutely unequivocally not. And my defense attorney, everybody knew she was away for that weekend.",
      "In regard to that defense strategy, Claire, later wrote in a book, \"how could I be angry at my mother, when all I did was worry about her.\" Jane's lawyer, whom \"48 Hours\" interviewed at the time of her trial, did not speak with us again.",
      "Jane Dorotik: That was the worst strategy of my life ever\u2026 I said to my attorney, \"If anything happens to Claire, I'm gonna stand up and say I did it.\"",
      "In her filings, Jane also questioned why her defense attorney accepted the \"bad forensics \"pointing to the bedroom as the murder scene, rather than presenting other scenarios as to where and how Bob Dorotik could have been murdered.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Did the defense too easily accept the bedroom as a crime scene?",
      "Matthew Troiano: That is a very legitimate argument.",
      "CBS News consultant Matthew Troiano, a former prosecutor and current defense attorney, was not involved in the Dorotik case, but he reviewed some of the court documents at \"48 Hours\"' request.",
      "Matthew Troiano: The defense made a strategic decision. \u2026 Are we going to dispute that a crime happened in this location or \u2026 are we essentially gonna concede that it happened there and then come up with a different narrative of how it happened there? And they chose the latter.",
      "And that decision, Troiano says, likely led the defense to point the finger at Claire for the murder.",
      "Matthew Troiano: They had to blame somebody else for something that happened in a specific location. \u2026 And they, at least, as it relates to the daughter, you know, went back to her, having some disagreement with her father about something. \u2026 And it was \u2013 it was a risk.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Have you ever seen that kind of defense?",
      "Matthew Troiano: You don't \u2014 you don't see it. I mean, it could happen when there are clear facts and evidence to support it, but when there are none \u2026 that's, you know, that's a showstopper.",
      "And, in fact, Claire was never charged with any wrongdoing in connection to her father's murder. The defense accepting the bedroom as the murder scene is especially puzzling to Troiano, as there were reports from several eyewitnesses who said they saw a man jogging that day \u2014 accounts consistent with Jane's depiction of events, not the prosecution's.",
      "Matthew Troiano: That's critical, critical evidence.",
      "Jane Dorotik: And all of that was really not pursued. \u2026 And \u2026 I didn't know of all the witnesses. \u2026 Had there been a thorough investigation initially, all of that would have come out.",
      "Through the years, in filings, Jane raised problems with the entire case against her, arguing that authorities focused on her from the very beginning of the investigation and failed to follow other investigative leads. But motion after motion was denied. And regarding Jane's ineffective counsel claims,\u00a0 the judge rejected them all, ruling that her attorney's performance was not deficient, and that his actions had not affected the outcome of the case.",
      "Jane Dorotik: There were many moments where I doubted when is this ever going to turn around. Many, many moments.",
      "Still, Jane didn't give up. She continued looking for new evidence to clear her, especially as DNA testing became more advanced. In 2012, she filed a petition for DNA testing of that rope found around Bob's neck, and other items, like Bob's fingernail clippings, which had been saved, but never tested. And in 2015, the motion was granted.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Is that unusual that she finally even got testing based on her filing motions on her own?",
      "Matthew Troiano: Yes, it's \u2014 it's very atypical.",
      "It was at this time that Jane finally got the attention of a wrongful conviction group, Loyola Law School's Project for the Innocent.",
      "Jane Dorotik: I get this wonderful letter from Loyola saying, \"You've contacted us and we're interested in your case. \u2026 And after that, Loyola took over. Got the testing done.",
      "And what that testing revealed, as well as a fresh examination of other evidence, would change the course of the case.",
      "Matt Troiano: That's really what flips the script to say that there's more here. This is more than just an inadequate investigation. There is a different narrative that's running through these test results. \u2026 there is evidence that another person could be involved.",
      "A NEW LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE",
      "Matthew Troiano: When you talk about the evidence in this case \u2026 the subsequent testing reveals that you might have a different explanation for things \u2026 that really shed light on what may have happened here.",
      "Jane Dorotik spent years behind bars asking for a new examination of the evidence used to convict her of her husband Bob's murder. Now, working with a team from Loyola Project for the Innocent, the court allowed them to have new DNA testing on items such as the rope found around Bob Dorotik's neck, his fingernails, and clothing. Appeal filings state that foreign male DNA was found on several items.",
      "Jane Dorotik: The results of that \u2014 none of my DNA anywhere.",
      "Matthew Troiano: There is physical evidence \u2026 from fingernail clippings \u2026 from a rope \u2026 from his clothing, that is foreign to Jane.",
      "The team from Loyola Project for the Innocent declined to be interviewed. We asked Nathan Lents, a Professor of Biology and Forensic Science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, who was not involved in the case, to review court documents about new evidence, such as the DNA on the rope.",
      "Nathan Lents: While they didn't get a profile that would be good enough to search a database or even match to a suspect, they did get enough DNA that is not attributable to Bob or to Jane.",
      "But while Jane and her team believed the results pointed to her innocence, the state came to a different conclusion, stating in filings: \"\u2026 the DNA obtained was too low level to make any reliable interpretation.\"",
      "Lents agrees the DNA levels were low, but he believes it was enough to exclude Jane, and that the absence of Jane's DNA on the rope, as well as under Bob's fingernails or on his clothing, is significant.",
      "Nathan Lents: With the theory of crime that they presented, you would expect a lot of Jane's DNA on Bob \u2026 and if \u2014 if she had moved his body, there's a lot of DNA transfer that might have taken place there \u2014 that wasn't found.",
      "The appellate team also reviewed the bedroom blood evidence the prosecutor told the jury was fully tested and was Bob's.",
      "Prosecutor Bonnie Howard-Regan (in court): \u00a0Now, the evidence will show that all this blood that has been described to you, the observations made in this bedroom, that it was all sent out for DNA analysis, and it all came back Bob Dorotik's blood.",
      "But according to the appeal, not every single spot in the bedroom believed to be blood was tested. Instead, representative samples were tested.",
      "Nathan Lents: There were cases where just simply one swab with a control was taken and it was representative, uh, of a variety of spots. That's not good practice \u2026 it just invites misinterpretation.",
      "Matthew Troiano:\u00a0 When you're talking about blood spatter and you're trying to analyze how it got there \u2026 you need to do a fairly comprehensive test to be able to draw the conclusion that you're drawing.",
      "Erin Moriarty:\u00a0 But I think the prosecution could argue \u2026 You can't afford to test, can you, every single drop that looks like blood?",
      "Matthew Troiano: Right. \u2026 But when you say we did everything \u2026 and that's not accurate, that's where the problem lies.",
      "In fact, the appellate team says that several blood-like stains on items including a pillow sham, the nightstand, a lampshade, turned out not to be blood.",
      "And there were those stains on the bedspread, which criminalist Charles Merritt pointed to at trial and described as Bob's\u00a0 blood. Jane's lawyers learned those particular spots were never tested at all, and due to improper storage,\u00a0 the bedspread could not be tested again.",
      "The handling of the evidence, over the course of the entire investigation, was also raised on appeal.",
      "Nathan Lents (looking at photo with Moriarty): This one is hard to even look at. Um, you have an investigator who definitely should know better, um, handling murder evidence with his bare hands. \u2026 In addition to obviously depositing his own DNA all around this crime scene, he's also risking transferring evidence from among the various spots that he's collecting.",
      "And there's that syringe, with Bob's blood and Jane's fingerprint, found in the bathroom garbage \u2014 something the appellate team, and Lents, thought could be explained.",
      "Nathan Lents: And if you throw that syringe in the garbage can \u2026 Bob throws a \u2014 a bloody Kleenex in that garbage can, they could transfer. Transfer of DNA from one object to another in a trash can is not unexpected.",
      "Lents feels the fact that syringe was even found in the garbage, points fingers away from Jane.",
      "Nathan Lents: If you're cleaning up after a murder, you won't leave the bloody syringe in the waste bucket \u2014 basket.",
      "But the state stood by its original investigation, maintaining the bedroom was the murder scene, stating that the evidence still points to Jane Dorotik as the killer, and that the defense \"arguments are largely derived from speculation and misstatements of fact.\"",
      "Jane's appellate team, though, maintains the bedroom did not even look like a crime scene, something Lents also believes.",
      "Nathan Lents: There is not a consistent pattern to the evidence that indicates a violent bludgeoning that took place in that bedroom. \u2026 if Bob were alive today and investigators had walked in his room, no one would say, oh, this looks like someone was murdered here.",
      "Jane Dorotik: If you just look at all of the pieces of evidence that Loyola was able to absolutely take apart \u2026 and yet we know what was told to the jury in the original conviction \u2026\u00a0 So \u2014 how can that happen?",
      "As her attorneys reviewed evidence, Jane Dorotik, in 2020, was temporarily and conditionally let out of prison due to COVID health concerns. The question now became, was the new evidence her lawyers were finding enough to make her release permanent?",
      "JANE DOROTIK'S FINAL PUSH FOR FREEDOM",
      "In the summer of 2020, Jane Dorotik and her team hoped a court would overturn the jury's verdict, turning her temporary release from prison into lasting freedom.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What were their major points?",
      "Matthew Troiano: The testing that was done initially was insufficient. The way that that testing was presented to the jury was inaccurate. There were a number of different arguments that they made.",
      "A hearing was scheduled, but then suddenly the state requested an unplanned virtual hearing.",
      "PROSECUTOR KARL HUSOE (remote hearing): The people are willing to concede petitioner's new evidence claim\u2026",
      "The prosecution admitted what Jane's lawyers had argued all along.",
      "PROSECUTOR KARL HUSOE (remote hearing): The DNA evidence as it exists now, in 2020, is much different in quality and quantity than presented at trial in 2001.",
      "That the new DNA test results \u2013 as well as issues with how the Sheriff's Crime Lab handled evidence \u2014 cast doubt on the verdict. But what came next was even more unexpected. The state requested that Jane's murder conviction be overturned \u2026 and the judge agreed.",
      "Jane Dorotik: I always believed that at some point \u2026 the truth would come out.",
      "But Jane's ordeal wasn't over. Three months later, in another shocking move, the DA's office decided to retry her.",
      "Jane Dorotik: I don't think any of us thought \u2026 that San Diego County would attempt to retry me. But they did.",
      "Matthew Troiano: The state believes that she did this, and they want to pursue it. \u2026 Then you have this battle \u2026 in court. \u2026 If you're conceding that there were problems \u2026 how are you going to do it again, essentially with the same evidence?",
      "Jane Dorotik: It was astounding to sit in that courtroom and see what they try and put forward as actual evidence. And then also thrilling to see my team take it apart.",
      "Jane's attorneys questioned the credibility of several of the State's experts, including Charles Merritt of the Sheriff's Crime Lab. The judge ultimately ruled that the new trial could go ahead, but that some key evidence presented in her original trial would not be admissible \u2014 including those tire tracks near where Bob's body was found that were linked to Jane's truck.",
      "Matthew Troiano: You have a number of different trucks that could be consistent with those tire tracks \u2026 It's in essence kind of junk science-y.",
      "In May 2022, just as jury selection was about to begin, the prosecution surprised everyone yet again.",
      "Jane Dorotik: We go into court as the jury is assembled and ready to come into the \u2026 courtroom Monday morning. And everything's changed.",
      "Deputy DA Christopher Campbell (in court): We no longer feel that the evidence is sufficient to show proof beyond a reasonable doubt and convince 12 members of the jury. So we are requesting that the court \u2026 dismiss the charges at this time. Thank you.   Judge: Ms. Dorotik, you are free to go. Good luck to you ma'am.",
      "JANE DOROTIK (to reporters): It just is overwhelming to realize that now I can determine my own future. It's something I've prayed for and hoped for.",
      "After the hearing, Jane's attorneys spoke about her decades-long fight.",
      "MICHAEL CAVALUZZI ( to reporters) Jane's dignity in standing up and stoically fighting for her innocence against every risk and every threat. That's why this case got dismissed today and \u2026 as far as we're concerned, we're moving on.",
      "The District Attorney's Office and Sheriff's Department declined to speak with \"48 Hours.\" The case against Jane Dorotik was dismissed without prejudice, which means, if new evidence surfaces, charges could be brought again someday.   Erin Moriarty: But then, doesn't that leave still a shadow over Jane Dorotik?",
      "Matthew Troiano: Oh, sure, it does. I mean, there's no question about it. \u2026 From a practical perspective, do I think it's over? Yeah, I think it's over. But from a legal perspective, no.",
      "Jane Dorotik is working to rebuild her life after spending nearly two decades in prison.",
      "Jane Dorotik: My entire family has been blown apart by this hurricane of events. \u2026 It's been heartbreaking on so many levels.",
      "Claire Dorotik did not respond to\"48 Hours\"' request for comment, but Jane says they are still close. Her son Nick died in 2023. Alex Dorotik did not provide a comment to \"48 Hours,\" but according to filings by the state, he remains convinced his mother killed his father.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Do you have hope that your family will come together at some point?",
      "Jane Dorotik: Of course I do. Of course I have hope.",
      "Jane also has hope that she can make a difference in other people's lives, as she works with advocacy groups that help incarcerated women.",
      "Jane Dorotik: To me, it's not just about my story. And yes, we can all sit here and say, \"This is so horrendous.\" And \"How did this happen to this woman?\" \u2026 But unless we look systemically, how many others are we gonna find? And to me, that's critically important.",
      "Many unanswered questions about this case remain, including, perhaps, the most important one.",
      "Matthew Troiano: What happened here? \u2026 We don't know what happened to Bob Dorotik. \u2026 Where's justice for Bob? Where's justice for Robert Dorotik?",

    "summary": "Police in Lakeville, Indiana, say Jeff Pelley, 17, killed his family to make his 1989 prom night perfect.",
    "story": [
      "Did an Indiana teenager murder four members of his family in an argument over prom? CBS News chief investigator and senior national correspondent Jim Axelrod reports on the Pelley family murder case and the path of Jessi Toronjo \u2014 a sibling left to pick up the pieces in an encore of \u00a0\"Murder on Prom Night,\" airing Saturday, June 21 at 9/8c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "From tweeting celebrities for a date, to hiring helicopters instead of limos, there seems to be no limit to what teenagers will do to make their prom a night to remember. But just how far would a teenager go for his senior dance? Detectives in Lakeville, Indiana, say 17-year-old Jeff Pelley was willing to kill his family to make his 1989 prom night perfect.",
      "More than 30 years later, former Indiana State Police Detective Mark Senter says he still remembers walking into the Pelley family home on Sunday, April 30, 1989. \"No one should have seen what we saw that morning.\" What Senter saw in the home adjacent to the Olive Branch Church was gruesome: The Reverend Robert \"Bob\" Pelley, his wife Dawn, and Dawn's daughters Janel and Jolene were shot at close range with a shotgun. Parishioners discovered the four bodies when Bob Pelley and his family did not show up for services that morning.",
      "Three of the Pelley family children were not at the house the night of the murders. Jessica Pelley, 9, slept over at a nearby friend's house. Jacque Pelley was out of town, and Jeff Pelley, 17, attended the LaVille High School senior prom and was with friends at Great America, a Chicago area amusement park, as part of the after-prom events that Sunday.",
      "For Senter and other investigators at the Pelley house, there were several clues that stuck out. The doors were locked and the curtains were closed, which neighbors in the tiny town of Lakeville said was unusual. A shotgun was also missing from the family gun rack and judging from the location of Bob Pelley's body in the hallway, detectives surmised that whoever killed him came from a bedroom not accessible from the outside.",
      "\"It did not look like a burglary. It did not look like a home invasion,\" Senter recalls. \u00a0\"As a detective I saw the worst of the worst that morning, but we had a job to do. So immediately started talking about suspects.\" The one suspect that investigators began to look into almost immediately was Jeff Pelley. Senter was familiar with Jeff Pelley. Just weeks before prom Jeff was caught stealing CDs and some money from a nearby home and Senter worked the investigation.",
      "\"Bob Pelley grounded Jeff for the burglary case. He could not go to the prom without his dad taking him. He couldn't go to dinner before the prom. He couldn't go to the after prom.\" The embarrassment of his father driving him to prom, Senter said, \"was crushing to Jeff Pelley\u2026 I believe he killed his family and then was able to go to the prom.\"",
      "While investigators had a motive, the case against Jeff was thin, said John Botich, a retired St Joseph's County detective who also worked the case. \"We didn't have any forensic evidence. We didn't find a murder weapon\u2026 \u00a0No eyewitnesses. We had circumstantial evidence and the timeline. Very tough case to prove very tough case to prosecute.\"",
      "Prosecutors initially declined to press charges on Jeff Pelley and he eventually married, had a son, and built a successful career as a computer consultant in Florida. But in 2002, a new prosecutor took a look at the case and decided to charge Pelley with four counts of homicide, even though there was no new evidence. Authorities arrested Jeff Pelley at Los Angeles International Airport on his way home from a business trip.",
      "Frank Schaffer, then an Assistant District Attorney for St Joseph's County, said the case hinged mainly on Pelley's motive \u2014 his anger over prom \u2014 and the timeline of events on Saturday, April 29, 1989.",
      "At Pelley's 2006 trial, Schaffer argued that Jeff Pelley shot his father in an argument over prom and then had to get rid of the surviving witnesses, all within a roughly 30-minute timeframe.",
      "\"It was a very, very small window when the family could have been murdered, and it was very clear the only person who could have done this was Jeff,\" Schaffer said.",
      "According to Schaffer, numerous witnesses who stopped by the Pelley household before prom to show off their dresses and pose for pictures, helped build the prosecution's timeline. \"On Saturday April 29th, the Pelley house was definitely buzzing. Many of the individuals going to the prom wanted to come by and show Bob their prom dress, their prom tux\u2026.\u00a0 So up until roughly 5 o'clock there was a lot of traffic in and out of the home.\"",
      "But Schaffer said that by 5:30, no other visitors could get into the house and Jeff's car was gone from the driveway. \"The house was locked up as tight as a drum. It became very clear that the murders had to happen between say 5 and 5:20.\"",
      "Pelley's defense attorney Alan Baum disputed the prosecution's allegations that Jeff killed his family and then attended prom as if nothing had happened. \u00a0\"From all indications, the people that were with Jeff that night described him as just one of the group, they were having a good time. To think he could spend that whole evening doing all of the things they did and just having fun like a kid after murdering his family is preposterous.\"",
      "In the summer of 2006, a jury found Jeff Pelley guilty for the murders of Bob, Dawn, Janel and Jolene Pelley. He was sentenced to 160 years in prison.",
      "However, more than three decades after the murders, Jeff Pelley's case is still working its way through the courts. On April 28, 2024, the St. Joseph Superior Court denied Jeff Pelley's request for post-conviction relief, one day prior to the 35-year anniversary of the murders. Pelley is appealing that denial.",

      "Jessi Toronjo was just 9 years old when she returned from a sleepover at a friend's house to find out her mother, stepfather and two sisters were murdered in their Lakeville, Indiana, home. Police immediately suspected Jessica's stepbrother Jeff Pelley, but it would take 13 years to arrest him. The motive? Prosecutors say the then-17-year-old Pelley wiped out his family in anger at not being able to drive to his prom. Pelley was ultimately convicted, but the case continues to wind its way through the courts.",

      "Jessi Toronjo: My name is Jessi. \u2026 My hair is pink. \u2026 I decided to change my hair. \u2026 I also changed my name to Jessi. Jessica, I no longer wanted that name 'cause she was a very sad, lonely, angry little girl. And I just didn't want that anymore [cries].",
      "Jessi Toronjo: When I was a young child, I lived \u2026 with my mom and my dad \u2026 And then there was me, the oldest \u2026\u00a0 my middle sister Janel \u2026 And then there was my little sister Jolene.",

      "Jessi Toronjo: Because my stepdad was the minister of the church, we lived in the parsonage",
      "Jessi Toronjo: Bob's kids were older than me and my sisters. \u2026 \u00a0My first impression of Jeff was he was very tall, skinny, crazy big hair. And Jacque, she was a little more quiet, reserved.",
      "Jessi Toronjo: My sister Janel and I had a best friend, Stephanie Fagan \u2026 She was like one of the family.",
      "Stephanie Fagan: We played in the backyard. We ran through the cornfields. \u2026 It was typical country girl stuff.",

      "Stephanie Fagan: So, I ran over there \u2026 and the door was locked. \u00a0\u2026 I was confused. The doors were never locked \u2026 And I went running back to the church and I said, \"I don't know. They must all be sleeping.\"",
      "Stephanie Fagan: At this point in time I think the whole congregation was there \u2026 They had a master key \u2026 They went and scoped it out themselves. \u2026 And they came back and said everybody needs to run to the alter and pray. I was super confused [cries].",
      "Jessi Toronjo: We drove up, and I saw lots of people in the parking lot. \u2026 And there were cop cars everywhere. There was yellow crime tape. \u2026 A police officer came up to the van and asked my friend's mom to get out. [Cries] and I could see them talking.

      "Jessi Toronjo: The only thing I remember about my family's funeral was the caskets. I don't remember who all was there. I couldn't tell you what I was doing. I just remember the four caskets.",
      "Jamie Collins: We were toward the front of the church in a pew. \u2026 And all at once, the chords to the piano began to play the song \"Amazing Grace.\" \u2026 \u00a0And I just remember being so devastated to realize \u2026 \u00a0the reason that the caskets were closed is because of the horrific way that they had died.",

      "John Botich | Former St. Joseph County Detective: To see the young girls in that position the way they were with their mother trying to protect them was just something that was etched in my mind forever. \u2026 They were all shot in the head. \u2026 It was devastating. It stuck with me my whole life. I mean, 30 years later I can still see- if I close my eyes, the three people in the basement",
      "Mark Senter: As a detective I saw the worst of the worst that morning, but we had a job to do. So immediately started talking about suspects. \u00a0\u2026 It did not look like a burglary. It did not look like a home invasion.",

      "JEFF PELLEY: No, I really don't. I don't know who would want to.",
      "Jessi Toronjo: I didn't know who had done it or who they thought had done it. It was like a hush hush thing with me.",
      "Jessi Toronjo: In my own mind, I had to come up with something. So, I thought my stepdad had killed my mom and my two sisters and then killed himself. \u2026 He was not very nice to me. \u2026 Spanked me a lot so I thought, you know, at 9 that he could have been capable of that.",
      "But police had dismissed that possibility almost immediately.",
      "John Botich: After seeing the extent of the injuries of Bob Pelley and no murder weapon or no weapon laying around him, I ruled the suicide part out in my mind.",
      "A month after the funeral, relatives sent Jessi away to camp with her friend Stephanie, in an effort to restore some normalcy to her life.",

      "Stephanie Fagan: When I look at those pictures it's just so weird and strange to me because we both have smiles on our faces but \u2026 those little girls weren't right. Those little girls were hurting.",
      "After camp, Jessi says her relatives thought it was best for her to start over.",
      "Stephanie Fagan: They didn't want her to communicate with the people that she had shared this tragedy with.",
      "Jessi Toronjo: After the murders we really didn't have a close relationship \u2014 my stepbrother and my stepsister and I.",

      "Stephanie Fagan: I had sent letters \u2026 and I was told not to send any more letters",
      "Stephanie Fagan I just would sit at night and think to myself I can't imagine what she's going through.",

      "Jessi Toronjo: I didn't really have a place to call my own \u2026 I felt like a drifter.",
      "Jessi Toronjo: I didn't know where I was going to stay. \u2026 I felt like I didn't belong anywhere.",
      "As time passed and Jessi tried to regain her footing, the investigation dragged on without any arrests.",
      "Jessi Toronjo: At the age of 13, I did try and take control of my life. \u2026 And I actually pushed down all the feelings that I was feeling \u2026 I was happy and outgoing and had friends and didn't think about the past.",
      "But five years after the murder of her family, someone from her past life came calling.",
      "Jessi Toronjo: My stepbrother Jeff \u2026 he did call me when I was 15 \u2026 and asked me to come down to Florida to visit him. \u2026 When I went to visit him, he did have a really good job with a computer business. He had a wife, Kim, and you know had his own house, so he was doing pretty good.",
      "Jessi Toronjo: And the first thing that he asked me was, \"Who do you think did it?\" \u2026 So, I looked at him and said, \"I think your dad did it.\" And then it was dropped.",

      "Stephanie Fagan [at cemetery]: \u2026 And they're right over here. \u2026 When I was 16 \u2026 \u00a0I got my driver's license. The first place I went was to the cemetery. I would just sit and talk to them.",

      "Stephanie Fagan: She was gone, I couldn't figure out why they wouldn't just let me, you know, keep in contact with her.",
      "Stephanie Fagan: When I was a teenager, I did start doing research about the murders and that's when it became kind of an obsession for me to find her.",
      "Stephanie Fagan [at cemetery]: Every time I came out, I was always thinking, \"I'll run into her someday \u2014 if I just come out here enough, she'll be here.\"",
      "Jessi Toronjo: I did not realize anybody was out there looking for me. I pretty much thought everybody forgot about me and had moved on with their lives because it wasn't their family that they lost.",
      "In 1998, when she was 18, Jessi tried to move on as well.",
      "Jessi Toronjo: The first chance that I got to purchase my own home, I did. \u2026 I used some of the inheritance to purchase it. I had not had a home since I was 9. \u2026 It was an amazing feeling. \u2026 I felt like I belonged there, that I had a place.",
      "Jessi finally had a home, and a family would soon follow",
      "Jessi Toronjo: When I first met Tyson, it was love at first sight for him. Me, it was not. I was with someone else. So, when we reconnected a couple of years later \u2026 we just started hanging out. And ever since then we've been together",
      "Jessi Toronjo: I have two children.",
      "Jessi Toronjo: When my children were younger, they did know that I had a family and that they were gone. I did not go into detail. I did not really give them any explanation on what had happened, they just knew they were gone.",
      "But in 2002, 13 years after the murders, keeping her past buried would become more difficult.",
      "Jessi Toronjo: There was a knock on my door \u2026 And there were two detectives standing there.",
      "They told her the case was being reopened.",
      "Jessi Toronjo: They said, well, we're here to talk about, you know, your family's murder case. And we just want to know who you think did it.",
      "Jessi Toronjo: When I told them it was my stepfather, they looked at each other and then, you know, looked at me, and said, well,\" There's no way it could have been him\". And then that's when they asked me, well, \"Who do you think could have done it?\" And in that moment, Jeff came to my mind.",
      "Jessi Toronjo: My older stepbrother, Jeff, liked to do things that, just scared me \u2026 He was so quick to getting angry. And he would use his fists. He would fight.",
      "Jessi Toronjo: And they said, yep, \"that's exactly who we think did it.\" \u2026 I got a pit in my stomach. \u2026\u00a0 And then they started telling me \u2026 \u00a0a little bit about the case.",

      "Mark Senter | Former Indiana State Police Detective: I know there was \u2026 a lot of angst in that family between him and his dad \u2014 between Bob and Jeff. \u00a0I know a situation where Bob punched him one time. I think the neighbors saw a lot of that same thing as well.",

      "But investigators didn't believe him.",
      "John Botich: When you're talking about the death of your family, you think, you know, every once in a while, he'd tear up or he'd cry. He never did any of that.",

      "Jessi Toronjo: I actually had someone call me and tell me that. And I remember being at Save-A-Lot actually, and I was sitting in my car. And I just started crying because I was afraid it was all going to start again. And I didn't want have to look over my shoulder.",
      "But Jeff remained in custody and in February 2009, the Indiana Supreme Court upheld Jeff Pelley's conviction; the sentence stood.",
      "With the case seemingly behind her, Jessi decided her children were old enough to hear how she lost her family.",
      "Dakota Toronjo | Jessi's daughter: When I was first told about my mom's past, we were actually in Indiana. \u2026 she took me to her sister's and mom and stepdad's graves. \u2026 She told me that \u2026 they had been killed when she was 9. \u2026 it made me sad, 'cause I was like, \"Well that's your family.

This eye came up just this part of her eye. \u2026 I knew it was her. I knew. \u2026 \u00a0Part of me was scared because I thought \u2026 maybe she didn't want me in her life.

      "Jessi Toronjo: So, Jamie \u2026 said to me, \"You know you should write a book about your life.\" And I told her, I said, \"Well everybody tells me that,\" but I definitely could never do that and I probably couldn't talk to a stranger about everything. And she said, \"Well, what about me? Could you tell me?\" And I told her, \"Yeah, I could probably do that.\"",
      "Though she came across as outgoing and positive, the trauma of Jessi's childhood was never far below the surface.",
      "Jamie Collins: We were actually \u2026 writing the book at the time that Jessica kind of had a downward spiral. And it was a very scary time for both of us. \u2026 \u00a0She lost a close family friend to cystic fibrosis. \u2026 And for her, it had triggered these elements from her past \u2026 Once the triggers hit her, that was that was it.",
      "Jessi Toronjo: I hadn't lost anybody since my family. And I never realized that it would hit me like that. \u00a0So \u2026 I have a whole week where I don't remember a whole lot. \u2026 \u00a0I trashed my living room. I was angry. \u2026 It was like I wasn't even there.",
      "Jessi Toronjo: I could feel myself being sucked into the darkness and I just couldn't bring myself out.",
      "Stephanie Fagan: That week I knew something was going on. \u2026 I got a call. \u2026 And she was crying. \u2026 All I could hear was \"you know I need you. I need you\" \u2026 I was like, \"OK, you calm down.\" There was no calming her down. ... I was like,\" maybe you just need to take an anxiety pill. Maybe you just need to calm down \u2026\" She's like, \" I took all of them.\" I said, \"Oh this is not good. \u2026. And the phone went silent. And I couldn't hear her anymore.

      "Jessi Toronjo: I ended up waking up in a hospital and I didn't know how I got there, I didn't know what had happened. But the doctor asked me if I tried to kill myself. And I was floored. \u2026 I guess I had taken a bottle of pills and tried to kill myself. I later found in a notebook a goodbye note.",

      "Jessi Toronjo: I've learned that I do have DID, which is dissociative identity disorder, and I am part Jessica and part Jessi. So, when I pushed Jessica down inside me, way down, and didn't want to feel sad, lonely, I think I lost a lot of the memories that I had in doing that. And now that I'm trying to get them back, you know, it's difficult too because I'm just now letting Jessica come back.",
      "Jessi Toronjo: A survivor's path is very messy. There is no clean line. There is no straight path. You have your ups and downs\u2026. \u00a0But when you get help, it's a little bit easier",
      "Jessi Toronjo: I do not consider myself fully healed, but I am definitely on the way to recovery.",

      "Stephanie Fagan: There's a lot I admire about Jessi. \u2026 I admire Jessi for her strong will. I admire her for her strength. I admire her for everything that she went through. \u2026 And I feel like she came out just this beautiful flower in a field full of weeds. That's how I feel about her.",
      "Dakota Toronjo: I saw her in this downward spiral \u2026 and then in just the past year or so I've seen her crawl back up \u2026 she survived it. \u2026 Seeing my mom go through this has taught me to value family and to never give up and to always keep fighting no matter what's going on in my life.",

Would they have called her Nana?",

      "\"There will be either peace or there will be tragedy for Iran far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Remember, there are many targets left.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced earlier Saturday evening on social media that the U.S. had launched strikes against three Iranian nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. He said in his address that the sites \"have been completely and totally obliterated.\"",
      "The president said the objective of the strikes was to end \"the nuclear threat posed by the world's No. 1 state sponsor of terror.\" Prior to the start of military action, Mr. Trump sought a deal with Iran to curtail its nuclear program.",
      "In his televised address, the president called Saturday's three targets \"the most difficult of them all, by far, and perhaps the most lethal.\" He said other sites could be targeted \"with precision, speed and skill\" in the future \"if peace does not come quickly.\"",
      "Mr. Trump thanked U.S. service members. He also thanked the Israeli military, which began targeting sites in Iran just over a week ago, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

      "Iran's Atomic Energy Organization has confirmed the strikes, but said the attack would not stop Iran from advancing its nuclear program. In a statement, it called on the international community to condemn the attacks. Iran's main state TV channels have so far been\u00a0 downplaying the impact of the strikes, claiming the sites had already been evacuated and denying any damage to the Fordo uranium enrichment facility.",
      "Prior to Saturday's airstrikes, Iran had threatened to retaliate against the U.S. if it joined the Israeli offensive. An Iranian official had warned Wednesday that U.S. intervention would risk \"all-out war.\" Iran has launched missiles at Israel over the last week.",

      "3 Iranian nuclear sites targeted",
      "All three sites that were targeted Saturday evening are part of Iran's nuclear program. Fordo\u00a0is 300 feet underground and protected by a Russian-produced anti-missile system. It's a high-grade uranium enrichment plant that can hold about 3,000 centrifuges. Fordo has long been believed by nuclear weapons experts to be central to any effort by Iran to produce weapons-grade uranium because of its size, security and technical capacity.",
      "Natanz, which is about 135 miles southeast of Tehran, in Isfahan province, is the country's main enrichment site. It operates multiple cascades of centrifuges working together to more quickly enrich uranium. On June 13, Israel struck Natanz, and IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi told the United Nations Security Council Iran had confirmed the attack on Natanz and said the above-ground portion of the plant where Iran was producing uranium enriched up to 60% was \"destroyed\" and centrifuges may have been damaged.",
      "The Isfahan facility, about 80 miles south of Natanz, hosts thousands of nuclear scientists and is home to three Chinese research reactors and laboratories associated with the country's atomic program.",
      "President Trump posted a screenshot of a post on X from \"Open Source Intel\" that says: \"Fordow is gone.\"",
      "The U.S. carried out the strikes nine days after Israel launched its offensive on Iranian military and nuclear targets \u2014 an operation Mr. Trump said the U.S. was not involved with.",
      "Iran has increased its stockpile of highly enriched uranium in recent months, according to the IAEA \u2014 though Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is only intended for peaceful purposes. Before Israel's initial strikes the IAEA noted in a classified report obtained by CBS News that Iran is the only non-nuclear weapon state in the world that is producing and accumulating uranium enriched to 60%, which remains a matter of serious concern. Uranium for civilian use is enriched to a much lower rate, between 3% and 5%.",
      "On Friday, the president said his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was \"wrong\" when she testified in March that Iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon, and the White House said this week that Iran has everything it needs to build a nuclear weapon and a green light from Iran's supreme leader would enable Iran to ready a nuclear weapon within weeks.

      "The silent stones tell both sides of an epic story, the life and death of  Blaze Bernstein. They are a marker of a violent murder, but also a promise in the belief of a better future. A monument to the best of humanity, and the very worst of human behavior.",
      "You can find the stones in a tranquil corner of Borrego Park, in suburban Orange County, California. There are hundreds of them, hand-painted, with messages of tolerance, love and peace. \"And they're getting sent to us from all around the world,\" says Gideon Bernstein. \"It's great to see the messaging. It's always positive,\" adds Gideon's wife Jeanne Pepper.",
      "Jeanne and Gideon are the parents of Blaze Bernstein. On Jan. 2, 2018, then-19-year-old Blaze left his house. Sometime later that night, he was murdered in Borrego Park, stabbed 28 times; his body buried there in a shallow, muddy grave.",
      "By all accounts, Blaze was an exceptional young man \u2014 an Ivy League student at the University of Pennsylvania, considering a career in medicine, a writer and budding chef. \"I call him a unicorn,\" Jeanne Pepper tells \"48 Hours\" correspondent Tracy Smith in an encore of\u00a0\"The Life and Death of Blaze Bernstein,\"\u00a0airing Saturday, June 28 on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Theirs is a loss they continue to live with to this day. \"I think about Blaze all the time, because when I see things, I think to myself, 'what would Blaze be doing now?'\" says Pepper.",
      "Blaze died because of something far more fundamental. He was targeted, and according to investigators, slaughtered, because of who he was \u2013 a gay, Jewish man. Tony Rackaukas, then the Orange County district attorney, says this was a hate crime. Authorities say Blaze's killer was a neo-Nazi, a member of a small violent hate group called \"Atomwaffen,\" whose beliefs were deeply anti-LGBTQ + as well as virulently antisemitic.",
      "The killer is Samuel Woodward. He had once been Blaze's classmate back in high school. That's about all Blaze and Woodward had in common, according to classmate Raiah Rofsky, who tells Smith, \"They were so different \u2026 about as different as you could be.\" Rofsky remembers Woodward's unsettling presence. \"He was very quiet -- very withdrawn, didn't really talk to people.\" Rofsky tells Smith Woodward had a reputation. \"Racist, homophobic, sexist.\"",
      "And when word spread that Blaze had gone missing while home in California on college winter break, and that the last person known to have seen him was Woodward, Rofsky's reaction was immediate. \"The only reason I could think of Sam meeting up with Blaze is because either number one, he wanted to hook up with him, or two, because he was planning to murder him.\" That was January 2018.",
      "Detectives arrested Woodward just 10 days after Blaze disappeared in Borrego Park.",
      "It has been six painful years. There were COVID delays, and a revolving door of defense lawyers who raised questions with the court about Woodward's mental health and ability to defend himself. It all left Jeanne Pepper and Gideon Bernstein frustrated and waiting for justice. \"Slow justice is no justice,\" says Pepper. \"It's not fair to victims and it's not fair to the deceased.\" In 2022, Woodward was found competent to stand trial. Finally, in April 2024, the murder trial began.",
      "Remarkably, after all they have endured, the couple turned their grief into hope. They founded what they call \"a kindness movement\" \u2013 promoting \"positivity\" and random acts of kindness in Blaze's name. They call their movement \"BlazeItForward.\"",
      "In Borrego Park, where Blaze took his last breath, there is that extraordinary response \u2014 the hundreds of hand-painted stones, most left by total strangers, in the memory of Blaze Bernstein.",
      "The silent stones speak of tolerance and Blaze's transformation into a kind of martyr; his murder a marker of rabid hate. His spirit gives inspiration to LGBTQ + people, wherever they live and with whomever they love.",
      "Jeanne Pepper tells Smith, \"Blaze's life mattered and he has a legacy, to create good news, to inspire people to be better, to be kinder. And to work on repairing the world, because it's not too late and we can make it better.\"",
      "On July 3, 2024, Sam Woodward was found guilty of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement. On Nov. 15, Woodward was sentenced to life in prison without parole.",

    "story": [
      "A brutal heat wave is in the forecast across the eastern United States, and it's expected to bring several days of record high temperatures starting this weekend and into next week. The National Weather Service has called it \"the first significant heat wave this season.\"",
      "The NWS said on Saturday that \"major to extreme heat risk will spread into the Midwest and East Coast on Sunday, where anyone without effective cooling and/or adequate hydration will be affected. Little to no overnight relief will only exacerbate heat impacts.\"",
      "Over 140\u202fmillion Americans will be under the highest-level extreme heat alerts by Sunday. Including heat advisories, the total number affected rises to 200 million. This marks one of the most expansive heat alert events ever, with major population centers from the Midwest to the Northeast under serious heat strain.",
      "CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said potential daily record highs were\u00a0forecast for parts of the Rockies and Plains on\u00a0 Saturday, then temperatures well into the 90s will reach the mid-Atlantic and Northeast and linger into next week.",

      "Heat wave forecast maps",
      "\"Summer has taken its time arriving in the Northeast, but it's coming  in HOT,\" the National Weather Service wrote Wednesday in a social media post. \"Triple-digit heat indices will be common through next week, with oppressive humidity.\"",
      "The\u00a0heat index\u00a0is what the actual temperature feels like when it's combined with relative humidity.",
      "These maps show daily forecast highs across the country and their departures from average temperatures.",
      "How long will the heat wave last?",
      "The heat is expected to shift into the Midwest and Ohio Valley by the end of the weekend and arrive in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic on Sunday through the first half of next week.",
      "Parts of the Northeast face a \"High Risk\" \u2014 a greater than 60% chance \u2014 of extreme heat through the middle of next week, according to the National Weather Service. Temperatures are forecast to be well into the 90s or even triple digits.",
      "\"I cannot emphasize this enough: extreme heat can be deadly,\" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned. \"The best way to stay safe is stay indoors, with air conditioning. This is not the time to start training for the marathon.\"",
      "What constitutes a heat wave?",
      "A heat wave is a period of unusually hot weather that lasts more than two days, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "It often, but not always, covers a wide area and can expose a large number of people to hazardous heat, which can be extremely dangerous for vulnerable people, including children and the elderly.",
      "How to stay safe during a heat wave",
      "The simplest way to way to avoid heat-related illnesses is to stay out of the sun and avoid extended time outdoors in extreme temperatures, experts say.",
      "If strenuous outdoor activities are unavoidable, you should dress for the heat and wear lightweight, loose-fitting and light-colored clothing, the National Weather Service recommended. You should also\u00a0stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, even if you're not thirsty.",
      "It's also important to be aware of any symptoms of overheating, which include muscle cramps, unusually heavy sweating, shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, weakness or nausea, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If you experience these symptoms, one major sign to seek care is if the symptoms don't improve after getting into a cooler environment or hydrating, experts say.",

    "summary": "The Colorado mother vanished in May 2020. Her husband, Barry, was about to go on trial for her murder.",
    "story": [
      "Case update: \u00a0Barry Morphew was arrested\u00a0in Arizona on June 20, 2025, two days after he was indicted on first-degree murder charges in the case of his wife's death. This was the second time Barry Morphew has been arrested and charged in Suzanne Morphew's death.",
      "In a high-profile case that has already seen numerous and sometimes odd twists and turns over the past three years, including crucial judicial sanctions, a judge agreed to dismiss all charges against Barry Morphew, without prejudice, just nine days before he was to stand trial for the first-degree murder of his wife and mother of their two daughters, Suzanne Morphew.",
      "Prosecutors, who can re-file charges in the future, filed a motion to dismiss the indictment minutes before a pre-trial conference on April 19, 2022, with D.A. Linda Stanley writing they need to investigate further and believe \"we are close to discovering the victim's body.\"\u00a0 Stanley also cited the court's decision to exclude \"several key expert witnesses initially endorsed.\u00a0 Without this crucial evidence and without the victim's body, the People cannot move forward at this time in good faith.\"",
      "\"First I want to say that Mr. Morphew not only was presumed innocent and still is presumed innocent, he is innocent,\" Morphew's attorney, Iris Eytan, said at a press conference after the charges were dropped.\u00a0 In response to the State pointing to the need to find Suzanne's body, she said, \"Forever they have stated that they don't need a body \u2014 that a body is irrelevant.\u00a0 But you need to know, that in this case, there has been not a single ounce of physical evidence that has been found connecting Mr. Morphew to this \u2026 alleged crime.\"",
      "Since Barry Morphew's arrest, his defense attorneys had asked Judge Ramsey Lama, multiple times, to dismiss the charges against him. Over the past several months, they pressed the judge to issue severe sanctions on the prosecution for failing to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence ahead of trial.\u00a0 And the judge imposed damaging sanctions, including barring 11 of their 16 endorsed expert witnesses \u2014 among others, experts in DNA, vehicle data and a cell phone data analyst, as punishment for violating discovery rules. In all, the Court excluded 14 of the prosecution's expert witnesses.\u00a0 The judge found that DA Stanley and her team repeatedly missed deadlines and failed to turn over important information, writing, \"The People's actions amount to negligent and arguably, reckless disregard\" for their discovery obligations.",
      "In earlier filings, prosecutors said that the Court did not find willful misconduct associated with any discovery violations, noting \"ultimately the sanctions imposed greatly damage the People's case, tantamount to dismissal, for late disclosures that were not greatly prejudicial, but rather technical in nature.\"",
      "\"48 Hours\" correspondent Peter Van Sant updates the case in \"The Suzanne Morphew Case: Nothing is What It Seems,\" now streaming on Paramount+.",
      "When Suzanne Morphew, a Colorado mother of two girls, vanished on Mother's Day in May 2020, authorities wondered if she'd been abducted or if her husband Barry \u2014 whom she had threatened to divorce \u2014 might have killed her.",
      "Investigators never expected the case would have so many bizarre twists and turns and eventually involve a chipmunk alibi, a tranquilizer gun, a \"talking\" truck, mystery DNA and a spy pen right out of a James Bond film.",
      "\"This case is incredibly unique,\" says Aya Gruber, a law professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder. \"When you started to dig a little bit deeper, nothing is what it seems.\"",
      "Gruber studied thousands of pages of public documents from the prosecutor, investigators and defense attorneys.",
      "Suzanne was reported missing on May 10, 2020. She'd been alone that day because her daughters, Macy, 16, and Mallory, 20, were off on a church-sponsored camping trip and planned to return home later that Mother's Day.",
      "At the same time, Barry Morphew\u00a0told investigators he had left the home early in the morning to drive to a job site some three hours away. He said the last time he saw his wife of 25 years was when she was sleeping in their bed.",
      "After Suzanne was officially reported missing by a neighbor, investigators began to examine Barry's story. Friends and relatives told investigators that the marriage was troubled, and agents found a deleted text from Suzanne to Barry on his phone that read: \"I'm done. I could care less what you're up to and have been for years. We just need to figure this out civilly.\"",
      "But 10 days after Suzanne disappeared, agents were pulled in a different direction when they found a so-called spy pen belonging to Suzanne. The spy pen has a long battery life and is designed to look and write like an ordinary pen.",
      "But it has one extra feature: it is voice-activated and records conversations. Suzanne had acquired it, she told a friend, because she suspected Barry was having an affair and she hoped to use the pen to gather evidence. But the plan backfired.",
      "Investigators listened to what the pen had recorded and, although there was no evidence of Barry having an affair, they say they heard \"intimate\" conversations between Suzanne and someone named Jeff.",
      "It was another twist in a case filled with them.",
      "Without knowing who Jeff was or his location when Suzanne went missing, they could not eliminate him as a person or interest. It took FBI agents six months before they uncovered his identity: Jeff Libler, a man both Suzanne and Barry knew from their Alexandria, Indiana, high school. Jeff and Suzanne had had a one-time fling after graduation, and she'd reached out to him in 2018 after the Morphews moved to Colorado with a Facebook message that read simply: \"Howdy stranger.\"",
      "\"And from that moment they had talked almost every single day nonstop,\" said Ashley Franco, a reporter for KKTV, the CBS affiliate in Colorado Springs, who has covered the story from the beginning.",
      "That was enough to ignite a nearly two-year love affair. Jeff had a wife and six children. He lived in Michigan and claimed to be there with his family on the day Suzanne vanished.",
      "Agents eventually discovered the lovers had spoken to each other for dozens of hours, often communicating via secret accounts on WhatsApp and LinkedIn. Jeff also admitted that they met for romantic rendezvous in New Orleans, Florida, Texas, Michigan and Indiana.",
      "After Suzanne disappeared in May 2020, Jeff did not contact authorities. Instead, agents say, he deleted the accounts where he had communicated with Suzanne.",
      "\"What he did was delete all his social media accounts that he had used to communicate with Suzanne,\" says Gruber. \"He's got a lot to lose if revelations of this affair come out.\"",
      "Jeff reportedly told agents he did not want to tarnish Suzanne's memory, but he also told them he worried that he'd lose his wife, children and job. He also worried he might be considered a suspect. \"He asks the agents, 'Am I a target?'\" says Gruber.",
      "After agents confronted him, he did cooperate, providing a sample of his DNA and passwords to the deleted accounts. Investigators eventually were able to retrace the couple's steps and recovered texts by tapping into the iCloud accounts of Jeff and Suzanne.",
      "Jeff was able to provide receipts for a home goods store he'd visited in Michigan on the day Suzanne vanished and he was eventually cleared.",
      "Investigators still had their suspicions about Barry Morphew. They never uncovered any evidence that he was having an affair, but investigators found his actions on that Mother's Day weekend to be suspicious.",
      "They asked Barry why his phone seemed to be pinging all around his house on the day before Mother's Day and he told them he must have been out shooting chipmunks, which he said were a constant nuisance at the house.",
      "It was perhaps the world's first chipmunk alibi, but Barry stood by it, saying he'd shot 85 chipmunks in the two years he owned that Colorado house.",
      "\"And then that confession to shooting chipmunks becomes a major piece of incriminating evidence against him,\" says Gruber.",
      "Van Sant asked why. \"Because [agents are] saying, 'Well, you know, now he's admitting to having run around the house. And this is a ridiculous explanation, so it must be the explanation of a guilty person,'\" says Gruber.",
      "What's more, there was no evidence of any chipmunk shootings around the house and neighbors did not recall hearing any type of disturbance during that period of time.",
      "Cases sometimes turn on the smallest of things and, in this case, agents seized upon just such a small item.",
      "Agents had found a small clear plastic cap in the family's dryer that they believed was from a syringe used to inject chemicals into a tranquilizer dart. Barry acknowledged he knew how to inject chemicals into a dart and that he'd shot many deer for trophies and so he could get their antlers. His garage was filled with deer heads and a pile of antlers. However, there was no working tranquilizer gun found in the home and authorities say Barry's DNA was not on that plastic cap.",
      "Even so, investigators developed a theory that Barry had shot Suzanne with a tranquilizer gun and then chased her around the house before she passed out. They found a door frame that was broken and suspected there had been a confrontation.",
      "Agents also tapped into a new investigative tool called digital vehicle forensics. They pulled data from his Ford truck's many computers and got the truck to \"talk\" to them. They learned that when Barry said he was sleeping, the truck's doors were opening and closing.",
      "He was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other crimes in May 2021. Suzanne's body has not been found and prosecutors presume she is dead. Barry eventually pleaded \"not guilty.\"",
      "But at the eleventh hour, there was one more twist revealed for the first time publicly at a preliminary hearing to determine if there was enough evidence for probable cause.",
      "Prosecutors admitted at a hearing held in the summer of 2021 that their own forensics team had uncovered DNA evidence that threatened to destroy their case against Barry. State technicians had found DNA on the glove compartment of Suzanne's car that partially matched an unknown male connected to three unsolved sexual assault cases in three different cities.",
      "Barry Morphew and Jeff Libler were excluded from that DNA sample which meant there was a chance Suzanne had fallen into the hands of a sexual predator. \"This DNA discovery is so significant,\" Gruber said. \"All of a sudden, the seemingly implausible becomes more possible.\"",
      "Judge Patrick Murphy wwas candid in his assessment of the case, saying it could go either way before a jury. He found enough probable cause to put it over for trial but ordered that Barry be released on $500,000 bond, observing that he thought there was not \"a fair likelihood\" that Barry would be convicted by a jury. Barry entered a plea of not guilty to the charges.",
      "Barry Morphew raised the bond money and is free awaiting trial. \u00a0Judge Murphy disqualified himself because of a potential conflict of interest involving a witness, and Judge Ramsey Lama was appointed in January 2022.\u00a0 Morphew's trial, which was moved from Chaffee to Fremont County, Colorado, was scheduled to begin on April 28.",
      "Then, on April 19, Stanley and her team filed the motion to drop all charges, without prejudice, until they gather more evidence.\u00a0 But Morphew's attorney, Iris Eytan, argued that the case should be dismissed with prejudice so that it cannot be refiled.\u00a0 The court dismissed the charges without prejudice.",
      "At the press conference outside court, Eytan made it clear her opinion that her client should never have been charged.",
      "\"These charges were false from the beginning \u2026 The prosecution was manufacturing a murder case,\" she said.\u00a0 \"You've seen shows called 'Making a Murderer?' That's what was happening here in this courtroom \u2026 They absolutely dismissed this case at this point because they knew they were going to lose this trial and Mr. Morphew was going to be acquitted and exonerated.\"",
      "\"Barry Morphew loves Suzanne Morphew,\" Eytan said. \"He loves her and he misses her and he wants to know where Suzanne Morphew is.\u00a0 It's a big question mark \u2026 Definitely there was not any evidence, even close to convicting him of murder of his wife.\"",
      "As investigators continue searching for Suzanne Morphew's body, focusing on a \"remote and mountainous region nearby the Morphew residence,\" as the DA wrote in her motion, waiting for five feet of snow to melt before they can safely excavate the area, Barry Morphew, alongside his daughters, walked out of the Fremont County courthouse a free man. With all charges against him dropped, his bond is lifted, his GPS ankle monitor removed, and his passport returned. \u00a0And about 1,000 people who had been summoned to appear for jury selection are released.",
      "In May 2023, Barry Morphew filed\u00a0 a $15 million federal civil rights lawsuit against prosecutors and law enforcement officials stating he was wrongfully arrested, jailed and prosecuted.",

But buyers are actually paying far less than sellers' median asking price, which stood at $422,238 for the same period, the real estate company's data shows.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 15:57:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers conducted the first systematic review of policies around the U.S. to limit plastic bag use.",
    "story": [
      "State and local policies to regulate the use of plastic bags have significantly reduced how many of them are found littered along U.S. shorelines \u2014 potentially cutting that type of waste in half in certain places, a new study published Thursday in the journal Science found.",
      "More than 600 bag policies, along with records from more than 45,000 shoreline cleanups between 2017 and 2023, were reviewed by researchers to see whether implementing bans or fees on plastic bags led to fewer discarded bags found near coastlines, rivers and lakes \u2013 and if they did, to what extent.",
      "Co-authors environmental economist Anna Papp and Kimberly Oremus, a marine science and policy professor at the University of Delaware, found that the number of plastic bags collected as shoreline litter in places with bag policies dropped by at least 25%, and up to 47% over six years than in locations that did not have regulations.",
      "\"When we found the database that had information on different shoreline cleanups, we realized we could look at the composition of litter before and after a policy to see what effect it had,\" Oremus said in a statement. \"And then we could compare that to places that never got a plastic bag policy.\"",
      "These results bring fresh insights to an issue that gained prominence over the last decade or so, as awareness spread about the harms of plastic pollution and its threats to marine environments. Oremus said it's the first attempt to comprehensively review the effectiveness of plastic bag policies on shoreline litter, using a database of global shoreline cleanup initiatives from the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy.",
      "Since 2018, more than 100 countries around the world have implemented some form of policy to either ban or limit the use of plastic bags, according\u00a0to a report by the United Nations Environment Program. The U.S. doesn't have a federal bag policy, but individual towns, cities and states have policies of their own.",
      "Some states, like New York, have completely banned retailers from distributing plastic bags. Others, like Washington, passed partial bans in recent years, where thinner plastic bags deemed \"single use\" are prohibited, but thicker plastic bags are not. Oremus and Papp noted in the study that, although those thicker bags are usually considered \"reusable\" under partial bans, \"there is evidence that some consumers still treat them as single-use.\"",
      "In multiple states without bans, local jurisdictions such as counties have taken steps to regulate plastic bag use. For example, Arlington County, Virginia, requires stores to collect a fee from customers who purchase plastic bags, at 5 cents per bag. But 17 states prevent plastic bag regulations even at the county level, with statewide \"preemption\" laws in place to ensure the distribution of these bags isn't regulated at all.",
      "During the study period, plastic bag litter was collected less often in shoreline cleanups that took place in areas where some form of regulation existed to curb their distribution and use, the authors said.",
      "\"Our findings make clear that plastic bag policies have been broadly effective in limiting\u2014but not eliminating\u2014shoreline plastic bag debris in jurisdictions where it was previously prevalent,\" Oremus and Papp wrote in the study. They also found evidence that suggests fees on plastic bags are more effective at limiting shoreline litter than bans, especially partial bans, but understanding why would require more research.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 13:50:16 -0400",
    "summary": "This was the number one airline in the U.S. last year, based on its reliability, passenger experience and more.",
    "story": [
      "Looking to travel this summer but not sure which airline to fly for the best experience? The Points Guy (TPG), an online site dedicated to improving consumers' travel experiences while helping them save money, has revealed its annual ranking of the best airlines in the U.S.",
      "Founder and CEO Brian Kelly said the site ranks airlines based on four criteria: a carrier's reliability and performance; passenger experience; its cost and reach; and the quality of its loyalty or rewards program. Recent carrier meltdowns have travelers thinking more carefully about which airline \u2014 and through which airports \u2014 they want to fly.",
      "\"This is not just my personal decision,\" Kelly told CBS Mornings. He also explained how the company weighs each metric. \"We have a formula. We use lots of data. This isn't us just sticking our finger up in the air and kind of playing favorites. We look at reliability, first and foremost.\"",
      "\"When you buy airfare, you need to get to where you're going, so we give a huge amount \u2014 30% \u2014 to reliability,\" Kelly explained.",
      "Some airlines are going the extra mile to make flying more enjoyable for customers, from the minute they step foot in an airport through touchdown. For that reason, TPG assigned a 25% weight to an airline passenger's experience score to determine its overall ranking.",
      "An airline's cost and reach \u2014 including how expansive its network of destinations is \u2014 was assigned a 20% weight. And one-quarter of an airline's score was determined by the quality of its loyalty of rewards program.",
      "How the airlines stack up",
      "Delta Air Lines topped the list for the seventh year in a row, with its relative strength across all categories earning it the highest ranking, according to TPG. It is the most reliable on-time airline in America. It also provides passengers with free wi-fi, a wide selection of inflight entertainment options and meals from Shake Shack.",
      "United came in second place, rising from third place last year, aided by an improved onboard experience. It could continue to climb the rankings next year after announcing a partnership with JetBlue that will expand the airline's reach and improve perks for its loyalty members, TPG said.",
      "Weighing on the airline, though, is United's outsized presence at Newark Airport, which is suffering from persistent equipment and staffing issues.",
      "Southwest Airlines moved up two spots to earn the No. 3 position. Working in the airline's favor is its low flight cancellation rate, which is the best of any of its competitors. While it scored points in the cost and reach category, recent changes in fee structures could end its reign. It recently ended its popular \"bags fly free\" policy and offers a new, basic economy fare.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-ceo-generative-ai-corporate-workforce/",
    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 17:28:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, said he expects the company to reduce its workforce over the next few years as it rolls out more generative AI and agents.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon's CEO envisions an \"agentic future\" in which AI robots, or agents, replace humans working in the company's offices.",
      "In a\u00a0memo\u00a0to employees made public by Amazon on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy said he expects the company to reduce its corporate workforce in as soon as the next few years, as it leans more heavily on generative AI tools to help fulfill workplace duties.",
      "\"As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,\" Jassy stated. \"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"",
      "Jassy added that this move toward AI would eventually \"reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\" With approximately 1.5 million employees worldwide, the e-commerce giant is the second largest private employer in the United States.",
      "Reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson deferred to the original memo.",
      "Amazon shares dipped slightly on Tuesday, down 0.4% as of 3:45 p.m. EST.",
      "Amazon investing \"quite expansively\" in AI",
      "Amazon is \"investing quite expansively\" in generative AI technology, according to Jassy, adding that \"the progress we are making is evident.\"",
      "\"Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming, and coming fast,\" the CEO stated in the memo.",
      "Amazon ramped up its participation in the generative AI arms race with the release of the Amazon Echo smart speaker in 2014, its first product to include its virtual assistant Alexa. This February, the company\u00a0announced it was unveiling Alexa+, a new version of the AI-powered voice assistant that's \"more conversational, smarter, personalized.\"",
      "AI features have since been incorporated across Amazon's e-commerce websites through tools like \"Buy for Me\" which allow customers to ask a shopping assistant to buy an item for them and \"Recommended Size\" which predicts your clothing size based on past purchases. Amazon's\u00a0AI shopping assistant is used by tens of millions of customers, according to Jassy.",
      "AI replaces creativity for some",
      "In the Tuesday memo, Jassy sketched out a future in which AI agents are used to conduct tedious tasks, freeing up human workers to take on more creative roles.",
      "\"Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point,\" Jassy said. \"We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones.\"",
      "However, this hard-pivot into AI has generated negative feedback from some white-collar employees at the company. Amazon software engineers interviewed recently by the New York Times\u00a0describe\u00a0an intensified work environment in which they are pushed to use AI to increase productivity and meet higher output goals, making their jobs \"more routine, less thoughtful and, crucially, much faster paced.\"",
      "All told, Amazon currently has 1,000 generative AI services and applications either in the works or already built, a \"small fraction\" of what the company ultimately plans to build, said Jassy.",
      "Jassy's pledge to invest in AI comes after the company announced in May that it would cut 100 jobs in its devices and services\u00a0unit, an Amazon spokesperson confirmed.",

    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, President Trump announced Saturday evening, calling them a \"spectacular military success.\"",
      "\"The U.S. military carried out massive precision strikes on the three key nuclear assemblies in the Iranian regime: Fordo, Natanz and Esfahan,\" President Trump said in a national address from the White House Saturday night. \"Our objective was the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and a stop to the nuclear threat posed by the world's number one state sponsor of terror.\"",
      "Prior to his address, the president\u00a0wrote\u00a0on his Truth Social platform that a \"full payload of BOMBS\" was dropped on the \"primary site\" Fordo. The president also said all U.S. planes made it safely out of Iranian air space.",
      "And in second post, Mr. Trump wrote: \"This is an HISTORIC MOMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ISTAEL (sic), AND THE WORLD. IRAN MUST NOW AGREE TO END THIS WAR. THANK YOU!\"",
      "Trump warns Iran against retaliating after U.S. strikes",
      "The president\u00a0addressed the nation\u00a0regarding the strikes late Saturday night, saying that \"Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated\" and issuing a warning to Iran to strive for a peace deal in its war with Israel.",
      "\"There will be either peace, or there will be tragedy for Iran far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days,\" Mr. Trump said while flanked by Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. \"Remember, there are many targets left.\"",
      "Mr. Trump added that \"if peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill. Most of them can be taken out in a matter of minutes.\"",
      "Iran has pledged to retaliate if the U.S. joined the Israeli assault, which began with airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites and military targets on June 13. Iran has responded with missile and drone attacks on Israeli cities.",
      "But in a follow-up social media post following his national address, Mr. Trump said that \"ANY RETALIATION BY IRAN AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL BE MET WITH FORCE FAR GREATER THAN WHAT WAS WITNESSED TONIGHT.\"",
      "What we know so far about the U.S. strikes",
      "Two senior Defense Department officials confirmed to CBS News that three American B-2 bombers were used to strike Fordo early Sunday local time, with each of those B-2s armed with 2 U.S.-produced\u00a0\"bunker-buster\" bombs\u00a0known as the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, or MOPs \u2014 bombs so heavy that they could only be dropped by a B-2.",
      "Fordo, the site of a high-grade uranium enrichment facility\u00a0that international experts believe is key to Iran's nuclear program, is buried almost 300 feet beneath a mountain and protected by significant air defenses. The MOP is believed to be the best chance at destroying the Fordo facility.",
      "The officials told CBS News Natanz and Isfahan were struck by tomahawk missiles launched by submarines. It's unclear how many missiles were launched at those two sites.",
      "The U.S. reached out to Iran diplomatically Saturday to say the strikes are all the U.S. plans and that regime change efforts are not planned, the sources said. Earlier this week, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News that Mr. Trump opposed an Israeli plan to kill Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader.",
      "Not all U.S. allies in the region who house U.S. troops that are part of U.S. Central Command were informed in advance of the coming U.S. plan to strike in Iran, according to diplomatic sources. Some of the allies were informed as the planes were in the air.",
      "The United Nation's International Atomic Energy Agency stated in a social media post that it confirm \"no increase in off-site radiation levels\" in the wake of the U.S. strikes.",
      "What Israeli and Iranian officials are saying",
      "The U.S. alerted Israel ahead of the strikes, two White House officials told CBS News. Mr. Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke following the strikes, the officials said. And in a video address, Netanyahu praised the president for conducting the strikes.",
      "\"President Trump and I often say peace through strength. First comes strength, then comes peace. And tonight President Trump and the United States acted with a lot of strength.\"",
      "According to the Iranian state media outlet IRNA, Morteza Heidari, a spokesman for crisis headquarters in Iran's Qom province, acknowledged there had been attacks on all three nuclear sites. Iran's Atomic Energy Organization also confirmed the attacks in a statement, but claimed the strikes will not stop it from progressing in its nuclear program. It also called on the international community to condemn the attacks.",
      "And in a social media post Sunday morning, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi  said that \"in accordance with\" the United Nations Charter \"and its provisions Iran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people.\"",
      "Araghchi alleged that the U.S. in its attack had \"committed a grave violation of the UN Charter.\"",
      "Homeland Security officials are monitoring for potential physical and cyber reprisals from the U.S. attack, domestically amid a \"very high\" threat level and with the \"red line\" of the Iranian response doctrine now crossed, CBS News has learned.",
      "\"We're in unchartered territory,\" one U.S. intelligence official told CBS News, while speaking about potential Iranian threats to the U.S. homeland. \"We don't know how Iran will react to this because this is the highest rate of tension and conflict we've had in recent history. We're just not sure how the Khomeini regime will react.\"",
      "The official added that assessments range from little to no action on the part of Iranians to desperate and drastic action.",
      "U.S. lawmakers give mixed response",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson was briefed ahead of the strikes, according to a source familiar.",
      "The response from U.S. lawmakers\u00a0has been mixed. Some Republicans, including Johnson, expressed support for the strikes, while others, like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, an ardent Trump supporter, posted on X that \"this is not our fight.\"",
      "Both Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the president for not seeking congressional authorization for the strikes.",
      "\"President Trump misled the country about his intentions, failed to seek congressional authorization for the use of military force and risks American entanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East,\" Jeffries said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement that Mr. Trump campaigned on a promise to \"'end the endless foreign wars.'\"",
      "\"Tonight, he took steps that could drag the United States into another one, without consulting Congress, without a clear strategy, without regard to the consistent conclusions of the intelligence community, and without explaining to the American people what's at stake,\" Warner said.",
      "The events that led up to the surprise strikes",
      "Earlier Saturday, multiple U.S. officials had confirmed to CBS News that B-2 bombers had departed Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri en route to Guam. Multiple U.S. aerial refueling tankers were spotted on commercial flight trackers flying flight patterns consistent with escorting aircraft from the central U.S. to the Pacific.",
      "The U.S. strikes come after Araghchi met with European officials in Geneva Friday and said he was open to further dialogue.",
      "\"Iran is ready to consider diplomacy once again,\" Araghchi said, adding, \"I stress that Iran's defense capabilities are not negotiable. (But) I express our readiness to meet again in the near future.\"",
      "On Thursday, the president said he would decide whether to strike Iran \"within the next two weeks.\" One source told CBS News at the time that Mr. Trump \"believes there's not much choice. Finishing the job means destroying Fordo.\"",
      "U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said earlier Saturday that the U.S. had begun evacuating Americans and green card holders out of Israel aboard assisted departure flights. Two flights departed from Tel Aviv to Athens with approximately 70 U.S. citizens, their accompanying immediate family members and lawful permanent residents, the State Department said prior to Mr. Trump's announcement of the strikes.",
      "Meanwhile, the White House released photos of the Situation Room during the strikes. In the room with the president were Vance, Hegseth, Rubio, chairman of the Joint Chiefs Dan Caine, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino, deputy national security adviser Andy Baker, White House general counsel David Warrington and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.",
      "Gabbard's presence in the room was significant, as on Friday, Mr. Trump told reporters that she was \"wrong\" when she testified to Congress in March that Iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon.",
      "Hegseth and Caine were scheduled to hold a news briefing from the Pentagon at 8 a.m. Eastern Time Sunday to provide an update on the assault.",

      "\"The President gave Iran's leader every opportunity to make a deal, but Iran refused to commit to a nuclear disarmament agreement,\" Johnson\u00a0said in the post. \"President Trump has been consistent and clear that a nuclear-armed Iran will not be tolerated. That posture has now been enforced with strength, precision, and clarity.\"",
      "Texas Sen. Cruz, who has backed of Israeli strikes against Iranian targets, said in a statement: \"As long as Iran was able to access and conduct activities at Fordow, they could still rush to build a nuclear arsenal.

      "Rep. Rick Crawford, Republican chair of the House Intelligence Committee, praised Mr. Trump in a statement and said, \"I have been in touch with the White House before this action and will continue to track developments closely with them in the coming days.\"",
      "The strikes announced by Mr. Trump Saturday evening further escalated the conflict between\u00a0Iran and Israel\u00a0that started June 13. Mr. Trump, on Wednesday,\u00a0was still mulling over\u00a0whether the U.S. military would join Israel's ongoing attacks on Iran.",
      "Before the announcement of the strikes, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia was among the few Republicans who opposed the U.S. action, arguing on social media, \"This is not our fight.\"",

      "Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, reshared Mr. Trump's post on the strikes with a terse comment: \"not constitutional.\" Massie\u00a0introduced a resolution on Tuesday to prohibit U.S. involvement in the conflict. A few days earlier, He pointed out that the power to authorize use of military force rests with Congress, and\u00a0said\u00a0of the Israel-Iran conflict on X, \"This is not our war.

Confronting Iran's ruthless campaign of terror, nuclear ambitions, and regional aggression demands strength, resolve, and strategic clarity. The danger of wider, longer, and more devastating war has now dramatically increased.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Warner, vice chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence, said that while there is \"no question that Iran poses a serious threat to regional stability,\" the president's actions threaten to drag the U.S. into an open-ended conflict \"without consulting Congress\" and \"without a clear strategy.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who cosponsored Massie's resolution seeking to limit Mr. Trump's war powers, said in a statement early Sunday that Congress \"needs to come back to DC immediately to vote\" on the resolution \"to ensure there is no further conflict and escalation.\"",
      "\"Trump's strikes are unconstitutional and put Americans, especially our troops, at risk,\" Khanna said.",
      "Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts\u00a0called on Congress\u00a0to return to Washington to vote on Massie's legislation \"to stop this madness.\"",

      "Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been trying to limit Mr. Trump's ability to order U.S. strikes on Iran amid its ongoing war with Israel, emphasizing that only Congress has the power to declare war under the Constitution. The extent of the president's authority to enter foreign conflicts without the approval of the legislative branch has been questioned in recent years. The last time Congress authorized the use of military force was in 2002, against Iraq.

      "Early Saturday, smoke could be seen rising from an area near a mountain in Isfahan, where a local official said Israel had attacked the nuclear research facility in two waves.",
      "The target was two centrifuge production sites, and the attacks came on top of strikes on other centrifuge production sites elsewhere in recent days, according to an Israeli military official speaking on condition of anonymity under army guidelines to brief reporters. It was the second attack on Isfahan, which was hit in the first 24 hours of the war as part of Israel's goal to destroy the Iranian nuclear program.",

      "The official said part of the reason that Iran's overnight attack had been relatively small was that the military had been targeting its launchers and estimates it has now taken out more than 50% of them.",
      "\"We've been able to take out a large amount of their launchers, creating a bottleneck \u2014 we're making it harder for them to fire toward Israel,\" he said. \"Having said all that, I want to say the Iranian regime obviously still has capabilities.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 21 Jun 2025 20:10:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Iran has long been suspected of hiding work toward a nuclear weapon at its underground Fordo enrichment site.",
    "story": [
      "Update: President Trump announced the U.S. launched strikes\u00a0on three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordo, on Saturday, June 21. Read the latest here.",
      "Iran has two known underground nuclear enrichment sites, the one Israel attacked on the first day of its assault at Natanz, and another at Fordo. Both sit south of Tehran in central Iran, but Fordo has long been the Iranian nuclear facility of most concern to international monitors and experts.",
      "Buried deep in a mountain, Fordo is where many analysts believe Iran has concealed clandestine efforts to work toward a nuclear weapons capability.",
      "As recently as March, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said American intelligence agencies did not believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon, but Israel's military asserted hours after initiating its attack on Iran last week that the U.S. information was outdated, claiming Iran was \"racing towards a nuclear bomb.\"",
      "Israel Defense Forces spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin claimed that the country had intelligence indicating the Iranian regime \"has established a secret program, within the framework of which senior nuclear scientists in Iran secretly conducted the experiments required to build nuclear weapons.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters early Tuesday morning, President Trump appeared to have been swayed. Asked about the assessment Gabbard delivered in March, he said: \"I don't care what she said. I think they were very close to having them.\"",
      "Iran's leaders have always denied any interest in building a nuclear weapon, insisting the program is for civilian purposes. But if that's obfuscation, as Israel insists, and the Iranians are close to a nuclear weapons capability, more than a decade of analysis of Iran's nuclear facilities by experts around the world suggests Fordo would be central to those efforts.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News\u00a0earlier this week that Mr. Trump has been briefed on both the risks and benefits of bombing Fordo, and his mindset is that disabling it is necessary because of the risk of weapons being produced in a relatively short period of time.",
      "Why is Iran's Fordo nuclear site such a concern?",
      "Two experts told CBS News in 2012 \u2014 the last time Netanyahu looked close to attacking Iranian nuclear facilities \u2014 that Fordo, buried almost 300 feet beneath a mountain and protected by significant air defenses, was the most likely location for a hypothetical nuclear weapons \"breakout\" program.",
      "Fordo is \"obviously for nuclear weapons hedging, to preserve centrifuges in case of an attack\" on other, more vulnerable facilities, Mark Fitzpatrick, an expert on Iran's nuclear program at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CBS News in 2012.",
      "Israel attacked the only other nuclear facility known to house significant uranium enrichment facilities in Iran last week, causing damage at Natanz.",
      "But the progress made at Fordo even at that stage, before the U.S.-brokered nuclear deal with Iran brought United Nations inspectors into the country, and since Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of that agreement during his first term, prompting an escalation of Iran's efforts, has remained unverified.",
      "The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, declared Iran non-compliant with its monitoring efforts for the first time in 20 years just hours before Israel attacked. The lack of understanding of Iran's work at the facility has long been a concern, but those concerns have mounted in recent years, since the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal spurred Iran to reduce cooperation with international inspectors and ramp up its enrichment.",
      "In late 2023, Manuel Herrera, a weapons non-proliferation expert with two different European think tanks, said Fordo remained \"one of the main concerns regarding Iran.\"",
      "\"Fordo has always been a major concern because of its location and because of its size,\" Herrera said during a discussion with fellow Iran expert William Alberque, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \"We all knew from the beginning that Fordo was a site that aimed to enrich uranium for weapons purposes, because of its location, because of its size, because of its technical capacity. And\u2026 that the Iranians have been expanding that site and also expanding the stockpile of enriched uranium in that site, should be a concern for us because, actually, we don't have a lot of transparency on what's going on there.\"",
      "Herrera noted that, \"in contrast with Natanz, which is overground, Fordo is underground \u2014 it's a facility which actually has a tunnel structure.\"",
      "Because of its location deep within a mountain, experts believe Israel's best chance at destroying the facility could lie with a U.S.-produced \"bunker-buster\" bomb\u00a0known as the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or MOP \u2014 a bomb is so heavy that it could only be dropped by an American B-2 bomber. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was asked about the possibility at a Senate hearing on Wednesday.",
      "\"It's being reported that the president is being asked to consider providing the bunker-buster bomb that is required to be carried only by the B-2 bomber and would require a U.S. pilot,\" said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat of New Hampshire, pressing Hegseth on whether he had been asked to provide the president with options for striking the Middle East. He declined to answer.",
      "In addition to its well-fortified location and structure, Herrera said Fordo \"has always been assumed to be an enrichment plant with military purposes\" due to the machinery at the site.",
      "He noted that the Iranian regime had boasted in 2019 of installing advanced \"IR-6\" centrifuges at Fordo, capable of enriching uranium to higher purity levels much more quickly than most of its older equipment. In early 2023, the IAEA said it had found uranium particles at Fordo enriched to almost 84% purity, which is incredibly close to the 90% purity uranium that would be required for a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"This tells us that the Iranians at least are experimenting with this kind of uranium enriched level,\" Herrera said.",

      "A British-flagged luxury superyacht that sank off Sicily last year, killing U.K. tech magnate Mike Lynch and six others, resurfaced Saturday as salvage recovery crews finalized the complex operation to bring it ashore for further investigation.",
      "The white top and blue hull of the 184-foot Bayesian was visible on the surface but was not clear of the sea yet in a holding area of a yellow floating crane barge.",
      "\"Pumping out of sea water will continue and it will be lunchtime, following a series of lifting and resting procedures to satisfy the salvage team, before Bayesian is fully and finally out of the water,\" said David Wilson, spokesman for TMC Maritime, which is conducting the recovery operation.",

On Sunday, the vessel will be transported to the Sicilian port of Termini Imerese, where it will be made available for investigators to help determine the cause of the sinking.",
      "The Bayesian sank Aug. 19 off Porticello, near Palermo, during a violent storm as Lynch was treating friends to a cruise to celebrate his acquittal two months earlier in the U.S. on fraud charges. Lynch, his daughter and five others died. Fifteen people survived, including the captain and all crew members except the chef. One survivor reported holding her 1-year-old child above the waves.",
      "Italian authorities are conducting a full criminal investigation.",
      "TMC Maritime said the vessel has been slowly raised from the seabed, 165 feet down, over the past three days to allow the steel lifting straps, slings and harnesses to be secured under the keel. The depth of the wreck requires special precautions. It's far deeper than most recreational divers are certified for. One diver died during an earlier operation to try and raise the ship. In the immediate aftermath of the sinking, recovery crews could only stay for 12-minute shifts. Specialized cave divers were used to help search the wreckage.",
      "Eight steel lifting straps are being used to support the hull upright and to form part of a steel wire lifting system that began raising the vessel out of the water Saturday. As it is lifted up, sea water is pumped out of the hull.",
      "TMC Maritime said the vessel will be held upright, out of the water, for checks and preparations for its final journey.",
      "The floating crane platform will then move the Bayesian to Termini Imerese, where a special steel cradle is waiting for it.",
      "The Bayesian is missing its 236-foot mast, which was cut off and left on the seabed for future removal. The mast had to be detached to allow the hull to be brought to a nearly upright position that would allow the craft to be raised.",
      "British investigators said in an interim report issued last month that the yacht was knocked over by \"extreme wind\" and couldn't recover.",
      "The report said the Bayesian had chosen the site where it sank as shelter from forecast thunderstorms. Wind speeds exceeded 70 knots, or 81 miles per hour, at the time of the sinking and \"violently\" knocked the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds.",

    "summary": "There's a narrow window to bring the Israel-Iran conflict to an end before President Trump decides whether to involve the U.S. in the Israeli offensive.",
    "story": [
      "Diplomacy will have a \"last shot\" within the next two weeks to bring the Israel-Iran conflict to an end, according to one American and one European diplomatic official, a window set by President Trump this week as he decides whether to involve the U.S. in Israel's offensive against Iran.",
      "Those efforts were underway Friday as Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European foreign ministers in Geneva in the face of Israel's ongoing bombing campaign and the U.S. military buildup in the region.",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and the top European Union diplomat, Kaja Kallas, attended the Geneva meeting with Aragchi. Lammy had met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff at the White House Thursday.",
      "The Geneva meeting lasted nearly four hours \u2014 twice as long as scheduled \u2014 and afterward, Barrot indicated there would be further talks and told reporters \"the problem of Iran's nuclear program cannot be solved by military means\" alone. Lammy said, \"We were clear: Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "Araghchi, too, spoke after the meeting and said Iran supported continuing discussions.",
      "\"Iran is ready to consider diplomacy once again,\" he said, adding, \"I stress that Iran's defense capabilities are not negotiable. (But) I express our readiness to meet again in the near future.\"",
      "Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei remains the ultimate decision-maker, and it's not yet clear whether the ongoing Israeli airstrikes and impending threat of U.S. involvement will move him any closer toward a diplomatic off ramp than when Witkoff last offered a proposal a few weeks ago. The U.S. offer, which is still on the table, would have allowed Iran to have a civilian nuclear program if it agreed not to enrich uranium on its soil. Instead, Iran would be able to purchase enriched fuel from other countries. One suggestion involved an Omani idea to establish a regional consortium that would allow enrichment for civilian purposes under monitoring by the IAEA and U.S.",
      "Khamenei, 86, is thought to still be battling cancer and is in hiding from the Israeli strikes. He has not responded to overtures from multiple countries seeking to help de-escalate the conflict.",
      "It's not entirely clear how functional the Iranian government is at this moment. Internet connectivity and international calls into Iran are difficult to complete, according to sources in the region. Cyber attacks have paralyzed the banking system, and as of Thursday, multiple diplomats acknowledged factors like these have made it more difficult to arrange in-person talks with Aragchi.",
      "The ongoing Israeli assault may also make Khamenei fearful about communicating, given concerns about avoiding signals intelligence intercepts that could be used to target him, one diplomatic source suggested.",
      "Anything Aragchi discusses with the West will ultimately need the supreme leader's approval, and U.S. expectations for a breakthrough during this meeting are low. But it's a start.",
      "It remains to be seen if the conversation in Geneva produced some indication of whether Iran is still open to direct talks with the U.S. \u2014 not just the European nations \u2014 which is what Witkoff has also been trying to initiate through his own personal outreach, one U.S. official said.",
      "Turkey and Oman, as well as European countries including Italy and Norway, have offered to host direct or indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran, if Tehran were to choose that path, according to two European diplomatic sources. The Italian foreign minister said Rubio told him Thursday that the U.S. is ready for direct negotiations with Iranian counterparts, and a French diplomat also said Rubio had also conveyed the same message to Barrot. The French foreign minister and secretary of state are expected to speak again after the Geneva consultations.",
      "Mr. Trump has expressed frustration in recent weeks that although Iran has come to the negotiating table, its leaders have shown no willingness to actually negotiate. Iran offered no response for two weeks to Witkoff's most recent U.S. proposal and neither declined nor accepted its terms, a U.S. official familiar with the efforts told CBS News. Instead, Iranian leaders issued press statements, but negotiators did not directly engage on the specifics or discuss the terms of the offer. That lack of substantive engagement raised doubts from the Trump administration about whether Iran was engaging in good-faith negotiations or simply running out the clock.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has openly questioned whether Iran's leaders were playing with Mr. Trump and used that uncertainty to justify his unilateral decision to launch military strikes. Multiple U.S. and foreign diplomats indicated that Mr. Trump did not bless the strikes or explicitly tell Netanyahu he should proceed with them. Diplomatic sources acknowledge that Iran's leaders may also be wondering about the degree of coordination between the U.S. and Israel and may also be uncertain about whether the U.S.-initiated diplomacy was a ruse to justify the use of military force that Netanyahu has long advocated.",
      "But one U.S. official maintained that Mr. Trump's interest in diplomacy was genuine, as is his aversion to drawing the U.S. military into a Mideast war \u2014 especially without a clear sense of what would come next, should the Iranian regime collapse.",
      "U.S. and European diplomats confirmed that there are confidential conversations about who would lead Iran next, whether the nuclear sites and material can be secured, and the potential environmental and health fallout for regional allies from military strikes on nuclear facilities.",
      "In the meantime, the president still has the option of choosing to use military force including the potential of using for the first time in history the MOP or massive ordnance penetrator, a 30,000-pound bunker-buster bomb, to destroy the underground nuclear facilities at Fordo.",
      "In theory, Mr. Trump maintains the ability to launch a strike while he's out of town at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Friday and Saturday, sources said. A secure suite is set up before he arrives at any out-of-town location, and he also has access to secure communications that would allow him to give an order while en route. While at his Florida golf resort, Mar-a-Lago, he ordered a strike on Syria in 2017, and on an Iranian general in 2020.",
      "In the meantime, the U.S. intelligence assessment remains that Khamenei has not ordered the resumption of the nuclear weapons program that Iran suspended in 2003.

      "Additionally, Chinese farmland has become a topic of conversation in the wake of revelations that Israel\u2019s attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities was aided by\u00a0years of covert planning, surveillance and infiltration by Israeli intelligence.",

In recent years, tax preparation companies, accounting software vendors and data brokers have all found themselves in the crosshairs of increasingly aggressive ransomware gangs.

      "If your information was part of the Optima breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Optima data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Monitor your accounts and transactions:\u00a0The Optima data breach might have revealed bank details to attackers, which means they can misuse those details to steal your money. You should check your online accounts and transactions regularly for any suspicious or unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, immediately report it to the service provider or authorities. You should also review your credit reports and scores to see if there are any signs of identity theft or fraud. To report identity theft, visit the FTC\u2019s\u00a0IdentityTheft.gov.",
      "3. \u00a0Contact your bank and credit card companies:\u00a0Since Optima hackers might have obtained bank and credit card information, they could use it to make purchases or withdrawals without your consent. You should inform your bank and credit card companies of the situation. They can help you freeze or cancel your cards, dispute any fraudulent charges and issue new cards for you. You should also contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies \u2014 Equifax, Experian or TransUnion \u2014 and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file. This will make it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name without verification.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you. One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "5. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Optima hackers most likely have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. Two-factor authentication requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Optima breach is not an isolated event, but part of a larger failure to adapt to the sophistication of modern ransomware groups. When companies with access to tax and identity data are compromised, it\u2019s not just an internal issue; it becomes a national one. For an industry built on trust, breaches like this erode public confidence in systems that are already strained. Attacks like these raise fresh concerns about the cybersecurity preparedness of companies that handle tax and financial data. Unlike login credentials or email addresses, stolen tax information cannot be easily reset. For victims, the consequences of such a breach could stretch across years.",

    "story": [
      "A growing number of fire departments across the country are turning to artificial intelligence to help detect and respond to wildfires more quickly.",
      "Every time you ask ChatGPT a question, to generate an image or let artificial intelligence summarize your email, something big is happening behind the scenes. Not on your device, but in sprawling data centers filled with servers, GPUs and cooling systems that require massive amounts of electricity.",
      "The modern AI boom is pushing our power grid to its limits. ChatGPT alone processes roughly 1 billion queries per day, each requiring data center resources far beyond what\u2019s on your device.",
      "In fact, the energy needed to support artificial intelligence is rising so quickly that it has already delayed the retirement of several coal plants in the U.S., with more delays expected. Some experts warn that the AI arms race is outpacing the infrastructure meant to support it. Others argue it could spark long-overdue clean energy innovation.",
      "AI isn't just reshaping apps and search engines. It's also reshaping how we build, fuel and regulate the digital world. The race to scale up AI capabilities is accelerating faster than most infrastructure can handle, and energy is becoming the next major bottleneck.",

      "ChatGPT on a computer\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why AI uses so much power, and what drives the demand",
      "Running artificial intelligence at scale requires enormous computational power. Unlike traditional internet activity, which mostly involves pulling up stored information, AI tools perform intensive real-time processing. Whether training massive language models or responding to user prompts, AI systems rely on specialized hardware like GPUs (graphics processing unit) that consume far more power than legacy servers. GPUs are designed to handle many calculations in parallel, which is perfect for the matrix-heavy workloads that power generative AI and deep learning systems.",
      "To give you an idea of scale: one Nvidia H100 GPU, commonly used in AI training, consumes up to 700 watts on its own. Training a single large AI model like GPT-4 may require thousands of these GPUs running continuously for weeks. Multiply that across dozens of models and hundreds of data centers, and the numbers escalate quickly. A traditional data center rack might use around 8 kilowatts (kW) of power. An AI-optimized rack using GPUs can demand 45-55 kW or more. Multiply that across an entire building or campus of racks, and the difference is staggering.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Cooling all that hardware adds another layer of energy demand. Keeping AI servers from overheating accounts for 30-55% of a data center's total power use. Advanced cooling methods like liquid immersion are helping, but scaling those across the industry will take time.",
      "On the upside, AI researchers are developing more efficient ways to run these systems. One promising approach is the \"mixture of experts\" model architecture, which activates only a portion of the full model for each task. This method can significantly reduce the amount of energy required without sacrificing performance.",
      "How much power are we talking about?",
      "In 2023, global data centers consumed about 500 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity. That is enough to power every home in California, Texas and Florida combined for an entire year. By 2030, the number could triple, with AI as the main driver.",
      "To put it into perspective, the average home uses about 30 kilowatt-hours per day. One terawatt-hour is a billion times larger than a kilowatt-hour. That means 1 TWh could power 33 million homes for a day.",
      "Data center\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5 AI TERMS YOU KEEP HEARING AND WHAT THEY ACTUALLY MEAN",
      "AI\u2019s energy demand is outpacing the power grid",
      "The demand for AI is growing faster than the energy grid can adapt. In the U.S., data center electricity use is expected to surpass 600 TWh by 2030, tripling current levels. Meeting that demand requires the equivalent of adding 14 large power plants to the grid. Large AI data centers can each require 100\u2013500 megawatts (MW), and the largest facilities may soon exceed 1 gigawatt (GW), which is about as much as a nuclear power plant or a small U.S. state. One 1 GW data center could consume more power than the entire city of San Francisco. Multiply that by a few dozen campuses across the country, and you start to see how quickly this demand adds up.",
      "To keep up, utilities across the country are delaying coal plant retirements, expanding natural gas infrastructure and shelving clean energy projects. In states like Utah, Georgia and Wisconsin, energy regulators have approved new fossil fuel investments directly linked to data center growth. By 2035, data centers could account for 8.6% of all U.S. electricity demand, up from 3.5% today.",
      "Despite public pledges to support sustainability, tech companies are inadvertently driving a fossil fuel resurgence. For the average person, this shift could increase electricity costs, strain regional energy supplies and complicate state-level clean energy goals.",
      "Power grid facility\u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can big tech keep its green energy promises?",
      "Tech giants Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta all claim they are working toward a net-zero emissions future. In simple terms, this means balancing the amount of greenhouse gases they emit with the amount they remove or offset, ideally bringing their net contribution to climate change down to zero.",
      "These companies purchase large amounts of renewable energy to offset their usage and invest in next-generation energy solutions. For example, Microsoft has a contract with fusion start-up Helion to supply clean electricity by 2028.",
      "However, critics argue these clean energy purchases do not reflect the reality on the ground. Because the grid is shared, even if a tech company buys solar or wind power on paper, fossil fuels often fill the gap for everyone else.",
      "Some researchers say this model is more beneficial for company accounting than for climate progress. While the numbers might look clean on a corporate emissions report, the actual energy powering the grid still includes coal and gas.\u00a0Microsoft,\u00a0Google and\u00a0Amazon have pledged to power their data centers with 100% renewable energy, but because the grid is shared, fossil fuels often fill the gap when renewables aren\u2019t available.",
      "Some critics argue that voluntary pledges alone are not enough. Unlike traditional industries, there is no standardized regulatory framework requiring tech companies to disclose detailed energy usage from AI operations. This lack of transparency makes it harder to track whether green pledges are translating into meaningful action, especially as workloads shift to third-party contractors or overseas operations.",

      "AI CYBERSECURITY RISKS AND DEEPFAKE SCAMS ON THE RISE",
      "The future of clean energy for AI and its limits",
      "To meet soaring energy needs without worsening emissions, tech companies are investing in advanced energy projects. These include small nuclear reactors built directly next to data centers, deep geothermal systems and nuclear fusion.",
      "While promising, these technologies face enormous technical and regulatory hurdles. Fusion, for example, has never reached commercial break-even, meaning it has yet to produce more energy than it consumes. Even the most optimistic experts say we may not see scalable fusion before the 2030s.",
      "Beyond the technical barriers, many people have concerns about the safety, cost and long-term waste management of new nuclear systems. While proponents argue these designs are safer and more efficient, public skepticism remains a real hurdle. Community resistance is also a factor. In some regions, proposals for nuclear microreactors or geothermal drilling have faced delays due to concerns over safety, noise and environmental harm. Building new data centers and associated power infrastructure can take up to seven years, due to permitting, land acquisition and construction challenges.",
      "Google recently activated a geothermal project in Nevada, but it only generates enough power for a few thousand homes. The next phase may be able to power a single data center by 2028. Meanwhile, companies like Amazon and Microsoft continue building sites that consume more power than entire citie.",
      "SCAMMERS CAN EXPLOIT YOUR DATA FROM JUST ONE CHATGPT SEARCH",
      "Will AI help or harm the environment?",
      "This is the central debate. Advocates argue that AI could ultimately help accelerate climate progress by optimizing energy grids, modeling emissions patterns and inventing better clean technology. Microsoft and Google have both cited these uses in their public statements. But critics warn that the current trajectory is unsustainable. Without major breakthroughs or stricter policy frameworks, the energy cost of AI may overwhelm climate gains. A recent forecast estimated that AI could add 1.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide to global emissions between 2025 and 2030, roughly 4% more than the entire annual emissions of the U.S.",
      "Water use, rare mineral demand and land-use conflicts are also emerging concerns as AI infrastructure expands. Large data centers often require millions of gallons of water for cooling each year, which can strain local water supplies. The demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements \u2014 used in servers, cooling systems and power electronics \u2014 creates additional pressure on supply chains and mining operations. In some areas, communities are pushing back against land being rezoned for large-scale tech development.",
      "Rapid hardware turnover is also adding to the environmental toll. As AI systems evolve quickly, older GPUs and accelerators are replaced more frequently, creating significant electronic waste. Without strong recycling programs in place, much of this equipment ends up in landfills or is exported to developing countries.",
      "The question isn\u2019t just whether AI can become cleaner over time. It\u2019s whether we can scale the infrastructure needed to support it without falling back on fossil fuels. Meeting that challenge will require tighter collaboration between tech companies, utilities and policymakers. Some experts warn that AI could either help fight climate change or make it worse, and the outcome depends entirely on how we choose to power the future of computing.",
      "HOW TO LOWER YOUR CAR INSURANCE COSTS IN 2025",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "AI is revolutionizing how we work, but it is also transforming how we use energy. Data centers powering AI systems are becoming some of the world\u2019s largest electricity consumers. Tech companies are betting big on futuristic solutions, but the reality is that many fossil fuel plants are staying online longer just to meet AI\u2019s rising energy demand.

      "1. Avoid downloading apps from ads or unknown sources: Crocodilus often spreads through ads on social media platforms like Facebook. These ads promote apps that look like banking tools, e-commerce platforms or even crypto wallets. If you click and install one, you might be unknowingly downloading malware. Always search for apps directly on trusted platforms like the Google Play Store. Do not install anything from random links, especially those shared through ads, messages or unfamiliar websites.",
      "2. Avoid suspicious links and install strong antivirus protection: Crocodilus spreads through deceptive ads and fake app links. These can look like legitimate banking tools, crypto apps or browser updates. Clicking on them may quietly install malware that hijacks your contacts, monitors your screen or steals login credentials. To stay safe, avoid clicking on links from unknown sources, especially those that promise rewards or warn of urgent problems. Installing strong antivirus software on your Android device adds another layer of protection. It can scan downloads, block malicious behavior and warn you about phishing attempts before they become a bigger issue.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Review app permissions carefully before and after installation: Before you install an app, take a moment to look at the permissions it asks for. If a shopping app wants access to your contacts, messages or screen, that is a red flag. After installing, go to your phone settings and double-check what permissions the app actually has. Malware like Crocodilus relies on overreaching permissions to steal data and gain control. If anything seems unnecessary, revoke the access or uninstall the app entirely.",
      "4. Keep your Android device updated at all times: Security patches are released regularly to block known vulnerabilities. Crocodilus is designed to take advantage of outdated systems and bypass newer Android restrictions. By\u00a0updating your phone and apps regularly, you reduce the chances of malware slipping through. Set your device to install updates automatically when possible and check manually every so often if you are not sure.",
      "5. Consider using a data removal or monitoring service:\u00a0While not a direct defense against malware, data removal services can help minimize the damage if your information has already been leaked or sold. These services monitor your personal data on the dark web and offer guidance if your credentials have been compromised. In a case like Crocodilus, where malware may harvest and transmit banking info or crypto keys, knowing your data exposure early can help you act before scammers do.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "6. Turn on Google Play Protect: Google Play Protect is a built-in security feature on Android phones that scans your apps for anything suspicious. To stay protected, make sure it\u2019s turned on. You can check this by opening the Play Store, tapping your profile icon and selecting Play Protect. From there, you can see if it's active and run a manual scan of all your installed apps. While it may not catch everything, especially threats from outside the Play Store, it\u2019s still an important first layer of defense against harmful apps like Crocodilus.",
      "7. Be skeptical of unfamiliar contacts or urgent messages: One of the newer tricks Crocodilus uses is modifying your contact list. It can add fake entries that look like customer service numbers or bank helplines. So, if you receive a call from \"Bank Support,\" it might not be real. Always verify phone numbers through official websites or documents. The same applies to messages asking for personal details or urgent logins. When in doubt, do not respond or click any links. Contact your bank or service provider directly.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Crocodilus is one of the most advanced Android banking Trojans seen so far. It spreads through social media ads, hides inside apps that look real and collects sensitive data like banking passwords and crypto seed phrases. It can also add fake contacts to your phone to trick you during scam calls. If you use Android, avoid downloading apps from links in ads or messages. Only install apps from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. Keep your phone updated, and be careful if something looks too good to be true because it probably is.",

      "ANYmal-D, a four-legged robot that can play badminton with people\u00a0 (ETH Zurich)",
      "How does ANYmal-D play badminton with humans?",
      "Badminton is a game that requires quick footwork, fast reactions, and precise hand-eye coordination. To give a robot a chance on the court, the\u00a0ETH Zurich team equipped ANYmal-D with four legs for stability and agility, a dynamic arm to swing the racket, and a stereo camera to track the shuttlecock. The robot uses a reinforcement learning-based controller, which allows it to predict and react to the shuttlecock's movement in real-time. ANYmal-D can move around the court, adjust its posture, and time its swings, keeping rallies going with human players for up to 10 shots.",
      "NO TENNIS PARTNER? NO WORRIES WITH THIS AI ROBOT",
      "The technology behind ANYmal-D's badminton skills",
      "ANYmal-D's stereo camera serves as its eyes, constantly monitoring the shuttlecock. The robot uses a \"perception noise model\" to compare what it sees with data from its training, helping it track the shuttlecock even when it moves unpredictably. The robot can pitch its body to keep the shuttlecock in view, mimicking how a human player might lean in for a tricky shot.",

      "Coordinating legs and an arm is tough for any robot.

On average, it took about 0.357 seconds to process the shuttlecock's trajectory after a human hit, leaving just over half a second to get into position and make the shot.

      "5. Use alias email addresses:\u00a0Create separate email addresses for things like online shopping, sign-ups, and banking.

These calls often come from spoofed or international numbers and may include\u00a0fake IRS agents,\u00a0tech support scams, or phony insurance offers. To fight back, enable your phone carrier's spam call protection (AT&T ActiveArmor, Verizon Call Filter, or T-Mobile Scam Shield). You can also use third-party apps like RoboKiller, Hiya, or Truecaller to screen calls, block known scam numbers, and report suspicious callers. Be sure to avoid answering unknown calls, even pressing a button to \"opt out\" can confirm your number is active and lead to more spam.

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Apps like Venmo, Zelle, Cash App, and PayPal have changed how we move money. They are fast and convenient, but with that ease comes exposure. If you send funds to the wrong person, they are likely gone for good. There is often no real path to recovery, especially when the recipient disappears behind a fake username and an unresponsive support system.",
      "This vulnerability becomes even more dangerous in moments of crisis. During natural disasters, high-profile social movements, or health emergencies, people are moved to give. Scammers know this and exploit the impulse. One such scam involved a fake Venmo account pretending to collect donations for a Minnesota nonprofit after the death of George Floyd. The account looked legitimate, but the funds never reached the organization.",
      "A similar scam is targeting Miles Perret Cancer Services, a nonprofit based in Louisiana. Scammers have created a fraudulent Venmo account that closely mimics the legitimate Venmo handle of the cancer nonprofit organization. They are using this fake account to trick well-meaning donors into sending money, believing they are supporting the real charity.",

      "Instead of helping, Venmo routed Rinaldi through generic FAQs and legal disclaimers. Even after he was connected with a live support agent, the responses were standard scripts. He was told that the issue had been escalated, but no one could provide a timeline beyond a vague window of three to five business days.",

Take a known nonprofit, tweak the username slightly, and ride the momentum of goodwill. By the time anyone catches on, the money is gone and the damage is done.",
      "The incident involving MPCS is not an isolated case. In December 2024, Final Victory Animal Rescue, a nonprofit based in South Carolina,\u00a0discovered a Venmo account impersonating the organization and collecting donations intended for the real charity.

      "1) Always access the payment app from the official app or website, and not from any third-party platforms or services.",
      "2) Look at the security settings that the payment app offers and make sure they\u2019re all set to the highest and most protective settings.",
      "3) Consider using a personal data removal service to protect your privacy and reduce your risk of scams.\u00a0Scammers who target payment apps like Venmo, Zelle, Cash App, and PayPal often rely on information found on data broker and people-search sites to craft convincing impersonations or phishing attempts. These sites can list your name, address, phone number, and even connections to organizations you support, making it easier for fraudsters to trick you or others into sending money to fake accounts.",
      "Personal data removal services work by automatically removing your information from hundreds of data broker sites, making it much harder for scammers to find and misuse your details. By scrubbing your data from these sources, you lower your risk of being targeted in payment app scams and reduce the likelihood that someone could impersonate you or a nonprofit you care about.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "4) Create a strong, unique and complex password for each of your mobile payment apps and change it often. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication, which means that you need to enter a code or use your fingerprint or face to unlock your account to prevent unauthorized access. This way, even if someone knows your password, they can\u2019t log in without your device or confirmation.",
      "6) Lock your device and log out of your apps. You should always lock your phone with a password, PIN, pattern, fingerprint, or face. Never share your password, PIN, or security code with anyone. You should also log out of your mobile payment apps after each use and turn off the auto-login feature. This way, even if someone takes or borrows your device, they can\u2019t access your mobile payment apps without your approval.",
      "7) Verify the identity and legitimacy of the sender or receiver. You should always check the name, photo, username, and contact information of the person or organization you are sending money to or receiving money from before accepting or sending any payment requests. You should also confirm the reason and amount of the transaction before you agree to it. If you are not sure or have any doubts, you should contact the person or organization directly through another way, such as a phone call, text message, or email, but only if you know for sure that those forms of communication are legitimate. You should never send money or give your account details to anyone you don\u2019t know or trust, or anyone who asks you to do so out of the blue.",
      "8) Link your Venmo to a credit card as opposed to a debit card, so you can dispute a charge from scammers more easily. However, keep in mind, linking a credit card to your payment app can provide additional protection in the event of fraud, but this can come with extra costs in terms of transaction fees.",
      "9) Try not to keep a balance in your money-transferring apps.\u00a0You have a much better chance of being helped by your bank or credit card company when it comes to fraud than you do from a money-transferring app.",
      "10) Use strong antivirus software and never click on links from unknown sources,\u00a0especially when an email or text appears to have come from the payment App. Protect yourself from accidentally clicking on malicious links by running antivirus software on your device.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "11) Monitor your account activity and report any suspicious or unauthorized transactions.\u00a0You should set up notifications from your payment app and your bank via text or email, and check your account activity regularly. Look for any signs of fraud, such as payments you didn\u2019t make or receive, or changes to your account settings or information.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Unlike traditional banks, which are bound by federal consumer protection laws and fraud resolution timelines, peer-to-peer payment apps operate in a much looser regulatory environment. Services like Venmo often state in their user agreements that they are not responsible for mistaken or unauthorized payments unless there is clear evidence of account compromise or technical malfunction. Venmo\u2019s only suggestion here was to respond to a support ticket and wait. There was no emergency fraud hotline, no dedicated contact for nonprofits, and no indication that urgent action would be taken. Payment apps that allow donations to flow as quickly as a text message must also bear the responsibility of keeping those transactions safe. When a nonprofit has to beg for support just to protect its own identity, something is broken.",

Imagine a robot that can help with chores or serve as a hands-on learning tool. HopeJR is designed to be just that.",
      "One of the biggest talking points is price. Hugging Face aims to keep HopeJR affordable, with an estimated cost of around $3,000.

      "Phishing is one of the most common ways scammers can access your personal information. Many people fall victim to it every day, which is why this email we received was not surprising.",
      "Just ask \"Pamela,\" who wrote to us: \"I thought I couldn't be scammed, but I almost was.\"",

      "Facebook scam warning: How Pamela almost fell for a tech support hoax",
      "\"I was working on my Facebook and it suddenly had a screen flash and voice that said the computer was locked and I needed to call a number to report the breach. I thought it was Microsoft so I called the number. The guy was good. He gave me a name and employee number and we went through some things on my computer which brought up a screen that said 'scammers were listening' and my IP was being used on the Porn Hub. I thought, how could that be? But still, I was obtuse.",
      "\"The screen listed what he said were all my credit cards that had been compromised, but only the beginning numbers: 3xxx, 4xxx, 5xxx, etc. He said in order to make a report to the FTC I needed to tell him all of the numbers. I told him I was not going to do that even though he insisted I had to for the 'report.' Then he said he would transfer me to the FTC and gave me a number in case we were disconnected. A different guy answered, gave me his name and said he was Andrew Ferguson, head of the FTC.",
      "\"I've been in politics and business for over 50 years. I looked him up while still on the phone and realized the head of the FTC wouldn't be answering a support line. When I refused to give him my information, he yelled that my IP was being used on porn sites and didn't want to stop it. I hung up.",
      "\"I have great virus software on all my devices and use two-step authentication for almost everything - but I still almost fell for it. I'm sharing this story to help others.\"",
      "Pamela was fortunate. Her security measures and quick thinking saved her, but these tactics are becoming more common and more aggressive. Here's what you can do to stay safe.",
      "Beware of pop-up scams that impersonate Microsoft or the FTC",
      "Scammers often use alarming pop-up messages or automated voices claiming your device is compromised, urging you to call a number for help. As described in Pamela's experience, a pop-up claimed her computer was locked and played a voice message directing her to call what appeared to be a Microsoft support number. The scammer then impersonated both a Microsoft employee and a government official, using fake names and employee numbers, and tried to pressure her into revealing sensitive information.",
      "If you ever receive a pop-up or voice message claiming your device is at risk, do not call the number provided or share any personal information. Instead, contact the organization directly using official contact details from their website. Legitimate companies and government agencies will never ask you to provide sensitive information or credit card numbers over the phone in response to unsolicited pop-ups or calls.",
      "Protect your online accounts with strong, unique passwords",
      "Make sure each of your online accounts has a unique password. This prevents scammers from accessing multiple accounts if one gets compromised. While password generators provide secure passwords, you can also easily create one that's hard to crack by looking at three random things in the room and using them to form a password.\u00a0Consider using a\u00a0password manager for strong, unique passwords. A password manager helps you generate and securely store complex, unique passwords for each of your accounts. This prevents you from reusing passwords and makes it much harder for scammers to access multiple accounts if one is compromised.

      "Check URLs carefully before you click them, and use strong antivirus software",
      "Verify links before clicking them, especially if they come from someone who randomly contacted you on the internet. Scammers often use URLs that look similar to legitimate sites, but they typically contain slight misspellings or different domains (e.g., payepal.com or Microsoft.xyz). Also, install and update strong antivirus software.Protect all your devices, including computers, tablets, and smartphones, with strong antivirus software. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Be cautious with personal information on social media",
      "Think twice before sharing personal details, such as your birthday, address, or even your pet's name. Scammers can use information from your social media profiles to guess passwords or craft personalized\u00a0phishing attacks.",

      "HOW HACKERS ARE BREAKING INTO APPLE DEVICES THROUGH AIRPLAY",
      "Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) on all accounts",
      "Don't limit\u00a0MFA to just your main accounts. Enable it wherever possible, including email, social media, and financial services. Multifactor authentication adds an extra step to the login process, making it significantly harder for scammers to gain access, even if they have your password.",
      "Use a personal data removal service to clean up your online footprint",
      "Scammers often scour the internet for your personal information. Using a personal data removal service can help reduce the amount of your sensitive data available online, making it harder for scammers to target you with convincing attacks. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Monitor your bank accounts, credit cards, and credit reports for any unusual or unauthorized activity. Early detection is key. If you spot something suspicious, report it immediately to your financial institution and the proper authorities.",
      "Back up your important data regularly",
      "Ransomware and other attacks can lock you out of your files. Regularly\u00a0back up your important data to an external hard drive or a secure cloud service. This ensures you can recover your information if your device is compromised.",
      "Report online scams to these official authorities",
      "If you encounter a scam, reporting it to the proper authorities can help you recover lost funds and prevent others from falling victim to the same scam. By reporting scams, you contribute to a database that allows law enforcement to track patterns and catch criminals. Places you can report to include the\u00a0FTC, your local FBI office, the\u00a0IC3 and your state's consumer protection office.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Keep in mind that scammers are constantly evolving their tactics. You must always be on guard. Do not rely too heavily on technology to protect you, since there is a psychological aspect to their methods as well. Have a skeptical mindset and trust your instincts. By sharing experiences and staying informed, we strengthen our community's defense against cybercrime.",

      "\"We receive inquiries regarding practically every major social cause imaginable, and the anti-ICE demonstrations are no exception,\" Adam Swart, the CEO and founder of Crowds on Demand, told Fox News Digital. \"The fact that we receive requests does not mean we take them, in many cases because the budget does not match the ambition.\"",
      "Swart added that they have received \"numerous high budget requests\" regarding the anti-ICE demonstrations, but declined those offers due to the fact \"that they do not want to get close to any form of illegal activity, including violence, vandalism or blocking off roads without a permit.\"",
      "Swart, who started Crowds on Demand in 2012 when he was a student at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) to \"change how advocacy is done,\" shared how they support causes and how to spot if these protests are tied to other companies and organizations.",

      "\"Now what you're seeing from the agitators should not be logged in with the broader protest movement, and that is because there is a group of agitators who attach themselves to every cause and use that cause as an excuse to loot, to be violent, and to create disruption,\" Swart said.",
      "\"They do not care about those causes, they merely care about looting and destruction. These are pirates. These are psychopaths, and their behavior should not be tolerated, and their actions should not be used to delegitimize peaceful demonstrators.\"",
      "Swart said that some of these groups have informants inside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).",
      "\"Activist groups are (likely) receiving tipoffs about ICE raid locations, allowing them to stage protests before law enforcement even arrives,\" Swart shared.",
      "\"I strongly believe that there are ICE informants who are providing information to demonstrators about the locations of the raids. The reason why I believe that is that there were hundreds of demonstrators that showed up with just a few minutes' notice at the locations of the raids. That is difficult to do,\" he continued.",
      "Swart said this is all speculation on his part, and he has no specific information on how the riots might be funded.",
      "\"While I don't have direct information that the protesters are being paid, I strongly believe that many of the protesters are being compensated,\" he explained. \"How do I know this? Because when you can gather hundreds of people at the wee hours of the morning or the late hours of night with zero notice with just a text message within a 10-minute period, that sounds a lot more like a rapid reaction force than a group of passionate demonstrators.\"",

      "Tactical gear is a red flag",
      "Swart said the most important factor to determine whether these rioters are being funded is the use of tactical gear.",
      "\"Another tip that these guys are funded is the fact that they have tactical gear. Tactical gear is extremely expensive and the fact they're passing out hundreds of tactical gear uniforms is an indication that there's some money. Who is funding these groups?\" Swart questioned.",

      "California lawmakers need to address real issue",
      "Swart said that what these violent protests are doing is turning people away from the cause and deterring the public from wanting to support their mission.",
      "\"Blocking streets is not the way you do that, you know? The way you do that is respectful advocacy, communication, and it's hard to say Trump is the agent of chaos when it's people who are on your side who are throwing Molotov cocktails, blocking streets and preventing access for single moms getting to work to pick up their kids. That doesn't sound like liberal values to me,\" Swart said.",
      "With their positions in power, Swart urged Gov. Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass to get in front of the mess and restore law and order.",
      "\"If you arrest people for violence, but then they're put back on the street in two hours, they will continue violence. If the ultimate penalty for violent offenders is some sort of diversion program with a few-hundred-dollar fine, then there will be more violence,\" Swart explained. \"So the reality is, until you increase the penalties for violence, until you have mass arrests, then nothing will change in the state of California.\"",
      "\"Gavin Newsom knows what people want. He just doesn't think they deserve it. He's kind of like this symbol of what's wrong with the Democratic Party, because he preaches a lot, but he never practices,\" Swart said. \"He never practices anything he preaches, and it's really a sad state of affairs that he has left it (California) in.\"",

Meanwhile, the international community is beginning to realize that the Islamic Republic has no future. Our discussions about a post-Islamic Republic Iran have begun.\"",

      "Taleblu cautioned that both the Iranian opposition and Western governments have failed to prepare for regime collapse because of a long-standing reluctance to engage with the idea of regime change. \"By not being able to articulate the necessary political strategy... we are most unprepared,\" he said.",
      "Beni Sabti, an Iran expert at Israel\u2019s Institute for National Security Studies, sees four scenarios emerging from the current moment \u2014 one of which, he warns, is far worse than the others.",
      "\"The Iranian people are currently leaderless, low-energy, and disillusioned since the women\u2019s protests,\" Sveti told Fox News Digital. \"One scenario is collapse from within, similar to the Soviet Union. A brigade commander inside the Revolutionary Guards, supported by a circle of loyalists, could decide to rebel from within the regime.\"",
      "Sabti said that after Israel eliminated many Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) generals, Iran\u2019s regular army may now be better positioned to rise. \"It might even align with disillusioned elements of the revolutionary guards,\" he said. \"Because they know the system and its bureaucracy, insiders could quietly organize something from within. There would be casualties, but it could unfold as a relatively quiet historical event.\"",

      "Taleblu supports the idea that a regime transition could emerge from within, but notes that Iran has spent decades \"coup-proofing.\"",
      "\"It has promoted more based on zeal than capability. So it's less likely that you could have a classic military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat emerge,\" he said. \"That doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t happen, but it would take a significant amount of politicking and maneuvering.\"",
      "ISRAEL'S 'RESOUNDING' MILITARY CAMPAIGN AGAINST IRAN COULD BE HISTORIC TURNING POINT, EXPERTS SAY",
      "The second scenario Sabti outlined is a popular uprising sparked by the release of political prisoners. \"There are many political leaders in Iranian prisons,\" he said. \"If some are freed, they could rally the public. They were once part of the regime but tried to shift course and now support relations with the U.S. It would still be a very cold peace with Israel\u2014but not hostile.\"",
      "Taleblu noted that Iranian society has already undergone a significant shift over the past decade. \"Large swaths of the Iranian population\u201480% is probably a minimum number\u2014hate this regime,\" he said. \"The protests since 2017, especially \u2018Women, Life, Freedom,\u2019 were triggered not just by politics, but by economic, social, even environmental issues.\"",
      "Iranians protest the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini after she was detained by the morality police, in Tehran, Iran, on Oct. 1, 2022. (The Associated Press)",
      "A third possibility, Sabti said, is the return of exiled leaders. \"There\u2019s deep romantic nostalgia toward the monarchy,\" he said. \"Maybe in a later phase, if infighting breaks out, people might rally around a symbolic figure\u2014\u2018Come back and be a symbol.\u2019 That could strengthen the revolution.\"",
      "Taleblu acknowledged that figures like Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi could play a role, but not as rulers. \"Think of the diaspora as a bridgehead into a new Iran\u2014not the definers of the new Iran,\" he said. \"The people inside Iran should be the ones shaping the next Iran.\"",
      "The fourth \u2014 and worst \u2014 scenario, according to Sabti, is that the regime survives. \"That\u2019s the worst option,\" he said bluntly.",
      "EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI, SUPREME LEADER OF IRAN",
      "Taleblu agreed, warning that survival would bring an even more repressive future. \"If the Islamic Republic survives, it will survive in a more radical fashion\u2014more military, less clergy,\" he said. \"There\u2019s debate: does it become like Turkey or Pakistan, or does it become even more messianic? The older IRGC are corrupt; the younger ones are messianic.\"",
      "One of the most contentious questions looming over all these scenarios is the future role of Iran\u2019s non-Persian communities, including the Ahwazi, Baloch, Azeris, and Kurds. Aref Al-Kaabi, executive president of the State of Ahwaz, told Fox News Digital in a written statement that without trust-building between these communities and the Persian opposition, change will remain elusive.",

So, the state of alert was very, very high,\" Yadlin recalled. He and the other pilots believed it might be a suicide mission, and they might not have enough fuel to return home.",

      "WHY US MUST DESTROY IRAN'S FORDOW NUCLEAR FACILITY NOW",
      "In 2008, when it was determined that Israeli F-16s could not reach Iran's nuclear sites, Yadlin ordered Mossad to come up with another way to take out Iran's uranium enrichment at Natanz. Two years later, Israeli and American cyber warriors introduced Stuxnet, a malicious computer worm that caused thousands of Natanz centrifuges to spin out of control, setting back Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment.",

      "\"Anybody who wants the war to be over soon, to be finished quickly, have to find a way to deal with Fordow,\" Yadlin said. \"Those who think that attacking Fordow will escalate the war, in my judgment, it can de-escalate and terminate the war.\"",

      "Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin provides details on the nuclear sites targeted in the United States strike on Iran.",
      "President Donald Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity that the U.S. used six \"bunker buster\" bombs to destroy the Iranian nuclear site at Fordow on Saturday evening. In addition, Trump said that the U.S. used 30 tomahawk missiles, launched from U.S. submarines, to strike the Natanz and Isfahan facilities.",
      "Iran's nuclear agency confirmed the U.S. struck all three facilities.",
      "U.S. strikes three sites in Iran (Fox News)",
      "Jonathan Ruhe, Director of Foreign Policy for JINSA, spoke with Fox News Digital about bunker-busters, and how the U.S. might use them to eliminate the Fordow nuclear threat.",
      "Illustration showing how a GBU-57 Bunker Buster is deployed. (Fox News\u00a0)",
      "Ruhe said bunker busters are munitions designed to use the force of gravity to \"penetrate through any mixture of earth, rock, and concrete before the bomb itself then explodes\" underground. The explosion may either take out the target fully, or \"collapse the structure\" around the target \"without necessarily obliterating it,\" he explained.",
      "Bunker busters come in multiple weight classes. Israel possesses 2,000- and 5,000-pound varieties. Only the U.S. possesses the 30,000-pound GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP).",
      "Developed under President George W. Bush, Ruhe says the MOP was \"designed specifically\" for targets like Fordow, where nuclear sites or command and control bunkers are hidden far underground.",
      "Two separate bombs are dropped by a B2 Spirit stealth bomber. (Fox News)",
      "Ruhe said that the number of munitions required to target Fordow depends on the depth of the facility. The Foundation for Defense of Democracies states that Fordow\u2019s facility is between 60 and 90 meters (196 to 295 feet) below ground. The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Grossi told The Financial Times last week that the facility reaches 800 meters underground.",
      "Ruhe said Grossi, who has been to the Fordow facility, may have been \"trying to message, \u2018hey, military action is not the solution here.\u2019\"",

      "The illustration shows the first bomb exploding and creating a hole. (Fox News)",
      "The MOP is said to have a penetration depth of 200 feet. Ruhe said that given Fordow\u2019s distance underground and the difficulty of penetrating the rocky mountainside the site is dug into, the U.S. would likely use a technique called burrowing, in which a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber would \"drop several MOPs in succession, one after the other.\"",
      "Fordow poses a unique target. Ruhe said that pilots have to take into account the facility\u2019s multiple, narrow exit tunnels, and achieve the right angle of impact to penetrate the ground.",
      "Though Israeli air dominance over Iran has eliminated the need for stealth air assets, Ruhe believes the stealth B-2 would be the only tool adequate for delivering the MOPs. Ruhe said timing constraints make the use of B-52 bombers \"not relevant.\"",
      "Additionally, Ruhe explained that talk of loaning B-2 bombers to the Israeli Air Force is \"a dangerous distraction.\" Not only is there \"0.0% chance\" that the U.S. would give out this strategic capability, but Ruhe says training Israeli pilots to fly the B-2 would take several months.",
      "A second bomb follows into the hole and explodes, causing more damage. (Fox News)",

      "Given that Israel is \"very tactically inventive\" and \"very good at maximizing the capabilities they do have,\" Ruhe says that Israel could achieve its goals at Fordow without the MOP.",
      "Not only did Ruhe offer the unlikely but not impossible scenario where Israel might \"storm the site in a commando raid,\" but he said that Israel could use F-15s, escorted by F-35s, to deliver multiple 5,000-pound bunker busters over Fordow, utilizing the same burrowing tactic the U.S. would likely employ.",

      "Such a strike, he admitted, would \"achieve a more limited definition of success\" than the MOP could.",
      "The U.S. and Israel are likely to have different goals in targeting Fordow, Ruhe said. \"Americans tend to think of obliterating targets,\" Ruhe said, whereas Israel would \"probably be fine with saying they knocked back the operations there by a year or so.\"",
      "Ruhe estimates that the bunker busters may not completely destroy the facility, but that it may be considered a success if it were to knock out the power source to Iranian centrifuges, or making \"the air too polluted\" for centrifuges to operate.",

      "President Donald Trump said Saturday night that Iran\u2019s major nuclear enrichment facilities were \u201ccompletely and totally obliterated\u201d after the United States dropped bombs on them \u2014 and warned that American forces would carry out further hostilities if Tehran does not negotiate a peace settlement.",
      "The airstrikes, which targeted the Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites, are the first time the United States has conducted a direct military attack on Iran, and they further escalated a military conflict between Iran and Israel that began on June 13.",
      "U.S. Navy submarines also launched 30 Tomahawk missiles into Iran.",
      "Trump\u2019s claim about the result of the strikes could not be independently confirmed.",
      "Follow along for live coverage",
      "\u201cThere will be either peace or there will be tragedy,\u201d Trump said in a nationally televised address from the White House, with Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio flanking him. \u201cRemember, there are many targets left. ... [I]f peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill.\u201d",
      "Trump first announced the strikes on Truth Social at 7:50 p.m. ET.",
      "At the White House, Trump thanked God, the military and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying U.S. officials \"worked as a team\" with their counterparts in Tel Aviv.",
      "Netanyahu, in his first public comments on the U.S. strikes, congratulated Trump for his \u201cbold decision to target Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities with the awesome and righteous might\u201d of the American military.",
      "The decision will \u201cchange history,\u201d Netanyahu said in an English-language video statement.",
      "In a brief phone interview with NBC News' Kristen Welker, Trump called the strikes a \u201cgreat success\u201d and a \u201ccomplete and total success.\u201d",
      "A gamble by Trump",
      "Trump\u2019s decision to bomb Iran represents a gamble that U.S. military action against Tehran\u2019s nuclear program can remain limited in scope and that the United States will not be drawn into another open-ended war in the Middle East.",
      "Trump and his aides appear to have calculated that the U.S. action did not mean opening the door to a long-term military assault on Iran and that a one-off strike could deal a decisive blow to Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions.",
      "U.S. military commanders have not yet outlined the possible damage to Iran\u2019s nuclear sites, including a deeply buried facility in Fordo believed to hold enriched uranium and sophisticated centrifuges. If the bombing was less than precise or if Iran moved key nuclear-related hardware, U.S. aircraft could still be ordered back to finish the job.",
      "Even if the bombing raids hit their targets, the decision to attack Iran carries risks and uncertainties.",
      "If Trump\u2019s gamble pays off, Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities will be set back years and possibly decades. Iran could find itself severely weakened, having suffered a series of devastating blows over the past year from Israel\u2019s military and intelligence operations.",
      "But Iran has a history of striking at more powerful adversaries by using asymmetric tactics, including terrorist attacks. In 1983, Washington accused Iran of using Lebanese Hezbollah militants to carry out lethal bombings of a Marine Corps barracks and the U.S. Embassy in Beirut.",
      "With both Israel and the United States bombing its territory and Israel\u2019s government suggesting Iran\u2019s government might collapse, Iran\u2019s political leaders are likely to see the current conflict as a fight for the survival of their regime.",
      "Iran has said it has a right to self-defense if it is attacked, and it could be looking to strike at U.S. bases or embassies in and outside the region. Iran still has ballistic and cruise missiles that it could try to fire at American bases in the Persian Gulf or elsewhere, a scenario the U.S. military has long prepared for.",
      "It\u2019s not clear whether Iran could retaliate with missile attacks on U.S. or allied forces in the Gulf. Israel has managed to intercept many of the ballistic missiles and drones that Iran has fired over the past week, though its air defenses are coming under increasing strain.",
      "Iranian officials could choose a more drastic response by planting sea mines or attacking commercial ships in the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow waterway between the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean through which a fifth of the world\u2019s oil passes.",
      "Such a move could cause havoc in the oil markets and the global economy. But it would also disrupt Iran\u2019s own oil exports, depriving the country\u2019s struggling economy of badly needed oil revenue. And it could antagonize other countries that have so far stayed out of the conflict.",
      "After he spoke Saturday night, Trump posted on Truth Social, \"ANY RETALIATION BY IRAN AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL BE MET WITH FORCE FAR GREATER THAN WHAT WAS WITNESSED TONIGHT. THANK YOU! DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\"",
      "Iran had long counted on its proxy forces in the region as a defensive ring to fend off its enemies and deter any possible attack by Israel or the United States.",
      "But its most important ally, Hezbollah in Lebanon, has been devastated by a series of Israeli attacks and assassinations. And in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza, Hamas \u2014 which Iran armed and trained \u2014 has been badly weakened and its leaders have been killed.",
      "But Tehran still has Shiite militias in Iraq and Houthi militants in Yemen that could possibly target American forces, including in Syria.",
      "The New York Police Department said in a statement that it was putting officers at sensitive locations around the city in the wake of the U.S. action.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re tracking the situation unfolding in Iran,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, we\u2019re deploying additional resources to religious, cultural, and diplomatic sites across NYC and coordinating with our federal partners.\u201d",
      "Partisan reaction",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., attacked Trump's decision to strike Iran, saying that \u201cthe risk of war has now dramatically increased.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump misled the country about his intentions, failed to seek congressional authorization for the use of military force and risks American entanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East,\u201d Jeffries said in a statement.",
      "Tommy Vietor, who was a National Security Council spokesperson during the Obama administration, warned of retaliatory attacks by Tehran against the United States.",
      "\u201cIran might retaliate today, tomorrow or in months. Or a year from now, Iran or its proxies might blow up a bus filled with American tourists in Cyprus,\u201d Vietor wrote on social media. \u201cNo one knows what comes next. Bombing Iran started something that we no longer have the capacity to predict or contain.\u201d",
      "Republican members of Congress said on social media that they supported Trump\u2019s decision to bomb the three nuclear sites in Iran.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said, \u201cGood. This was the right call. The regime deserves it.\u201d",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said the attack was necessary. \u201cThe prospect of the Iranian regime acquiring nuclear weapons represents the most acute immediate threat to America and our allies,\u201d he said.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn of Texas called Trump\u2019s actions \u201ccourageous and correct,\u201d and Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said the president\u2019s actions show \u201cwhat peace through strength looks like.\u201d",
      "Focus on Fordo site",
      "The facility at Fordo, Iran\u2019s most advanced, is built inside a mountain and believed to be safe from any bomb except the United States\u2019 GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a \u201cbunker buster\u201d weapon.",
      "Trump did not say which type of bombs were used, but it was widely expected that the GBU-57 would be used. Earlier in the day, several American B-2 stealth bombers, which are the only plane that can carry GBU-57 bombs, which weigh 30,000 pounds, took off from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri.",
      "Trump's turn",
      "NBC News has reported that Trump initially opposed Israel\u2019s taking military action against Iran, favoring negotiations over bombing. But in the days before Israel's strikes on Iran, he became convinced that Israel\u2019s heightened anxiety over Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment capabilities was warranted.",
      "After a pivotal June 8 briefing from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, about Israel\u2019s plans and U.S. options for supporting its operation, Trump gave tacit approval for Israel to conduct strikes and for the U.S. to provide limited backing.",
      "Even though many of his MAGA allies have advocated against U.S. military involvement, Trump\u2019s rhetoric about Iran has steadily escalated since Israel\u2019s bombing campaign began.",
      "On Tuesday, he called for Iran\u2019s \u201cUNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!\u201d on Truth Social.",
      "Wednesday morning, he said he was still considering U.S. strikes.",
      "\u201cI may do it. I may not do it,\u201d he told reporters outside the White House. \u201cNobody knows what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d",
      "\u201cI may do it. I may not do it,\u201d he told reporters outside the White House. \u201cNobody knows what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, Trump\u2019s decision was clear: an unprecedented US military attack that he hopes will weaken Iran so decisively that its leaders will make major concessions.",
      "Trump ended his speech with a warning to Iran\u2019s leaders. \u201cIran, the bully of the Middle East, must make peace,\u201d he said. The question now is how Iran responds."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Several members of Congress in both parties Saturday questioned the legality of President Donald Trump\u2019s move to launch military strikes on Iran.",
      "While Republican leaders and many rank-and-file members stood by Trump\u2019s decision to bomb Iran\u2019s major nuclear enrichment facilities, at least two GOP lawmakers joined Democrats across the party spectrum in suggesting it was unconstitutional for him to bomb Iran without approval from Congress.",
      "\u201cWhile President Trump\u2019s decision may prove just, it\u2019s hard to conceive a rationale that\u2019s Constitutional,\u201d Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, who usually aligns with Trump, said on X. \u201cI look forward to his remarks tonight.\u201d",
      "Follow along for live coverage",
      "Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., said in response to Trump\u2019s social media post announcing the strikes: \u201cThis is not Constitutional.\u201d",

      "In brief remarks from the White House on Saturday night, Trump defended the strikes but did not mention the basis of his legal authority to launch them without Congress\u2019 having given him that power.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., reacted in real time during a speech in Tulsa, Oklahoma, slamming Trump\u2019s actions as \u201cgrossly unconstitutional.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe only entity that can take this country to war is the U.S. Congress. The president does not have the right,\u201d Sanders told the crowd, which broke out in \u201cno more war!\u201d chants.",
      "Some Democrats called it an impeachable offense for the president to bomb Iran without approval from Congress.",
      "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said Trump\u2019s move is \u201cabsolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe President\u2019s disastrous decision to bomb Iran without authorization is a grave violation of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers,\u201d she said on X. \u201cHe has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations.\u201d",
      "Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., said on social media: \u201cThis is not about the merits of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. No president has the authority to bomb another country that does not pose an imminent threat to the US without the approval of Congress. This is an unambiguous impeachable offense.\u201d",
      "Casten called on House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to \u201cgrow a spine\u201d and protect the war powers reserved for Congress.",
      "Johnson said Trump respects the Constitution as he sought to lay the groundwork to defend his decision to act unilaterally.",
      "\u201cThe President fully respects the Article I power of Congress, and tonight\u2019s necessary, limited, and targeted strike follows the history and tradition of similar military actions under presidents of both parties,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "Johnson\u2019s remarks, along with support for Trump\u2019s move offered by Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., indicate that Trump may have sufficient political cover to avoid blowback from the Republican-controlled Congress.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Trump \u201cfailed to seek congressional authorization for the use of military force and risks American entanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East.\u201d But he stopped short of labeling the military action illegal or unconstitutional.",
      "House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., was more direct on the legal question.",
      "\u201cThe power to declare war resides solely with Congress. Donald Trump\u2019s unilateral decision to attack Iran is unauthorized and unconstitutional,\u201d said Clark, the No. 2 Democrat. \u201cIn doing so, the President has exposed our military and diplomatic personnel in the region to the risk of further escalation.\u201d",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., responded by endorsing a resolution by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., to require congressional approval for Trump to take military action in Iran.",
      "\u201cNo president should be allowed to unilaterally march this nation into something as consequential as war with erratic threats and no strategy,\u201d Schumer said in a statement. \u201cWe must enforce the War Powers Act, and I\u2019m urging Leader Thune to put it on the Senate floor immediately. I am voting for it and implore all Senators on both sides of the aisle to vote for it.\u201d",

      "Now, at least for the time being, the lay leaders in the president's base appear to be rallying around a position that spares Trump criticism: Direct attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities are justified, as long as American troops aren't sent into a third full war halfway around the world in the last quarter of a century.",
      "\"People don\u2019t want an escalation where ground troops are sent in, but this is not Iraq,\u201d said Ryan Girdusky, a Republican consultant who worked for a super PAC that backed Vice President JD Vance's 2022 Senate campaign in Ohio. Girdusky predicted the MAGA base will swing in line behind Trump.",
      "Follow live coverage",
      "There is little appetite at the White House or anywhere else in Washington for a ground invasion of Iran, a mountainous country in the Middle East that would be extraordinarily difficult to conquer in a conventional war.",
      "But it's hardly unusual for the start of hostilities \u2014 the airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear-enrichment facilities were the first direct American intervention in a week-old war between Israel and Iran \u2014 to create a rally-around-the-flag effect within a president's party. What's notable is just how dramatic and speedy the turn has been from dissent to full-throated support.",
      "\"Heavy smear campaign going on right now attacking America First Patriots as \u2018Isolationists,\u2019\" Jack Posobiec, a leading voice in the MAGA movement, posted earlier Saturday, before the bombings. \"I hope everyone using this bad persuasion knows that it associate them with the worst Bush-era neocons,\" slang for the so-called neoconservative George W. Bush administration officials who pushed for war in Iraq.",
      "Posobiec had previously warned that direct attacks on Iran would \"disastrously split the Trump coalition.\"",

      "Posobiec was hardly alone among anti-interventionist MAGA figures in holding off on criticizing Trump after what he described as a highly successful mission that \"completely and totally obliterated\" Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons.",
      "Steve Bannon, a top adviser in Trump's first White House and host of the \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast, made it clear in a special broadcast Saturday night that he would have preferred for Israel to take the lead in striking Iran's nuclear facilities. But he stopped short of condemning Trump for sending U.S. forces to do the job.",
      "Instead he gave voice to the doubts some MAGA voters would have about the mission.",
      "\"A big question is going to be why Israel did not take the lead and do this. Because right now this is back to the United States,\" he said. \"Why are we engaging in combat operations in a war that\u2019s a war of choice?\"",
      "But he ultimately concluded that Trump would bring the MAGA movement to his own position \u2014\u00a0perhaps an indication that influencers have more to lose by opposing Trump than he does by using force in Iran.",
      "\"There are a lot of MAGA that are not happy about this,\" Bannon said. \"I believe he will get MAGA on board for all of it. But he's got to explain exactly and go through this.\"",

      "While Republican leaders and many rank-and-file members stood by Trump\u2019s decision to bomb Iran\u2019s major nuclear enrichment facilities, at least two GOP lawmakers joined Democrats across the party spectrum in suggesting it was unconstitutional for him to bomb Iran without approval from Congress.",

      "Follow along for live coverage",
      "Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., said in response to Trump\u2019s social media post announcing the strikes: \u201cThis is not Constitutional.\u201d",

      "In brief remarks from the White House on Saturday night, Trump defended the strikes but did not mention the basis of his legal authority to launch them without Congress\u2019 having given him that power.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., reacted in real time during a speech in Tulsa, Oklahoma, slamming Trump\u2019s actions as \u201cgrossly unconstitutional.\u201d",

      "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said Trump\u2019s move is \u201cabsolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe President\u2019s disastrous decision to bomb Iran without authorization is a grave violation of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers,\u201d she said on X. \u201cHe has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations.\u201d",
      "Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., said on social media: \u201cThis is not about the merits of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. No president has the authority to bomb another country that does not pose an imminent threat to the US without the approval of Congress. This is an unambiguous impeachable offense.\u201d",
      "Casten called on House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to \u201cgrow a spine\u201d and protect the war powers reserved for Congress.",
      "Johnson said Trump respects the Constitution as he sought to lay the groundwork to defend his decision to act unilaterally.",
      "\u201cThe President fully respects the Article I power of Congress, and tonight\u2019s necessary, limited, and targeted strike follows the history and tradition of similar military actions under presidents of both parties,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "Johnson\u2019s remarks, along with support for Trump\u2019s move offered by Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., indicate that Trump may have sufficient political cover to avoid blowback from the Republican-controlled Congress.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Trump \u201cfailed to seek congressional authorization for the use of military force and risks American entanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East.\u201d But he stopped short of labeling the military action illegal or unconstitutional.",
      "House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., was more direct on the legal question.",
      "\u201cThe power to declare war resides solely with Congress. Donald Trump\u2019s unilateral decision to attack Iran is unauthorized and unconstitutional,\u201d said Clark, the No. 2 Democrat. \u201cIn doing so, the President has exposed our military and diplomatic personnel in the region to the risk of further escalation.\u201d",

      "\u201cNo president should be allowed to unilaterally march this nation into something as consequential as war with erratic threats and no strategy,\u201d Schumer said in a statement. \u201cWe must enforce the War Powers Act, and I\u2019m urging Leader Thune to put it on the Senate floor immediately. I am voting for it and implore all Senators on both sides of the aisle to vote for it.\u201d",
      "Appearing Saturday night on MSNBC, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who co-authored the resolution with Massie, wondered whether the anti-war voters who support Trump would back his move.",

      "A gamble by Trump",
      "Trump\u2019s decision to bomb Iran represents a gamble that U.S. military action against Tehran\u2019s nuclear program can remain limited in scope and that the United States will not be drawn into another open-ended war in the Middle East.",
      "Trump and his aides appear to have calculated that the U.S. action did not mean opening the door to a long-term military assault on Iran and that a one-off strike could deal a decisive blow to Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions.",
      "U.S. military commanders have not yet outlined the possible damage to Iran\u2019s nuclear sites, including a deeply buried facility in Fordo believed to hold enriched uranium and sophisticated centrifuges. If the bombing was less than precise or if Iran moved key nuclear-related hardware, U.S. aircraft could still be ordered back to finish the job.",
      "Even if the bombing raids hit their targets, the decision to attack Iran carries risks and uncertainties.",
      "If Trump\u2019s gamble pays off, Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities will be set back years and possibly decades. Iran could find itself severely weakened, having suffered a series of devastating blows over the past year from Israel\u2019s military and intelligence operations.",
      "But Iran has a history of striking at more powerful adversaries by using asymmetric tactics, including terrorist attacks. In 1983, Washington accused Iran of using Lebanese Hezbollah militants to carry out lethal bombings of a Marine Corps barracks and the U.S. Embassy in Beirut.",
      "With both Israel and the United States bombing its territory and Israel\u2019s government suggesting Iran\u2019s government might collapse, Iran\u2019s political leaders are likely to see the current conflict as a fight for the survival of their regime.",
      "Iran has said it has a right to self-defense if it is attacked, and it could be looking to strike at U.S. bases or embassies in and outside the region. Iran still has ballistic and cruise missiles that it could try to fire at American bases in the Persian Gulf or elsewhere, a scenario the U.S. military has long prepared for.",
      "It\u2019s not clear whether Iran could retaliate with missile attacks on U.S. or allied forces in the Gulf. Israel has managed to intercept many of the ballistic missiles and drones that Iran has fired over the past week, though its air defenses are coming under increasing strain.",
      "Iranian officials could choose a more drastic response by planting sea mines or attacking commercial ships in the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow waterway between the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean through which a fifth of the world\u2019s oil passes.",
      "Such a move could cause havoc in the oil markets and the global economy. But it would also disrupt Iran\u2019s own oil exports, depriving the country\u2019s struggling economy of badly needed oil revenue. And it could antagonize other countries that have so far stayed out of the conflict.",
      "After he spoke Saturday night, Trump posted on Truth Social, \"ANY RETALIATION BY IRAN AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL BE MET WITH FORCE FAR GREATER THAN WHAT WAS WITNESSED TONIGHT. THANK YOU! DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\"",
      "Iran had long counted on its proxy forces in the region as a defensive ring to fend off its enemies and deter any possible attack by Israel or the United States.",
      "But its most important ally, Hezbollah in Lebanon, has been devastated by a series of Israeli attacks and assassinations. And in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza, Hamas \u2014 which Iran armed and trained \u2014 has been badly weakened and its leaders have been killed.",
      "But Tehran still has Shiite militias in Iraq and Houthi militants in Yemen that could possibly target American forces, including in Syria.",

      "Tommy Vietor, who was a National Security Council spokesperson during the Obama administration, warned of retaliatory attacks by Tehran against the United States.",
      "\u201cIran might retaliate today, tomorrow or in months. Or a year from now, Iran or its proxies might blow up a bus filled with American tourists in Cyprus,\u201d Vietor wrote on social media. \u201cNo one knows what comes next. Bombing Iran started something that we no longer have the capacity to predict or contain.\u201d",
      "Republican members of Congress said on social media that they supported Trump\u2019s decision to bomb the three nuclear sites in Iran.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said, \u201cGood. This was the right call. The regime deserves it.\u201d",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said the attack was necessary. \u201cThe prospect of the Iranian regime acquiring nuclear weapons represents the most acute immediate threat to America and our allies,\u201d he said.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn of Texas called Trump\u2019s actions \u201ccourageous and correct,\u201d and Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said the president\u2019s actions show \u201cwhat peace through strength looks like.\u201d",

      "Trump did not say which type of bombs were used, but it was widely expected that the GBU-57 would be used. Earlier in the day, several American B-2 stealth bombers, which are the only plane that can carry GBU-57 bombs, which weigh 30,000 pounds, took off from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri.",
      "Trump's turn",
      "NBC News has reported that Trump initially opposed Israel\u2019s taking military action against Iran, favoring negotiations over bombing. But in the days before Israel's strikes on Iran, he became convinced that Israel\u2019s heightened anxiety over Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment capabilities was warranted.",
      "After a pivotal June 8 briefing from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, about Israel\u2019s plans and U.S. options for supporting its operation, Trump gave tacit approval for Israel to conduct strikes and for the U.S. to provide limited backing.",
      "Even though many of his MAGA allies have advocated against U.S. military involvement, Trump\u2019s rhetoric about Iran has steadily escalated since Israel\u2019s bombing campaign began.",
      "On Tuesday, he called for Iran\u2019s \u201cUNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!\u201d on Truth Social.",
      "Wednesday morning, he said he was still considering U.S. strikes.",
      "\u201cI may do it. I may not do it,\u201d he told reporters outside the White House. \u201cNobody knows what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d",
      "\u201cI may do it. I may not do it,\u201d he told reporters outside the White House. \u201cNobody knows what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, Trump\u2019s decision was clear: an unprecedented US military attack that he hopes will weaken Iran so decisively that its leaders will make major concessions.",
      "Trump ended his speech with a warning to Iran\u2019s leaders. \u201cIran, the bully of the Middle East, must make peace,\u201d he said. The question now is how Iran responds."

      "While the court document, filed in the 1st Judicial District of Carver County, does not include the name of the person to whom Bohn, a lobbyist for 20 years, allegedly sent the texts, it does include samples of several texts threatening in nature.",

      "Former U.S. Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, who left Congress amid sexual harassment allegations, has died. He was 63.",
      "He died in a Corpus Christi hospital and suffered heart and liver problems in recent years, Steve Ray, his former longtime political consultant, said. Farenthold\u2019s wife, Debbie Farenthold, confirmed that he died Friday.",
      "Farenthold was elected in 2010, upsetting long-serving Democratic U.S. Rep. Solomon Ortiz. Seven years later, Farenthold announced that he wouldn\u2019t seek reelection.",
      "In a video he posted on his campaign\u2019s Facebook page at the time, he denied a former aide\u2019s three-year-old accusations, which included that he\u2019d subjected her to sexually suggestive comments and behavior and then fired her after she complained. He apologized for an office atmosphere he said included \u201cdestructive gossip, offhand comments, off-color jokes and behavior that in general was less than professional.\u201d",
      "He said in the video that if he stayed in Congress, he would have spent months trying to vindicate himself.",
      "\u201cWe all make mistakes,\u201d Ray said Saturday. \u201cHe made some mistakes.\u201d",
      "Ray described him as a \u201ctechie\u201d who was interested in the internet and technology before getting involved in politics.",
      "\u201cHe did a tremendous job as congressman for this area,\u201d Ray said, noting that Farenthold cared about fighting crime and promoting transparency. \u201cHis heart was really always in the right place.\u201d",
      "Before becoming a congressman, Farenthold was a sidekick for a conservative radio talk show host, Ray said.",
      "\u201cWhen he decided to run, nobody in the world thought he was going to win,\u201d Ray said.",
      "When he left office, Farenthold started his own radio show, which he continued until he died.",
      "In addition to his wife, Farenthold is survived by two adult daughters, Morgan Baucum and Amanda Lawrence, Ray said."

    "story": [
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been promising self-driving cars for a decade, and the moment of truth may finally be here.",
      "Musk, who\u2019s mostly back in the private sector after his chain saw-wielding turn in the Trump administration, has said that Tesla plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on Sunday. Though he said the exact day could still shift, Tesla appears to be getting close to making an attempt, with videos spreading online of road tests where no human is in the driver\u2019s seat.",
      "But Tesla is also starting from behind. Waymo, a spinoff of Google, is already running a robotaxi service in several cities including Austin, and the service has a growing following.",
      "Safety remains a key question. Musk has rejected the idea of using radar and lidar sensors on Tesla vehicles, instead relying on cameras in a departure from some rivals. He has said the Tesla robotaxis are using a \u201cnew version of software\u201d that\u2019s relatively untested.",
      "Federal regulators have been raising concerns about Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance software for more than a year, saying it contributed to hundreds of avoidable crashes, including some fatal crashes.",
      "Waymo\u2019s service has not reported any fatalities.",
      "Here\u2019s what to expect from Tesla\u2019s planned service.",
      "When will it start?",
      "Musk said this month that the robotaxi launch would be, \u201cTentatively, June 22.\u201d",
      "Musk has predicted for years that autonomous Tesla vehicles were just around the corner, to the point where it\u2019s become a meme. Musk told Fortune magazine in 2015 that autonomy was two years away, and he said in 2019 that Tesla would have 1 million robotaxis on the roads in 2020.",
      "Texas Democrats on Wednesday asked Tesla to delay its launch until September, when a new state law could take effect and require robotaxi operators to obtain a state permit. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Who will be able to use this service?",
      "Very few people, at least to start. Musk has said that the service will begin very small, with as few as 10 vehicles the first week. They\u2019ll operate in Austin, but Tesla hasn\u2019t said how large its service area will be. There is no public waitlist, although Musk has said he wants to grow the service within a few months to catch up to Waymo.",
      "On Friday, some people on Musk\u2019s social media app X posted screenshots of what appeared to be invitations to \u201cearly access of Tesla Robotaxi.\u201d",
      "Robotaxi services work like a Lyft or Uber ride-hail service: A user orders a ride on a phone app by entering their starting point and destination. The key difference is that there\u2019s no one in the driver\u2019s seat, although it\u2019s not clear whether Tesla will have someone in the front passenger seat, as it has during test drives, or how much remote control of the car Tesla will have.",
      "How does this compare with Waymo?",
      "Waymo says its service covers 37 square miles in Austin, and customers there can order rides through the Uber app, in a partnership between the two tech companies. Waymo is also available in Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Francisco and Atlanta, with plans to expand to Miami and elsewhere.",
      "Nationwide, Waymo says it has 1,500 vehicles on the road, plus parking lots, electric charging stations, maintenance staff and engineers to support the vehicles.",
      "\u201cWaymo is far and away the leader of the development of the technology here, and over the last 15 years has been evolving both the technology and related infrastructure to support what they\u2019re doing,\u201d said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Center for Transportation and Logistics.",
      "Tesla is calling its service Robotaxi, but so far the company has not succeeded in getting a trademark for the term.",
      "How safe will Tesla robotaxis be?",
      "Experts say that no one knows how safe Tesla\u2019s service will be.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re starting small,\u201d said Greg Stevens, the research director of Mcity, a testing lab for autonomous technology at the University of Michigan.",
      "\u201cAs an engineer, I\u2019m a real fan of small launches. Keep it simple in the beginning: launch a small number of vehicles and watch them very, very closely,\u201d he said.",
      "Phil Koopman, an associate professor of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, said that only a driving record over tens of millions of miles will determine Tesla\u2019s safety.",
      "\u201cSuccess is no crashes and no serious mishaps for the rest of the year, at least,\u201d he said. \u201cSafety is not something where you can go look at the car and see that it\u2019s safe.\u201d",
      "Tesla has a different approach to safety than its chief competitor. While Waymo uses a combination of cameras, radar and lidar to keep its bearings, Tesla relies on cameras only. It\u2019s an approach that Musk says is less expensive and \u201csuperior\u201d to using lidar, while federal regulators have said that Tesla\u2019s cameras may have trouble seeing in certain conditions such as fog and glaring sun.",
      "Musk has said that Tesla is \u201cbeing super paranoid about safety.\u201d He has also said a more advanced version of Tesla\u2019s autonomy software \u201cstill requires a lot of polishing.\u201d",
      "Can Tesla just do this? Who has approved it?",
      "Texas has had relatively permissive laws about autonomous vehicles: Unlike in California, there\u2019s no state regulator in Texas that needs to sign off on the service. That may change in September, when a proposed Texas law requiring robotaxi operators to get authorization from the Department of Motor Vehicles is set to take effect. The bill has passed the state House and Senate and is awaiting action by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott.",
      "If Tesla launches Sunday and Abbott signs the bill into law, it\u2019s not clear what would happen under the new law this fall. A spokesperson for the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles said Friday that the department would need time to put the law into effect and begin enforcement, a process that would most likely stretch into next year.",
      "Austin city officials also say they\u2019re prohibited under state law from regulating autonomous vehicles, but they have been documenting examples of safety concerns. In the first five months of this year, the city said it collected data on 35 safety incidents, such as blocking traffic, involving various companies.",
      "Austin officials said that as of Friday, they had not documented any safety incidents involving Tesla autonomous vehicles.",
      "\u201cThe City treats each AV company that expresses interest in Austin the same, offering training opportunities and providing information about City right-of-way and procedure,\u201d Jack Flagler, a spokesperson for the Austin transportation department, said in an email. He said the city had provided Tesla and others with maps, special event information and information about fire and police procedures.",
      "Tesla has sought to block the city of Austin from releasing government records about its planned service, according to Reuters.",
      "What happens if something goes wrong?",
      "Tesla has not publicly outlined any contingency plans, but if rival companies are a guide, Tesla will have staff ready to assist either in person or remotely. Test vehicles spotted in Austin have been followed close behind by what some people speculate to be \u201ctrailing\u201d vehicles driven by humans.",
      "Companies such as Waymo and the now-defunct Cruise say they can and do intervene remotely with vehicles if there\u2019s a problem \u2014 which for Cruise meant every 4 to 5 miles, according to CNBC. Cruise later shut down following a highly publicized crash involving a pedestrian.",
      "Tesla posted a job related to teleoperations and told Wall Street analysts to expect telesupport, according to Wired magazine and auto site Electrek, but the company hasn\u2019t provided details.",
      "The stakes are high for the whole robotaxi industry.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s my big worry: that all the progress we\u2019ve made gets halted by some sort of major safety incident,\u201d Stevens said.",
      "How quickly could Tesla come to other cities?",
      "Musk has said that safety and regulations will guide how quickly Tesla tries to expand the number of vehicles in the service. He told CNBC in an interview last month: \u201cI think we\u2019ll probably be at a thousand within a few months.\u201d He also mentioned expanding to California, though Tesla does not have the permit required to operate there.",
      "Musk has also hyped a new vehicle, called Cybercab, that Tesla could potentially use for its robotaxi service, though for now the company is using existing model vehicles. And eventually, Musk has said that individual Tesla owners would be able to offer their vehicles for hire in the robotaxi service, but he has not set a date for when that might happen.",
      "\u201cHow long did it take Waymo to scale up? Years and years and years. And there\u2019s no reason to believe it will be different for Tesla,\u201d Koopman said.",
      "What will the impact on Tesla as a company be?",
      "The scheduled launch of the robotaxi service has helped to buoy Tesla\u2019s stock price in recent months, after the company\u2019s sales and profits cratered during Musk\u2019s time in the Trump administration and the resulting \u201cTesla Takedown\u201d protests against him and the company. Some investors think Tesla will be able to scale up its service quickly to dozens of cities over the next year, creating a new source of revenue while possibly also boosting vehicle sales.",
      "Some experts think that is the main point of the robotaxi launch.",
      "\u201cI think the objective that is paramount is stabilizing Tesla\u2019s stock price,\u201d said MIT\u2019s Reimer. \u201cThis is as much of a media stunt as anything else.\u201d"

      "NEWARK, N.J. \u2014After more than three months in immigration detention, Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil returned to the New York area, where his harrowing ordeal began.",
      "Immigration authorities arrested Khalil, 30, in March at the university housing complex where he lived in New York City. He was quickly transported thousands of miles away to a detention center in Louisiana, where he spent the last few months.",
      "Khalil remained defiant as he spoke to reporters and supporters Saturday afternoon when he arrived at Newark International Airport.",
      "\"Your messages have kept me going. Still the fight is far from over, the genocide is still happening in Gaza, Israel is still waging a full war against Palestine,\" said Khalil, who was flanked by his wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. \"The U.S. government is funding this genocide, and Columbia University is investing in this genocide. This is why I was protesting, this is why I will continue protesting with every one of you, not only if they threaten me with detention. Even if they would kill me, I would still speak up for Gaza.\"",
      "Asked what his message to the Trump administration would be, Khalil said, \"Just the fact that I'm here sends a message.\"",
      "\"The fact that all of these attempts to suppress pro-Palestine voices have failed now,\" he said. \"This is the message. My existence is a message.\"",
      "Ocasio-Cortez said Khalil's imprisonment was politically motivated.",
      "\"Everybody agrees that persecution based on political speech is wrong and is a violation of all of our First Amendment rights, not just Mahmoud's,\" she said.",
      "His unprecedented detention has sparked national outrage.",
      "Further fueling the controversy, Abdalla, an American, gave birth to the couple\u2019s first son in April while he remained behind bars.",
      "Upon his release in Louisiana on Friday, Khalil addressed reporters briefly, saying he was excited to return to New York City and see his family.",
      "\u201cAlthough justice prevailed,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s long, very long overdue. And this shouldn\u2019t have taken three months.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrump and his administration, they chose the wrong person for this,\u201d he added. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that there is a right person for this. There\u2019s no right person who should be detained for actually protesting a genocide, for protesting their university, Columbia University.\u201d",
      "Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin on Friday denounced the judicial order freeing Khalil and the judge who issued it.",
      "\u201cThis is yet another example of how out of control members of the judicial branch are undermining national security,\u201d McLaughlin said in a statement. \u201cTheir conduct not only denies the result of the 2024 election, it also does great harm to our constitutional system by undermining public confidence in the courts.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration claimed it had the authority to detain and deport Khalil, arguing that his presence in the United States threatened national security. Another charge alleges that he omitted details about his work history and membership in organizations on his permanent residency application.",
      "The government cited an obscure provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 that gives Secretary of State Marco Rubio authority to \u201cpersonally determine\u201d whether a foreign national can remain in the United States on national security grounds.",
      "An NBC News review of more than 100 pages of court filings found that prosecutors relied on unverified tabloid reports and anecdotal claims, raising doubts about the strength of their case for deporting Khalil.",
      "Less than 10 minutes after Khalil, who has no criminal history, was released from the detention center in Jena, Louisiana, the Trump administration filed a notice of appeal. A lawyer representing Khalil vowed to fight the appeal.",
      "Khalil helped lead student protests over the war in Gaza, where more than 55,000 people have been killed since Israel launched its war against Hamas. He also participated in negotiations with university officials at Columbia last year, when protests at the Ivy League school gripped the nation for weeks and inspired similar demonstrations at universities around the world.",
      "Some Jewish students at universities across the United States reported antisemitic incidents as the protest movement gained traction.",
      "Khalil was the first of several foreign academics whom immigration authorities apprehended in the first months of Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Immigration authorities arrested Tufts University student R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, a doctoral candidate from Turkey, outside her home in Somerville, Massachusetts, on March 25. Viral street video of her arrest showed Department of Homeland Security officials dressed in plainclothes surrounding \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, grabbing her by the wrists and escorting her into an unmarked vehicle.",
      "Immigration authorities apprehended Mohsen Mahdawi, 34, a graduate student at Columbia who was born in the West Bank, during his naturalization interview in Vermont.",
      "Federal judges also ordered the release of both \u00d6zt\u00fcrk and Mahdawi in recent weeks. Other notable cases include those of a Georgetown University professor who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and later released after a judicial order and a Brown University professor who was deported to Lebanon."

      "From navigating tough weather in Australia to being questioned by police in Egypt, Ian Andersen has faced many challenges in his journeys biking across continents and documenting them on social media.",
      "But the American creator, known as \u201cridewithian\u201d to his 43,300 followers on TikTok, never had war on his list of possible hurdles \u2014 until last week. Amid his 29-day trek across Iran, Andersen found himself stuck just after Israeli forces began a \u201cpre-emptive\u201d strike on the country.",
      "As Iran and Israel continue to trade attacks, visitors like Andersen have scrambled to find ways to safely exit the Middle East. He was among several people to document how he was able to depart the country, and he shared his journey with followers.",
      "Andersen said that at first, he was determined to continue his Iran trip \u201cas intended.\u201d But then his guide, Reza, told him something that made him change course. \u201cI can no longer protect you,\u201d Reza said, according to Andersen. \u201cIf you\u2019re stopped by police, I should just wave goodbye, because there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d",
      "As of Wednesday, the State Department had advised citizens to \u201cleave Iran now\u201d and to have plans that do \u201cnot rely on U.S. government help.\u201d Other governments have also warned their citizens to leave the region as the conflict unfolds and airspace closes. The United Kingdom has advised against \"all travel to Iran.\" Similarly, Australia has said its citizens should not travel to Israel. Major U.S. carriers like Delta and American have offered rebooking options.",
      "Some Americans in Israel have also been able to leave the region after the state of Florida and a nonprofit organization arranged a flight to bring evacuees home.",
      "Andersen said his departure was possible only because of Reza, whose last name he did not share to protect his safety, and help from the State Department.",
      "\u201cI had a couple weeks there in country of really positive good experiences,\" he said in a phone interview. \"Experiencing Iran as it should be experienced.\u201d",
      "His first vlog from Iran, posted June 2, recorded him crossing into the country from Turkey. Not unlike other influencers whose content focuses on travel, Andersen also posted himself trying different local cuisines \u2014 including a fermented yogurt drink, a Persian omelet and kaleh pacheh, a stew made with goat head \u2014 and showing the hospitality of the Iranian people.",
      "\"They tried to give us for free and said we are their guests, but we had to insist,\" Andersen says in one video, which Reza explains is an example of the \"ta\u2019arof,\" a form of etiquette practiced by Iranians worldwide.",
      "As he biked around the country, he also captured the landscape and talked to viewers about the impact of sanctions, asking in one video, \"What happens when a country is cut off from the global economy for decades?\"",
      "The lighthearted, fun tone of his videos began to shift one week ago while he was in Chalus. Many of his followers began commenting, sharing concerns about his safety.",
      "\"Actually all of us are sad because this is happening,\" Reza says in one video after they heard news of the attack. \"But hope for world without war. ... Everybody needs a peaceful world.\"",
      "The two were headed toward Tehran to try to sort out a visa for Afghanistan, which was the next country on Andersen's itinerary.",
      "\"It's amazing that even after such an event, you know, an emergency, that people are so friendly,\" Andersen says after two people eating near them bring them a meal and insist they share with them.",
      "The information that was available in Iran was initially unclear, and it left Andersen with questions. Iran plunged into a near-total internet blackout this week, limiting Iranians\u2019 ability to access and share information with the outside world.",
      "The situation soon became \u201ctoo dangerous,\" Andersen says in another video, and he and Reza decided not to go to Tehran.",
      "\u201cIt ended up being a good call, \u2019cause there was just more and more attacks as the days went by,\u201d Andersen told NBC News as he reflected on his past week.",
      "\u201cThere was lots of rumors flying around about what borders might be open,\" he added. \"Like, what, like one of the requirements once you get to the border? Like if you\u2019re able to get a visa, if you can just go through. A lifeline came through via an email from the State Department about getting into Azerbaijan.\"",
      "He ultimately was able to exit through Azerbaijan with help from Reza, who drove them to the border. He said he \"probably wouldn\u2019t be here talking\" if it weren't for Reza.",
      "\"I\u2019m out, and truly grateful for all your prayers, messages, and support,\" Andersen wrote in a recent video update. \"It\u2019s an honor to have you following this journey and caring about my wellbeing out here in the Middle East. ... And finally, to my Iranian guide Reza\u2014there\u2019s no one I\u2019d rather have had by my side.\"",
      "Andersen said that since he left the country, his thoughts continue to be with the people of both Iran and Israel and that he is also \u201cthinking about all the people who don\u2019t have the option to leave, like I did.\u201d",
      "U.K.-based influencers Nadia Akhtar and Irfan Aziz, who go by the handle \"fieldofvisions\" on TikTok, where they have 60,000 followers, were also in Iran when the strikes began.",
      "The couple, who were unavailable for an interview, were traveling with their young son, Zakariya. They quickly realized they were among the last to enter the country on an incoming flight and soon had a front-row seat for the attacks from their balcony.",
      "\"Iranian forces were intercepting Israeli drones right above us,\" Aziz says in a video. \"That night, we realized this wasn't normal and it's nothing like what has happened before. We needed to start thinking about an exit plan.\"",
      "The advice they got from officials was simple: \u201cGet out now.\" Like Andersen, they said they leaned on help from their guide, Ali, to help them get out.",
      "Aziz said that at 1:30 a.m. that night, they drove with Ali \"through the night despite getting zero sleep\" to get to the Turkish border.",
      "\"It was when we approached Tabriz, seven hours from Tehran, the reality of the situation kicked in,\" Aziz says in the video, adding that they saw smoke rising in different areas around them.",
      "\"Locals told us five fighter jets had bombed a cement factory at 5 in the morning. Nowhere was truly safe,\" he added.",
      "Akhtar and Aziz described their goodbyes with their guide when they finally reached Turkey\u2019s border as \u201cemotional.\u201d",
      "\"Even though we had just met, he sacrificed his own family's safety, leaving them behind in Tehran to help us,\" Aziz says in part two of his video series about the experience. \"And for this, we will forever be grateful to him. But not everyone has the privilege of leaving like we did. Millions of people just like Ali are at the receiving end of the war that has nothing to do with them.\""

    "story": [
      "When Louis McCartney first auditioned for \u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow,\u201d he taped himself reading for a part named George.",
      "The opportunity started as an email in the then 18-year-old's inbox: an untitled Netflix play, co-directed by Tony Award winner Stephen Daldry. George was described as a young kid, \"savagely loyal,\" \"escaping the shadow\" and \"living with the spirit of the boy he once was,\" McCartney tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s all I knew,\" he adds.",
      "Two years later, McCartney was at the Tony Awards, nominated for best actor in a play and competing against the likes of George Clooney, winner Cole Escola and more.",
      "\"Stranger Things: The First Shadow,\" which opened in London's West End in December 2023 and then hit Broadway April 22, 2025, is a play set in the world of the hit Netflix show, which returns for its fifth and final season in November. \"George\" turned out to be a young Henry Creel, who was revealed as the big bad of the show's universe in Season 4.",
      "Henry, played in the series by Jamie Campbell Bower, is also known as One, the first of the powerful children, including Millie Bobby Brown's Eleven, tested on in Dr. Brenner's lab in Hawkins, Indiana. Henry was taken under Dr. Brenner\u2019s wing after he murdered his mother and sister using his powers of telekinesis.",
      "Henry was eventually banished to a terrifying parallel universe from which monsters like the Demogorgon and Mind Flayer originate. He transformed into a grotesque, red humanoid monster responsible for unleashing a hellscape onto Hawkins via the Upside Down, which essentially marks the intersection of the real world and that other dimension.",
      "But before Vecna, Henry was a teenage boy starting school at Hawkins High in the late 1950s.",
      "\"The whole point of the play is that we're showing that Vecna, and the psychology of that \u2014 we're taking it as a very human approach,\" McCartney says. \"The only way to do it and to explain naturally in front of you how somebody would become a world ending monster, is it needs to be the conditioning of the people around him.\"",
      "As Henry navigates being the new kid at Hawkins High, he's introduced to a veritable who's who of faces familiar to fans of the Netflix show, including a young Joyce Byers (then Joyce Maldonado), Hopper (or James Hopper Jr.), and a teenage Bob Newby. Supporting characters include Walter Henderson, Alan Munson, Ted Wheeler, Charles Sinclair and more.",
      "Essentially, the production depicts the parents from the TV series when they were just teenagers.",
      "\u201cWe try to remind the audience that these are kids,\u201d McCartney says. \u201cAnd that is the most scariest, heartbreaking thing about the play, is that they\u2019re so young, and they\u2019re dealing with so much that it\u2019s impossible for them all not to go in the wrong direction.\u201d",
      "The play was written by Kate Trefry, a screenwriter on the Netflix show. She was only given a few parameters: a prequel story and the \u201850s setting.",
      "\"I was kind of given free rein from there \u2014\u00a0within the very specific confines of the material that exists already and then what's coming in Season 5,\" Trefry tells TODAY.com.",
      "Developing the Story",
      "\"Stranger Things: The First Shadow\" started with a pitch from British director and producer Stephen Daldry, known for \"Billy Elliot\" and \"The Crown.\" Daldry and co-director Justin Martin brought the idea to Matt and Ross Duffer, the creators of the show, and together, they imagined a Henry Creel origin story.",
      "\"It became clear that it was going to be impossible for somebody who's not part of the 'Stranger Things' world to execute this if they wanted it to be canon,\" Trefry says. \"So that was when they came to me.\"",
      "Trefry, who was seven months pregnant at the time and hadn't written for the stage before, originally said no. Similarly, Josh Simon, vice president of consumer products at Netflix, reacted to the idea with a degree of nervousness.",
      "\"How are we actually going to bring this thing to life?\" he remembers thinking.",
      "It started with a script. Trefry was writing the play while she was in the writers' room for Season 5 of \"Stranger Things,\" and she felt she brought a \"privileged insight.\" While the play primarily follows Henry Creel and his friend Patty Newby (Bob's younger sister), young Joyce, Hopper and Bob are on their own journey trying to figure out what's behind a series of animal murders in Hawkins.",
      "\"I was doing so much work to think about, like, who was Joyce? If this is the beginning of Joyce\u2019s story that starts in the \u201850s, what is the perfect final arc for her and Hopper?\" Trefry recalls asking.",
      "The origins of characters like Joyce, Hopper, Bob and the parents of Mike Wheeler, Lucas Sinclar, Dustin Henderson and more have been a conversation in the writers' room for 10 years, Trefry says.",
      "\"If these people went to high school together, what was the 'Breakfast Club'?\" she quips.",
      "In the play, Ted Wheeler and Karen Childress are depicted as a popular attractive high school couple. Joyce leads the school play and dreams of a scholarship to attend college in Indianapolis. Sue Sinclair (then Anderson) is the senior class president. Bob is the school's radio host, and Hopper is desperate to leave Hawkins amid his father's plans to make him join the army.",
      "\"It was kind of like a writing exercise to reverse engineer personalities and say, who was this person and how did the event of the play change them to become the person that we know from the show?\" Trefry explains.",
      "Joyce grew up to be fiercely protective of her family, a trait that can be linked to the Creel family tragedy, which she, Hopper and Bob tried to prevent, Trefry says. Hopper, meanwhile, is burdened by the guilt of it all.",
      "\"That was kind of the magic trick of trying to put all of these pieces together in a way that would be really satisfying for people who know the show, but also makes sense for someone who's never seen it,\" she says.",
      "Trefry describes her first draft, which was used to pitch the play to Netflix, as \"super long\" and \"not the best.\" From there, they cast actors for each role \u2014 including Alison Jaye, currently starring as Joyce in the Broadway production \u2014 and gathered everyone in a big room in Los Angeles for a reading.",
      "\"Bare bones, with no costumes, no nothing, just actors reading,\" Trefry says.",
      "Simon attended this workshop, along with the Duffer brothers, executive producer Shawn Levy and more Netflix representatives.",
      "\"Having these actors in an empty room reading through the script was so energizing,\" Simon tells TODAY.com. \"At the same time, you left feeling, 'This is amazing,' and 'How in the world are they going to bring this to life in a way that delivers on the promise of the spectacle?'\"",
      "Enter: Miriam Buether.",
      "Bringing Another Dimension to Life",
      "While tasked with re-creating the alternate dimension from the show, stage designer Miriam Buether started with the \"real world,\" aiming to design a space that could hold all the special effects Trefry had written.",
      "\"(Trefry) hadn't written for theater before, so she didn't really know what was possible and what wasn't, which sort of gave us a great challenge, but also great possibility,\" Buether tells TODAY.com. \"Because she wrote them in the first place, we then had to find a way to make it work, which was a lot of fun.\"",
      "The \"holding space\" built to contain the engineering feats required for the production became the set for Hawkins High, which Buether designed using reference photos from the filming of Season 5.",
      "The goal was for the set to be able to flip from real to unreal spaces, like the liminal space Buether calls the Black Void, in seconds. In the play, the Black Void is designated by changes in lighting, sound, a body double for McCartney, theatrical fog and more.",
      "Like the TV series, the play is full of jump scares and gasp-worthy moments. In the Black Void, Henry encounters a Demogorgon, and his telekinetic powers permit violent attacks on animals and eventually, people. At one point, the Mind Flayer, a giant shadowy beast that has wormed and twisted its way into Henry's mind, is revealed to the audience.",
      "In London, the Mind Flayer was built into the arch framing the top of the stage, Buether says, but the reveal of the monster \"never felt completely satisfying.\" For Broadway, they had another go at designing the Mind Flayer, using illustrations and models to plan how the puppet could move.",
      "Now, the giant puppet-like figure descends from the top of the stage, out and over the orchestra as its tendrils move above the audience.",
      "\"The first time it really descended ... was quite spectacular, and then video and light and sound brought it to life,\" Buether recalls. \"When it all came together it was quite frightening, actually.\"",
      "Buether, who won the 2025 Tony Award for best scenic design in a play, says she's never worked as closely with a creative team as she did for \"Stranger Things: The First Shadow.\"",
      "\"Theater, of course, is always a collaborative process,\" Buether says. \"But this was more like, unless we all work together and we're all on the same page at any moment, this is actually not going to work.\"",
      "Revelations About the Villain of 'Stranger Things'",
      "\ud83d\udea8Warning: This section contains spoilers for the events of \u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow.\u201d",
      "If \"Stranger Things\" Season 4 depicted Henry Creel as a psychopathic child who brutally murdered his family, \"Stranger Things: The First Shadow\" unpacks all the conditions that led to his acts of violence.",
      "After several self-tapes, workshops and group auditions, McCartney was cast to play Henry when it opened in the West End, and he reprises the role now as it runs on Broadway.",
      "\"I love characters that have a mind,\" McCartney says of Henry. \"Characters who just think right in front of you. Characters who stand for something. Characters who can do something with their role in the story. They're either influential, or they f--- it all up by doing something bad.\"",
      "When he first took on the role, McCartney says he thought Henry was a \"bad kid.\"",
      "\"Now, having done it a year in London and six months here, I really, really feel for the kid,\" he says.",
      "The play reveals that before moving to Hawkins, Henry lived near a military base in Nevada. Shortly after turning 8, Henry went missing for a few hours before he was found in a cave. He likely encountered a doctor involved in testing a survivor of a government initiative, Project Rainbow, which tried to make a ship invisible via electromagnetic energy, but actually transported it to another dimension. That survivor is none other than ship Capt. Brenner, Dr. Brenner's father.",
      "The visit to another dimension changed Capt. Brenner, down to his blood type. It's implied the young Henry encountered something from Capt. Brenner that exposed him to the other dimension.",
      "That explains why Henry is tormented by the Black Void. But it doesn't absolve him of the choices he makes to continue giving into the Void's power, especially as Patty begs him not to.",
      "\u201cHe makes bad decisions, and he likes it, and that\u2019s what\u2019s so interesting is that he will do something that will make him feel shame and guilt and fear and regret, and then he has this deep desire to do it again, because he knows deep inside of him that somehow that felt good, and he felt stronger, and he felt more than he was,\u201d McCartney explains.",
      "As he developed his approach to Henry, McCartney says he spoke to the series star Jamie Campbell Bower to understand the mind of the character. \"My goal of that talk was to listen, because he takes spot No. 1,\" he says.",
      "The character is \"malleable,\" McCartney says, constantly changing at the influence of Patty, Dr. Brenner and his parents.",
      "\"It's never just one thing, and that gives me so much every night, and it's just been such a joy to grow with the character,\" he says.",
      "But one constant has been the daunting goal of humanizing a supervillain.",
      "\"We weren't coming at this looking at it like a gimmick. It could easily be a super duper immersive Las Vegas event. You know, 'The Stranger Things Show,'\" McCartney says. \"But we wanted something else out of it. We wanted people to feel for these characters like you do in the TV show. You wanted to see them fight for their f----- lives.\""

    "story": [
      "When \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders\u201d premiered in 2024, the docuseries left some viewers asking how much (or how little) the NFL cheerleaders are paid.",
      "Season 2 of the popular Netflix series, which aired June 18, shows several members of the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders stepping up to push for more livable wages.",
      "In light of the success of Season 1, some DCC members were emboldened to start a conversation with management about their pay, explaining their effort to make compensation better for future generations of cheerleaders.",
      "Read on for what \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts\u201d reveals of how the DCC are paid.",
      "What Season 1 Showed of DCC\u2019s Salaries",
      "Season 1 of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts\u201d gave an inside look into what it takes to be an NFL cheerleader, from tryouts to playoffs.",
      "The 36 women who end up on the team appear to spend hours at dance rehearsals, volunteering around Dallas, Texas, and performing at games. At one point in the docuseries, the cheerleaders\u2019 coaching staff said that the dancers typically clock an 11-hour day on game days.",
      "But the show also revealed that most of the women work an additional full-time job, on top of being a Cowboys cheerleader. In their introduction, some of the cheerleaders said they worked jobs as doctors, nurses, accountants, fitness instructors and more.",
      "How Much Do NFL Cheerleaders Make?",
      "In 2024, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts\u201d director and executive producer Greg Whiteley told Glamour that he never received a \u201cclean answer\u201d on the cheerleaders\u2019 wages.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s because it varies depending on how senior you are in the group. You may even get paid more if you\u2019re a group leader, though that was never clear to me,\u201d he said.",
      "The rates for NFL cheerleaders are not made public, but some reporting, as well as the docuseries, give insights into estimates.",
      "In \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts,\u201d former Cowboys cheerleader Kat Puryear, who concluded her tenure on the team in 2022, compared their pay to that of \u201ca substitute teacher\u201d or a full-time \u201cChick-fil-A worker.\u201d",
      "In a follow-up video Puryear shared to TikTok in June 2024, she explained that, when she was on the team, the cheerleaders were paid a flat fee for games, in addition to an hourly rate.",
      "For public appearances, cheerleaders were also paid an hourly rate and flat fee, but tenure plays a role in that amount, she said in the video. Because many of the women work another job, Puryear said the public appearances were not required. She added that for practices, the athletes are solely compensated an hourly rate.",
      "\u201cSo all in all, it\u2019s a full-time commitment, part-time pay,\u201d she said at the time.",
      "As seen in the docuseries, DCC members also score several perks as part of their roles, including meal prep services, gym memberships, beauty services (tanning, nails, makeup, hair, skincare, etc.), products, dental treatments and more.",
      "NBC Sports Boston reported in 2022 that NFL cheerleaders make, on average, about $150 per game, which comes out to about $22,500 per year. The athletes were reportedly also making about $50 to $75 for public appearances at the time.",
      "However, pay differs among teams. The outlet reported that Dallas\u2019 cheerleaders in 2022 were making about $15-20 per hour, which, with game and public appearance fees, totaled to about $75,000 a year.",
      "Per old footage in the Netflix docuseries, the cheerleaders were, at one point, making $15 per game. However, in interviews with former cheerleaders, some said they were \u201csurprised (the Cowboys) paid anything,\u201d calling their job an \u201chonorary position.\u201d",
      "Former cheerleader Tina Kalina, who was on the team in the 1980s, said in the docuseries that she made $35 per game.",
      "\u201cThese millennials, X-Gen, whatever they\u2019re called, they do look at it as a job, whereas us old-timers look at it as more of a privilege,\u201d she said.",
      "What Season 2 Reveals About DCC\u2019s Salaries",
      "In Season 2 of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts,\u201d several members of the DCC have a message for Cowboys\u2019 management: Put your money where your mouth is.",
      "When it comes time to sign contracts for the year, a group consisting of several veteran DCC members unites to push for change.",
      "While some DCC members are hesitant to confront management, saying they can \u201ccan see both sides,\u201d others opened up about financial difficulties like being unable to pay rent and \u201cexhaustion\u201d from working multiple jobs.",
      "In the show, the group pushing for change consults with outside legal sources and meets with management, which doesn't initially lead to changes. The team considers a walkout to protest the pay, which falls through. Many still debate not turning in their contracts unless changes are made.",
      "In the season finale, however, the athletes receive great news: management has approved a 400% pay increase.",
      "While reflecting on the achievement, DCC Armani Latimer said, \u201cI love the fact that I made change for the girls that are coming up behind me even if I\u2019m not getting the chance to benefit.\u201d",
      "\u201cDancers are athletes. They have so much value. That\u2019s all I could ever want. So I\u2019m excited to come back,\u201d DCC Megan McElaney added.",
      "What has DCC said about pay?",
      "In regards to the increased salaries revealed at the end of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts\u201d Season 2, the Cowboys told NBC News in a statement June 18, \u201cWe\u2019re pleased, as you\u2019ll see in the series, that the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders were happy with the outcome.\u201d",
      "Charlotte Jones, Cowboys\u2019 chief brand officer and daughter of team owner Jerry Jones, addressed the cheerleaders\u2019 pay in Season 1 of the docuseries.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cynicism around pay for NFL cheerleaders \u2014 and as it should be. They\u2019re not paid a lot,\u201d Jones said in the first season. \u201cBut the facts are that they actually don\u2019t come here for the money. They come here for something that\u2019s actually bigger than that to them.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey have a passion for dance,\u201d she continued. \u201cThere are not a lot of opportunities in the field of dance to get to perform at an elite level. It is about being a part of something bigger than themselves. It is about a sisterhood that they were able to form; about relationships that they have for the rest of their life.\u201d",
      "In 2018, former Cowboys cheerleader Erica Wilkins, who danced from 2014 to 2017, sued the organization for allegedly working over 40 hour weeks, making less than $7.25 per hour. The lawsuit, obtained by TODAY.com, also alleged that the team\u2019s mascot made more than the cheerleaders.",
      "At the time, Wilkins claimed in the lawsuit that she was making $200 per game. During her time on the team, Wilkins also claimed that her gross wages ranged from about $5,800 to $16,500 annually.",
      "Per court documents, Wilkins filed to dismiss the case in July 2018. In 2019, Wilkins\u2019 attorney told WFAA that the matter was resolved.",
      "The Dallas Cowboys declined to comment at the time on cheerleader pay and Wilkins\u2019 lawsuit.",
      "The Cowboys aren\u2019t the only team to face lawsuits from cheerleaders. In 2017, more than 20 organizations with cheerleading teams were named in an antitrust lawsuit filed by a Jane Doe representing cheerleaders across the NFL, NBC News reported. The suit alleged the NFL conspired to keep cheerleader wages as low as possible.",
      "The NFL teams\u2019 motion to dismiss the lawsuit was granted in May 2017, per court documents."

    "story": [
      "Rafael L. Silva got the call that he booked \"The Waterfront\" on a Friday. On Tuesday, he was already filming.",
      "\"What I was understanding from the role itself \u2014\u00a0and it was my first time experiencing this in my young career \u2014 was that, oh, they want me to really just be me,\" he tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"The Waterfront\" follows the affluent Buckley family in a fictional North Carolina coastal town as they struggle to keep their fishery business afloat and turn to drug smuggling to make ends meet.",
      "Silva's character, Shawn, is introduced as the new bartender at the family's restaurant. He shares that he's from Galveston, Texas, and in town because he \"wanted a change.\" But his skills \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014\u00a0behind the bar draw suspicion from Buckley matriarch Belle (Maria Bello).",
      "It's revealed in Episode 2 that Shawn was born from an affair between his late mother, Bebe, and head of the Buckley family, Harlan Buckley (Holt McCallany). Rather than a former bartender, Shawn is actually a law student at the University of Texas at Austin. (Silva, known for starring in the Austin-set \"9-1-1: Lone Star,\" which ended in February 2025, calls this a \"happy coincidence,\" adding, \"Maybe Shawn and Carlos crossed paths, we don't know.\")",
      "Shawn learned the name of his father as his mother died. So, he decided to temporarily leave his life as he knew it, including his boyfriend, to meet his family.",
      "\"Shawn goes the literal distance to learn who his father is, and learning the possibility that he has a father,\" Silva, 31, says. \"I, Rafael,  moved to this country with my mom and my brother to be reunited with my own father. I was 13, and we also went the literal distance for that to happen.\"",
      "Shawn likely never imagined folding into the fiercely loyal Buckley family. By the end, he\u2019s a key member of the group, stepping up to defend Belle when a threat arrives, and  coming up with a plan to save his half-sister Bree Buckley (Melissa Benoist) after she\u2019s kidnapped.",
      "\"The places where Shawn and I may share in our own existence is this blessed ignorance of not knowing what's ahead,\" he adds, \"but knowing that you have to let go of everything that you have in order to find out what you're capable of having or receiving in the future.",
      "\"That's something that I truly connect deeply, because as an immigrant in this country, and especially with the state of the country right now, we didn't come with any one agenda,\" the Brazilian actor says. \"I've never dreamed of being an actor. I never dreamed of living the life that I'm living now.\"",
      "Shawn's goal of finding where he belongs slowly unfolds over the course of the show, against the backdrop of Harlan, Belle, Bree and Cane's (Jake Weary) scheming to keep their business operating and their drug smuggling under the radar.",
      "\"If we go to the core of who I think this character is ... I think there's just this very quiet but thunderous need to not feel alone in life,\" Silva says.",
      "Silva says creator Kevin Williamson, also responsible for \"Dawson's Creek\" and \"The Vampire Diaries,\" essentially \"builds the foundation of a house.\" And Silva was able to add in details of the character from there, imagining key traits and a rich backstory. His key question was: Why is Shawn in Havenport, and why now?",
      "\"I did take my own creative place in justifying Shawn's relationship with his mother, and justifying, like, how come this m---------- can kick some ass, you know?\" he says.",
      "Silva says Shawn came to Havenport because his mother's death marked losing \"the most important person.\" Now, he essentially has nothing to lose.",
      "\"Yes, the romantic partner is important, but (with) family, when it comes to blood, it's irreplaceable,\" he says. \"Blood is irreplaceable when it comes to connection. And I think Shawn is after that.\"",
      "But Shawn\u2019s gradually introduced to the reality of the family\u2019s dealings, which Silva says likely runs counter to his \"strong moral compass\" and respect for the rules as a future lawyer. And by the end, Shawn may have signed up for more than he bargained for. In the explosive finale, Shawn and Cane hatch a plan to rescue Bree, sneaking onto drug supplier Grady's (Topher Grace) boat before a bloody shootout leaves Grady dead.",
      "\"I think Shawn is brokenhearted a little bit by the reality that he's come across who this family,\u00a0who his family, is,\" Silva says.",
      "Silva imagines that his character hoped for a world in which the family he met in Havenport was \"normal\" \u2014\u00a0or at least, not at the helm of a criminal enterprise.",
      "\"He's that compass in the family that is just like, constantly being bombarded with things that makes him want to crawl out of his own skin,\" Silva says. \"I also have questions for Kevin. Who is this guy in the face of all of this? Who has he become? Because at the end of the day, he's still Harlan's son.\""

    "story": [
      "Kelley Wolf says a group of her friends \"held her against (her) will\" months ago because they were \"worried\" about her.",
      "The author and former \"Real World\" franchise star, 48, who was hospitalized last week after she filmed herself being detained by law enforcement officers in Utah, said June 19 on Instagram that \"a small but very vocal group of PC lex-friends\" told her they had been concerned about her.",
      "\"No one showed up. No one lit a candle or asked a question. They called the cops from a beach town in Florida or somewhere seaside\u2026 while sipping cocktails,\" she wrote alongside a selfie that showed her smiling.",
      "\"That\u2019s not love. That\u2019s control,\" she added. \"What happened was legal. But it wasn\u2019t right. And it should never be that easy to weaponize concern \u2014 especially against women.\u201d",
      "Wolf's lengthy post comes less than two weeks after she and her husband, former \"Party of Five\" star Scott Wolf, announced June 10 that they were divorcing after 21 years of marriage.",
      "Later the same day, Scott Wolf told TODAY.com in a statement that he was the one who filed for divorce from his wife, calling it \u201cthe most difficult decision\u201d of his life.",
      "In her June 19 Instagram post, Kelley Wolf said she had \"initiated a separation almost a year ago.\"",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to file for divorce for months, but delays with legal counsel slowed the process,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYes, the official petition came from the other party, but let the record show: I\u2019ve been grieving this marriage for years.\u201d",
      "Three days after the couple announced their split, Kelley Wolf shared a disturbing video that showed her being detained by law enforcement officers in Utah.",
      "One officer in the video informed Kelley Wolf that she was \u201cnot going to jail,\u201d adding that he and the other officers wanted to get her \u201csome help.\u201d",
      "The officer also said he wanted to \u201cmake sure\u201d Kelley Wolf was OK after learning she recently made \u201cconcerning\u201d comments to loved ones.",
      "After Kelley Wolf posted the video to Instagram, Utah County\u2019s Sheriff\u2019s Office issued a press release saying that they responded to Sundance Resort \u201cfor a report that a female needed some help.\u201d",
      "\u201cUpon speaking with the female, our deputies learned that she had made concerning comments to a family member, and she also made similar comments to our deputies,\u201d the statement read, adding that because of that, she was transported to a local hospital.",
      "While in the hospital, Kelley Wolf shared several updates on Instagram. She claimed in one reel that she had been taken against her will and urged followers to check on her children: Jackson, 16; Miller, 12; and Lucy, 11.",
      "She followed up on June 18 by sharing a pic of her arm stacked with gold bracelets, and what appeared to be a hospital bracelet, resting beside a drink. \u201cHi,\u201d she wrote in text overlaid on the image.",
      "In her most recent Instagram post on June 19, Kelley Wolf shared her feelings about the end of her marriage, explaining that she was \"far past\" the grief phase and was now \"well into the healing.\"",
      "She also addressed online critics who have expressed concern about her mental health since her hospitalization. Though Wolf said being single now is \"surprisingly great,\" she added that she \"might get married\" again some day.",
      "\"So if you could stop calling me crazy, I\u2019d appreciate it,\" she wrote, adding, \"You absolute idiots.\"",
      "\"Some of you crossed lines \u2014 contacted my family, even my children. One allegedly threatened to show up at my house with a tire iron. I\u2019ll be handling that legally.",
      "\"But don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m good. I\u2019m rested. My kids are safe. And I\u2019m finally free,\" she added.",
      "She also wrote in overlaid text on her selfie image, \"Divorce is hard. However, it's not as hard on the adults as it is the kids, which is why I want you to leave them alone. Are we clear?\"",
      "She reshared her selfie in her Instagram story, adding a note directly to her children.",
      "\"And to my kids ....momma is a badass. She's nice but damn,\" she wrote in more overlaid text.",
      "\"And my kids and I will be, I hope, going on a vacay ... so ... yeah. Bye for now,\" she added."

      "Fans of \"The Golden Girls\" know the show's zany characters often quibbled on screen for laughs, but it seems two of its stars \u2014 Bea Arthur and Betty White \u2014 had a tense relationship off screen as well during the series' seven-season run.",
      "\u201cWhen that red light was on (and the show was filming), there were no more professional people than those women, but when the red light was off, those two couldn\u2019t warm up to each other if they were cremated together,\u201d co-producer Marsha Posner Williams joked during a recent \"Golden Girls\" panel discussion at the Pride LIVE! Hollywood festival, according to The Hollywood Reporter.",
      "Williams recalled that Arthur, who died in 2009 at age 86,  sometimes referred to White, who died in 2021 at age 99, using a profane slur for a woman.",
      "Arthur \u201cused to call me at home and say, \u2018I just ran into that c--- at the grocery store. I\u2019m gonna write her a letter,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Bea, just get over it for crying out loud. Just get past it,'\" said Williams.",
      "Williams added, \"I remember, my husband and I went over to Bea\u2019s house a couple of times for dinner. Within 30 seconds of walking in the door, the C-word came out.\"",
      "Casting director Joel Thurm, who was also on the panel, chimed in to say he'd also heard Arthur refer to White using the same slur.",
      "The \u201cGolden Girls,\u201d which also starred Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty, told the story of a group of older women who lived together in a single-family home in Miami. The Emmy-winning series aired from 1985 to 1992 on NBC.",
      "As for what caused the longstanding rift between former \"Maude\" star Arthur and former \"Mary Tyler Moore Show\" star White, the panelists tossed out different theories, according to The Hollywood Reporter.",
      "Co-producer Jim Vallely thought it was because White got more applause during tapings.",
      "Williams said that Arthur \"hated\" when White would break character and talk to the studio audience while shooting. She also shared that Arthur was the only one of the show's stars who refused to continue on after Season 7.",
      "\"Their contracts were up and \u2026 the executives went to the ladies, and Estelle said, \u2018Yes, let\u2019s keep going,\u2019 and Rue said, \u2018Yes, let\u2019s keep going,\u2019 and Betty said, \u2018Yes, let\u2019s keep going.\u2019 And Bea said, \u2018No f------ way,\u2019 and that\u2019s why that show didn\u2019t continue.\u201d",
      "One of the show's writers, Stan Zimmerman, recalled in his 2024 memoir, \"The Girls: From Golden to Gilmore,\" that Arthur believed White was \"two-faced.\"",
      "\u201cBea liked real people,\u201d wrote Zimmerman, adding, \"I had the sense that Betty was more like Sue Ann Nivens, the character she played on 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show,' than she was like Rose. More conniving than the innocent airhead from St. Olaf.\u201d"

This was 1994,\u201d Bezos explained in an interview with Mathias D\u00f6pfner for Business Insider. \u201cBut even before she could say \u2018What\u2019s the internet?\u2019 she said, \u2018Great \u2014 let\u2019s go!\u2019 Because she wanted to support it, and she knew that I had always had this passion for invention and starting a company.\u201d",

We\u2019ve had such a great life together as a married couple, and we also see wonderful futures ahead, as parents, friends, partners in ventures and projects, and as individuals pursuing ventures and adventures.

Though we still have a lot to learn about how to act on these beliefs without contradicting and subverting them, we can begin by acknowledging that people working to build power from within communities are the agents of change. Their service supports and empowers people who go on to support and empower others.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The reviews are in!",
      "The new live-action remake of \"How to Train Your Dragon\" has  arrived; we asked the real experts, kids, what they think about it.",
      "The film, which stars Mason Thames as Hiccup, Nico Parker as Astrid and Gerard Butler as Stoick, hit theaters on June 13.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Butler talked about the movie and revealed how it paid homage to the 2010 animated version, which was inspired by the best-selling book series of the same name.",
      "Butler said \"a fine line had to be tread to pay homage to the original to keep the essence of the story.\" However, with director Dean DeBlois at the helm, he said that the cast was able to \"bring something that felt real fresh and original\" to the film.",
      "What are kids saying about the movie?",
      "TODAY.com spoke with kids about the movie, and the reviews were generally positive. Joseph, 12, who adored the movie, says he thinks the remake is \"an amazing movie for all ages.\u201d",
      "\"I thought it was awesome. It had good graphics. It looked like real dragons, and I think it moved nicely,\" he says.",
      "Wylie, also 12, agrees.",
      "\"I thought it was really good. A lot of time when they remake old movies, they change the story or something like that. They didn\u2019t do that here at all. The movie itself looked great. Everything was well paced,\" he says.",
      "Any suggestions for improvement? Ruby, 9, thought that the movie could've been better if it had no intimate scenes.",
      "\"I hate the kissing,\" she says. On the other hand, Clara, 9, says that she wanted \"more kissing.\"",
      "(For the record, the kissing scene between the two young lead actors is quite minimal and chaste.)",
      "Wylie, a huge fan of the original series, says the film did a good job representing all the characters, both human and dragon.",
      "But Ruby and Jane, 7, say they were displeased with how the movie brought Gronckle, the most ferocious dragon in the film, to life, as well as some of the other beasts.",
      "\"The Gronckle looks weird,\" Ruby tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"One thing I would change about the movie is Gronckle because it doesn't look like the cartoon,\" Jane adds. \"The Hideous Zippleback, the Gronckle and the Monstrous Nightmare don\u2019t look anything like the cartoon.\"",
      "When asked if the remake was better than the cartoon, Jane declares,  \"It's a tie.\"",
      "Emma, 8, said the remake met all of her expectations.",
      "\"I love it so much. I love it. I love everything,\" she said. \"But I\u2019m so sad that Hiccup had to lose his leg, even though it\u2019s necessary. I cried like, maybe twice, maybe even three times. And it\u2019s a great movie. I really, really recommend it.\"",
      "What are parents saying about the movie?",
      "TODAY Digital reporter Rosie Colosi McDevitt saw the film with her daughters, Ruby and Jane, their friends, and her husband, Ryan.",
      "She said if other parents plan to take their kids to see \"How to Train Your Dragon,\" then there's some things they should look out for, like the jump scares in the movie and how real the monstrous beasts looked.",
      "\"They looked as real and scary as the dinosaurs in 'Jurassic Park,'\" she said. \"There were even a handful of jump scares. The sweet 7-year-old on my left clutched my arm and said, 'I\u2019m scared!' five different times, but the 4-year-old on my right was having a grand old time.\"",
      "As for Ryan, he says \"How to Train Your Dragon\" has a questionable moral lesson, from an adult perspective. He says he also realized that the film is \"a lot harsher\" than the animated version.",
      "\"It\u2019s a little bit more graphic ...  I don\u2019t know if I would change this, but kids are supposed to listen to their parents. In this case, Hiccup didn\u2019t listen to his father, but he turned out to be right, so that means the message is \u2026 don\u2019t listen to your parents?\" he wondered.",
      "What is \u2018How to Train Your Dragon\u2019 about?",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d focuses on the friendship between Hiccup, a young Viking lad, and his dragon, Toothless. Although his Viking village and the dragons are bitter historical enemies,  Hiccup and Toothless must come together to save their family and friends against a greater threat.",
      "What is \u2018How to Train Your Dragon\u2019 rated?",
      "The movie is rated PG, which stands for parental guidance. This means that some material in the movie may not be suitable for young kids and parents should decide whether or not the film is appropriate for their kids to watch",
      "How is 'How to Train Your Dragon' different from the original?",
      "Bringing animated characters to life was no easy task. Butler said that he and the cast knew that they had some big shoes to fill for their roles, so they always thought about how they could make things \u201cmore richer and more nuanced\u201d for the remake.",
      "\u201cThis just sucks you in and it becomes its own story,\u201d he says of the remake. \u201cHow could anyone who\u2019s seeing this movie for the first time not be blown away or really enthralled and thrilled?\u201d",
      "Other than the effects, which brings the animated film to life, Butler said nothing comes close to the feeling that viewers will get from watching real actors play the roles.",
      "\u201cThe ability to see actual sadness, anger, fear, whatever that is, it makes it ultimately, a more powerful, emotional, relatable experience,\u201d he said."

      "The Buckley family\u2019s shady dealings caught up with them by the finale of Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Waterfront.\u201d",
      "The show created by Kevin Williamson follows a fishing family dynasty in the fictional Havenport, North Carolina, as they struggle to financially stay afloat. The family\u2019s patriarch, Harlan Buckley (Holt McCallany), stepped away from leading the restaurant and fishery due to his health, leaving son Cane (Jake Weary) to take his place.",
      "The show, which hit Netflix June 19, opens with two of the Buckleys\u2019 employees being murdered after Cane decided to take on drug smuggling runs using the company\u2019s boats to bring in extra cash.",
      "From there, the entire family, including mom Belle (Maria Bello) and daughter Bree (Melissa Benoist), is implicated in Harlan and Cane\u2019s criminal activity, culminating in a final faceoff against Grady (Topher Grace), a supplier at the helm of the rapidly unraveling drug operation.",
      "And by the end of Episode 8, Williamson, known for creating \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d and \u201cThe Vampire Diaries,\u201d tells TODAY.com that it\u2019s time for a new Buckley \u201cto step forward\u201d as leader of the pack.",
      "Below, read a breakdown of all the twists and turns in \u201cThe Waterfront\u201d Season 1 finale.",
      "How Does 'The Waterfront' End?",
      "\u201cThe Waterfront\u201d finale picks up right where Episode 7 ended, with yet another kidnapping. This time, it\u2019s Bree and her estranged son, Diller (Brady Hepner).",
      "Seeking revenge against the Buckleys, Grady took the mother and son to try and draw out patriarch Harlan, who was responsible for blowing up the farm where he produced opium.",
      "Back at the house, the family, which now firmly includes Shawn (Rafael Silva), revealed to be Harlan\u2019s son from an affair, hatches a plan to get Bree back. While Harlan pretends to surrender, Cane and Shawn sneak onto Grady\u2019s boat to free Bree and Diller.",
      "But before they arrive, Bree tries to fight back on her own. As a result, she\u2019s shot in the leg and thrown overboard. Diller throws her a life-saving kit, complete with a raft and flare gun.",
      "Unable to find Bree, Cane and Shawn reveal themselves to save Harlan, starting a shootout with Grady and his men.",
      "Who Dies in 'The Waterfront' Finale?",
      "In a final standoff on the boat, Harlan, Cane and Grady go face to face. Held at gunpoint by the father and son, Grady puts his weapon down.",
      "Taunting Cane for being unable to pull the trigger, Grady turns to Harlan and asks, \u201cYou want this guy for a son?\u201d",
      "Cane then shoots Grady multiple times in the face, and he falls into the water.",
      "Meanwhile afloat on the life raft, Bree falls in and out of consciousness before her family arrives to her rescue and rushes her to the hospital.",
      "In the waiting room, Cane appears haunted by the murder, but Harlan reassures him, \u201cGrady never would have stopped. ... You were protecting your family.\u201d",
      "Weary, who plays Cane, tells TODAY.com that the final murder represents a turning point for him.",
      "\u201cI think he crosses the threshold into the life of crime that he maybe never saw himself being thrust into,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it does come from a place of need, that he needs to protect his family and that means taking a life .... It\u2019s also proving to his father that he\u2019s capable of doing these things, and making him proud in a morbid way.\u201d",
      "What Does Belle Do?",
      "The show seemingly wraps on a high note for the Buckley family. Belle and Harlan reaffirm their love for each other, Cane reconnects with his wife Peyton (Danielle Campbell) after carrying on an affair, and Bree is reunited with Diller. Meanwhile, the new sheriff, Drew, tells Harlan the boat was \"all clean\" of any evidence, suggesting they quite literally got away with murder.",
      "Williamson says Season 1 is only the beginning for the Buckleys.",
      "\u201cBree has earned her place. She's no longer on the outside, she's no longer an outcast,\" Williamson says. \"And I think Cane has grown and he's gotten some answers. ... I think he's sort of reconciling his life choices.",
      "\"Harlan is going back to a life of crime, which he wears very well, and he kind of finds his purpose again,\" he adds. \"And I think Belle \u2014 we've just barely brushed the surface of this family.\"",
      "At the very end, Belle\u2019s previous attempt to save the Buckley enterprise comes back around. While Cane turned to drug running to raise the funds needed to keep their business open, Belle worked with Wes Benson (Dave Annable) to potentially sell some of their waterfront property in Havenport. Over the course of the dealings, Belle carried on an affair with Wes.",
      "Belle eventually backed out of the land deal, claiming the sale would \"kill\" Harlan. But having knowledge of the family's finances, Wes goes behind her back to buy up some of the Buckley family's debts, effectively taking away control of the property.",
      "While Harlan was furious at Belle going behind his back, it doesn\u2019t seem to stop her from doing it again. To get rid of some bodies at the fishery, Belle enlists the help of, in Williamson's words, a \"new threat in town\" \u2014 the Parkers.",
      "Belle calls on Emmett Parker, part of another crime-running family responsible for killing Harlan's father decades ago. Emmett reminds her of their shared history and says he's on her side.",
      "\"Maybe you should be in charge,\" he tells her. \"If you ever needed a favor, I could be a friend to you.\"",
      "Later at the hospital, Belle takes a call from Emmett.",
      "\"We'll help you with the land deal, but only if you take over,\" he says.",
      "The very last scene of Season 1 reveals that she took that deal. She walks into the fish house to find Emmett, with Wes tied up and brutally beaten.",
      "\"We'll need his complete loyalty, to both of us,\" Emmett explains after Belle asks if they're going to kill him.",
      "Emmett then rips the tape off Wes' mouth and says, \"Well, what do you have to say to your new boss?\"",
      "Williamson says Belle's turn to crime boss was a long time coming.",
      "\u201cShe married into the Buckleys, and I think she has always pulled the strings in the shadows,\u201d Williamson says. \u201cI think by the end, she realizes she\u2019s more of a Buckley than Harlan \u2014 and that it's time for her to stand front and center and he needs to sit down.",
      "\"She's tired of having to go through him and convince him and sort of work with him,\" he adds. \"And now she's just going to take charge.\"",
      "Overall, Season 1 leaves the Buckleys and Belle \u201cbeholden to this other crime family \u2014 and that's not going to go well,\" Williamson says."

      "The airstrikes, which targeted the Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites, are the first time the United States has conducted a direct military attack on Iran, and they further escalated a military conflict between Iran and Israel that began on June 13.",
      "U.S. Navy submarines also launched 30 Tomahawk missiles into Iran.",
      "Trump\u2019s claim about the result of the strikes could not be independently confirmed.",
      "Follow along for live coverage",
      "\u201cThere will be either peace or there will be tragedy,\u201d Trump said in a nationally televised address from the White House, with Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio flanking him. \u201cRemember, there are many targets left. ... [I]f peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill.\u201d",
      "Trump first announced the strikes on Truth Social at 7:50 p.m. ET.",
      "At the White House, Trump thanked God, the military and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying U.S. officials \"worked as a team\" with their counterparts in Tel Aviv.",
      "Netanyahu, in his first public comments on the U.S. strikes, congratulated Trump for his \u201cbold decision to target Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities with the awesome and righteous might\u201d of the American military.",
      "The decision will \u201cchange history,\u201d Netanyahu said in an English-language video statement.",

      "A gamble by Trump",
      "Trump\u2019s decision to bomb Iran represents a gamble that U.S. military action against Tehran\u2019s nuclear program can remain limited in scope and that the United States will not be drawn into another open-ended war in the Middle East.",
      "Trump and his aides appear to have calculated that the U.S. action did not mean opening the door to a long-term military assault on Iran and that a one-off strike could deal a decisive blow to Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions.",
      "U.S. military commanders have not yet outlined the possible damage to Iran\u2019s nuclear sites, including a deeply buried facility in Fordo believed to hold enriched uranium and sophisticated centrifuges. If the bombing was less than precise or if Iran moved key nuclear-related hardware, U.S. aircraft could still be ordered back to finish the job.",
      "Even if the bombing raids hit their targets, the decision to attack Iran carries risks and uncertainties.",
      "If Trump\u2019s gamble pays off, Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities will be set back years and possibly decades. Iran could find itself severely weakened, having suffered a series of devastating blows over the past year from Israel\u2019s military and intelligence operations.",
      "But Iran has a history of striking at more powerful adversaries by using asymmetric tactics, including terrorist attacks. In 1983, Washington accused Iran of using Lebanese Hezbollah militants to carry out lethal bombings of a Marine Corps barracks and the U.S. Embassy in Beirut.",
      "With both Israel and the United States bombing its territory and Israel\u2019s government suggesting Iran\u2019s government might collapse, Iran\u2019s political leaders are likely to see the current conflict as a fight for the survival of their regime.",
      "Iran has said it has a right to self-defense if it is attacked, and it could be looking to strike at U.S. bases or embassies in and outside the region. Iran still has ballistic and cruise missiles that it could try to fire at American bases in the Persian Gulf or elsewhere, a scenario the U.S. military has long prepared for.",
      "It\u2019s not clear whether Iran could retaliate with missile attacks on U.S. or allied forces in the Gulf. Israel has managed to intercept many of the ballistic missiles and drones that Iran has fired over the past week, though its air defenses are coming under increasing strain.",

      "Such a move could cause havoc in the oil markets and the global economy. But it would also disrupt Iran\u2019s own oil exports, depriving the country\u2019s struggling economy of badly needed oil revenue. And it could antagonize other countries that have so far stayed out of the conflict.",

      "But its most important ally, Hezbollah in Lebanon, has been devastated by a series of Israeli attacks and assassinations. And in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza, Hamas \u2014 which Iran armed and trained \u2014 has been badly weakened and its leaders have been killed.",

      "Partisan reaction",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., attacked Trump's decision to strike Iran, saying that \u201cthe risk of war has now dramatically increased.\u201d",

      "\u201cIran might retaliate today, tomorrow or in months. Or a year from now, Iran or its proxies might blow up a bus filled with American tourists in Cyprus,\u201d Vietor wrote on social media. \u201cNo one knows what comes next.

      "Trump did not say which type of bombs were used, but it was widely expected that the GBU-57 would be used. Earlier in the day, several American B-2 stealth bombers, which are the only plane that can carry GBU-57 bombs, which weigh 30,000 pounds, took off from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri.",
      "Trump's turn",
      "NBC News has reported that Trump initially opposed Israel\u2019s taking military action against Iran, favoring negotiations over bombing. But in the days before Israel's strikes on Iran, he became convinced that Israel\u2019s heightened anxiety over Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment capabilities was warranted.",
      "After a pivotal June 8 briefing from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, about Israel\u2019s plans and U.S. options for supporting its operation, Trump gave tacit approval for Israel to conduct strikes and for the U.S. to provide limited backing.",

    "summary": "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told NBC News\u2019 Andrea Mitchell that his government doesn\u2019t know \u201chow we can trust\u201d the U.S. after Israel's strikes.",
    "story": [
      "Iran is uncertain whether it can trust the United States in diplomatic talks after Israel launched an aerial attack on the country only days before scheduled negotiations with American officials, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Friday in an exclusive interview with NBC News.",
      "Asked by NBC News\u2019 Andrea Mitchell whether a deal with the United States could be reached within the two-week time frame recently given by President Donald Trump, Araghchi said it was up to the Trump administration \u201cto show their determination for going for a negotiated solution.\u201d",
      "But he suggested Washington was perhaps not genuinely interested in diplomacy and had merely used talks as a \u201ccover\u201d for Israel\u2019s air attack.",
      "At her briefing Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt delivered what she said was a message from Trump: \u201cBased on the fact that there\u2019s a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks.\u201d",
      "Israel, a staunch U.S. ally, last week launched airstrikes two days before a sixth round of negotiations between U.S. and Iranian officials, with intermediaries from Oman, had been scheduled to take place. U.S. officials said the administration was not involved in the Israeli military operation.",
      "\u201cSo they had perhaps this plan in their mind, and they just needed negotiations perhaps to cover it up,\u201d Araghchi said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how we can trust them anymore. What they did was, in fact, a betrayal to diplomacy.\u201d",
      "During the interview, which was conducted in Geneva after he held talks with European top diplomats, Araghchi said that his government was ready to negotiate but that Israel first had to halt its aerial attacks on Iran.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not prepared to negotiate with them anymore, as long as the aggression continues,\u201d he said.",
      "Araghchi said Iran would not give up uranium enrichment as Trump has demanded, and he said he had made that clear to U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "\u201cI told him several times zero enrichment is impossible,\u201d he said.",
      "Every country has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes, Araghchi said.",
      "\u201cThis is an achievement of our own scientists. It\u2019s a question of national pride and dignity,\u201d he said.",
      "As for Witkoff, Araghchi said he appeared unable to deliver on what had been discussed in previous meetings.",
      "\u201cI think he is a gentleman, somebody you can work with, but unfortunately, he changed his words every time we met. So maybe that was because he couldn\u2019t deliver what he promised to us,\u201d Araghchi said.",
      "He added, \u201cThere is a lack of confidence now between us because he didn\u2019t deliver his promises and what he told us that we can do.\u201d",
      "He and Witkoff do continue to communicate, though, he said.",
      "\u201cThere are some direct messages, some indirect messages we\u2019re exchanging,\u201d Araghchi said. \u201cAnd we have explained each other\u2019s positions to each other in order to prevent misunderstandings.\u201d",
      "He added that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean negotiation. They have asked us to negotiate, but we negotiate only when it is negotiation and not dictation.\u201d",
      "Araghchi also said the bombing of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities could not destroy the technical \u201cknowledge\u201d Iran has developed in its nuclear program.",
      "\u201cSuppose they destroy one facility or two,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can rebuild them, because the knowledge is here, the technology is there. We have achieved that ourselves, and the technology cannot be reversed, cannot be destroyed by bombs.\u201d",
      "If Trump decides to have the United States strike Iran, Araghchi said, his government reserves the right to retaliate, as it has done against Israel.",
      "\u201cWhen there is a war, both sides attack each other. That\u2019s quite understandable. And self-defense is a legitimate right of every country,\u201d Araghchi said.",
      "He added that \u201cif the U.S. joins Israel in these attacks, we will do the same.\u201d",
      "Addressing Israel\u2019s threat to target Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Araghchi said that such an act \u201cwould be the biggest crime they can commit\u201d but that \u201cthey won\u2019t be able to do that.\u201d",
      "The supreme leader, who has held power in Iran since 1989, is an unelected Shiite cleric who holds ultimate political authority in the Islamic Republic and can overrule the elected parliament and president.",
      "Araghchi said Khamenei \u201chas millions of followers, not only in Iran but in other countries.\u201d",
      "Trump has said the United States knows where Khamenei is but is not planning to target him, \u201cat least not for now.\u201d",
      "Asked whether he regarded Trump\u2019s comments as a threat, Araghchi said: \u201cI see it more as an insult. And I\u2019m amazed how the president of the so-called superpower can talk like this. We have always talked about President Trump respectfully.\u201d",
      "Araghchi added that it was \u201ccertainly not acceptable the way that he talked about our respected leader.\u201d",
      "To revive negotiations between Iran and the United States, Washington only needs to tell Israel to halt its airstrikes on Iran, he said.",
      "\u201cI think if Americans are serious to go back to diplomacy, what it needs is only a telephone call from Washington to Tel Aviv to stop everything,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThey can stop this process very quickly, and then we will consider diplomacy once again.\u201d",
      "Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have raised the possibility that the Iranian regime could collapse because of the effect of the Israeli bombardment. But Araghchi said Iran endured a long war against Iraq shortly after the 1979 revolution and would persevere in the current conflict.",
      "He said that Iranians have a long history of independence and that he hopes Trump \u201cunderstands Iranians and our pride and dignity.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are a great nation. We have lived ... for thousands of years in that place. We have never been a colony of any other power. We have been always independent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the cradle of civilization, the Persian civilization. So all those things cannot be bombed away.\u201d",
      "Araghchi is an experienced diplomat who was one of the top negotiators of the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers. That agreement limited Iran\u2019s nuclear work in return for an easing of U.S. and international sanctions. In his first term, Trump withdrew the United States from the accord."

      "From navigating tough weather in Australia to being questioned by police in Egypt, Ian Andersen has faced many challenges in his journeys biking across continents and documenting them on social media.",
      "But the American creator, known as \u201cridewithian\u201d to his 43,300 followers on TikTok, never had war on his list of possible hurdles \u2014 until last week. Amid his 29-day trek across Iran, Andersen found himself stuck just after Israeli forces began a \u201cpre-emptive\u201d strike on the country.",
      "As Iran and Israel continue to trade attacks, visitors like Andersen have scrambled to find ways to safely exit the Middle East. He was among several people to document how he was able to depart the country, and he shared his journey with followers.",
      "Andersen said that at first, he was determined to continue his Iran trip \u201cas intended.\u201d But then his guide, Reza, told him something that made him change course. \u201cI can no longer protect you,\u201d Reza said, according to Andersen. \u201cIf you\u2019re stopped by police, I should just wave goodbye, because there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d",
      "As of Wednesday, the State Department had advised citizens to \u201cleave Iran now\u201d and to have plans that do \u201cnot rely on U.S. government help.\u201d Other governments have also warned their citizens to leave the region as the conflict unfolds and airspace closes. The United Kingdom has advised against \"all travel to Iran.\" Similarly, Australia has said its citizens should not travel to Israel. Major U.S. carriers like Delta and American have offered rebooking options.",
      "Some Americans in Israel have also been able to leave the region after the state of Florida and a nonprofit organization arranged a flight to bring evacuees home.",
      "Andersen said his departure was possible only because of Reza, whose last name he did not share to protect his safety, and help from the State Department.",
      "\u201cI had a couple weeks there in country of really positive good experiences,\" he said in a phone interview. \"Experiencing Iran as it should be experienced.\u201d",
      "His first vlog from Iran, posted June 2, recorded him crossing into the country from Turkey. Not unlike other influencers whose content focuses on travel, Andersen also posted himself trying different local cuisines \u2014 including a fermented yogurt drink, a Persian omelet and kaleh pacheh, a stew made with goat head \u2014 and showing the hospitality of the Iranian people.",
      "\"They tried to give us for free and said we are their guests, but we had to insist,\" Andersen says in one video, which Reza explains is an example of the \"ta\u2019arof,\" a form of etiquette practiced by Iranians worldwide.",
      "As he biked around the country, he also captured the landscape and talked to viewers about the impact of sanctions, asking in one video, \"What happens when a country is cut off from the global economy for decades?\"",
      "The lighthearted, fun tone of his videos began to shift one week ago while he was in Chalus. Many of his followers began commenting, sharing concerns about his safety.",
      "\"Actually all of us are sad because this is happening,\" Reza says in one video after they heard news of the attack. \"But hope for world without war. ... Everybody needs a peaceful world.\"",
      "The two were headed toward Tehran to try to sort out a visa for Afghanistan, which was the next country on Andersen's itinerary.",
      "\"It's amazing that even after such an event, you know, an emergency, that people are so friendly,\" Andersen says after two people eating near them bring them a meal and insist they share with them.",
      "The information that was available in Iran was initially unclear, and it left Andersen with questions. Iran plunged into a near-total internet blackout this week, limiting Iranians\u2019 ability to access and share information with the outside world.",
      "The situation soon became \u201ctoo dangerous,\" Andersen says in another video, and he and Reza decided not to go to Tehran.",
      "\u201cIt ended up being a good call, \u2019cause there was just more and more attacks as the days went by,\u201d Andersen told NBC News as he reflected on his past week.",
      "\u201cThere was lots of rumors flying around about what borders might be open,\" he added. \"Like, what, like one of the requirements once you get to the border? Like if you\u2019re able to get a visa, if you can just go through. A lifeline came through via an email from the State Department about getting into Azerbaijan.\"",
      "He ultimately was able to exit through Azerbaijan with help from Reza, who drove them to the border. He said he \"probably wouldn\u2019t be here talking\" if it weren't for Reza.",
      "\"I\u2019m out, and truly grateful for all your prayers, messages, and support,\" Andersen wrote in a recent video update. \"It\u2019s an honor to have you following this journey and caring about my wellbeing out here in the Middle East. ... And finally, to my Iranian guide Reza\u2014there\u2019s no one I\u2019d rather have had by my side.\"",
      "Andersen said that since he left the country, his thoughts continue to be with the people of both Iran and Israel and that he is also \u201cthinking about all the people who don\u2019t have the option to leave, like I did.\u201d",
      "U.K.-based influencers Nadia Akhtar and Irfan Aziz, who go by the handle \"fieldofvisions\" on TikTok, where they have 60,000 followers, were also in Iran when the strikes began.",
      "The couple, who were unavailable for an interview, were traveling with their young son, Zakariya. They quickly realized they were among the last to enter the country on an incoming flight and soon had a front-row seat for the attacks from their balcony.",
      "\"Iranian forces were intercepting Israeli drones right above us,\" Aziz says in a video. \"That night, we realized this wasn't normal and it's nothing like what has happened before. We needed to start thinking about an exit plan.\"",
      "The advice they got from officials was simple: \u201cGet out now.\" Like Andersen, they said they leaned on help from their guide, Ali, to help them get out.",
      "Aziz said that at 1:30 a.m. that night, they drove with Ali \"through the night despite getting zero sleep\" to get to the Turkish border.",
      "\"It was when we approached Tabriz, seven hours from Tehran, the reality of the situation kicked in,\" Aziz says in the video, adding that they saw smoke rising in different areas around them.",
      "\"Locals told us five fighter jets had bombed a cement factory at 5 in the morning. Nowhere was truly safe,\" he added.",
      "Akhtar and Aziz described their goodbyes with their guide when they finally reached Turkey\u2019s border as \u201cemotional.\u201d",
      "\"Even though we had just met, he sacrificed his own family's safety, leaving them behind in Tehran to help us,\" Aziz says in part two of his video series about the experience. \"And for this, we will forever be grateful to him. But not everyone has the privilege of leaving like we did. Millions of people just like Ali are at the receiving end of the war that has nothing to do with them.\""

      "CALGARY, Alberta \u2014 Search teams located a second body Friday following a massive rockfall off a hiking trail in Canada\u2019s Banff National Park.",
      "The University of Alberta confirmed one of the two people killed in the rockfall in Banff National Park was retired educator Jutta Hinrichs, who was a leader in the Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine.",
      "Parks Canada officials say she was 70 and lived in Calgary.",
      "The slide happened Thursday afternoon north of Lake Louise on the Icefields Parkway, about 124 miles northwest of Calgary. It is also about 85 miles from the site of the Group of Seven summit held in Kananaskis, Alberta, this week.",
      "Three others were taken to the hospital and were reported in stable condition.",
      "Officials said no one else has been reported missing and there are no unidentified vehicles at the trailhead.",
      "The route runs along the edges of Bow Lake and is considered a moderate challenge for hikers and is used by tourists and day-trippers, including families. It\u2019s a region with limited cellular service.",
      "Niclas Brundell, a trail guide who lives in nearby Canmore, said he was hiking in the area with his wife Thursday when they both started seeing concerning signs of rocks tumbling and boulders the size of tires starting to fall.",
      "\u201cThis was unimaginable to me, that such a big piece of mountain would fall off,\u201d he said. As rocks started rolling at the top of the waterfall, he said, they didn\u2019t hit anyone, but he and his wife wondered why nobody seemed to be reacting.",
      "\u201cThen all of a sudden, I hear the start of another rockfall, and I turn around, and the whole mountainside is coming off.\u201d",
      "He said the slab seemed about 50 meters (164 feet) wide and 20 meters (60 feet) deep, and he and his wife started sprinting.",
      "When he turned around, he could see a group of between 15 and 30 people at the waterfall disappear under a cloud of dust.",
      "\u201cThe only place I\u2019ve ever seen something similar is like watching videos from 9-11, when you see New York being cast over,\u201d he said.",
      "He said there was a roar, \u201cand I just didn\u2019t see them anymore.\u201d",
      "Brundell said when they got far enough to feel safe, he sent a satellite message to Parks Canada, while his wife ran to a nearby lodge to call for help.",
      "He said it\u2019s a popular trail because it\u2019s considered relatively easy, and on any given summer day there are 15 people or more hiking the trail."

      "It is then expected to be transported to the nearby port of Termini Imerese on Monday and handed over to the authorities who are investigating the sinking.",
      "The recovery process has been made easier after the vessel\u2019s 72-metre mast was detached using a remote-controlled cutting tool and placed on the seabed on Tuesday.",
      "In addition to Lynch, founder of the software company Autonomy, his daughter Hannah, lawyer Chris Morvillo and his wife Neda, banker Jonathan Bloomer and his wife Judy, and chef Recaldo Thomas were killed when the yacht sank. Nine other crew members and six guests were rescued."

      "Pakistan said Saturday it would recommend President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, an accolade that he has said he craves, for his work in helping to resolve the recent conflict between India and Pakistan.",
      "Some analysts in Pakistan said the move might persuade Trump to think again about potentially joining Israel in striking Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. Pakistan has condemned Israel\u2019s action as a violation of international law and a threat to regional stability.",
      "In May, a surprise announcement by Trump of a ceasefire brought an abrupt end to a four-day conflict between nuclear-armed foes India and Pakistan.",
      "Trump has since repeatedly said that he averted a nuclear war, saved millions of lives, and grumbled that he got no credit for it. Pakistan agrees that U.S. diplomatic intervention ended the fighting, but India says it was a bilateral agreement between the two militaries.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump demonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi, which de-escalated a rapidly deteriorating situation,\u201d Pakistan said. \u201cThis intervention stands as a testament to his role as a genuine peacemaker.\u201d",
      "Governments can nominate people for the Nobel Peace Prize. There was no immediate response from Washington. A spokesperson for the Indian government did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump has repeatedly said that he\u2019s willing to mediate between India and Pakistan over the disputed Kashmir region, their main source of enmity. Islamabad, which has long called for international attention to Kashmir, is delighted.",
      "But his stance has upended U.S. policy in South Asia, which had favored India as a counterweight to China, and put in question previously close relations between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "In a social media post, opens new tab on Friday, Trump gave a long list of conflicts he said he had resolved, including India and Pakistan and the Abraham accords in his first term between Israel and some Muslim-majority countries. He added: \u201cI won\u2019t get a Nobel Peace Prize no matter what I do.\u201d",
      "Pakistan\u2019s move to nominate Trump came in the same week its army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, met the U.S. leader for lunch. It was the first time that a Pakistani military leader had been invited to the White House when a civilian government was in place in Islamabad.",
      "Trump\u2019s planned meeting with Modi at the G7 summit in Canada last week did not take place after the U.S. president left early, but the two later spoke by phone, in which Modi said \u201cIndia does not and will never accept mediation\u201d in its dispute with Pakistan, according to the Indian government.",

      "But the move was not universally applauded in Pakistan, where Trump\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has inflamed passions.",
      "\u201cIsrael\u2019s sugar daddy in Gaza and cheerleader of its attacks on Iran isn\u2019t a candidate for any prize,\u201d said Talat Hussain, a prominent Pakistani television political talk show host, in a post on X. \u201cAnd what if he starts to kiss Modi on both cheeks again after a few months?\u201d"

      "Thanks to HEAL Palestine, a nonprofit group that aids the youngest victims of the Gaza war, children like 7-year-old Qamar Alkordi, who uses two-hand crutches to walk, have been able to play in a safe place with other wounded children and feel less alone.",
      "\"There\u2019s other kids, they have the prosthetic, they are walking, and this is, like, it makes me happy to see this,\" her mother, Huda Alkordi, said about the sleepaway camp, where Qamar played in an inflatable pool and sprayed other kids with water.",

      "Overall, more than 55,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the conflict began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.",
      "Realizing that they were confronted with \"the largest population of child amputees in modern history,\" Salman said, she and her cohorts came up with the idea of a summer camp for the dozens of children they have been able to bring to the United States for specialized care.",
      "\"Some of them have lost four limbs, and we as individuals are not able to stop this from happening, but at HEAL Palestine, we can start to give them back a little bit of what was taken from them,\" Salman said.",
      "That means a summer camp with ramps so kids who rely on wheelchairs and walkers and prosthetics can get around and play.",
      "\"We brought them to a camp that\u2019s very accessible, where they can play wheelchair basketball or can do art with, like, adapted paintbrushes, you know, for kids who don\u2019t have fingers,\" Salman said. \"We want every child to feel whole.\"",

      "\"They decided to amputate her leg because of infection that happened with her leg,\" her mother said.",
      "Watching her daughter play, Huda said she knows this is only a temporary break from the chaos in Gaza. But she said her daughter, even without one leg, is luckier than many other injured children still back in Gaza.",

The brother who initially survived died days later while waiting for help.",

    "summary": "If Trump bombs Iran's Fordo nuclear enrichment site, the main risk would be from the Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb itself rather than radiation or chemicals.",
    "story": [
      "If President Donald Trump does decide to use the United States' largest conventional bomb to destroy Iran\u2019s fortresslike Fordo nuclear enrichment facility, the colossal force of the explosion would likely cause casualties among workers or anyone else still at the site.",
      "But it would not trigger a nuclear explosion or a widespread radiological or chemical spill, according to former nuclear officials and experts.",
      "Sitting to the south of Iran's capital, Tehran, the Fordo plant is used to enrich uranium for the production of nuclear energy or, potentially, a bomb. But although this uranium and its chemical byproducts can be harmful to ingest or touch without protective equipment \u2014 they won\u2019t create a wider blast or regional contamination, analysts say.",
      "That would only be the case if Fordo housed nuclear reactors or warheads, which international watchdogs and experts say is not the case.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re down there and it gets bombed, you\u2019re stuffed,\u201d Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, the ex-commanding officer of the British military\u2019s Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment, told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "\u201cBut that\u2019s because this is a 2,500-kilogram [about 5,500-pound] warhead we are talking about here,\u201d he said, referring to the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (or MOP), the largest non-nuclear bomb in the world, which only the U.S. has.",
      "Less of a bunker-buster and more of a mountain-buster, this is perhaps the only conventional ordnance in the world that could do the job if Trump did decide to bomb Fordo.",
      "\u201cBut if anyone thinks this would be like Chernobyl \u2014 absolutely not,\u201d de Bretton-Gordon said. \u201cBlowing up uranium will not create a nuclear explosion; that is a very complex piece of science, which is why it\u2019s so bloody difficult to make nuclear bombs.\u201d",
      "There is also little chance of a wider radiation leak or spill impacting the surrounding area, according to Mark Nelson, founder and managing director of Radiant Energy Group, a research consultancy based in Chicago.",
      "That\u2019s because \u201cthe nuclear substances at Fordo are only very weakly radioactive,\u201d he said. Were this a nuclear plant or missile site, there could be \u201cfission products\u201d \u2014 the stuff uranium breaks down into during a nuclear reaction \u2014 which can cause a wider catastrophe.",
      "Scrutiny has nonetheless sharpened on Fordo as Trump deliberates whether to join Israel's attacks on Iran.",
      "Iran\u2019s most advanced enrichment facility, Fordo was refining uranium to 60%, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. That\u2019s far more than the 3-5% needed for power plants \u2014 and far closer to the 90% required to build a warhead.",
      "Until 2018, Iran had been complying with a landmark deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, that offered Tehran billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for agreeing to curb its nuclear program.",
      "The agreement was sealed by President Barack Obama in July 2015, along with the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council \u2014 the U.S., Russia, France, China and the United Kingdom \u2014 as well as Germany and the European Union. Most independent observers said it was successfully limiting Iran's nuclear program.",
      "That effectively collapsed when Trump walked away from the pact three years later.",
      "Iran had been back in talks with Trump when Israel started bombing last week. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had no choice because Iran was racing toward building a bomb, something the International Atomic Energy Agency says it has not been able to confirm.",
      "The watchdog has been nonetheless concerned about Fordo, where uranium\u2019s naturally mined form is turned into a gas and spun at high speed inside centrifuges. That separates its heavier isotope, uranium-238, from the lighter uranium-235 that can be used for civilian purposes or otherwise.",
      "Iran says Fordo was designed to hold 3,000 of these centrifuges, a \u201csize and configuration\u201d that is \u201cinconsistent with a peaceful program,\u201d Obama said in 2009.",
      "Observers such as de Bretton-Gordon say the U.S.\u2019s enormous MOP bomb might be powerful enough not only to destroy this facility but effectively incase it under the collapsed mountain. That could produce a similar effect to the sarcophagus built around Chernobyl after the disaster in 1986, Bretton-Gordon said.",
      "Whereas Chernobyl\u2019s protective enclosure is 40 feet thick, \u201cat Fordo we would be talking about a sarcophagus 200-feet thick,\u201d de Bretton-Gordon said.",
      "That\u2019s not to say the risk of contamination would be zero.",
      "If the uranium gas is released, it would partly decompose into hydrofluoric acid, a deadly substance that causes deep-tissue burns if touched without protective gear, and potentially fatal problems for the heart, lungs and nervous system if inhaled.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a nasty chemical to be around without correct safety equipment and procedures,\u201d said Nelson at the Radiant Energy Group. Any blast survivors, or rescuers without the necessary safety equipment, would face \u201cextremely severe\u201d consequences, he said, but caveated that \u201cyou have to be really close and really unprotected.\u201d",
      "There is also a chance that radioactive material could seep into any water source that\u2019s running through the mountain. But the likely radioactive levels would be low \u2014 detectable rather than harmful \u2014 both Nelson and de Bretton-Gordon said.",
      "Ultimately, Nelson agreed, all of these risks pale in comparison with the threat posed by the MOP bomb itself, whose payload is upward of 5,500 pounds and weighs a total of 30,000 pounds.",
      "\u201cThe danger at the seaside of saltwater ingestion is real \u2014 even a few liters could kill you,\u201d he analogized. \u201cThis danger, however, is relatively small compared to drowning.\u201d"
