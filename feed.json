      "Lee Soo Man spent three decades trying to bring K-pop into the global market, often bending but never breaking his vision",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Lee Soo Man resisted the title at first. \u201cKing of K-pop\u201d sounded too brash, too nightclub-esque \u2014 like something you\u2019d see on a neon sign in Itaewon, a nightlife neighborhood in the South Korean capital Seoul once popular with U.S. soldiers and foreign visitors. \u201cI asked them, \u2018Couldn\u2019t it be Father of K-pop?\u2019\u201d the 73-year-old recalled during a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "He was discussing the title of Amazon Prime's documentary about his career. The producers insisted the bolder moniker would resonate better with American audiences. After some back-and-forth, Lee relented. \u201cI had to follow their decision.\u201d",
      "The compromise speaks to Lee\u2019s pragmatic approach to breaking South Korean acts into the American mainstream \u2014 a three-decade quest that often required him to bend but never break his vision. Now, as the founder of SM Entertainment and widely credited as the architect of K-pop\u2019s global expansion, Lee will be inducted into the Asian Hall of Fame on Saturday alongside basketball legend Yao Ming, Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan, and rock icon Yoshiki, among others.",
      "Lee remains a prominent but controversial figure in K-pop history. His label pioneered the industry\u2019s intensive training system, recruiting performers as young as elementary school age and putting them through years of rigorous preparation. Some of his artists have challenged their contracts as unfair, sparking broader debates about industry practices.",
      "The recognition arrives as Lee reemerges into the spotlight after a contentious, high-profile departure from the agency he founded in 1995 \u2014 a management battle that included a public feud with his nephew-in-law and a bidding war over his shares. He\u2019s been keeping busy since, debuting a new band, A2O MAY, in both China and the U.S. He's also investing in a boutique Chinese firm\u2019s high-tech production technologies.",
      "Born in South Korea, Lee studied computer engineering in the U.S. for his master's degree. That technical background would later inform his approach to everything from visualization and cutting-edge production technologies \u2014 he said he\u2019s been rewatching \"The Matrix\u201d to revisit filming techniques \u2014 to pioneering elaborate \u201cworldviews\u201d and virtual avatars for his K-pop bands.",
      "For Lee, the Hall of Fame honor \u201cconfirms that K-pop has become a genre that the mainstream is now paying attention to\u201d \u2014 an acceptance that came after costly lessons and years of trial and error.",
      "Lee invested about $5 million in BoA\u2019s 2009 American debut with \u201cEat You Up,\u201d one of the first songs by a South Korean artist to be primarily written and produced by Western producers \u2014 a bold early attempt to bring K-pop into the U.S. mainstream. But with few widely recognized Asian artists in American pop culture at the time, the market wasn\u2019t ready. After nearly two years, BoA \u2014 already a megastar in Korea and Japan \u2014 decided to return home. The experience, Lee has said, left him with lasting regrets.",
      "\u201cWhen I asked the songwriter(s) to revise \u2018Eat You Up,\u2019 they refused,\u201d Lee recalled. \u201cIf we had changed it, I believe it would have achieved much better results.\u201d",
      "That setback taught Lee that K-pop needed to source global talent while maintaining creative control to adapt songs for the worldwide market. His quest for the perfect tracks took him worldwide.",
      "\u201cI once heard a song that was so good I couldn\u2019t let it go,\u201d he said, recalling the track that would later become \u201cDreams Come True\u201d for S.E.S., the late-1990s girl group. \u201cI could\u2019ve bought the license to the song in South Korea, Hong Kong, or Sweden. But I wanted to play it safe, so I found the Finnish address, went to meet the songwriter directly, wrote up a contract, and brought it back.\u201d",
      "At the time, top Western songwriters prioritized Japan, the world\u2019s second-largest music market. \u201cEuropean songwriters were willing to sell to Asia,\u201d Lee explained. \u201cThat\u2019s how we eventually built a system where music from Europe, Asia, and America could come together.\u201d",
      "That fusion became K-pop\u2019s signature. Lee also helped to pioneer another innovation: elaborate fictional universes, or \u201cworldviews,\u201d for groups like EXO and aespa \u2014 a storytelling approach that would later be adopted across the industry, including by groups like BTS.",
      "The concept emerged during his time in the U.S., where he witnessed MTV transform music into a visual medium. \u201cBut we only have three or four minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we express dramatic, cinematic elements in such a short time?\u201d",

      "Unable to attract established screenwriters, Lee developed the storylines himself. The strategy proved prescient: These interconnected narratives give global fans reason to follow groups across comebacks, waiting for the next chapter in an unfolding saga.",
      "Despite K-pop\u2019s global success, Lee remains focused on Asia\u2019s potential. He envisions South Korea as a creative hub where international talent learns production. \u201cKorea should become the country of producers,\u201d he said.",
      "With the Asia-Pacific region home to more than half the world\u2019s population, he sees it as entertainment\u2019s inevitable future center.",
      "His latest venture with A2O MAY, which operates in both China and the U.S., is testing that vision in one of Asia\u2019s most challenging markets. China\u2019s entertainment landscape has grown increasingly restrictive, with Beijing recently cracking down on \u201c effeminate \u201d male celebrities and youth culture. Asked about potential political risks, Lee dismissed concerns.",
      "\u201cPolitical risk? I don\u2019t really know much about that,\u201d he said.",
      "He said he aims to elevate South Korea\u2019s cultural influence as a center of production while meeting China\u2019s needs as it seeks to expand its soft power alongside economic dominance.",
      "\u201cCulturally, does China need what we do? I believe they do.\u201d",
      "The documentary also addressed darker aspects of K-pop close to Lee\u2019s heart, including the suicides of SM Entertainment artists.",
      "He traces the problem to anonymous and malicious online comments that often evade accountability, especially when posted on servers outside South Korea\u2019s jurisdiction, calling it a global issue requiring international cooperation. Lee advocates for worldwide standards on user verification and mediation systems where victims could identify attackers without expensive legal battles.",
      "But Lee resists the media\u2019s focus on K-pop\u2019s problems. \u201cShould we always weigh the dark side equally with the bright side, the future?\u201d he asked. \u201cMedia should consider whether K-pop represents more future or more past that holds us back. Rather than just discussing the dark side and dragging us down by clinging to the past, shouldn\u2019t we talk more about the future?\u201d",
      "After more than three decades, Lee\u2019s definition remains straightforward: \u201cK-pop is a new language of communication that transcends barriers. These languages move around naturally \u2014 what you can\u2019t stop is culture.\u201d",

      "As details of Andrew\u2019s links to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein continued to dribble out and Parliament raised questions about his rent-free residence at a sprawling country house near Windsor Castle, King Charles III moved Thursday to shield the monarchy from any further revelations.",

    "story": [
      "Florence Welch explores her desire for greatness and the constraints she faces as a female artist in Florence + the Machine's sixth album, \"Everybody Scream.\"",
      "During his acceptance speech for best actor at this year\u2019s Screen Actors Guild Awards, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet made known his desire to be remembered as \u201cone of the greats.\u201d A few years earlier, Chalamet starred in Greta Gerwig\u2019s adaptation of \u201cLittle Women,\u201d in which his character demonstratively asks his future wife, \u201cWhat women are allowed into the club of geniuses, anyway?\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody Scream,\u201d Florence + the Machine\u2019s sixth album, is a response to that familiar, gendered notion. Across its 12 tracks, Florence Welch contends with both her desire for greatness and the constraints she understands to have been put on her as a female artist.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if Welch had Chalamet\u2019s viral speech in mind when writing, \u201cOne of the Greats,\u201d the album\u2019s lead single. But what is apparent in her brooding feminist treatise are grievances about sexism and male entitlement. \u201cIt must be nice to be a man and make boring music just because you can,\u201d she belts over gothic synths and strings. But it's a bit funny, too: \"Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m a fan, you\u2019re my second favorite frontman.\u201d",
      "Welch collaborated with Mark Bowen of IDLES for much of the record, as well as Mitski and Aaron Dessner of The National. Sometimes the collaborations create a haunting sound, but most of \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d is packed with the band's signature orchestral pop, an ornate arrangement of strings, synths, guitars, pianos and percussion.",
      "Perhaps to a fault, \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d isn\u2019t sonically dissimilar from what fans of Florence + the Machine have come to expect. But in a lyrical shift, Welch meditates heavily on mysticism and witchcraft throughout, something she turned to after suffering a nearly fatal ectopic pregnancy in 2023. The 39-year-old later revealed that she performed with a burst fallopian tube during her last tour and had to undergo emergency surgery.",
      "\u201cI sit in salt water/Call in a vision of my daughter/Light a candle/Place my grief upon the altar,\u201d her voice vibrates over haunting background vocals and an eerie electric guitar on \u201cYou Can Have It All.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Food and Drug Administration on Friday moved to limit the use of fluoride supplements used to strengthen children's teeth, the latest action by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his deputies against a chemical that is a mainstay of dental care.",
      "The FDA said that the products are no longer recommended for children younger than 3 and those who are older but don't face serious risks of tooth decay. Previously, the products have been prescribed for children as young as six months.",

      "The agency also sent a form letter to dentists and other health providers warning about the risks of the products.",
      "Those claims have been disputed by the American Dental Association, which has said there are no significant health problems associated with fluoride when used at the levels prescribed by dentists. The supplements can cause spotting or discoloration of teeth due to the extra fluoride, a downside the FDA also noted.",

      "The government shutdown has been a source of anxiety for educators, wondering how long grant money will last and who can help them interpret federal laws",
      "WASHINGTON -- The government shutdown has been a source of anxiety for school leaders wondering how long grant money will last and who can help them interpret federal laws. For Education Secretary Linda McMahon, it offers a preview of what she hopes to make permanent.",
      "Much of the department\u2019s work has gone completely cold. No new grants are being awarded, and civil rights investigations have been halted. Money is still flowing for key programs, but in many respects, schools and states are on their own.",
      "That\u2019s the vision President Donald Trump has promoted since his presidential campaign \u2014 a world where states fully have the reins of education policy with little or no influence from the federal government.",
      "Even before the shutdown, mass layoffs had left the agency with 2,400 employees, down from 4,100 when Trump took office. Remaining workers have mostly been furloughed during the budget impasse, leaving some 330 who are responsible for carrying out duties that are deemed essential.",
      "In a recent social media post, McMahon said the shutdown proves her department is unnecessary. \u201cTwo weeks in, millions of American students are still going to school, teachers are getting paid, and schools are operating as normal,\u201d McMahon wrote.",
      "She offered a more direct assessment days later, after the agency hit its 46th year: \u201cWe don\u2019t need a birthday cake,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe need an eviction notice.\u201d",
      "Some say the shutdown's impact has been more significant. They warn that funding for preschool centers and school meals is running out, and students with disabilities might not be getting the help they need.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the impact so far.",
      "Most of the billions of dollars the Education Department steers to schools each year went out the door in October, leaving schools funded until July.",
      "Other programs that aren\u2019t funded in advance face more uncertainty. That includes federally funded Head Start preschool centers and school nutrition programs funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said Julia Martin, director of policy and government affairs at the Bruman Group, an education law firm.",
      "Districts are required to cover the cost of school meals and then seek reimbursement from the Department of Agriculture, but the agency said it only has two months of reimbursements left amid the shutdown.",
      "\u201cDistricts are really worried that they\u2019re going to have to dig deep into their pockets to fund meals,\u201d Martin said.",
      "The last remnants of federal COVID-19 aid are still being released by the Education Department, but reimbursements have slowed with fewer staff reviewing the requests, Martin said.",
      "America\u2019s public schools are primarily funded by states and cities, but federal funding plays an important role. The billions sent already to schools include grants to help low-income students, those with disabilities and other populations.",
      "Grant competitions to award smaller amounts of money have largely frozen. Schools and states that already received grants can keep spending them down, but all new grantmaking has ceased, the department said. At the college level, federal Pell grants for low-income students are still flowing, and the FAFSA financial aid form is still being processed.",
      "Ordinarily, states and schools rely on the department to answer questions on a wide range of topics \u2014 from special education laws to statewide academic assessments to laws requiring public schools to provide certain services to students at private schools.",

      "Also gutted was the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, which ensures that students with disabilities get the services they\u2019re entitled to under federal law. It maintains \u201cvery regular\u201d communication with states to field questions on coordinating aid to families and eliminating waitlists, said Katy Neas, CEO of The Arc of the United States, a disability rights group.",
      "The new layoffs have been halted by a federal judge. But as the shutdown drags on, more states are likely to break federal laws unknowingly because they can\u2019t get help from the government, said Neas, who led the special education office under former President Joe Biden.",

      "Some states have turned instead to law firms for advice, but there are not always clear answers. In August, the department rescinded 2015 guidance explaining schools\u2019 legal obligations to students who are learning English. But with no new guidance replacing it before the government shutdown, schools have questions about their responsibilities, said Martin, of the Bruman law firm.",

      "Bill Swick, who has a rare degenerative brain disease, has lost access to virtual speech therapy due to the federal government shutdown",
      "MINOOKA, Ill. -- Bill Swick has a rare degenerative brain disease that inhibits his mobility and speech. Instead of the hassle of traveling an hour to a clinic in downtown Chicago to visit a speech therapist, he has benefited from virtual appointments from the comfort of his home.",
      "But Swick, 53, hasn\u2019t had access to those appointments for the last month.",
      "The federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week, halted funding for the Medicare telehealth program that pays his provider for her services. So, Swick and his wife are practicing old strategies rather than learning new skills to manage his growing difficulties with processing language, connecting words and pacing himself while speaking.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because we want to continue with his journey, with his progress,\u201d 45-year-old Martha Swick, a caregiver for her husband since his diagnosis three years ago, said during an interview at their home in Minooka, Illinois. \u201cI try to have all his therapy and everything organized for him, to make his day easier and smoother, and then everything has a hitch, and we have to stop and wait.\u201d",
      "Their experience has become common in recent weeks among the millions of patients with Medicare fee-for-service plans who count on pandemic-era telehealth waivers to attend medical appointments from home.",
      "With Congress unable to agree on a deal to fund the government, the waivers have lapsed, even with support from Republicans and Democrats. As a result, medical providers are deciding whether they can continue offering telehealth services without the guarantee of reimbursement or whether they need to halt virtual visits altogether.",
      "That\u2019s left a patient population of mostly older adults with fewer options to seek specialists or get help when they can\u2019t physically travel far from home.",
      "Swick, whose corticobasal degeneration causes symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease, can\u2019t feed or dress himself anymore and struggles with balance and walking. Add on the logistical nightmare of driving to the city in traffic, and in-person speech therapy appointments aren\u2019t a worthwhile ordeal for him and his wife.",
      "But missing even a few appointments can impede progress for patients with dementia and other degenerative conditions who depend on continuity of care, experts said.",
      "It \u201cfeels like you\u2019re taking a step back,\u201d Swick said in the interview.",
      "Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Medicare only paid for virtual medical appointments under narrow circumstances, including in designated rural areas and when patients logged in from eligible sites, like hospitals and clinics.",
      "That changed in 2020, when Trump\u2019s first administration dramatically expanded telehealth coverage in response to the public health emergency. Medicare started reimbursing a wide range of telehealth visits, stripping the geographic requirement, and allowing patients to take calls from their homes.",
      "Congress has routinely extended the telehealth flexibilities and was poised to do so again before their Sept. 30 expiration. But when budget negotiations stalled and the government shut down Oct. 1, the vote never happened, leaving the program temporarily unfunded.",
      "With more than 4 million Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries using telehealth in the first half of 2025, according to Brown University\u2019s School of Public Health, the pause has had a major impact on an already vulnerable population.",
      "Swick\u2019s speech therapy services are provided by the Chicago-area business Memory and Aphasia Care. Owner Becky Khayum said many of her clients are in different cities and states and sought her therapists out because they specialize in frontal temporal dementias.",
      "\u201cNow suddenly without telehealth services, they do not continue to have the support to participate in those activities that are so important to them,\u201d Khayum said. \u201cThe risk is we could see social withdrawal; we could see depression and anxiety increased.\u201d",

He said that in the current Medicare telehealth pause, one of his patients wasn\u2019t having regular check-ins and ended up in the emergency room.",
      "Susan Collins, 73, in Murrieta, California, said Medicare-reimbursed telehealth appointments were a \u201ctremendous relief\u201d to her when she was a full-time caregiver for her late husband, Leo. Before he died last year from progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare brain disorder, she struggled to lift him from his wheelchair in and out of the car for his in-person doctor visits 60 miles from their home.",
      "\u201cHe was much safer at home,\u201d Collins said, noting that telehealth was a useful resource when her husband needed a medication or symptom consultation but not a complete physical exam.",
      "The latest guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services does not ban medical providers from providing telehealth services during the lapse \u2013 but it stops short of promising they\u2019ll be reimbursed if they do.",
      "In response, providers are deciding whether they can absorb the risk of continuing care without assurance that they\u2019ll be paid for it when the government reopens.",
      "Khayum in Illinois said she had to stop providing telehealth services to Medicare patients because her small business couldn\u2019t handle the volatility of potentially losing out on payments. Ghoddusi, the family medicine provider, said his Oregon practice is honoring telehealth appointments made before Oct. 1 but not scheduling additional ones for Medicare patients until the funding is restored.",
      "Genevieve Richardson, owner of a speech pathology business in Austin, Texas, has stopped providing telehealth services to her Medicare clients who are spread across the country. She has been referring them to outpatient clinics in their areas who can provide stopgap services in person.",
      "Major hospitals are also grappling with whether to provide virtual care to Medicare patients.

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The Alaska Supreme Court is weighing a case that is expected to determine who can provide abortion care in the state.",
      "The court heard arguments Wednesday in a 2019 case challenging the constitutionality of a law that states only a doctor licensed by the State Medical Board can perform an abortion in Alaska.",
      "The law, dating to the 1970s, was struck down as unconstitutional by Superior Court judge Josie Garton last year, a victory for the group that brought the challenge, Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky. The state appealed Garton's ruling.",
      "Planned Parenthood has argued there is no medical justification for the restriction and that it unfairly burdens those seeking an abortion by limiting the pool of those qualified to provide care. In 2021, Garton granted the group\u2019s request to allow advanced practice clinicians \u2014 health care workers, such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants \u2014 to provide medication abortion pending her decision in the underlying case. They have continued to do so and since the 2024 ruling also have been able to provide procedural abortions, Planned Parenthood says.",
      "Advanced practice clinicians routinely provide care similar in risk and complexity to that of providing abortion services, and in 25 states can provide medication abortion, attorneys for Planned Parenthood said in court documents. Planned Parenthood's advanced practice clinicians seek to provide abortion care in just the first trimester, the attorneys said.",
      "Since Garton's 2021 decision, advanced practice clinicians have been providing \u201cnearly all\u201d medication abortions in Alaska, and Planned Parenthood clinics in the state have been able to offer medication abortion each day they've been open, the attorneys wrote. Before that, doctors hired by Planned Parenthood on a per diem basis \u2014 at the clinics on limited days \u2014 were able to offer medication abortions perhaps once or twice a week at each clinic, they wrote.",
      "A vital statistics report released by the state this year shows that the total number of abortions in Alaska has been fairly consistent \u2014 1,229 in 2021, 1,247 in 2022, 1,222 in 2023 and 1,224 last year. The report says that could include cases where medication was provided to manage a miscarriage, but without providing a number. It also says reasons for ending pregnancies are not reported to the state.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned a federal right to abortion, leaving it up to each state to regulate.",
      "Access to health care has been a longstanding concern in Alaska, with travel \u2014 sometimes covering hundreds of miles \u2014 required for many residents. Compounding that are ongoing challenges to recruit and keep medical providers.",

      "BERLIN -- The organization that handles claims on behalf of Jews who suffered under the Nazis said Wednesday that Germany has agreed to extend another $1.076 billion (923.9 million euros) for Holocaust survivors ' home care around the globe for the coming year.",
      "The compensation was negotiated with Germany\u2019s finance ministry and is the largest budget for frail and vulnerable Holocaust survivor home care in the organization\u2019s history.",
      "\u201cThis historic increase to home care funding reflects the complex and growing needs of Holocaust survivors worldwide,\u201d said Gideon Taylor, the president of the New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, also referred to as the Claims Conference.",
      "\u201cWhile we are losing survivors at a rapid pace each year, those who remain are older, frailer and in greater need than ever before,\u201d Taylor said in a written statement. \"This budget is critical in providing each of them the opportunity to age in place, a dignity that was stolen from them in their youth.\u201d",
      "The average age of survivors receiving home care through Claims Conference funding has increased from 86 in 2018 to 88.5 in 2024. Data collected by the organization show that survivors are experiencing more complicated health needs and increased disability, with the number of survivors who qualify for full-time assistance due to extreme disability \u2014 such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia \u2014 has nearly doubled during that time period.",
      "Additionally, the Hardship Fund Supplemental payments, which were previously guaranteed to be paid annually to eligible Holocaust survivors until 2027, have been extended through 2028 at an amount of \u20ac1,450 per survivor, impacting more than 127,000 Holocaust survivors globally.",
      "The Claims Conference projected in April that approximately 200,000 survivors are still alive, most of them living in Israel, the United States and Europe, but also scattered all over the globe.",
      "Also, righteous rescuers \u2013 non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust - currently receiving a monthly pension from the Claims Conference, will be eligible to receive home care similar to that provided to Jewish survivors, allowing them to live their final years with dignity in their own homes, the group announced.",

      "At 27, she is the average age of new mothers in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She's feeling the pressure as an only child. Her father wants to be a grandfather and her mother, before she died, always told Porretto that she would eventually want to be a mom.",

      "Younger generations of Americans are increasingly citing climate change as making them reticent to have children, according to several studies. They are worried about bringing children into a world with increasing and more intense extreme weather events, a result of climate change, which is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide when oil, gas coal are burned. And they are concerned about the impact their offspring will have on the planet.",
      "In a 2024 Lancet study of people 16 to 25 years old, the majority of respondents were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d worried about climate change. The study also found that 52% said they were hesitant to have children because of climate change. Adults under 50 years old without children were four times more likely than adults over 50 without children to say that climate plays a factor in their decision, according to a Pew Research Center report published last year. And a study published this year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found more than half of respondents said \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cmaybe\u201d to whether climate change made them question having children.",
      "Parenthood and climate change are related not just because of fears for a child's well-being, but also by concern for the planet's well-being.",
      "Compared to the carbon emissions of all the other decisions, \"having a child is by far, by orders of magnitude, larger,\u201d said Nandita Bajaj, executive director of Population Balance, which is a nonprofit focused on humans' environmental impact.",
      "Unlike other choices, procreation comes with something that bioethics professor Travis Rieder of Johns Hopkins University calls \u201ccarbon legacy.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not only doing carbon expensive activities like buying a larger house and a larger car and diapers and all that,\" said Rieder. \u201cYou\u2019re also creating someone who is going to have their own carbon footprint for the rest of their lives.\u201d",
      "That child might have children, and those children might have children, creating an impact that lasts generations, Rieder added. Of course, the logical extreme of minimizing an environmental footprint means having no children, Rieder said, which he is not advocating.",
      "It's tricky to quantify the impact of a child. That's because there's no consensus on what percentage of their impact is the parent's responsibility, and partly because the impact of that child depends on their parents' lifestyle.",
      "\u201cOne of the best predictors of how carbon-expensive they\u2019ll be is how wealthy you are,\u201d Rieder said.",
      "For example, the U.S. emits 123 times more carbon emissions than Ghana, according to the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research. Adjusted for population size, that means the average American emits more than 12 times as much as the average Ghanan.",
      "Procreation might have the largest climate impact, but when it comes to actions people can take to reduce their personal contribution to global warming, having fewer children often isn't discussed.",
      "Researchers who study climate change and family planning give two reasons.",
      "\u201cIf a person tells you that they\u2019re expecting or that they are pregnant, the immediate response is to offer some kind of support, congratulate them, that sort of thing,\" said Trevor Hedberg, who teaches moral philosophy at the University of Arizona.",

      "\u201cIt resembles a spy operation. By whom, I don\u2019t know. I have a few ideas but I\u2019m going to be careful\u201d about speculating, he said. Last month, several drones were spotted above another Belgian military base near the German border. The operators were not identified.",

      "The sophisticated Patriot systems are the most effective weapon against Russian missiles. Zelenskyy has pleaded with Western partners to provide more of them, but production limitations and the need to maintain stockpiles have slowed their delivery.",
      "\u201cMore Patriots are now in Ukraine and being put into operation,\u201d Zelenskyy said on social media late Sunday. \u201cOf course, more systems are needed to protect key infrastructure sites and our cities across the entire territory of our state.\u201d",
      "He thanked Germany and its Chancellor Friedrich Merz for the Patriots. Germany said three months ago it would deliver two more Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine. It agreed to the move after securing assurances that the U.S. will prioritize the delivery of new Patriots to Germany to backfill its stocks. Patriot systems are made only in the U.S.",
      "NATO is coordinating regular deliveries of large weapons packages to Ukraine.

The Trump administration is not giving any arms to Ukraine, unlike the previous Biden administration.",

      "HONG KONG -- A Hong Kong court on Monday rejected a former Tiananmen vigil organizer's attempt to quash her indictment, pressing ahead with a landmark case widely seen as part of a years-long crackdown on the city's pro-democracy movement.",
      "Chow Hang-tung, a former leader of the group that organized a decades-old vigil to remember China's 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, was charged in 2021 with inciting subversion, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. She was charged together with two of the group's other former leaders, Albert Ho and Lee Cheuk-yan.",
      "Their case was brought under a national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020 to quell massive anti-government protests in 2019. The trio were accused of inciting others to challenge the leadership of the Communist Party by unlawful means.",
      "Chow, who is a barrister and is defending herself, argued that the indictment was unacceptably broad and vague because authorities did not specify an unlawful means. She said it could amount to a \u201ccatch-all charge.\u201d",
      "Judge Alex Lee remarked during the hearing that the charge was broad, but not vague.",
      "Prosecutor Ned Lai argued that unlawful means meant those against the Chinese constitution, which stipulates that the party's leadership is the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics and that damaging the socialist system is prohibited.",
      "The three-judge panel, approved by the government to oversee the case, ruled against Chow. Lee said the panel would issue an opinion in January.",

      "Fans have been flocking to soccer matches in Jalisco, Mexico, as authorities fine-tune security for the 2026 FIFA World Cup",
      "GUADALAJARA, Mexico -- Fans flocking to a soccer match in Zapopan chanted \u201cMexico! Mexico!\u201d while walking past dozens of police officers, bomb-sniffing dogs, metal detectors and drone jammers \u2014 as authorities fine-tuned security ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. A few miles away, south of Guadalajara, a different sort of deployment was underway: National Guard troops stood sentry as volunteers dug up the small patio of an abandoned house looking for some of Mexico\u2019s 134,000 disappeared.",
      "It's a jarring contrast especially present in Jalisco, where 48,000-seat soccer stadiums and fan zones \u2014 like the site of the Oct. 14 friendly match between Mexico and Ecuador \u2014 coexist with one of the world\u2019s most powerful criminal organizations. The state \u2014 which will host four World Cup matches in June 2026 \u2014 is home to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, arguably Mexico\u2019s most powerful with an estimated 19,000 members and operations spanning 21 of Mexico\u2019s 32 states.",
      "With a population of 8 million, Jalisco leads in disappearances and is among Mexico\u2019s top four states for crime rate. As of October, the state had reported approximately 1,000 disappearances \u2014 a 30% surge compared to the same period the previous year, according to Mexico\u2019s National Search Commission.",
      "Yet, neither the soccer fans attending the recent soccer match, nor the officials securing the site expressed concern about hosting an international sporting event on the home turf of the Jalisco cartel. The reasons offered varied, spanning the notion of a temporary, tacit truce between criminals and the government, to the inherent security boost that such major events provide.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t get yourself into trouble, nothing will happen,\u201d said Javier Rodr\u00edguez, an 18-year-old college student on his way to the stadium.",
      "South of Guadalajara, off the highway that leads to the snowbird destination of Lake Chapala, Indira Navarro and a group of volunteers dug up the concrete slab behind an abandoned house following a tip that human remains were buried there.",
      "They\u2019re members of the Jalisco Search Warriors, one of many volunteer groups across Mexico who spend their free time searching for the missing, hoping to find their own relatives or bring closure to another family.",
      "They didn\u2019t find anything that morning. However, earlier this year the team searched a ranch near Guadalajara \u2014 a site authorities raided the prior year \u2014 unearthing hundreds of garments and burned bone fragments that left authorities scrambling to explain why the initial investigation of the purported cartel recruitment and training site had been so shoddy.",
      "Navarro is searching for her brother who disappeared in the neighboring state of Sonora in 2015. Since March, she has lived with round-the-clock protection of the National Guard because of the death threats she received after publicizing the group\u2019s discovery at the ranch.",
      "The Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which the Trump administration designated a foreign terrorist organization earlier this year, has established itself as Mexico\u2019s most powerful criminal organization. It earned its reputation through bold attacks on authorities, such as downing a Mexican military helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade and attempting a spectacular ambush of a Mexico City police chief in 2020.",
      "Experts say there has not been a criminal organization so powerful in Jalisco since the late 1980s, the last time Guadalajara hosted international matches during the 1986 World Cup.",
      "Roberto Alarc\u00f3n, Jalisco\u2019s state security strategy coordinator, downplayed the local cartel\u2019s presence while simultaneously suggesting that their dominance actually makes security efforts easier.",
      "\u201cNot having a great number of criminal groups like other states allows \u2026 security authorities to attack these groups in a better, more controlled way,\" said Alarc\u00f3n, adding that all major crimes in the state are, in fact, trending downward.",

      "A day before the Oct. 14 friendly match, Jalisco Gov.

Security concerns and preparedness were notably absent from the discussion.",

      "But for those like Navarro, who have dedicated their lives to searching for loved ones with little help from authorities, the World Cup hype feels like whitewashing Jalisco\u2019s violence.",

      "Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen said 25 people are still missing and that the government had intensified the search mission, with the military deploying four aircrafts to help teams access the area that has been completely cut off after roads were washed away during Saturday\u2019s landslide.",

      "A Nigerian government official says the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump cannot unilaterally carry out any military operation in Nigeria over its claims of Christian persecution in the West African country",
      "ABUJA, Nigeria -- The U.S. cannot unilaterally carry out any military operation in Nigeria over its claims of Christian persecution in the West African country, a Nigerian presidential spokesman told The Associated Press Sunday.",
      "Such military threat from Donald Trump is based on misleading reports and appears to be part of \u201cTrump\u2019s style of going forceful in order to force a sit-down and have a conversation,\u201d according to Daniel Bwala, a spokesman for Nigerian President Bola Tinubu.",
      "Bwala was responding to Trump's comment on Saturday that he has ordered the Pentagon to begin planning for potential military action in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, over alleged Christian persecution in the country.",
      "Here are five things to know about the issue:",
      "Trump on Saturday doubled down on his allegations that the government is failing to rein in the persecution of Christians in the West African country, whose population of 220 million is split almost evenly between Christians and Muslims.",
      "\u201cIf the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, \u2018guns-a-blazing,\u2019 to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,\u201d Trump posted on social media.",
      "Trump\u2019s threat came after he designated Nigeria as a country of particular concern, a formal U.S. declaration of countries it says are failing to act over religious freedom violations.",
      "The threat and designation came after U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and some American celebrities alleged that Christians are being persecuted in Nigeria, without evidence. Some went as far as alleging a \u201cChristian genocide.\"",
      "The Associated Press found that both Christians and Muslims are killed in Nigeria\u2019s security crises, and that victims are often determined by their locations and not due to their religion.",
      "Cruz and Trump relied on old reports from more than a decade ago when Nigeria\u2019s home-grown Boko Haram Islamic group launched an insurgency to enforce their brutal interpretation of Shariah law, said Bwala.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to matters of military operation in Nigeria, this is a matter that two leaders have to agree on. It is not something unilaterally you can do especially since that country is a sovereign state and that country is not aiding and abating that (crime),\u201d he said.",

      "Venice has revived a tradition of building a temporary bridge to San Michele island for All Souls' Day",
      "VENICE, Italy -- Venice\u2019s San Michele island is the final resting place of American poet Ezra Pound, Russian composer Igor Stravinsky and many Venetians known only to their loved ones.",
      "The city of Venice this year revived a long-dormant tradition of constructing a temporary bridge to allow Venetians to make the solemn 400-meter (quarter-mile) lagoon crossing by foot to pay respects to their dead on the Catholic All Souls\u2019 holiday.",
      "In its original form, the crossing was made out of Venetian \u201cpeata\u201d boats lashed together, topped with walking planks and anchored to the lagoon bed. The practice was stopped in the 1950s, probably as more regular public water buses made the island easier to reach.",
      "After an absence of some seven decades, the bridge was revived in 2019 with a modular pontoon construction, but the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted plans to make it an annual fixture \u2014 until this year.",
      "\u201cWe have proposed it once more so we can reconnect history with living people,\u2019\u2019 Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said last week. \"It's a concrete journey. It's not fake, not philosophical. By foot, over the water, a beautiful route that make you understand a lot of things about Venice.''",
      "The lagoon city of Venice is patched together by hundreds of foot bridges. But the city has historically built temporary bridges on just two other occasions, which endure: across the Giudecca Canal for the annual Feast of the Redentore (Redeemer) in late July, and across the Grand Canal for the Nov. 21 Feast of the Madonna della Salute.",
      "The floating walkway to San Michele island near Murano is the longest of the three, traversing a relatively shallow area of the lagoon from the Fondamente Nove. The temporary bridge arches upward to allow water taxis, buses and ambulances and other boat traffic to pass by. Its modern construction allows it to easily withstand high tides of 1 meter (over 3 feet), officials said.",

      "Zhang Miao, a Chinese tourist, arrived on the island out of curiosity by ferry on Sunday, but didn't know it was a cemetery. \u201cTo return to the mainland, I used the bridge, which is much more convenient and, what\u2019s more, it\u2019s free,\u201d she said.",
      "The cemetery was established in 1807, after Napoleon decreed that burial be moved away from the city. It took its name from the island\u2019s 15th-century church. It was later expanded, when a canal between a neighboring island was filled in.",

      "The government shutdown is triggering a wave of closures of Head Start centers, leaving working parents scrambling for child care and shutting some of the nation's neediest children out of preschool.",
      "Dozens of centers are missing out on federal grant payments that were due to arrive Nov. 1. Some say they'll close indefinitely, while others are staying afloat with emergency funding from local governments and school districts. The closures mean Head Start students \u2014 who come from low-income households, are homeless or are in foster care \u2014 are missing out on preschool, where they are fed two meals a day and receive therapy vital to their development.",
      "\u201cChildren love school, and the fact that they can\u2019t go is breaking their hearts,\u201d said Sarah Sloan, who oversees small-town Head Start centers in Scioto County, Ohio. Staff told families they planned to close Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s hampering our families\u2019 ability to put food on the table and to know that their children are safe during the day.\u201d",
      "A half-dozen Head Start programs never received grants that were anticipated in October, but there are now 140 programs that have not received their annual infusion of federal funding. All told, the programs have capacity to assist 65,000 preschoolers and expectant parents.",
      "Among the preschools closing as of Monday are 24 Migrant and Seasonal Head Start centers spread across five states. Those centers, created to assist the children of migrant farmworkers, typically operate on 10- to 12-hour days to accommodate the long hours parents work on farms.",
      "Children attending the centers in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama and Oklahoma recently came home with fliers warning of possible closures, along with other parent notifications. Those centers serving more than 1,100 children will now remain closed until the shutdown ends, said East Coast Migrant Head Start Project CEO Javier Gonzalez. About 900 staff members across the centers also have been furloughed.",
      "In the absence of other options for child care, some parents\u2019 only option may be to bring their young child to the fields where they work, Gonzalez said.",
      "Many of the families that qualify for the federal preschool program also depend on food aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP or food stamps. That program also was on track to run dry of money due to the shutdown, although a pair of federal judges on Friday ordered the Trump administration to keep the program running with emergency reserve funds.",
      "That means many Head Start families have been worried about food aid, along with the child care they rely on to make ends meet. A day without child care means a day without work for many parents \u2014 and a day without pay.",
      "In Kansas City, Missouri, Jhanee Hunt teaches toddlers at a Head Start site, the Emmanuel Family and Child Development Center, where her 6-month-old son is cared for in another classroom. The center said it can scrape up enough money to stay open for a few weeks, but the money won\u2019t last much beyond November.",
      "At dropoff, she said, parents often are wearing uniforms for fast food restaurants like Wendy\u2019s and McDonald\u2019s. Some work as certified nurse assistants in nursing homes. None have much extra money. The most urgent concern right now is food, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of the parents, they\u2019re, you know, going around trying to find food pantries,\u201d she said. \u201cA parent actually asked me, do I know a food pantry?\u201d",

      "The initiative is funded almost entirely by the federal government, leaving it with little cushion from funding disruptions.",

      "Abu Dhabi has opened a major oil summit with optimism about rising energy prices",
      "ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates -- Abu Dhabi opened a major oil summit Monday with officials offering bullish optimism that power demands for artificial intelligence and global aviation will boost energy prices, just hours after OPEC+ paused production increases planned for next year.",
      "The comments at the annual Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference in the Emirati capital highlighted the contradictions in the market and in the United Arab Emirates, a major oil producer that hosted the United Nations COP28 climate talks in 2023.",
      "Sultan al-Jaber, the head of the state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. who led COP28, described the energy market as needing \u201creinforcement, not replacement.\u201d U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum applauded al-Jaber's remarks and criticized what he described as \u201ca set of policies that have been driven by an ideology around climate extremism.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe demand for power is going to go up and up and up,\" Burgum said. \"Today\u2019s the day to announce that there is no energy transition. There is only energy addition.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, OPEC+ met and decided to increase its production by an additional 137,000 barrels of oil beginning in December. However, it said other adjustments planned in January, February and March of next year would be paused \u201cdue to seasonality.\u201d",
      "OPEC+ includes the core members of the cartel, as well as nations outside of the group led by Russia.",
      "Benchmark Brent crude sold Monday around $65 a barrel, down from a post-COVID high of some $115 a barrel after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It had fallen to $60 a barrel in recent days over concerns that the market had too much production.",
      "\u201cYes, OPEC+ is blinking, but it\u2019s a calculated move,\u201d said Jorge Le\u00f3n, the head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy. \u201cSanctions on Russian producers have injected a new layer of uncertainty into supply forecasts, and the group knows that overproducing now could backfire later. By pausing, OPEC+ is protecting prices, projecting unity and buying time to see how sanctions play out on Russian barrels.\u201d",
      "Suhail al-Mazerouei, the Emirates' energy and infrastructure minister, however, dismissed any idea long-term of too much oil being in the market.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about a an oversupply scenario,\" he said. \"I can\u2019t see that. I can\u2019t justify that. And I think all of what we are seeing is more demand.\u201d",
      "Burgum, a former Republican governor of North Dakota and the chair of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s National Energy Dominance Council, was on hand for the Abu Dhabi oil summit on Monday. He praised the partnership oil-producing Gulf Arab states have with America, saying: \"We share a belief about energy policy.\u201d",

      "\u201cPeople have described the climate as an existential threat. Again, to help people understand U.S. energy policy, we are focused on two substantial threats. One is Iran could not have a nuclear weapon,\" Burgum said. \u201cBut the second thing is that the free world cannot lose the AI arms race. ... You need chips, you need software models and you need more electricity.\u201d",
      "The average price for a gallon of gasoline in the U.S., a key economic and political indicator in the country, stood at $3.03 on Monday. Trump also has criticized both OPEC+ and Saudi Arabia at times over the price per barrel, particularly in his first term.",

Those sanctions targets included Rosneft and the Russian oil company Lukoil, whose red-and-white logo hung over the annual oil conference. The UAE has maintained close ties to Russia despite the war, but has served as a key interlocutor between Kyiv and Moscow to negotiate prisoner exchanges.",
      "\u201cThe Russian and Ukraine war is being funded by energy sales,\u201d Burgum said on a stage that had flashed the Lukoil logo before his remarks.",
      "The oil conference comes after the UAE hosted COP28. Those talks ended with a call by nearly 200 countries to move away from planet-warming fossil fuels \u2014 the first time the conference made that crucial pledge. Scientists have called for drastically slashing the world\u2019s emissions by nearly half in the coming years to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with pre-industrial times.",
      "But the UAE as a whole still plans to increase its production capacity of oil to 5 million barrels a day in the coming years as it pursues more clean energy at home.",
      "Qatari Energy Minister Saad Sherida al-Kaabi repeated a warning to the European Union that his nation could halt their liquefied natural gas shipments \u2014 something crucial due to Russian LNG being banned \u2014 over its Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. That seeks to have companies pursue net-zero emission goals.",
      "\u201cI think, you know, a small part of this conference, unfortunately, changes with politics depending on when it was President Biden and President Trump and so on,\" al-Kaabi said. \"I think that they're not looking at facts and realities and I think we shouldn't be following politics when we look at the lives of people for the future and how much energy we need in the future.\u201d",

Universal also handled the nationwide re-release of Robert Zemeckis\u2019s \u201cBack to the Future\u201d which earned $4.7 million from 2,290 theaters \u2013 enough to snag a fifth-place spot on the North American charts.

That weekend, the streaming hit sold between $16 and $20 million in movie tickets. This weekend, it\u2019s estimated to have earned somewhere in the $5 million range from 2,890 screens.

With an estimated $4.8 million from 2,043 theaters, it marks filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s best wide break to date. The darkly comedic thriller stars Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons and is expected to be an awards season player.",
      "\u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere\u201d landed in sixth place, behind \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d and down 57% in its second weekend. It earned $3.8 million, putting its domestic total at $16.3 million and its global tally at $30.6 million.",
      "\u201cThis was a truly scary weekend,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s head of marketplace trends. \u201cIt was this imperfect storm of Halloween on a Friday and the World Series on Friday and Saturday. But the studios and theaters knew this was on the horizon and they planned for it.\u201d",
      "The weekend may net out to be one of the lowest grossing of the year, closing out an unusually slow October. With the exception of October 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the month\u2019s total ticket sales ($443 million) have not been this low since 1998 ($455.5 million).",
      "The next two weekends may bring some energy back to multiplexes, however, with releases like \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d and \u201cNow You See Me: Now You Don\u2019t,\u201d but the industry will likely have to wait until closer to Thanksgiving for a real blockbuster when \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d and \u201cZootopia 2\u201d enter the mix.",
      "\"This was always going to be a tough weekend. The audience was truly fragmented,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cThere are weekends where the movie theaters are the focus of the attention, and those are coming.\"",

      "Profits improved thanks to a mild hurricane season and more paper investment.",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The profits of Warren Buffett's company improved 17% thanks to a relatively mild hurricane season and more paper investment gains this year as Berkshire Hathaway continues to prepare for the legendary 95-year-old investor to relinquish the CEO title in January.",
      "But last month's $9.7 billion investment in OxyChem won't do much to diminish the $381.7 billion cash pile that Berkshire was sitting on at the end of September even though it is the biggest deal the company has made in years.",
      "The biggest thing on most investors' minds right now is that Buffett Vice Chair Greg Abel is set to succeed him as CEO in January, although Buffett will remain chairman at Berkshire. The Class A stock is well off its peak of $812,855, set just before Buffett surprised shareholders at the annual meeting in May by announcing he will step back. It closed Friday at $715,740, but Berkshire still didn't buy back any of its own stock in the quarter, which suggests Buffett thinks it is still overvalued.",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said she expects investors will clamor for more details from Berkshire after Abel takes over, and that calls for the company to finally pay a dividend if it can't find better uses for all that cash will also grow louder. But with Buffett remaining chairman there may not be any immediate changes.",
      "\u201cThe lack of discussion and disclosure \u2014 I think has a lot of the investment community frustrated,\u201d Seifert said. Berkshire has never had public or investor relations departments, and the company skips the quarterly investor calls that nearly every public company holds. Buffett has long said he prefers to share results with every investor at the same time, on Saturdays, and give them the weekend to digest the results before the markets reopen.",
      "Berkshire said Saturday that it earned $30.796 billion, or $21,413 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's up from last year's $26.251 billion, or $18,272 per A share.",
      "But those bottom-line figures are always distorted by the current value of Berkshire's massive investment portfolio and any stock sales, which this year added $17.3 billion to the company's profits.",

      "On that measure, Berkshire's operating profit jumped to $13.485 billion, or $9376.15 per Class A share, thanks to a strong rebound in its insurance companies. A year ago, Berkshire reported operating earnings of $10.09 billion, or $7,023.01 per Class A share.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted Berkshire would report operating earnings of $8,573.50 per Class A share.",
      "Berkshire said fewer catastrophic losses from hurricanes this year compared to when Hurricane Helene ravaged the southeast a year ago helped its insurance underwriting profit jump $1.6 billion to $2.369 billion. The bottom line was also helped by $331 million in gains on debt held in foreign currencies this year, compared to a $1.1 billion loss on those holdings a year ago.",
      "Most of Berkshire's other companies performed well in the quarter although profits did decline nearly 9% at its utilities to $1.489 billion.",

      "Black vultures have killed and eaten several calves on Tom Karr\u2019s cattle ranch in southeastern Ohio, a loss he says didn't happen two decades ago",
      "EMINENCE, Ky. -- Allan Bryant scans the sky as he watches over a minutes-old calf huddled under a tree line with its mother. After a few failed tries, the calf stands on wobbly legs for the first time, looking to nurse.",
      "Above, a pair of birds circle in the distance. Bryant, hoping they're not black vultures, is relieved to see they're only turkey vultures \u2014 red-headed and not aggressive.",
      "\u201cHonestly, the black vulture is one of the ugliest things I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re easy to hate.\u201d",
      "Black vultures, scavengers that sometimes attack and kill sick or newborn animals, didn't used to be a problem here. But now Bryant frequently sees the birds following a birth. He hasn't lost a calf in several years, but they've killed his animals before. So now he takes measures to stop them.",
      "In some of his fields, he erects a scarecrow of sorts \u2014 a dead black vulture \u2014 aimed at scaring off the birds. It's a requirement of his depredation permit through the Kentucky Farm Bureau, which allows him to shoot a few birds a year. The dead bird keeps the live birds away for about a week, but they eventually come back, he said.",
      "It\u2019s a problem that may grow worse for cattle farmers as the scavenging birds\u2019 range expands northward, in part due to climate change. Lobbying groups have been pushing for legislation that would allow landowners to kill more of these birds, which are protected but not endangered. But experts say more research is needed to better understand how the birds impact livestock and how their removal could affect ecosystems.",
      "Black vultures used to mainly live in the southeastern U.S. and farther south in Latin and South America, but over the past century they've started to rapidly stretch northward and also west into the desert Southwest, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration.",
      "Warmer winters on average, fueled by climate change, are making it easier for the birds to stay in places that used to be too cold for them. What's more, the human footprint in suburban and rural areas is enriching their habitat: development means cars, and cars mean roadkill. Cattle farms can also offer a buffet of vulnerable animals for vultures that learn the seasonal calving schedule.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from a lot of different studies of birds, it\u2019s that they are very good at taking advantage of food resources and remembering where those things are,\u201d Farnsworth said.",
      "Although black vultures are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, they aren't really a migratory species, he said. Instead, they breed, and some disperse to new areas and settle there.",
      "After losing a calf to a black vulture a decade ago, Tom Karr, who raises cattle near Pomeroy, Ohio, tried to move his fall calving season later in the year in hopes the vultures would be gone by then. But that didn't help \u2014 the birds stay all year, he said.",
      "Until newborn calves are a few days old, \u201cwe try to keep them up closer to the barns,\u201d said Joanie Grimes, the owner of a 350-head calf-cow operation in Hillsboro, Ohio. She said they've been dealing with the birds for 15 years, but keeping them out of remote fields has helped improve matters.",
      "Annette Ericksen has noticed the black vultures for several years on her property, Twin Maples Farm in Milton, West Virginia, but they haven't yet lost any animals to them. When they expect calves and lambs, they move the livestock into a barn, and they also use dogs \u2014 Great Pyrenees \u2014 trained to patrol the fields and the barnyard for raptors that might hurt the animals.",

Farmers said calves can be worth hundreds of dollars or upward of $1,000 or $2,000, depending on the breed.",
      "In March, lawmakers in Congress introduced a bill that would let farmers capture or kill any black vulture \u201cin order to prevent death, injury, or destruction to livestock.\u201d Many farmers and others in the cattle industry have supported the move, and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association in July commended the House Natural Resources Committee for advancing the bill.",

However, a planned meeting between Trump and Putin in Budapest was recently scrapped after Russian officials made clear they opposed an immediate ceasefire in the conflict.",

      "Despite Trump\u2019s optimism after a 100-minute meeting with Xi, there continues to be the potential for major tensions between the countries, with both seeking dominant places in manufacturing and developing emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.",
      "\u201cIt is certainly a contribution to bring the leaders of the two largest economies together for a meeting where they agreed to withdraw their most extreme tariff and export control threats. As a result, worst-case outcomes for global trade were averted,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.",
      "\u201cHowever, APEC is meant to be more than a venue for a trade war truce,\u201d Easley said. \u201cGreater multilateral efforts are needed to address the region\u2019s most pressing economic challenges, including resisting costly and destabilizing protectionism, harmonizing regulations for sustainable trade, and coordinating standards for digital innovation.\u201d",

But it will be hard to undercut China's stranglehold on the market.",
      "The restrictions China imposed on rare earths this year have been a key issue in the trade talks between Beijing and Washington. Trump responded angrily to China's latest rules with a threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on all Chinese imports, but he has since dropped that demand as part of this agreement.",
      "This week's deal will delay the regulations that would have required foreign companies to get special approval to export items that contain even small traces of rare earths elements sourced from China even if those products were made elsewhere by foreign companies, but it doesn't eliminate restrictions that were imposed in the spring after Trump imposed his tariffs.",

      "Neha Mukherjee, a rare earths analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said the one-year delay in China\u2019s new rare earth export controls that were announced earlier this month provides some short-term relief that will allow exports to return to a more normal level, but it doesn\u2019t change the broader strategic picture, and it's important for America and its allies to continue investing in the industry.",
      "\u201cThis move appears more tactical than structural, a pause to stabilize trade relations with the U.S. rather than a policy reversal,\u201d Mukherjee said. \"This is a temporary window for the U.S. and allies to accelerate diversification before controls likely return.\u201d",
      "The White House has made it a priority to revive and expand the domestic critical minerals industry while also seeking supplies of these elements from allies. The Pentagon agreed to invest $400 million in rare-earth producer MP Materials and promised to ensure every magnet made at its massive new plant is bought and set a minimum price for its neodymium and praseodymium products for a decade.",

      "There are a number of promising efforts already underway. Noveon will continue to produce rare earth magnets at its plant in Texas, and MP Materials and USA Rare Earth are both scheduled to begin producing magnets at their plants over the next year.

      "China has shown little sign of being willing to allow rare earth exports to defense contractors, which is concerning given the national security implications. But military demand for rare earths is relatively small, so America might be able to supply its needs by prioritizing rare earths from other sources for use in fighter jets, guided missiles and nuclear submarines.",

      "\u201cI did what any other mother would do to protect her children,\u201d Bond Ferguson, who has five children ranging in age from 4 to 16, told The Associated Press. \u201cI shot at it and it just stood there, and I shot again, and he backed up and that's when he fell.\u201d",
      "The Jasper County Sheriff's Office confirmed in a social media post that a homeowner had found one of the monkeys on their property Sunday morning but said the office didn't have any details. The Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks took possession of the monkey, the sheriff's office said.",
      "Before Bond Ferguson had gone out the door, she had called the police and was told to keep an eye on the monkey. But she said worried that if the monkey got away it would threaten children at another house.",
      "\u201cIf it attacked somebody's kid, and I could have stopped it, that would be a lot on me,\u201d said Bond Ferguson, a 35-year-old professional chef. \u201cIt's kind of scary and dangerous that they are running around, and people have kids playing in their yards.\u201d",

      "Rhesus monkeys typically weigh about 16 pounds (7.2 kilograms) and are among the most medically studied animals on the planet.

      "Udio, an AI song generation platform, has announced a 48-hour window starting Monday for users to download their songs",
      "Artificial intelligence song generation platform Udio said it would give its frustrated users 48 hours starting Monday to download their songs before the company shifts to a new business model to comply with a legal settlement.",
      "The short reprieve comes after Udio on Wednesday said it had settled copyright infringement claims brought by Universal Music, a label with artists including Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, Drake and Kendrick Lamar.",
      "AI companies are now fighting so many copyright lawsuits that a tech industry lobby group, the Chamber of Progress, last week called on President Donald Trump to sign an executive order directing federal attorneys \u201cto intervene in legal cases\u201d to defend the industry's practice of building generative AI tools by feeding them on copyrighted works.",
      "Citing more than 50 pending federal cases, the group asked for help stopping court fights leading to \u201cpotentially company-killing penalties\u201d that threaten AI innovation. But artists have warned that AI tools built on their works also threaten their livelihoods.",
      "In the biggest settlement so far, AI company Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion \u2014 or $3,000 per book \u2014 to settle claims from authors who alleged the company illegally pirated nearly half a million of their works to train its chatbot.",
      "Udio and Universal didn't disclose the financial terms of their new music licensing agreements. They also said they will team up on a new streaming platform.",
      "As part of the agreement, Udio immediately stopped allowing people to download songs they\u2019ve created, which sparked a backlash and apparent exodus among paying users.",
      "\u201cWe know the pain it causes to you,\u201d Udio later said in a post on Reddit's Udio forum, where users were venting about feeling betrayed by the platform\u2019s surprise move and complained that it limited what they could do with their music.",
      "Udio said it still must stop downloads as it transitions to a new streaming platform next year. But over the weekend, it said it will give people 48 hours starting at 11 a.m. Eastern time Monday to keep their \u201cpast creations.\u201d",

      "The settlement deal was the music industry's first since Universal, along with Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Records, sued Udio and another AI song generator, Suno, last year over copyright infringement.",
      "Udio and Suno pioneered AI song generation technology, which can spit out new songs based on prompts typed into a chatbot-style text box. Users, who don\u2019t need musical talent, can merely request a tune in the style of, for example, classic rock, 1980s synth-pop or West Coast rap.",
      "Record labels have accused the platforms of exploiting the recorded works of artists without compensating them.",
      "In its lawsuit filed against Udio last year, Universal sought to show how specific AI-generated songs made on Udio closely resembled Universal-owned classics like Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201cMy Way,\u201d The Temptations\u2019 \u201cMy Girl,\" ABBA's \u201cDancing Queen\u201d and holiday favorites like \u201cRockin\u2019 Around the Christmas Tree\u201d and \u201cJingle Bell Rock.\u201d",

      "\u201cLicensing is the only version of AI\u2019s future that doesn\u2019t result in the mass destruction of art and culture,\" the group said. \u201cBut this promise must be available to all music creators, not just to major corporate copyright holders.\u201d",

      "The closest supermoon of the year is approaching in November",
      "NEW YORK -- The moon will look slightly bigger and brighter Wednesday night during the closest supermoon of the year.",
      "The moon's orbit around the Earth isn't a perfect circle, so it gets nearer and farther as it swings around. A so-called supermoon happens when a full moon is closer to Earth in its orbit. That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA.",
      "November's supermoon is the second of three supermoons this year and also the closest: The moon will come within just under 222,000 miles (357,000 kilometers) of Earth.",
      "Tides may be slightly higher during a supermoon because the moon is closer to Earth, said astronomer Lawrence Wasserman with Lowell Observatory. But the difference isn't very noticeable.",
      "No special equipment is needed to view the supermoon if clear skies permit. But the change in the moon's size can be tough to discern with the naked eye.",

      "The recent escape of several research monkeys after the truck carrying them overturned on a Mississippi interstate is the latest glimpse into the secretive industry of animal research and the processes that allow key details of what happened to be kept from the public.",
      "Three monkeys have remained on the loose since the crash on Tuesday in a rural area along Interstate 59, spilling wooden crates labeled \u201clive monkeys\u201d into the tall grass near the highway. Since then, searchers in masks, face shields and other protective equipment have scoured nearby fields and woods for the missing primates. Five of the 21 Rhesus macaques on board were killed during the search, according to the local sheriff, but it was unclear how that happened.",
      "Mississippi authorities have not disclosed the driver's name, the company involved in transporting the monkeys, where the monkeys were headed or who owns them. While Tulane University in New Orleans has acknowledged that the monkeys had been housed at its National Biomedical Research Center in Covington, Louisiana, it said it doesn't own them and won't identify who does.",
      "The questions surrounding the Mississippi crash and the mystery of why the animals were traveling through the South are remarkable, animal advocates say.",
      "\u201cWhen a truck carrying 21 monkeys crashes on a public highway, the community has a right to know who owned those animals, where they were being sent, and what diseases they may have been exposed to and harbored simply by being caught up in the primate experimentation industry,\u201d said Lisa Jones-Engel, senior science adviser on primate experimentation with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.",
      "\u201cIt is highly unusual \u2014 and deeply troubling \u2014 that Tulane refuses to identify its partner in this shipment,\u201d Jones-Engel added.",
      "Transporting research animals typically requires legally binding contracts that prevent the parties involved from disclosing information, Tulane University said in a statement to The Associated Press. That's done for the safety of the animals and to protect proprietary information, the New Orleans-based university said.",
      "\u201cTo the best of Tulane\u2019s knowledge, the 13 recovered animals remain in the possession of their owner and are en route to their original destination,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The crash has drawn a range of reactions \u2014 from conspiracy theories that suggest a government plot to sicken people to serious responses from people who oppose experimenting on animals.",

      "The Mississippi crash is one of at least three major monkey escapes in the U.S. over the past four years.",
      "Last November, 43 Rhesus macaques escaped from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research after an enclosure wasn't fully locked. Employees from the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, South Carolina, set up traps to capture them. However, some spent two months that winter living in the woods and weathering a rare snowstorm. By late January, the last four escapees were recaptured after being lured back into captivity by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.",
      "In January 2022, several cynomolgus macaque monkeys escaped when a truck towing a trailer of about 100 of the animals collided with a dump truck on a Pennsylvania highway, authorities said. The monkeys were headed to a quarantine facility in an undisclosed location after arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on a flight from Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation, authorities said. A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said all of the animals were accounted for within about a day, though three were euthanized for undisclosed reasons.",

      "The plan was announced Friday by the government, Nvidia, and some of South Korea\u2019s biggest companies, including chipmakers Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and auto giant Hyundai Motor, after President Lee Jae Myung met with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.",
      "At a news conference, Huang said he hopes to export Nvidia\u2019s most advanced AI chips to China, following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on loosening U.S. chip restrictions as the two leaders pledged to reduce trade tensions.",
      "However, he acknowledged that it was up to Trump to decide, and said there were no current plans to sell the next generation Blackwell chips to China.",

      "About 50,000 of the GPUs will be used to support a government project to build a national cloud computing center for AI and Nvidia will provide the same number of GPUs each to Samsung and SK to help them enhance their manufacturing processes through AI and accelerate the development of advanced semiconductors.",
      "Hyundai and Nvidia said they plan to collaborate on developing technologies related to self-driving cars, smart factories and robotics, a process that will be powered by 50,000 of Nvidia\u2019s advanced Blackwell GPUs.",
      "Speaking to business leaders, Huang highlighted how AI and advanced computing are driving a profound transformation across industries, adding to the need for more infrastructure and capacity.

And so I\u2019m hopeful that both governments will arrive at a conclusion someday where Nvidia\u2019s technology could be exported to China.\u201d",
      "Huang acknowledged U.S. security concerns about Nvidia technology being used by China\u2019s military but argued that China already has ample AI capabilities, making the use of Nvidia chips for military purposes largely unnecessary.",
      "In August, Trump announced a deal with Nvidia and AMD, another chipmaker, to lift export controls on sales of advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenue, despite concerns among national security experts that such chips will end up in the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services.",

The tech executives clinked glasses, took bomb shots, and at one point, Huang stepped outside to hand baskets of chicken and fried cheese to the crowd waiting outside.",

      "The performance announced Thursday was driven largely by strong initial demand for the premium models of the iPhone 17 lineup that went on sale last month.",
      "Although the iPhone 17 lacks the AI wizardry featured in rival devices recently introduced by Samsung and Google, Apple spruced up its latest models with a redesign highlighted by a sleek \u201cliquid glass\u201d appearance on the display screens.",

      "The formula apparently was enough to win over consumers, particularly in the United States, and deliver iPhone sales totaling $49 billion during the July-September period, a 6% from the same time last year. That was slightly below the 8% increase in iPhone sales that had been anticipated by analysts, and less than the 13% bump in sales during the April-June period.",
      "Buoyed by the iPhone results, Apple earned $27.5 billion, or $1.85 per share, nearly doubling its profit from a year ago. Revenue climbed 8% from a year ago to $102.5 billion. Both the earnings and revenue eclipsed the analyst forecasts that steer the stock market.",

The first-person shooter game, which debuted in 2003 as a World War II simulation, has sold over 500 million copies globally. Subsequent versions have delved into modern warfare as well.",

      "Researchers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute are developing tiny drones inspired by bats for search and rescue missions",
      "WORCESTER, Mass. -- Don't be fooled by the fog machine, spooky lights and fake bats: the robotics lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute lab isn't hosting a Halloween party.",
      "Instead, it\u2019s a testing ground for tiny drones that can be deployed in search and rescue missions even in dark, smoky or stormy conditions.",
      "\u201cWe all know that when there\u2019s an earthquake or a tsunami, the first thing that goes down is power lines. A lot of times, it\u2019s at night, and you\u2019re not going to wait until the next morning to go and rescue survivors,\u201d said Nitin Sanket, assistant professor of robotics engineering. \u201cSo we started looking at nature. Is there a creature in the world which can actually do this?\u201d",
      "Sanket and his students found their answer in bats and the winged mammal's highly sophisticated ability to echolocate, or navigate via reflected sound. With a National Science Foundation grant, they\u2019re developing small, inexpensive and energy-efficient aerial robots that can be flown where and when current drones can\u2019t operate.",
      "Last month, emergency workers in Pakistan used drones to find people stranded on rooftops by massive floods. In August, a rescue team used a drone to find a California man who got trapped for two days behind a waterfall. And in July, drones helped find a stable route to three mine workers who spent more than 60 hours trapped underground in Canada.",
      "But while drones are becoming more common in search and rescue, Sanket and researchers elsewhere want to move beyond the manually operated individual robots being used today. A key next step is developing aerial robots that can be deployed in swarms and make their own decisions about where to search, said Ryan Williams, an associate professor at Virginia Tech.",
      "\u201cThat type of deployment \u2014 autonomous drones \u2014 that is effectively nil,\u201d he said.",
      "Williams tackled that problem with a recent project that involved programming drones to choose search trajectories in coordination with human searchers. Among other things, his team used historical data from thousands of missing person cases to create a model predicting how someone would behave if lost in the woods.",
      "\u201cAnd then we used that model to better localize our drones, to search in locations with higher chances of finding someone,\u201d he said.",
      "At WPI, Sanket\u2019s project addresses other limitations of current drones, including their size and perception capabilities.",
      "\u201cCurrent robots are big, bulky, expensive and cannot work in all sorts of scenarios,\u201d he said.",

      "By contrast, his drone fits in the palm of his hand, is made mostly from inexpensive hobby-grade materials and can operate in the dark. A small ultrasonic sensor, not unlike those used in automatic faucets in public restrooms, mimics bat behavior, sending out a pulse of high-frequency sound and using the echo to detect obstacles in its path.",
      "During a recent demonstration, a student used a remote control to launch the drone in a brightly lit room and then again after turning off all but a faintly glowing red light. As it approached a clear, Plexiglas wall, the drone repeatedly halted and backed away, even with the lights off and with fog and fake snow swirling through the air.",
      "\u201cCurrently, search and rescue robots are mainly operational in broad daylight,\u201d Sanket said. \u201cThe problem is that search and rescues are dull, dangerous and dirty jobs that happen a lot of times in darkness.\u201d",
      "But development didn\u2019t go completely smoothly. The researchers realized that the noise of the bat robot\u2019s propellers interfered with the ultrasound, requiring 3D printed shells to minimize the interference. They also used artificial intelligence to teach the drone how to filter and interpret sound signals.",
      "Still, there\u2019s a long way to go to match bats, which can contract and compress their muscles to listen only to certain echoes and can detect something as small as a human hair from several meters away.",
      "\u201cBats are amazing,\u201d Sanket said. \u201cWe are nowhere close to what nature has achieved. But the goal is that one day in the future, we will be there and these will be useful for deployment in the wild.\u201d",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- A fragment of a mask that was preserved for hundreds of years in permafrost sat in the muck of a low tide in the western Alaska community of Quinhagak. Wooden spoons, toys, a fishing lure and other artifacts were strewn, in some cases for miles, along the beach.",
      "The Yup'ik community near the edge of the Bering Sea was spared the widespread devastation wrought by the remnants of Typhoon Halong on its neighbors further west earlier this month. But it suffered a different kind of blow: The lashing winds and storm surge devoured dozens of feet of shoreline, disrupting a culturally significant archaeological site and washing away possibly thousands of unearthed artifacts.",
      "About 1,000 pieces, including wooden masks and tools, were recovered in Quinhagak after the storm ravaged parts of southwest Alaska on Oct. 11 and 12. But many more pieces \u2014 perhaps up to 100,000 \u2014 were left scattered, said Rick Knecht, an archaeologist who has worked on the Nunalleq, or old village, project for 17 years. That's roughly the number of pieces previously recovered from the archaeological site.",
      "Meanwhile, freezing temperatures and ice have settled into the region, stalling immediate efforts to find and recover more displaced artifacts on searches done by four-wheeler and foot.",
      "Knecht called what happened a major loss. The site has yielded the world's largest collection of pre-contact Yup'ik artifacts. Much of what's known about Yup'ik life before outsiders arrived stems from the project, said Knecht, an emeritus senior lecturer in archaeology at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.",
      "\u201cWhen there are holes or disturbances in the site, it\u2019s like trying to read a book with holes in the pages. You're going to miss a few things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the bigger those holes are, the weaker the story gets. There\u2019s a few holes in the book right now.\u201d",
      "While the name of the original village isn't known, it was attacked by another village and burned around 1650, he said. Knecht has worked with elders and others in Quinhagak to combine their traditional knowledge with the technology and techniques used by the archaeology teams to study the past together.",
      "Quinhagak has about 800 residents, and subsistence food gathering is critically important to them.",
      "The storm dispersed artifacts from a site long preserved by permafrost, Knecht said. A longstanding concern has been the threat that climate change \u2014 melting permafrost, coastal erosion, the potential for more frequent or stronger storms \u2014 has posed to the site, he said.",
      "It poses risks to the community itself. Erosion threatens major infrastructure in Quinhagak, including a sewage lagoon, homes and fish camps. Thawing permafrost is also unsettling and undermining buildings, according to a 2024 report from the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.",
      "The excavation project itself began after artifacts began appearing on the beach around 2007. Part of the site that washed out had been excavated previously.",

      "When he left in July, there was a roughly 30-foot buffer to the sea. The storm took out the buffer and another 30 feet of the site, he said. It also left what Knecht described as piano-sized clumps of tundra on the tidal flats.",

      "The news of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s accelerating growth in revenue and profit comes on the heels of a court ruling in the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s landmark monopoly case against Google\u2019s dominant search engine that was widely seen as a mild rebuke that wouldn\u2019t hobble the company.",
      "Alphabet performed like a powerhouse during the July-September period, delivering a profit of nearly $35 billion, or $2.87 per share, a 33% increase from the same time last year. Revenue rose 16% from last year to $102.3 billion. Both figures easily exceeded the analysts' projections that steer the stock market.",

      "That\u2019s on top of a 30% surge in Alphabet\u2019s shares that has created nearly $770 billion in stockholder wealth since early September. That\u2019s when U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta rejected a Justice Department proposal to break up Google to curb the abuses of a search engine that was declared an illegal monopoly last year.",
      "Mehta\u2019s cautious handling of Google\u2019s search monopoly largely reflected his belief that rapid advances in artificial intelligence technology have already been spawning conversational \u201canswer engines\u201d from rising tech stars such as ChatGPT and Perplexity that are giving consumers more options.",

      "Producing and manufacturing electric vehicles and their batteries uses a lot of energy, leading many to be skeptical about the environmental benefits of going electric",
      "DETROIT -- Making electric vehicles and their batteries is a dirty process that uses a lot of energy. But a new study says that EVs quickly make up for that with less overall emissions through two years of use than a gas-powered vehicle.",
      "The study also estimated that gas-powered vehicles cause at least twice as much environmental damage over their lifetimes as EVs, and said the benefits of EVs can be expected to increase in coming decades as clean sources of power, such as solar and wind, are brought onto the grid.",
      "The work by researchers from Northern Arizona University and Duke University, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS Climate, offers insight into a transportation sector that makes up a big part of U.S. emissions. It also comes as some EV skeptics have raised concerns about whether the environmental impact of battery production, including mining, makes it worthwhile to switch to electric.",
      "\u201cWhile there is a bigger carbon footprint in the very short term because of the manufacturing process in creating the batteries for electric vehicles, very quickly you come out ahead in CO2 emissions by year three and then for all of the rest of the vehicle lifetime, you\u2019re far ahead and so cumulatively much lower carbon footprint,\" said Drew Shindell, an earth science professor at Duke University and study co-author.",
      "The researchers evaluated several harmful air pollutants monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as emissions data, to compare the relative impact over time of EVs and internal combustion engines on air quality and climate change.",
      "Their analysis said that EVs produce 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than gasoline vehicles in their first two years. That can be attributed to the energy-intensive production and manufacturing processes involved in mining lithium for EV batteries.",
      "They also sought to account for how the U.S. energy system might develop in coming years, assuming growth in clean energy. And they modeled four different scenarios for EV adoption, ranging from the lowest \u2014 a 31% share of vehicle sales \u2014 to the highest, 75% of sales, by 2050. (EV sales accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2024.)",
      "The researchers said the average of those four models found that for each additional kilowatt hour of lithium-ion battery output, carbon dioxide emissions drop by an average of 220 kilograms (485 pounds) in 2030, and another 127 kilograms (280 pounds) in 2050.",
      "The consistent decrease in CO2 emissions from EVs is \u201cnot only driven by the on-road vehicles, but also reduction that has been brought due to electricity production,\u201d said lead author Pankaj Sadavarte, a postdoctoral researcher at Northern Arizona University.",
      "Greg Keoleian, a University of Michigan professor of sustainable systems who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, called it a \u201cvaluable study\u201d that echoes other findings and \u201cconfirms the environmental and economic benefits\u201d of EVs.",
      "\u201cAccelerating the adoption of battery electric vehicles is a key strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector which will reduce future damages and costs of climate change,\u201d he said.",
      "Shindell, the Duke researcher, said the grid will evolve to have more solar and wind power.",
      "\u201cWhen you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody\u2019s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the grid just overall becomes much cleaner in both the terms of carbon emissions for climate change, and for air pollution.\"",

      "If it happens, the deal would mark the end of months of uncertainty about the fate of the popular video-sharing platform in the United States. After wide bipartisan majorities in Congress passed \u2014 and President Joe Biden signed \u2014 a law that would ban TikTok in the U.S. if it did not find a new owner in the place of China's ByteDance, the platform was set to go dark on the law's January deadline. For a several hours, it did. But on his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order to keep it running while his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.",
      "Three more executive orders followed, as Trump, without a clear legal basis, continued to extend the deadline for a TikTok deal. The second was in April, when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement. The third came in June, then another in September, which Trump said would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States in a way that meets national security concerns.",
      "Trump\u2019s order was meant to enable an American-led group of investors to buy the app from China\u2019s ByteDance, though the deal also requires China\u2019s approval.",
      "However, TikTok deal is \u201cnot really a big thing for Xi Jinping,\u201d said Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the German Marshall Fund's Indo-Pacific program, during a media briefing Tuesday. \u201c(China is) happy to let (Trump) declare that they have finally kept a deal.

      "The government shutdown is triggering a wave of closures of Head Start centers, leaving working parents scrambling for child care and shutting some of the nation's neediest children out of preschool.",
      "Dozens of centers are missing out on federal grant payments that were due to arrive Nov. 1. Some say they'll close indefinitely, while others are staying afloat with emergency funding from local governments and school districts. The closures mean Head Start students \u2014 who come from low-income households, are homeless or are in foster care \u2014 are missing out on preschool, where they are fed two meals a day and receive therapy vital to their development.",
      "\u201cChildren love school, and the fact that they can\u2019t go is breaking their hearts,\u201d said Sarah Sloan, who oversees small-town Head Start centers in Scioto County, Ohio. Staff told families they planned to close Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s hampering our families\u2019 ability to put food on the table and to know that their children are safe during the day.\u201d",
      "A half-dozen Head Start programs never received grants that were anticipated in October, but there are now 140 programs that have not received their annual infusion of federal funding. All told, the programs have capacity to assist 65,000 preschoolers and expectant parents.",
      "Among the preschools closing as of Monday are 24 Migrant and Seasonal Head Start centers spread across five states. Those centers, created to assist the children of migrant farmworkers, typically operate on 10- to 12-hour days to accommodate the long hours parents work on farms.",
      "Children attending the centers in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama and Oklahoma recently came home with fliers warning of possible closures, along with other parent notifications. Those centers serving more than 1,100 children will now remain closed until the shutdown ends, said East Coast Migrant Head Start Project CEO Javier Gonzalez. About 900 staff members across the centers also have been furloughed.",
      "In the absence of other options for child care, some parents\u2019 only option may be to bring their young child to the fields where they work, Gonzalez said.",
      "Many of the families that qualify for the federal preschool program also depend on food aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP or food stamps. That program also was on track to run dry of money due to the shutdown, although a pair of federal judges on Friday ordered the Trump administration to keep the program running with emergency reserve funds.",
      "That means many Head Start families have been worried about food aid, along with the child care they rely on to make ends meet. A day without child care means a day without work for many parents \u2014 and a day without pay.",
      "In Kansas City, Missouri, Jhanee Hunt teaches toddlers at a Head Start site, the Emmanuel Family and Child Development Center, where her 6-month-old son is cared for in another classroom. The center said it can scrape up enough money to stay open for a few weeks, but the money won\u2019t last much beyond November.",
      "At dropoff, she said, parents often are wearing uniforms for fast food restaurants like Wendy\u2019s and McDonald\u2019s. Some work as certified nurse assistants in nursing homes. None have much extra money. The most urgent concern right now is food, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of the parents, they\u2019re, you know, going around trying to find food pantries,\u201d she said. \u201cA parent actually asked me, do I know a food pantry?\u201d",

      "Republican candidates running in the 2026 midterm elections are ramping up for a campaign cycle in lockstep with President Donald Trump, their party kingmaker who's keenly invested in their races, which will determine much about how the latter half of his second term will play out.",
      "National Republicans are focused on retaining control of both chambers of Congress during the elections, ensuring that the legislative portion of Trump's presidency can carry on. With Democratic control, they could ramp up investigations and oversight hearings that could put his administration on the defensive.",
      "The president is expected to be engaged in the midterms, campaigning for Republican candidates and having a hand in messaging and candidate selection, a Republican official close to the White House told ABC News, in order to prevent messy primaries or bids from non-Trump-aligned options.",
      "\"[The White House is] very involved in making sure we have the right candidates next year, that we're backing the right folks and that we're basically prepared and ready to go,\" the official told ABC News. \"The thinking basically started even before the president took office, like it's been a fantastic change compared to 2017, 2018.\"",
      "\"People on our side remember what it was like to deal with all of these investigations ... and how much it distracted and hurt the president's agenda. So I do think, especially on our side, when we're talking to our base, we're going to remind voters, you need to get out and vote to give the president a full four years.\"",
      "To win races, Republicans are strategizing on how to mobilize Trump voters, whose turnout has historically been lower in off-presidential election cycles, the Republican official and other GOP political operatives said. Ongoing pushes from Trump and other Republicans for mid-cycle redistricting in order to gain additional House seats are another way the party is shoring up its chances for victory.",
      "A year out from the midterms, an\u00a0ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll\u00a0published on Sunday finds 46% of registered voters saying they would support the Democratic candidate in House races if the election were held today.

      "\"The Republicans are going to do a Midterm Convention in order to show the great things we have done since the Presidential Election of 2024,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform in September.",

      "\"We have winners. We have good stars.\"",
      "Democrats, in the throes of rebuilding their party can agree, at least, on one thing: they are fed up with being portrayed as losers.",
      "Several ABC News interviews with Democratic strategists, current and former national staffers, and state-level officials raise several questions from within the party of how to best shift perceptions ahead of the midterms: does the party go full bore on anti-Trump messaging as the navigate the politics of the ongoing government shutdown and voters feel the pinch? Do they focus, instead, on boosting progressive rising stars even as Republicans paint the party as too-radical?",
      "Some less conventional Democrats question whether the party should bother relying on the traditional leadership structure, who may lean too much on outdated tactics, in Washington at all. While other, more traditional members, argue they're not in as much disarray as their critics claim.",
      "Democrats in Washington point to recent wins as proof that their brand is not as toxic as some critics claim: two Republican legislative district flips in Iowa; electing a Democrat in a Pennsylvania state senate seat for the first time in 130 years; elevating a Democratic mayor to lead Omaha's blue dot, for example.",
      "They're banking on likely successes in the days-away gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey (and to a lesser extent, dominance in New York City's mayoral race) as reputational defibrillators a year out from the midterms.",
      "\"We have the momentum, certainly, heading into this final stretch,\" Democratic National Committee chairman Ken Martin told ABC News in a recent interview, of anticipated wins in New Jersey, Virginia, and Pennsylvania's supreme court races.",
      "Yet a\u00a0recent\u00a0ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll\u00a0found that more Americans say the Democratic Party is \"out of touch with the concerns of most people in the United States today\" (68%) than Trump (63%) and the Republican Party (61%).",
      "Asked on Sunday why more Americans feel this way about Democrats than the president -- even amidst the East Wing demolitions or a White House Halloween party hosted during the shutdown -- Martin suggested Republicans were in hotter water and disapproved of by Americans more.",
      "But pressed on what Democrats are doing to try to get more in touch with voters -- or why he thinks, even if there is a swing away from Trump, people still see the Democrats as out of touch -- Martin said he's confident the party is making strides regardless of what the polls say.",
      "\"I can't speak to that because I've seen a lot of other polls that suggest just the opposite, right? People are starting to put their trust and faith back in with the Democratic Party. And you know, I can tell you right now that you know, we've been out there having conversations with voters, growing our coalition,\" Martin said, adding that Trump's policies and actions are creating an opening for Democrats to have conversations with disillusioned voters.",
      "Democrats also hope to mine several lessons from their soon-to-be-released election analysis (don't call it a postmortem, members joke).",
      "One of Martin biggest takeaways from the report, he told ABC News, is that \"everyone just started their campaign way too late, and we had already been defined before we ever had a chance to define ourselves ... we cannot wait to talk to voters until the final few months before an election.\"",
      "Yet, some Democrats see their party's lower approval numbers (32%, per a recent Associated Press survey)\u00a0and believe they should pivot away from the traditional party apparatus.",

Despite that, she argues the committee is laser-focused on winning and wishes to be a tool to help candidates succeed.",
      "\"People can feel what they need to feel and grieve how they need to grieve about this loss, and we will change the things that we need to change in order to continue to perform well. But to me, people complaining tells me that they care a whole lot, and I think that that's valuable. And also, frankly, we can listen to that stuff and still do our jobs every day to elect Democrats,\" said Schneider.",
      "\"We went from being the party of cool with Barack Obama to turning into the party of nerds and dweebs and losers, right? What is really annoying about all of it is that we have winners. We have good stars,\" the second staffer continued. told ABC News.",
      "Obama has aligned himself, and whatever residual it-factor he possesses, with marquee political fights over the last few months: rallying Texas Democrats who broke quorum, in-person campaigning for both the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races, boosting Democrats in Pennsylvania's supreme court elections, to cutting ads for Gov. Gavin Newsom's redistricting proposition.",

At the same time, if we're serious about telling voters we're moving forward -- she can't be our nominee in 2028. Is she a leading voice in the party, yes?

      "Per a new ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, roughly 6 in 10 Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of the job.",
      "And despite worries of disinterested donors and shrinking voter registration, the campaign arms of the party, taking cues from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, are outraising their Republican counterparts, even as the national party heavily lags in that arena. The DSCC raised nearly $20 million in Q3, versus the NRSC's $18 million, and the DCCC currently has a slight cash-on-hand edge, with $46.6 million to the NRCC's $45.8. A DNC official says the committee",
      "Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who rebuilt the DNC as chair after the party's devastating losses in 2001, is bullish on his party's chances to sweep over the next year, as he believes droves of voters will reject Trump due to rising costs, shrinking access to health care, and negative impacts of the government shutdown, and trickle back to Democrats after this off-cycle election day.",
      "\"T\u200b\u200bhe Democratic Party is poised to take off like a booster rocket,\" said McAuliffe, who, a few weeks ago, hosted a packed fundraiser for Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Abigail Spanberger, at his home alongside the Clintons on behalf of the Democratic Governors' Association.",
      "McAuliffe said the 400-or-so attendees raised $2.2 million in one night -- proof, he argues, of his party's unquestionable desire to win. His message to hand-wringers and eye-rollers, even some within the party, echoes from what many at the top tell ABC: \"We need to be encouraged, people are counting on us to fight. I'm tired of the whining, complaining, the party of lemon suckers. Get in the game.\"",

      "Harrison also said he hopes the party seriously considers hosting a midterm convention, which could amplify their talent and hammer home their priorities. Schneider said a potential event is \"in the mix.\"",
      "\"The Democrats are looking for a unity of purpose, a unity of message, a unity of strategy. And it's important that the leadership right now provides that,\" said Harrison, who says he trusts Martin and believes support, from donors and otherwise, will return after Democratic wins on Tuesday.",
      "\"I'm not overly concerned. If we were in June of '26 and we're still not getting major donors, then I'm concerned. But we're not there yet,\" he added, expressing confidence in the continued grassroots support.",
      "Some Democrats also point to Martin's tenure as one that prioritizes infrastructure. For example, state parties now get major influxes of cash, to the tune of a million dollars a month, to hire staff, set up programs, and fortify their ranks. \"Party changing money,\" adds Schneider. Lauren Nechochea, chair of the Idaho Democrats, told ABC News her chapter now has steady, monthly financial support.",
      "Texas Rep. Gene Wu, chair of the Lone Star State House Democratic caucus, said Jefferies and Martin gave his cohort full support to break quorum and attempt to block Republican redistricting efforts, a move that kicked off the party's more aggressive opposition to redistricting nationwide.",
      "Wu acknowledges that the perception of the Democratic Party is in peril, and is anxious for politicians to openly fight for the working class. He says voters, friends see Democrats as message-less, scolding hall monitors.",
      "\"People who would rather be right than win; people who would rather spend the time to tell other people how they're wrong instead of telling people what they would do about it and how they're going to fix it,\" Wu told ABC News.",
      "Wu said candidates need to be firmer on their beliefs, and his party must run candidates willing to take Republicans to task (like California's Gov. Newsom in his push to draw Democratic friendly maps) or face total failure.",
      "\"I think that the reality of where we are today and what the cost of failure will mean, I don't think people are under any illusion of where we are at this moment,\" said Wu, who added, \"this is not time for us to screw around ... I don't give a crap that you think Democrats are wimpy or whatever else. But if you want America to not suck anymore, you better join us.\"",

    "summary": "Newsom is a leader running miles ahead of others, experts explained to ABC News.",
    "story": [
      "Newsom has discarded Democrats' \"when they go low, we go high\" mantra.",
      "At the beginning of the year, California Gov. Gavin Newsom's tenure was marked by devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, a steady stream of ridicule from the White House, and backlash from within the Democratic Party for siding with conservatives on transgender athletes in women's sports.",
      "Not to mention, in the summer of 2021, Newsom weathered a blistering attempt to recall him from office -- his starpower at risk.",
      "Yet the twice-elected governor has pulled off a reputational heel turn, marked by viral Trump-mocking social media posts and parody MAGA merch coupled with a statewide redistricting measure that would level Republican's attempt to get an edge ahead of next year's midterms.",
      "Now, Newsom is a leader running miles ahead of others, experts explained to ABC News.",
      "One of the most noticeable transformations was the rebrand of Newsom's official governor social media account. A senior Newsom official told ABC that the weekend of June 6, when the team learned the president was federalizing the National Guard into Los Angeles, was when the \"red line\" was crossed, and a more defiant version of the Democratic governor debuted.",
      "\"That is when everything changed, with the governor, with our social media,\" the official said.",
      "On June 10, Newsom's @GovPressOffice account shared a TikTok video, where a voiceover, in the style of a Star Wars villain, mimicked Trump's TruthSocial post announcing the federalization of troops. That post generated over 800,000 views.",
      "The salvo continued. The same day, Newsom, on Instagram, responded to Trump mocking him as \"Newscum\" on Truth Social with a diss-video set to the Taylor Swift (another common Trump target) song \"You Need To Calm Down,\" dismissing Trump as \"keyboard warrior.\" That short video has 11.3 million views.",
      "The mocking never let up.",
      "'Newsom Derangement Syndrome'",
      "A non-exhaustive list of the incoming includes: accusing Trump of having \"Newsom Derangement Syndrome,\" a play on Trump's oft-referred \"Trump Derangement Syndrome;\" likening Trump adviser Stephen Miller to Voldemort, the villain from the Harry Potter series, and calling him submissive; calling Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \"Kosplay Kristi\" and urging followers to \"hide yo dogs,\" a reference to Noem's infamous tale of shooting and killing her own dog, Cricket; mocking Vice President JD Vance over a debunked rumor that he performed sex acts with a couch; and comparing White House border czar Tom Homan to an uncooked ham.",
      "Since then, Newsom's social media accounts have skyrocketed. Follower counts across multiple platforms for his non-government account, @GavinNewsom, ballooned -- growing to more than 11 million followers collectively. Nearly half of those followers were new this year.",
      "One of the official accounts, @GovPressOffice, has seen nearly 1 billion impressions on X since those first provocative posts in June, per Newsom's campaign.",
      "Newsom even launched his own \"patriot\" merchandise shop, repurposing Trump's Make America Great Again slogan -- Make America Gavin Again -- and selling REAL PATRIOT hats NEWSOM WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING! And REAL PATRIOT hats, and kneepads marked with Trump's signature.",
      "A key mark in Newsom's success is upending the \"when they go low, we go high\" mantra coined by Michelle Obama in 2016, suggested Parker Butler, the former director of Kamala Harris' presidential campaign's buzzy social media channel, @KamalaHQ. \"That is not where we are right now.\"",
      "'It feels very unrestrained'",
      "\"When we see democracy hanging by a thread, we have to take risks. It feels very unrestrained, that's the kind of energy that I think Democrats need,\" said Butler, now a digital strategist and co-founder at Luminary Strategies.",
      "\"We need to throw the sort of old rulebook out the window,\" Butler added.",
      "When Newsom launched his new solo podcast \"This is Gavin Newsom\" in March, he said he wanted to \"debate without demeaning\" and engage with people most members his party wouldn't dare to speak to. He called the Democratic brand \"toxic.\" He's positioned himself as a lefty alternative in the GOP-de-jour manosphere space. His interview with Charlie Kirk, for instance, has 1.3 million YouTube views.",

Julianna was outraged with Newsom at the start of the year, in part due to his right-wing podcast guests, but she now considers herself a huge fan -- she's even bought his merch.",
      "\"I did not take Gavin Newsom seriously until he made it clear that he was ready to take action,\" Julianna added.",
      "'Holding a mirror to the clown show'",
      "Newsom's longtime speechwriter and former deputy chief of staff Jason Eliott described the online mockery as a strategy of \"holding up a mirror to the clown show that is the Trump administration. We're not doing anything differently than what they are doing.\"",
      "Elliott said the buzz around Newsom's posts creates space for the \"actual substantive work,\" like Proposition 50, the ballot initiative that, if approved by voters on Tuesday,\u00a0will temporarily adopt a new congressional map that redraws five districts to be more Democratic-leaning, potentially flipping five existing Republican seats in the midterms. Elliott said that since the office has sharpened its tone, donations have poured in from millions of supporters.",
      "\"How do you get 1.2 million people from all 50 states all across the country to buy into this defense of democracy? You do it by getting attention,\" Eliott said.",
      "Newsom, in a recent interview with ABC News' Jonathan Karl, concurred.",
      "\"We're trying to have a little humor in this process as well, and we're fighting fire with fire, not just rhetorically, in the context of that back and forth, but substantively, we can get into the 43 lawsuits, we can get in the work we're trying to do on Prop 50,\" Newsom explained.",
      "John Dennis, former chair of the San Francisco Republican Party, said Newsom's tactic is the latest iteration of what he and other critics call a history of \"shapeshifting.\"",
      "\"He doesn't know who he is. So he's trying to be everybody else,\" Dennis said.",
      "But he admits it appears to be working.",
      "\"This Prop 50 move is a very clever move for the Democrats. And he's got good people around him,\" Dennis said. \"They know that Trump is the center of the universe right now so he's just keeping his name alive and positioning himself as the Trump fighter -- and he's going to run that all the way into the Democrat primaries.\"",
      "Dan Schnur, a longtime California political analyst and UC-Berkeley professor, called the Proposition 50 campaign \"a self-delivered political gift for Newsom.\"",
      "Newsom's successes put him in a solid position to launch a presidential bid, an ambition Californians are under no illusions about.",
      "\"Every governor looks in the mirror and sees a president looking back at them, and Newsom probably whistles \"Hail to the Chief\" when he's in the shower every morning,\" Schnur said. \"It's hard to predict exactly how the race plays out, but the governor of the largest state in the country, who is also the most visible and impactful Trump critic, and who has access to tremendous amounts of fundraising dollars could be a pretty formidable contender.\"",

      "Trump won 48% of Latino voters in 2024 -- nearly as many voters as Vice President Kamala Harris. The large Latino populations of Arizona and Nevada particularly played an outsized role in boosting Trump to victory and helping him secure these critical swing states.",
      "Jennifer Benz, deputy director of the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, referenced immigration as another factor that might bring Hispanic voters back to the fringes. Much of their dissatisfaction stems from the immigration tactics being implemented, she said, even if voters are aligned with the president's views at a higher level.",
      "Black voters",
      "While Black voters remain predominantly Democratic, their support for Trump nearly doubled in 2024. Black voters were likely influenced by the economy as well, according to Ashley Konig, director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University.",
      "Yet Trump's economic promises appear to be falling short, with the Black unemployment rate climbing to 7.5% this year, its highest point since October 2021.",
      "Matthews referenced a \"notable [swing] among younger Black men\" toward Trump in 2024 -- a group that has been drifting away from the Democratic party since 2020. The way the economy shakes out over the next year is likely to influence their voting decisions, she said, similar to young Hispanic men.",
      "Marcus James, a 43-year-old from Alabama, told ABC News that he \"totally regret[s]\" voting for Trump in 2016, pointing to his identity as a Black man and criticizing the administration for their treatment of minorities.",

      "Lovette Howard, a former Democrat who voted for Harris in 2024, told ABC News that she is undecided in 2025 because she says both parties are not \"listening to what the taxpayers are saying,\" citing concerns over the economy and halts to SNAP benefits, among others.",

      "Mamdani also responded to \"shocking\" remarks by Vice President JD Vance after the mayoral candidate said his aunt felt uncomfortable riding the subway wearing her hijab after 9/11. In response to Mamdani's comments, Vance said on social media: \"According to Zohran the real victim of 9/11 was his auntie who got some (allegedly) bad looks.\"",
      "\"It is sadly unsurprising, but still shocking to see the vice president of this country try and make a cheap joke about Islamophobia when what New Yorkers want is a vision of a city that can come together,\" Mamdani said of Vance's remarks. \"And coming together means honoring every single person who calls this city their home, not trying to pit people against each other as has become the norm in both Republican politics and now we're also seeing in Democratic politics as well.\"",
      "On concerns about his candidacy from some Jewish leaders, after more than 1,000 rabbis from across the country signed a letter decrying his rhetoric on Israel, Mamdani said he has \"appreciated\" conversations he has had with rabbis and Jewish leaders in the five boroughs.",
      "\"Those are conversations that have not only informed my understanding of what it means to root out antisemitism across the city, which we must do, but also the many different ways that we have to do it,\" he said, mentioning actions such as increasing funding for hate crime prevention and implementing a curriculum that \"celebrates the breadth and the beauty of Jewish life in the history of this city.\"",
      "\"I'm looking forward to being the mayor for every New Yorker, for every Jewish New Yorker, and not just those who actually vote for me, but anyone who calls the city home,\" he said.",
      "Days before early voting kicked off in New York City, Mamdani received an endorsement from one top Democrat -- House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. -- and has yet to be endorsed by the other -- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.",
      "Asked what he makes of that, Mamdani said he appreciates Jeffries' support and that the two discussed affordability in particular.",
      "\"I also say all of this knowing that the reason I sit in a chair across from you now as the Democratic nominee is not because of the number of endorsements that I've received, but because of the movement that we've built -- 90,000 New Yorkers who've been knocking on doors, making phone calls,\" Mamdani said. \"Those are the people who've built this campaign. Those are the people who will take us across the finish line.\"",
      "Among Mamdani's affordability promises are free public buses, an increase in free childcare and frozen rents for rent-stabilized units.",

Both tax changes would need approval from state leaders, though New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has been clear that she does not intend to raise taxes on New Yorkers.",
      "Asked how he would fund his proposals if he isn't able to increase taxes, Mamdani said he would continue to push for the hikes -- which he argued would help \"Trump-proof\" New York City, following threats from President Donald Trump to take away federal funding from the city if the assemblyman, whom Trump has called a \"radical\" and \"communist,\" wins.",
      "\"I will continue to make the case as to why I think we need to increase taxes on the top 1% by 2%, why we need to raise the state's top corporate tax rate to match that of New Jersey, and in doing so, this would raise $9 billion. And that more than pays for our economic agenda and starts to actually 'Trump-proof' our city,\" he said. \"And I will make that case because I think it makes the most sense in the wealthiest city and the wealthiest country in the history of the world that we actually ensure we have the funding necessary to make it a place that New Yorkers can afford.\"",

That I'm only talking to tenants, for example, and not homeowners, that I'm only speaking to New Yorkers who live in this neighborhood as opposed to that one,\" he said.",
      "\"For me, the affordability agenda, for it to have a real, true meaning, it has to be universally applied. It means both at once freezing the rent for rent-stabilized tenants and taking on a broken property tax system. It means at the same time that we are talking about how we make buses fast and free, that we are also looking to help those New Yorkers who don't take the bus, right?\"\u00a0Mamadani said.",

      "For President Donald Trump, tariffs \u2014 or the threat of them \u2014 can bend nations to his will",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump sees tariffs \u2014 or the threat of them \u2014 as a powerful tool to bend nations to his will.",
      "He has used them in an unprecedented way, not only as the underpinning of his economic agenda, but also as the cornerstone of his foreign policy in his second term.",
      "He has wielded the import taxes as a threat to secure ceasefiresfrom countries at war. He has used them to browbeat nations into promising to do more to stop people and drugs from flowing across their borders. He has used them, in Brazil\u2019s case, as political pressure because its judicial system prosecuted a former leader who was a Trump ally, and in a recent blowup with Canada, as punishment for a television ad.",
      "This week, the Supreme Court hears arguments on whether the Republican president has overstepped federal law with many of his tariffs. A ruling against him could limit or even take away that swift and blunt leverage that much of his foreign policy has relied on.",
      "Trump increasingly has expressed agitation and anxiety about the looming decision in a case he says is one of the most important in U.S. history.",
      "He has said it would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the United States if the justices fail to overturn lower court rulings that found he went too far in using an emergency powers law to put his tariffs in place.",
      "Trump had said he wanted to take the highly unusual step of attending the arguments in person, but on Sunday said he had ruled it out, saying he didn't want to be a distraction. \u201cI wanted to go so badly \u2014 I just don\u2019t want to do anything to deflect the importance of that decision,\" he told reporters on Air Force One.",
      "The Justice Department, in its defense of the tariffs, has highlighted the expansive way Trump has used them, arguing that the trade penalties are part of his power over foreign affairs, an area where the courts should not second-guess the president.",
      "Earlier this year, two lower courts and most judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that Trump did not have power under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to set tariffs \u2014 a power the Constitution grants to Congress. Some dissenting judges on the court, though, said the 1977 law allows the president to regulate imports during emergencies without specific limitations.",
      "The courts left the tariffs in place while the Supreme Court considers the issue. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to wield them as he has tried to pressure or punish other countries on matters related \u2014 and unrelated -- to trade.",
      "\u201cThe fact of the matter is that President Trump has acted lawfully by using the tariff powers granted to him by Congress in IEEPA to deal with national emergencies and to safeguard our national security and economy,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to ultimate victory on this matter with the Supreme Court.\u201d",
      "Still, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the Trump trade team is working on contingency plans should the high court rule against the Republican administration.",
      "\u201cWe do have backup plans,\u201d Leavitt said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\" \u201cBut ultimately\u2026we are hopeful that the Supreme Court will rule on the right side of the law and do what\u2019s right for our country. The importance of this case cannot be overstated. The president must have the emergency authority to utilize tariffs.\u201d",
      "Modern presidents have used financial sanctions such as freezing assets or blocking trade, not tariffs, for their foreign policy and national security aims, said Josh Lipsky, a former Obama White House and State Department staffer who is now the international economics chair at the Atlantic Council.",
      "There are other laws that presidents can use to impose tariffs. But they require a monthslong process to justify the rates.",
      "Trump, citing the IEEPA, moves faster and more dramatically. He signs executive orders imposing new rates and fires off social media posts threatening additional import taxes, as he did in late October when he was angered by an anti-tariff television ad aired by the province of Ontario.",

      "For example, earlier this year Trump had threatened a 30% tariff on European imports, a major increase from 1.2% before he took office. Seeking to secure Trump's support for the NATO military alliance and for security guarantees for Ukraine in its war with Russia, the European Union struck a deal to settle for 15% tariffs.",

      "Trump has been able \"to use it in specific circumstances to get better deals \u2014 not just trade deals \u2014 but better deals overall than he might otherwise,\u201d Lipsky said. \u201cOn the other hand, you would say there\u2019s probably some backlash.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff strong-arming has rattled relationships with America\u2019s friends and foes. Some have responded by becoming more protectionist or looking to foster relations with China, which has tried to be seen as a promoter of free trade.",
      "There also is the impact on pocketbook. Some businesses have passed on some of the costs to consumers by raising prices, while others have waited to see where tariff rates end up.",
      "Tariffs traditionally have been used just as a tool to address trade practices.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s literally no precedent for the manner that President Trump is using them,\u201d said Emily Kilcrease, who was a deputy assistant U.S. trade representative and earlier worked on trade issues at the National Security Council as a career civil servant during the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations,",
      "\u201cThe use of tariffs the way that President Trump is using them is like \u2014 just broadscale attack on an economy as a way to incentivize a foreign government to change their posture,\u201d said Kilcrease, now a director at the Center for a New American Security think tank.",
      "But she said the case is not clear-cut. Kilcrease said she thinks there is a \u201cdecent chance\u201d the Supreme Court could side with Trump because IEEPA gives the president \u201cbroad, flexible emergency powers.\u201d",
      "The case is also coming before a Supreme Court that has thus far been reluctant to check to Trump\u2019s wide-ranging use of executive powers.",
      "If the court constrains Trump, it could leave foreign governments questioning whether to try to renegotiate trade agreements recently struck with the Trump administration, experts said. But there are political realities at play too, because reneging on deals could affect other foreign policy or economic priorities.",
      "The administration could pivot to try to use other laws to justify the tariffs, though that could mean a more complex and bureaucratic process, Kilcrease said.",
      "\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t take tariffs off the table,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just makes them a little bit slower.\u201d",

      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- Jacqueline Chapman is a retired school aide who relies on a $630 monthly Social Security check to get by. She was navigating the loss of her federal food aid benefits when she learned the assistance she receives for heating her Philadelphia apartment may also be at risk.",
      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019m living in scary times. It\u2019s not easy to rest when you know you have things to do with limited accounts, limited funds. There isn\u2019t too much you can do,\u201d said Chapman, 74.",
      "Chapman relies on the $4.1 billion Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps millions of low-income households pay to heat and cool their homes.",
      "With temperatures beginning to drop in areas across the United States, some states are warning that funding for the program is being delayed because of the federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week.",
      "The anticipated delay comes as a majority of the 5.9 million households served by the federally funded heating and cooling assistance program are grappling with the sudden postponement of benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries. Money is running out for other safety net programs as well and energy prices are soaring.",
      "\u201cThe impact, even if it\u2019s temporary, on many of the nation\u2019s poor families is going to be profound if we don\u2019t solve this problem,\u201d said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which represents state directors of the program. Commonly called LIHEAP, it serves all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and federally recognized tribes.",
      "\u201cThese are important income supports that are all potentially heading toward a cliff at the same time,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t point to a similar time in recent history where we\u2019ve had this.\u201d",
      "LIHEAP, created in 1981, assists families in covering utility bills or the cost of paying for fuels delivered to homes, such as home heating oil. It has received bipartisan congressional support for decades.",
      "States manage the program. They receive an allotment of federal money each year based on a formula that largely takes into account state weather patterns, energy costs and low-income population data.",
      "While President Donald Trump proposed zero funding for the program in his budget, it was anticipated that Congress would fund LIHEAP for the budget year that began Oct. 1. But since Congress has not yet passed a full 2026 spending bill, states have not gotten their new allocations yet.",
      "Some states, including Kansas, Pennsylvania, New York and Minnesota, have announced their LIHEAP programs are being delayed by the government shutdown.",
      "In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro\u2019s administration said it cannot front the $200 million-plus in federal LIHEAP aid it had expected to help pay heating bills for some 300,000 low-income households. It is predicting payments will not go out until at least December, instead of November, as is customary.",
      "Minnesota\u2019s energy assistance program is processing applications but the state\u2019s Department of Commerce said federal LIHEAP dollars will likely be delayed by a month. The agency does not plan to pay recipients\u2019 heating bills until the shutdown ends.",
      "\u201cAs temperatures begin to drop, this delay could have serious impacts,\u201d the agency said. The program services 120,000 households, both homeowners and renters, that include many older adults, young children and people with disabilities.",
      "Connecticut has enough money to set aside to pay heating bills through at least the end of November or December, according to the group that helps administer LIHEAP. But the program faces uncertainty if the shutdown persists. Connecticut lawmakers are considering covering the cost temporarily with state budget reserves.",
      "\u201cThe situation will get much more perilous for folks who do need those resources as we move later into the heating season,\u201d said Rhonda Evans, executive director of the Connecticut Association for Community Action. More than 100,000 households were served last year.",

      "Chapman, the retired school aide, may be eligible for a program through her gas utility to prevent being shut off this winter. But the roughly 9% of LIHEAP recipients who rely on deliverable fuels such as heating oil, kerosene, propane and wood pellets, typically do not have such protections.",
      "Electric and natural gas companies are usually regulated by the state and can be told not to shut people off while the state waits to receive its share of the LIHEAP money, Wolfe said. But it is different when it involves a small oil or propane company, fuels more common in the Northeast.",

      "He has been approved this year for $500 in assistance but he has a half tank of oil left and cannot call for more until it is nearly empty. By that point, he is hoping there will be enough federal money left to fill it. He typically needs three deliveries to get through a winter.",

      "At the end of his talks with Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang, Hegseth handed over a leather box, a belt and a small knife \u2014 wartime artifacts once taken by U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- The nation's largest police fleet of Tesla Cybertrucks is set to begin patrolling the streets of Las Vegas in November thanks to a donation from a U.S. tech billionaire, raising concerns about the blurring of lines between public and private interests.",
      "\u201cWelcome to the future of policing,\u201d Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill said during a recent press conference, surrounded by the Cybertrucks while drones hovered overhead and a police helicopter circled above him.",
      "The fleet of 10 black-and-white Cybertrucks of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department with flashing lights and sirens are wrapped with the police department\u2019s logo. About 400 officers have been trained to operate the trucks that will use public charging stations.",
      "The all-electric vehicles are equipped with shotguns, shields and ladders and additional battery capacity to better handle the demands of a police department, McMahill said.",
      "The donation has raised concerns from government oversight experts about private donors\u2019 influence on public departments and the boost to the Tesla brand. The department is the latest U.S. city to turn to Tesla models even as Elon Musk \u2019s electric vehicle company has faced blowback because of his work earlier in the year to advance the president\u2019s political agenda and downsize the federal government.",
      "McMahill noted the trucks will help keep officers safer because they are bulletproof, while Metro\u2019s other squad cars are not. Each Cybertruck is valued at somewhere between $80,000 and $115,000 and will be used to respond to calls like barricades and shootings in addition to regular patrols.",

      "A Michigan defense lawyer is disputing FBI allegations that his 20-year-old client and four others planned a terror attack on Halloween weekend",
      "A Michigan defense lawyer is disputing FBI Director Kash Patel's allegations that his 20-year-old client and four other young suspects were planning to carry out a terror attack on Halloween weekend.",
      "Announcing their arrests on Friday, Patel said more information would be coming soon, however the FBI and Michigan authorities have offered few details about the case. Spokespersons for the state and national FBI and the U.S. Attorney in Detroit did not immediately respond to messages Saturday.",
      "The investigation involved discussion in an online chat room involving at least some of the suspects who were taken into custody, according to two people briefed on the investigation who could not publicly discuss details. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The group allegedly discussed carrying out an attack around Halloween, referring to \u201cpumpkin day,\u201d according to one of the people. The other person briefed on the investigation confirmed that there had been a \u201cpumpkin\u201d reference.",
      "However, lawyer Amir Makled, who represents a man from the suburb of Dearborn who was still detained on Saturday, said federal authorities haven't given him many details about the investigation but after reviewing the matter, he concluded that no terror event was planned. He said he doesn\u2019t expect any charges will be filed.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know where this hysteria and this fearmongering came from,\u201d Makled said.",
      "He described the all-male group of U.S. citizens as gamers, and said they range in age from 16 to 20.",
      "\u201cIf these young men were on forums that they should not have been on or things of that nature, then we\u2019ll have to wait and see,\u201d Makled said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s anything illegal about any of the activity they were doing.\u201d",

      "Investigators allege the plan was inspired by Islamic State group extremism. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if they had the means to carry out an attack, but the reference to Halloween prompted the FBI to make arrests Friday, one of the people familiar with the investigation told the AP.",

    "story": [
      "A recent FBI-led raid at an Idaho race track shows how immigration is driving federal law enforcement under the Trump administration",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- The first sign something was amiss was the thwack of helicopter rotors overhead, followed by screams. Within moments, Anabel Romero was on the ground with her hands restrained behind her, she said, as law enforcement officers brandishing guns removed her 14-year-old daughter from a nearby truck and zip-tied the teen while her young siblings looked on.",
      "Romero and her daughter, both U.S. citizens, were among about 400 people detained for hours at a privately owned race track about an hour west of Boise as part an FBI-led investigation into illegal gambling that resulted in more than 100 arrests, nearly all for immigration violations.",
      "Romero isn't sure what agency the officers who zip-tied her daughter were from. More than 200 officers from at least 14 agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Border Patrol, as well as local police, participated in the raid at La Catedral Arena.",
      "The Oct. 19 operation is a striking example of how immigration has become a major driver across federal law enforcement, demonstrating a previously unheard of level of coordination to address President Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportation agenda. It also shows how immigration dragnets marked by a heavy use of force have entangled U.S. citizens and legal residents.",
      "The raid on La Catedral Arena struck nerves in Canyon County, which has the most Hispanic residents in Idaho and where Trump got 72% of the vote last year.",
      "Five families interviewed by The Associated Press said officers zip-tied children as young as 11. They said an 8-year-old boy got glass in his mouth as he screamed while officers broke his car window. Several children were separated from family members for hours.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees Border Patrol and ICE, denied that children were zip-tied. FBI spokesperson Sandra Barker initially said no restraints or rubber bullets were used on children but later amended that statement, replacing \u201cchildren\u201d with \u201cyoung children.\u201d",
      "Four people at the track, and a fifth the next day, were arrested on gambling charges, while 105 others were detained on immigration violations.",
      "John Carter, a track security guard, said he was placed in zip ties and lost circulation in his hands before an FBI agent loosened them. Carter said officers used flash-bang devices, pointed guns at people, and deployed a pepper bomb in a vehicle where someone tried to hide.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s OK to take your family to a public event. Just because there\u2019s 10 people in a crowd doing something illegal, that doesn\u2019t make everyone in that crowd illegal,\u201d Carter said. \u201cYes, I voted for Trump, I\u2019m not ashamed to say it. But I don\u2019t like the way this was handled and the claims they are making.\u201d",
      "FBI Special Agent Jacob Sheridan said in court documents that the people charged worked on a pari-mutuel betting operation, although the track did not have a state license for that, only for horse racing.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security Department spokeswoman, said, \u201cICE dismantled an illegal horse-racing, animal fighting, and a gambling enterprise operation.\u201d However, court documents make no mention of animal fighting. She later added that ICE did not restrain or arrest children.",
      "Canyon County Sheriff Kieran Donahue and Caldwell Police Chief Rex Ingram said in a joint statement that it was \u201ccompletely false\u201d and \u201cdeeply misleading\u201d for ICE to take credit, noting the FBI's leadership and the involvement of a local task force.",
      "Other examples of how immigration has become a focus in anti-crime operations include a sting involving the FBI in October that targeted illegal street vending in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown, as well as recent efforts in Memphis, Tennessee. During Trump's law enforcement surge in Washington, D.C., touted as focusing on crime, about 40% of the first 2,300 arrests were immigration-related.",
      "During the Idaho operation, many officers did not appear to have any identifying marks or department names on their uniforms. Some wore masks. State and local agencies either denied restraining children or did not return calls seeking comment.",
      "Several people told the AP that ICE officers removed their restraints once they were put in line for immigration processing, and court documents say ICE was brought in after the initial search warrant was executed.",
      "Romero said that when she was unnerved about being separated from her children for hours, an agent laughed and said, \u201cWe\u2019re taking better care of them.\u201d",
      "Several days later, Romero said her daughter\u2019s bruises were still visible. Her 6- and 8-year-old woke up screaming each night. When the family drove past a police cruiser, her youngest \u201cfreaked out.\u201d",

      "Duran-Villa wasn't zip-tied because she was carrying her 14-month-old child. The baby was hungry and needed a diaper change, but the milk and diapers were in her car.",
      "\u201cAlready like 2 1/2 hours had passed, and that\u2019s why I was asking so many times, \u2018Can I go get my diaper bag to get my baby some milk?\u2019 They kept ignoring me, or saying to ask another officer,\u201d she said. \u201cThe baby was crying the whole time.\u201d",

      "Venice can feel like a movie set, particularly when riding on a boat down the Grand Canal with George Clooney.",
      "Waving to fans, he's asked if that ever gets normal. \"No,\" he replied.",
      "Clooney has practice navigating this kind of attention. He's made about 50 films, picking up a couple of Academy Awards along the way (as an actor for \"Syriana,\" and as a producer for \"Argo\"). And for his latest, \"Jay Kelly,\" he plays one of the world's biggest movie stars \u2013 a familiar role.",
      "He says it's true that he said yes to the film within 24 hours. \"Well, I read it, and I was like, Well, if I take time to think of it, they might go get Brad. And I can't have that. I can't have that, man! When you read something, you know.\"",
      "Co-starring Adam Sandler and Laura Dern, the Netflix film \u2013 part comedy, part drama \u2013 critiques the cult of celebrity, as Clooney's character embarks on a journey to reconcile his professional success and personal failings.",
      "I asked, \"There's this kind of mind-bending experience where you're watching the film and you're wondering how much is the character and how much is George Clooney. Did you feel that making it?\"",
      "\"I really didn't,\" Clooney said. \"You know, what I know in life is you can live with failure. I tried this, it didn't work out. What you can't live with is regret. Jay Kelly is filled with regret. I mean, if I get hit by a bus tomorrow, I have no regrets. I've certainly made mistakes. I've certainly done some dumb things. But I took a big bite at the apple, and I really took big swings.\"",
      "\"Were there things that felt autobiographical?\"",
      "\"I mean, there's things that we would laugh about, you know, playing a guy who no one says 'no' to.\"",
      "\"And that's the case for you?\"",
      "\"Well, I designed it so that that's not the case.\"",
      "How? \"I pay people!\" he laughed. \"No, I designed it by surrounding myself with the same friends that I met when I was 20 years old \u2026 I talk to them every day.\"",
      "\"Do you go out of your way to understand that there is this perceived gap between you and others?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Clooney said. \"I didn't grow up around fame. I mean, my father was a newscaster in Cincinnati, Ohio. My aunt [Rosemary Clooney] was a famous singer, but I'd met her three times. So, when I met someone famous, I was always like, Oh my God! And so, I always try to remind people that, honest to God, this is the job that I do and that, you know, we're all fairly normal.\"",
      "\"Why is that so important to you?\" I asked.",
      "\"I think because I was raised not only that you treat everyone equally, but that everyone treats you equally as well.\"",
      "Clooney is pretty disarming, as we saw while setting up the interview. Asked if he wanted to check how he looked in the camera, he smiled: \"No, I don't care. I'm too old to give a s*** anymore.\"",
      "\"You are, for many, kind of the poster man of aging gracefully.\"",
      "\"That's why I'm wearing these glasses,\" Clooney said, \"because for the record, I have a horrible sinus infection. If I take these off ...\" He demonstrated for us. \"You see the problem?\"",
      "\"How much does aging factor in \u2026 Do you see parts changing?\"",
      "\"I see parts on my body changing,\" he replied. \"I'm like, that fell off? How'd that fall off?\"",
      "\"I didn't mean that.\"",
      "\"Oh sure, parts have changed significantly.\"",
      "He's 64 now, married to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin. The two juggle Hollywood glamour with social justice work through their foundation. They have eight-year-old twins, and the actor (once famously single) says family life suits him \u2013 another thing that sets him apart from this character. \"Fame, [Jay] actually does really well. And I'm kind of the opposite of that in a way.\"",
      "What do you mean? \"I feel I'm a better parent, I hope, certainly husband. And fame, if there was one of the two, that would be the one I'm least comfortable with.\"",
      "\"Wow, you seem to be quite comfortable with fame and celebrity,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, you know, you got to put on your famous outfit when you come here to do a film premiere.\"",
      "\"But you know everywhere you go, people watch you. Is it performative?\"",
      "\"Sometimes it's performative,\" Clooney replied. \"I mean, listen, you don't get caught picking your nose, you know? You have to be more aware than other people would be.\"",
      "I asked, \"You seem to have this desire to keep some things for yourself, but then you can also be very political and really stick yourself out there.\"",
      "\"Sometimes, yeah,\" Clooney said. \"I try to do it when I think I have a responsibility to it. My father always told me to challenge people with more power than you, and protect people with less power. One of the things you understand is, you can't take on every fight. You have to pick things. I worked on trying to help solve some of the problems in Darfur in the early 2000s. Failed. You fail more often than you succeed. But it doesn't mean you don't keep trying. We still work there, we're still involved.\"",
      "He also does not regret writing that opinion piece in The New York Times, urging President Biden to drop out. \"To not do it would be to say I'm not going to tell the truth,\" he said.",
      "While Clooney does not shy from public activism, he gets some help guarding his private life at the family's place in Italy: \"Italian towns adopt you, Like, people come up and say, 'Which house is George Clooney's?' They go, 'Hey, he doesn't live here, he doesn't.' They protect you.\"",
      "Right now, Clooney considers France home. \"We live on a 750-acre farm, and our kids run around. We wanted them to have something of a normal existence.\"",
      "\"And you find that on a 750-acre ranch?\"",
      "\"Well, you find it on a farm, and you find on a very small school and very sort of farming community. We found a real peace there.\"",
      "He prizes that peace. In the film, Jay Kelly is searching for what George Clooney already has: a sense of self and balance. Clooney really does seem to have it all.",
      "I said, \"If people say, What was it like being with George Clooney? One of the things I'm going to say is, well, I was sitting here sweating, and somehow he didn't seem to sweat.\"",
      "\"I don't sweat!\" Clooney laughed. \"It's a funny thing. I don't sweat much when I'm on camera, funnily enough. I don't know why. I put ice cubes under my arms!\"",
      "But like the rest of us, he still has to contend with the passing of time. \"I want to work, but I don't want to fill my life with work,\" he said. \"When I turned 60, Amal and I talked about it, and I said, 'Look, I can still play basketball with the boys, I can still hang out. But in 25 years I'll be 85. And that's a real number.'",
      "\"And things change, and it doesn't matter how many granola bars you eat; it catches you. So, we have to focus on making sure we work. We also have to have focus on spending time with the people we love. More time, because at the end of your life, you don't go, I wish I'd worked more.\"",

      "Life has changed since the 2022 attack that nearly killed him. \"I think what has changed is, for public-facing things, then there has to be security in a way that there wasn't for 20 years,\" he said.",
      "On August 12, 2022, Rushdie was on stage in Chautauqua, N.Y., ready to speak, ironically about America as a safe haven for writers. A man lunged at him with a knife.",
      "His account of the attack, \"Knife,\" was published in 2024: \"I raise my left hand in self-defense. He plunges the knife into it. ... After that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere. I feel my legs give way, and I fall.\"",
      "Rushdie lost the sight in his right eye. \"I can still read,\" he said, \"but I do find that I use iPads in a way that I never used to. Because there's light, and because I can adjust the size of the type. So, I never, ever, read a book on an iPad, but now I do.\"",
      "His left hand and liver were badly damaged, but he lived, which he considers \"a miracle.\"",
      "In May of this year, Rushdie's attacker, Lebanese-American Hadi Matar, was sentenced to 25 years in prison.

      "Recognized just for his fiction before, suddenly Rushdie was world famous (to some, infamous) for the fatwa. After nearly a decade in hiding, protected 24/7 by British security, Rushdie emerged and moved to New York, thinking times had changed. But he was wrong.",
      "Yet the author does not seem bitter or angry. \"I think that's who I am,\" he said.",
      "I suggested, \"Most people would say, well, this is a clear recipe for a life with PTSD.\"",
      "\"Well, I do have a therapist,\" Rushdie said, \"and I asked him at one point to list for me the symptoms of PTSD. And I said, 'But I don't seem to be having those symptoms, so what's wrong with me?' And he said, 'Well, it's because you're a bad-ass, that's the technical term.'\"",
      "The new book is the first fiction he's published since the attack.",
      "So, why \"The Eleventh Hour\"? \"Well, for a start, I'm 78,\" he said. \"For another thing, I had a fairly intimate encounter with death, you know, and got away with it. But it makes you think, you know? So, I thought this idea of running out of time was something I had on the brain.\"",
      "\"It's a hard time in America\"",
      "\"Now you have entered the magic space of my childhood,\" the fictional narrator of one story says, as he takes a last walk up the hill to the neighborhood where the real Salman Rushdie grew up, in Mumbai, India (which he still calls Bombay). \"My relationship with the place is kind of elegiac now,\" Rushdie said. It's a relationship about something that has passed.",
      "He left India for an English boarding school at the age of 13. He left Britain after nearly 40 years there. He became an American citizen in 2016. Rushdie sees his place in the world through the eye of an immigrant.",
      "Asked what he felt after becoming a U.S. citizen, Rushdie said, \"I remember getting into a cab, leaving the office where I'd been sworn in, and being driven back through the streets of the city, and it felt different. I thought, Oh, I can belong. And it felt very good.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did the feeling that you had when you were sworn in as a citizen become fractured or altered based on what's happened since, both in public life in the United States, and to you?\"",
      "\"It's a hard time in America, but it's a hard time all over,\" he replied. \"If you think of countries as people, there is their better self and their less-good self. And it would be nice if this country were to remember its better self.\"",
      "\"The Eleventh Hour\" includes a ghost story, characters who get even, a writer who disappears. But the book is also political. He writes: \"Words such as good and bad or right and wrong are losing their effect, emptying of meaning, and failing anymore to shape society.\"",
      "The meaning of words matters to Rushdie, who has spent his entire career advocating for free speech, even though exercising it nearly got him killed.",
      "He said, \"The final story in the collection, 'The Old Man in the Piazza,' is kind of an allegory of that. In fact, free speech, to my great surprise, language itself, turned into a character, a female character. She just walked into the story and sat down in a corner, and I hadn't expected her at all.\"",
      "\"She is in fact a very old language, one of the oldest and richest\u2026\" he writes, in a story about what happens when speech is restricted. \"It's even possible, though it's hard for her to admit this, even to herself, that she may die. Nobody's listening. Nobody cares.\"",
      "Language abandons her corner, leaving people no longer able to speak:\u00a0\"We are at a loss to know how things will proceed. Our words fail us.\"",
      "\"That's pretty startling and scary,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah,\" Rushdie agreed. \"It's supposed to be.\"",

      "From \"In the South\"",
      "The day Junior fell down began like any other day: the explosion of heat rippling the air, the trumpeting sun\u00adlight, the traffic's tidal surges, the prayer chants in the distance, the cheap film music rising up from the floor below, the pelvic thrusts of an \"item number\" dancing across a neigh\u00adbor's TV; a child's cry, a mother's rebuke, unexplained laughter, scarlet expectorations, bicycles, the newly plaited hair of school\u00adgirls, the smell of strong coffee, a green wing flashing in a tree. Senior and Junior, two very old men, opened their eyes in their bedrooms on the fourth floor of a sea-green building on a leafy lane, just out of sight of Elliot's Beach, where, that evening, the young would congregate, as they always did, to perform the rites of youth, not far from the village of the fisherfolk, who had no time for such frivolity. The poor were puritans by night and day. As for the old, they had rites of their own and did not need to wait for evening. With the sun stabbing at them through their window blinds, the two old men struggled to their feet and lurched out onto their adjacent verandas, emerging at the same moment, like characters in an ancient tale, trapped in fateful coincidences, unable to escape the consequences of chance.",
      "Almost at once they began to speak. Their words were not new. These were ritual speeches, obeisances to the new day, of\u00adfered in call-and-response format, like the rhythmic dialogues or \"duels\" of the virtuosi of Carnatic music during the annual December festival.",
      "\"Be thankful we are men of the south,\" said Junior, stretch\u00ading and yawning. \"Southerners are we, in the south of our city in the south of our country in the south of our continent. God be praised. We are warm, slow, and sensual guys, not like the cold fishes of the north.\"",
      "Senior, scratching first his belly and then the back of his neck, contradicted him at once. \"In the first place,\" he said, \"the south is a fiction, existing only because men have agreed to call it that. Suppose men had imagined the earth the other way up! We would be the northerners then. The universe does not under\u00adstand up and down; neither does a dog. To a dog there is no north and south. And in the second place, you're not that warm a character, and a woman would laugh to hear you call yourself sensual\u2014but you are slow, that is beyond a doubt.\"",
      "This was how they were: they fought, going at each other like ancient wrestlers whose left feet were tied together at the ankles. The rope that bound them so tightly was their name. By a curious chance\u2014which they had come to think of as \"des\u00adtiny,\" or, as they more often called it, a \"curse\"\u2014they shared a name, a long name like so many names of the south, a name neither of them cared to speak. By banishing the name, by re\u00adducing it to its initial letter, V., they made the rope invisible, which did not mean it did not exist. They echoed each other in other ways\u2014their voices were high, they were of similarly wiry build and medium height, they were both nearsighted, and, after lifetimes of priding themselves on the quality of their teeth, they had both surrendered to the humiliating inevitabil\u00adity of dentures\u2014but it was the unused name, that symmetrical V., the Name That Could Not Be Spoken, that had joined them together for decades.",
      "The two old men did not share a birthday, however. One was seventeen days older than the other. That must have been how \"Senior\" and \"Junior\" got started, even though the nicknames had been in use for so long that nobody could now remember who originally thought them up. V. Senior and Junior they had become, Junior V. and Senior V. forevermore, quarreling to the death. They were eighty-one years old. If old age was thought of as an evening, ending in midnight oblivion, they were well into the eleventh hour.",
      "\"You look terrible,\" Junior told Senior, as he did every morn\u00ading. \"You look like a man who is only waiting to die.\"",
      "Senior\u2014nodding gravely, and also speaking in accordance with their private tradition\u2014responded, \"That is better than looking, as you do, like a man who is still waiting to live.\"",

      "K\u014cRERO: THE PAST IS THE FUTURE",
      "I'd opened my share of graves before finding something of value: a pendant in the shape of a fishhook, carved from greenstone. Greenstone only came from Aotearoa, the land our people had fled before we ended up on this island. The pendant, when held to the sun, glowed soft and green as dawn through miro trees. I was of the third generation born on this island, but the pendant was from our ancestors, from before. My father said a fishhook necklace had a special meaning: it ensured seafarers safe passage over water. To wear the pendant, I braided a cord from the inner bark of a hibiscus branch, which produced a fiber so strong, even parrots couldn't bite through it.",
      "Unpleasant as it was, and offensive to our ancestors, I was ready to open more graves.",
      "Still, I had other duties to perform. I was up each morning before dawn to hunt birds. Pigeons in planting season, t\u016b\u012b birds when the flax blossomed. This time of year, it was parrots. They arrived on our island in closely bonded flocks, and it was these social connections we'd exploit to ensnare them. When our ancestors landed on this island, it was so full of birds, they named it Manumotu, or Bird Island. If only that were still the case. These days, we'd quietly crouch all morning, ready to trigger our snares, in the hopes of catching a bird or two. The worst part was the silence. I'm the talkative type. My mother says I was born speaking, which is why she named me K\u014drero. Only after hours of silent birding was I free to open graves with my best friend Hine. The two of us could talk all day.",
      "Hine's duties, unlike mine, were endless. She'd been but a girl when her mother died and she was given to an older, childless woman named Tiri. But after a few years, when Tiri went blind, it was Hine who became the caretaker. Tiri was one of the most amazing persons in the world \u2014 I admit I only knew eighty-four people \u2014 but Hine, like me, was sixteen years old, and nobody likes it when they have to do something. And Hine had to do everything for Tiri.",
      "After birding on the morning this story begins, I arrived at our island's cove to continue digging. Many people trapped on this island before us were buried around the cove. This was considered a good resting place because of the view and the breeze and because this was where birds landed after open-water voyages. Where'd the birds come from? I always wondered. Where'd they fly off to?",
      "I tethered my parrots to a branch. One was named Aroha \u2014 it was she who lured the wild parrots into our traps. I'd tug on Aroha's tether, she'd squawk in distress, and wild parrots would come to her aid.",
      "\"I ohiti r\u0101,\" I said to Aroha. \"I ohiti p\u014d.\"",
      "This was a fisherman's adage, shortened to fit a bird's memory. Alert by day, the saying went. Alert by night. My father was a fisherman.",
      "I knew from old stories that parrots could be made to talk, though I'd had no luck at it.",
      "The other parrot was freshly caught. We'd named her Kanokano \u2014 the complications she caused are soon to be described.",
      "With only a digging stick and a basket, I picked a likely spot on the upper beach and began moving sand. If only our ancestors had thought to mark their graves. But I suppose they didn't imagine being exhumed by their great-granddaughters. I ran into a lot of mangrove roots, which I hacked with the jagged edge of a mussel shell. By the time Hine and Tiri arrived, I was sweating.",
      "\"What's the ocean like today?\" Tiri asked. Her pearled-over gaze was directed at nothing.",
      "Hine rolled her eyes and helped the old woman onto a mat before handing her her weaving.",
      "\"It's blue, it's wet,\" Hine said impatiently. \"The waves go up and down.\" I described for Tiri how late-morning light penetrated the cove, illuminating the humps of mullet, how the distant reef-break frothed like coconut pulp, how sputtering waves reached up the beach before fingering all the little shells in retreat.",
      "Hine half-heartedly stabbed at some sand with her stick.",
      "I asked, \"Did you hear the Toki brothers found an earring in a grave?\" I was arm-deep in the hole, fighting roots.",
      "\"The Toki brothers are insufferable,\" Hine said. She made a gesture to help me, but looking in the hole saw I was already to the point where smelly water was seeping in.",
      "\"The earring was greenstone,\" I said. \"From the old world. I bet one of the brothers brings it to you. Will it be the big, handsome, doltish one? Or the big, handsome, inane one?\"",
      "\"Don't make fun of me,\" Hine said. \"You'll have to marry the one I reject. And have his baby.\"",
      "The Toki brothers were slow-witted, trusting, and humorless. But their father was charismatic and funny, and the truth was, Hine had a parent-crush on him. It was quite possible that when the marriage ban was lifted, she'd marry a Toki brother just to become the daughter of Papa Toki.",
      "Tiri took a breath. She always did that before beginning a story. While Hine had no patience for the old tales, I could hear them all day. Today was the story of Paikea, who was one of the navigators who discovered Aotearoa. He was from a place called Hawaiki. Tiri didn't start in the obvious places, like Paikea's departure from Hawaiki or his arrival at Aotearoa. She didn't start with Paikea sinking a canoe and drowning his seventy enemies. Nor with him being saved by a whale. Instead, she started that epic tale with a little moment: Paikea, succumbing both to vanity and shame, as he groomed his hair with a forbidden comb.",
      "All the while, Tiri did her weaving \u2014 her fingers displaying their own kind of sight.",
      "My hole reached the point where sand fell in as fast as I scooped it out. Hine scrunched her nose. It's probably clear that Hine's heart really wasn't into digging up graves. She could barely bring herself to touch any bones, and when she did, she was afraid they might belong to her mother, even though we knew her mother was buried up the hill, above the k\u016bmara fields. We'd both been there when she was put in the ground. Still, one person's bones can look like another's, which can look like anybody's, which might as well be your mother's. I hoped Hine would change her outlook when she finally found something of value in a grave.",
      "That's when my digging stick made the unmistakable knock of wood striking bone.",
      "Tiri paused her story. I reached into the dark water and felt something in the muck. Hine winced, afraid of what I'd pull out. \"I'm sorry, ancestor,\" I said. Then, with a sucking sound, I tugged out a dog skull. I reached back for its jaw, but the mud offered only bird bones and broken shells.",
      "\"Another junk pit,\" Hine said, and started pushing sand back into the hole.",
      "I contemplated the skull. Since we'd begun digging up the dead, I'd come across many dog remains. Did they happen to die at the same time as our ancestors? Were they slain and buried alongside? Or was it something else altogether? No living person on the island had ever seen a dog, and before we started digging, it was thought that dogs had never even been here.",
      "\"What is it?\" Tiri asked.",
      "\"Another dog skull,\" Hine said. \"Look at those teeth. Who'd want to get close to one of those things, let alone share the afterlife with it?\"",
      "\"Dogs had white fur, soft as t\u016b\u012b feathers,\" Tiri said. \"The old stories say they'd lick your face.\"",
      "\"They supposedly had long tongues,\" I said, marveling at the skull. Hine shook her head. \"You don't believe every story you hear, do you?\" Hine knew that I did, indeed, believe every story I heard.",
      "\"There's only one thing we know for sure about dogs,\" Hine said. \"They must've tasted good.\"",
      "What interested me was the size of a dog's eye sockets. K\u0101k\u0101 parrots also had large eyes. In fact, the eyes of a parrot were quite intelligent and expressive. \"Ancestors are supposed to be wise,\" I said. \"But they didn't leave us a single dog.\"",
      "Hine eyed its fangs. \"I'm glad they're gone.\"",
      "\"Parrots have sharp beaks,\" I said. \"And they're friendly.\" Hine took the skull and threw it.",
      "\"One of these days, you'll lose a finger to those birds,\" she said.",
      "Already, I've forgotten some stuff. That's how bad a storyteller I am. I should've mentioned that I was absolutely forbidden from teaching my parrots human words, that Hine had a father who was alive and walking around our island \u2014 we just didn't know his identity. That Papa Toki had lost an arm, with my mother and Tiri being the ones who cut it off.",
      "But it's too late, the story's begun. Aroha looked toward the cove, spread her wings, and began screeching. We turned. Drifting in past the reef was the largest waka canoe imaginable. It had two hulls and rocked silently with the waves. Most canoes in the old stories were waka taua, war canoes. This one seemed empty \u2014 not a person or a paddle or a sail was visible. We beheld its pitched bows and soaring mast. Most ominously, the symbol of a death-bringing frigate bird was carved down its side. Then we heard it: upon the spar was a large parrot with a crimson body. It had spread its wings and was screeching back.",
      "\"What is it?\" Tiri asked. \"What's going on?\"",
      "\"We have visitors,\" Hine said. She took my hand in hers, and then she screamed.",
      "It seemed to me that, at the sound of Hine's voice, dozens of warriors would sit up in the waka and reveal themselves. I took hold of my fishhook necklace because, like the waka before me, it felt both ancient and startlingly new.",
      "Did I mention that in all our years on the island, we'd never had a visitor? As Hine's scream echoed off the cliffs, the hum of island life stopped.",
      "Silenced were the sounds of flax being beaten on the leeward shore and of our fathers excavating burial sites on the south-facing bluffs.",
      "Our fathers \u2014 all the men of Bird Island \u2014 would be here in no time.",
      "I should say the waka wasn't a total surprise. We knew something was coming. There'd been signs.",

      "Dear Reader,",
      "You are eighteen years old. Cast out by your father, shunned by society, you have fled to Geneva with your lover and your sister. The closeness of their relationship makes you furious, but if you protest, your lover will abandon you. Confined by terrible storms, you find yourself in a house with your lover, your sister and Lord Byron, an infamous and magnetically attractive poet. You know he is dangerous, but you find yourself drawn to him. When he sets a challenge to write a ghost story, all the turmoil that has boiled within you finds a voice.",
      "The anger pours from your pen in a roar of rage. Even as the monster that emerges terrifies you, you understand that it belongs to you. This creature that crawls across the page is the woman you were always meant to be. And in Byron, this furious beast that you have kept hidden for so long may have found a mate. You are eighteen years old. The creature you have created will howl its way onto page and stage and screen, burning its path across history in its desire to be seen, to be known, to be loved. The monster will never be silenced. Neither will you.",
      "Prologue",
      "Geneva, 1816",
      "At dusk, the sky over Lake Geneva is the colour of blood in a glass of water. The ash fragments falling over the city form a strange fog \u2013 a thickening of the air, which swirls through the deserted streets, past the spire of the old cathedral and over the walls of the new Protestant church. Inside, people are on their knees, praying for the uncanny cloud to lift. It is a judgement, they fear, a punishment from God, or else a curse.",
      "This night, like so many before it, the choking dust has driven the residents of the city into the shelter of shuttered houses and places of prayer. Outside, there is no one to witness the way the ash gleams as it settles on the lake. The water flickers and shimmers, each tiny filament glowing like a candle, sinking into the silence, quickly snuffed out.",
      "The lake is chill and dark and deep \u2013 not even the fishermen have fathomed its depths, or the small children who, on any other evening, would be taking turns to dive beneath the surface, competing to see who could swim down the furthest, stay under the longest.",
      "No one is standing on the lake's stony shores to watch the water's surface glow, red as the strange sky above. No one is there to see the darkness beneath the water shift and stir and coalesce, parting for a breath, like two slick thighs, which fall back into the darkness with a gasp that is almost human.",
      "Above, half masked by cloud, a thin slash of moon hangs hazy and indifferent. A lone figure stumbles down to the lake and scrambles into a small rowboat that one of the fishermen has left bobbing at the end of a long line. Looking right, then left, the man leans forward over the rope. Flash of steel from the blade in his hand. A quick tug and the boat is free. The man settles himself on the rocking boards, tugging the oars. No one will see him on this cloud-deadened, mist-muffled night. No one will stop him. Still, his breath stutters and stumbles. He must be quick. His hands ache, his chest burns. His eyes feel gritty as the mist parts before him, then closes around him, giving him the strange sensation of being swallowed.",

      "From the storeroom hidden under the stairs, Ma fetched a cup of rice and a sack of eggs speckled gray like the moon, then cooked, standing before the stove's blue fire, her eye upon the window and its dusk, in which bats swooped and the neem tree shivered and a figure down on the road pedaled a bicycle, whistling, as if everything was all right.",
      "Thief, thought Ma. Who else but a person who had chanced upon fresh vegetables or fruit would wander the city of Kolkata in this ruined year, the heat a hand clamped upon the mouth, the sun a pistol against one's head, and recall a song? She watched to see what the thief would do. He pedaled past. But Ma saw a different reality shimmer into being, in which he leaned his bicycle against the wall, climbed the pipes like a toddy tapper, and appeared at her window. In that picture, the thief was a collector of local information, dutiful in his neighborhood eavesdropping, shrewd in following what he heard about the bins of onions and carrots, the sacks of lentils and rice, the bags of raisins and cashews hidden in the dark fist of the house, stolen by Ma from donations made to the shelter where she worked, while the city outside wept for a handful of something to eat.",
      "There was \u2014 in the label accepted by the region \u2014 a shortage.",
      "In the year prior to this day, farmers across the region had fallen, their bodies running fevers in air that no longer cooled. In the croplands, among stilled machines, pests had traveled from acre to new acre, savage in their feeding of grains. In the west a drought had cleaved riverbeds and in the east salt water had tainted the paddy fields. In the city, those who walked to the neighborhood markets with umbrellas in their hands and wishful lists in their pockets, broad corners torn from the newspaper with writing in Bengali \u2014 cabbage, ginger, lychees if they were good, ice cream, half loaf of bread \u2014 found the roads alongside which the markets usually sat, its baskets and tarps invading, rickshaws and cars sounding their horns, slow shoppers inspecting the purple shine of eggplant and pressing guavas hard as hail, instead completely empty, nothing but some onion peel scattered at the edges where the pavement gave way to earth, where on most days goats and cows might have nudged the soil for something to eat. But those animals were gone too.",
      "It had happened before. 1770, when crops failed and smallpox plagued the enfeebled. 1876, when drought struck the Deccan Plateau and the British continued to export what grain remained. 1943. Those black-and-white newspaper photos, in which people appeared as sunken eyes and twig-thin limbs, facing a photographer who could do nothing for them, their fullness \u2014 their love, their humor, their annoyance, their preference \u2014 pared by the lens to reveal what remained, which was hunger.",

      "The five suspects were identified as Bruce Epperson, Eddie Barreto, Grant McIver and brothers John Nicolas and Roy Nicolas.",
      "They all face charges of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute fentanyl, para-fluorofentanyl and alprazolam, resulting in the deaths of De Niro-Rodriguez, Stein and the third victim. If convicted as charged, they face a minimum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.",
      "Epperson was arrested Tuesday in Troy, New York, the DEA said, while McIver was arrested Tuesday in Houston, Texas. John Nicolas was arrested Saturday in Buffalo, New York, while Roy Nicolas was arrested Saturday in Valley Stream, New York. Barreto surrendered to authorities Wednesday in Manhattan. All five have made their initial court appearances.",

She later died after another overdose, prosecutors said.",
      "The second victim died of an overdose two weeks later, and De Niro-Rodriguez died of an overdose less than a month after that.",

      "Leandro De Niro Rodriguez - our Leo - was kind, curious, and full of promise. He was a young man just shy of his 20th birthday, with a bright future ahead of him. We miss him terribly. We know there are thousands of families like ours who understand the nightmare of losing a child or loved one to fentanyl poisoning.",
      "The recent indictments in relation to the wrongful deaths of Victim #1 (whose name has not been made public at this time), Akira Stein, and Leandro De Niro Rodriguez is yet another painful reminder of an epidemic that has risen to plague proportions in the U.S. In 2023, there were 100,000 overdose related deaths. Out of over 2,400 New Yorkers who died of fentanyl-related overdose deaths, approximately 75 of them were teenagers and young adults between the ages of 15 and 24.",
      "No parent should have to bury a child. No family should have to endure the suffering of such a senseless and preventable loss.",
      "We are grateful to the law enforcement agencies, including the DEA New York Division and the NYPD as well as many individuals whose work and dedication brought us to this moment. Their efforts mean more than our words can express. Thank you.",
      "We will continue to honor Leo's life and the lives of countless other children and young adults taken too soon, by raising awareness, advocating for change, and working to ensure that other families will never have to experience this kind of heartbreak.",

The 19 charged have nicknames like \"Scarface,\" \"Butter,\" \"Hollywood\" and \"Heavy,\" prosecutors said, and face charges of conspiracy to distribute narcotics resulting in death.",
      "The indictment alleges they \"maintained a year-round market for opioids and crack cocaine\" in the park, adding the various defendants have been arrested more than 80 times for drug-related crimes and, when they were released, they returned to the park and kept selling drugs.",
      "\"The defendants are aware that their drugs cause overdoses,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "Pictures in the indictment reportedly show the scene after two people fatally overdosed on drugs containing fentanyl, allegedly sold to them from dealers in the Washington Square Park area.",
      "The victims included an 18-year-old who had just arrived in the city two days after graduating from high school and a 43-year-old person experiencing homelessness who was found dead on a sidewalk.",

    "story": [
      "Billie Eilish wants billionaires to donate more.",
      "As the Grammy and Oscar winner accepted the music award at this year's WSJ. Magazine Innovator Awards on Wednesday night, she urged the ultra-wealthy to address more of the world's issues.",
      "\"We're in a time right now where the world is really, really bad and really dark and people need empathy and help more than, kind of, ever, especially in our country,\" Eilish said to an audience that included Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, as well as \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas. \"I'd say if you have money, it would be great to use it for good things, maybe give it to some people that need it.\"",
      "Late-night host Stephen Colbert\u00a0introduced Eilish onstage at New York's Museum of Modern Art by announcing that she would donate $11.5 million of the proceeds from her Hit Me Hard and Soft tour to causes dedicated to food equity, climate justice and reducing carbon pollution.",
      "In accepting the award, the \"Bad Guy\" singer added a polite but direct call to others in the room, saying a lot of people, especially in the U.S., could use some help right now.",
      "\"Love you all, but there's a few people in here who have a lot more money than me,\" she said, to a smattering of applause. \"And if you're a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? And no hate, but give your money away, shorties.\"",
      "Through her Changemaker Program, Eilish has worked with the nonprofit Reverb for years on its Music Decarbonization Project and its Music Climate Revolution initiative, alongside artists ranging from Dead & Company to Harry Styles.",
      "Chan was also honored at the event, receiving the \"Philanthropy of Science Innovator of the Year\" award. A spokesperson for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Brandi Hoffine Barr, said Zuckerberg and Chan have committed to giving away 99% of their Meta shares to philanthropy over the course of their lifetimes and have already granted out $7 billion. According to Forbes, Zuckerberg's current net worth is around $224 billion.",
      "Eilish's comments come as the number of billionaires worldwide continues to grow, with 204 new billionaires added in 2024, according to a January report from\u00a0Oxfam International titled \"Takers Not Makers.\"",
      "The report found that the billionaires grew wealthier three times faster in 2024 than in 2023, pointing to an increased concentration of resources globally.",
      "Oxfam predicted that at least five people will become trillionaires in the next decade, up from one person the year before. The group called for higher taxes on the rich and other measures to break up monopolies, cap CEO pay and require companies to pay living wages.",
      "The wealthiest Americans have a long history of calling on each other to give away more of their money. In 1889, the steel magnate and industrialist Andrew Carnegie argued in the essay \"The Gospel of Wealth\" that the richest should give away their fortunes within their lifetimes, in part to lessen the sting of growing inequality.",
      "In 2010,\u00a0Bill Gates,\u00a0Melinda French Gates\u00a0and\u00a0Warren Buffett\u00a0took up that call by creating the\u00a0Giving Pledge, a commitment for billionaires to give away more than half their wealth in their lifetimes or when they die.",
      "Fifteen years on, some 256 billionaires have taken the pledge, with 110 of them coming from the U.S., according to a recent\u00a0report by the Charity Reform Initiative\u00a0of the Institute for Policy Studies. Those U.S. billionaires represent 13% of the total 876 billionaires in the U.S., according to the report, revealing the small portion of the wealthiest people who have publicly committed to giving away their fortunes.",
      "The report found that of the 22 billionaires who have died since taking the pledge, only one gave away his fortune before he died. Meanwhile, only eight of the 22 deceased pledgers fulfilled the commitment by giving away half of their wealth or more at their death, though some of their estates are still being resolved.",
      "Chuck Collins, one of the authors of the report and an expert at the Institute for Policy Studies, said Eilish's comments are part of a growing realization that the rules of the economy favor those with assets over those who earn wages.",
      "He thinks the Giving Pledge has created an expectation and competition for the wealthiest to give away their money, but the fortunes of many of the pledgers have increased over time, meaning they will need to move even more aggressively if they are to fulfill the commitment.",
      "\"In the end, philanthropy is not a substitute for a fair and effective tax system,\" Collins said. \"The level of extreme inequality will require some form of restoring progressivity to the tax system, a wealth tax as well as progressive income tax.\"",

      "Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" one of the most influential rock songs ever recorded, was released 50 years ago.",
      "It broke records and soared to the top of the British charts. It was No. 1 twice in the U.K. and also made history with the first ever promotional rock video.",
      "But in the U.S., the song took 17 more years and being featured in the movie \"Wayne's World\" to turn into a mega hit. Today, it has almost 3 billion streams on Spotify, which is the most for any 20th century song.",
      "\"It changed the dynamics of music\"",
      "The hit song came to life in the Welsh countryside at Rockfield Studios, which was set up in the 1960s by two farmers and musicians, Charles and Kingsley Ward.",
      "Queen's band members \u2014 Freddie Mercury, John Deacon, Roger Taylor and Brian May \u2014 lived at Rockfield for two weeks in 1975, working on their fourth album, \"A Night at the Opera.\"",
      "\"I don't think anybody realized at the time that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' would end up the iconic record it was,\" said Kingsley Ward, who's now 85 years old.",
      "In the main studio, which is still in use, Queen laid down the song in three sections \u2014 choral, hard rock and opera. The sound was revolutionary, as was the length of the track at almost six minutes.",
      "\"It's probably the greatest record ever made, a rock record, because it changed the dynamics of music, and people now realize they can do anything with music,\" Ward said.",
      "Ward remembers Queen's leader, Mercury, as \"very quiet, unassuming and just a genuinely nice person, wasn't flamboyant at all.\"",
      "He said Mercury kept the band waiting for the song they then knew only as \"Freddy's thing.\"",
      "\"Brian and John were playing frisbee. I remember talking to Brian and saying, 'You've been here a long time, five days, you haven't done much.' And I think Brian said, 'Freddy's in there writing something.'\"",
      "Ward explained Mercury was inside what is now an office and in the corner of the office was an old piano. Out the window, Kingsley said Mercury would have been able to see the old farm wind vane.",
      "\"Now, the odd thing is, a lot of people ask me, 'did Freddy get the idea of that iconic line, 'any way the wind blows,' looking at the weathercock?' We don't know, because Freddy's not here to tell us, but it's a great story, isn't it?\"",

      "\"Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor,\" the statement said. \"Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation.\"",
      "Andrew had recently said he would stop using his royal titles and honors, including the Duke of York, but Thursday's statement on behalf of King Charles III and Queen Camilla initiated the formal process of revoking all his titles, including prince.",
      "\"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,\" the statement said.",
      "Andrew has come under intense scrutiny over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and accusations from\u00a0Virginia Giuffre\u00a0that she was trafficked to engage in sex with the prince while she was underage. Andrew has denied the allegations. He reached a\u00a0settlement with Giuffre in 2022. Giuffre died by suicide earlier this year.",

We, her family, along with her survivor sisters, continue Virginia's battle and will not rest until the same accountability applies to all of the abusers and abettors connected to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell,\" said the statement sent on behalf of her brother, Sky Roberts, and sister-in-law, Amanda.",
      "In a memoir published posthumously, Giuffre detailed her alleged encounters with Andrew.",

The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\" (Maxwell was convicted for her role in trafficking and is serving a 20-year sentence.)",
      "In 2022, Andrew gave up his military affiliations, royal patronages and official public duties. He also stopped using the title \"His Royal Highness.\"",
      "Andrew had faced heavy criticism from the British public over his living arrangements, with many voicing concern that he continued to live in his mansion on a royal estate despite the accusations leveled against him and his retreat from royal duties.",
      "His 75-year lease for Royal Lodge, signed in 2003, included an up-front payment of around 8 million pounds (around $10.5 million) and an annual rent described as a \"peppercorn,\" meaning an extremely small amount, according to\u00a0BBC News. Part of that payment was for renovations to the property, which at the time was in a state of disrepair, and Buckingham Palace felt that having Andrew pay the cost to upgrade the property was better than using public funds, BBC reported.",
      "The lease had previously been referred to as \"cast iron,\" and Buckingham Palace said it needed to negotiate with Andrew in order to remove him, but did not provide further information about the details of those negotiations.",
      "Buckingham Palace said Andrew will move out of the residence as soon as possible and will move to a property on the Sandringham estate, located about 100 miles north of London.",

    "story": [
      "Powder supplements sold at Sam's Club stores are linked to at least 11 cases of Salmonella in seven states, federal health authorities said Friday.",
      "Member's Mark Super Greens Powder Supplements, which were sold at the discount chain's stores nationwide and online, have been pulled from store shelves because they contain moringa leaf powder that may be contaminated with Salmonella bacteria, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an alert posted on its website.",
      "\"If you have any of the products listed below in your home, throw them out or return them to the store,\" the agency said, while noting that the product has not been recalled.",
      "Three of the people who contracted Salmonella were hospitalized, according to the agency. Illnesses, which were reported between May and September, were confirmed in Florida, Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, New York, South Carolina and Virginia.",
      "The source of the Salmonella was traced to a single lot of organic moringa leaf powder imported from Vallon Farm Direct in Jodhpur, India, according to an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration. State health officials in Virginia and Michigan collected and tested samples of the product from the homes of people who fell ill.",
      "The CDC said it may add other Vallon Farm products with moringa leaf powder to avoid as the agency's investigation continues.",
      "Moringa is a plant native to India and other countries prized for essential nutrients including protein, amino acids, vitamins and minerals, according to research published by the National Institutes of Health. Its leaves can be dried and powdered.",
      "People infected with the Salmonella bacteria can experience symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and fever. Rarely, Salmonella can result in more serious ailments, including arterial infections, endocarditis, arthritis, muscle pain, eye irritation and urinary tract symptoms.",
      "Infections can be severe in young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems, who may require hospitalization.",

      "New York Times financial columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin's \"1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History - and How It Shattered a Nation\" (Viking) looks back to the nation's most catastrophic market collapse.",
      "Read an excerpt below.",
      "\"1929\" by Andrew Ross Sorkin",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Charles Mitchell strode up the steps of 55 Wall Street, determined to project his usual sense of confidence and certitude. It had been a crushing afternoon. As he returned to his office, he knew that the eyes of Wall Street were on him \u2014 everyone from the traders in the street to his own secretary was assessing his gait and searching his face, trying to read meaning into every twitch, every line, every wrinkle.",
      "In his gray three\u2011piece suit, shoulders back, Mitchell kept up his smile as he passed through the glass\u2011domed central hall of his National City Bank. With its eighty\u2011three\u2011foot ceiling and two solid bronze doors protecting a safe weighing some three hundred tons, the bank was the largest in the country.",
      "It was just past 5:30 p.m. on Monday, October 28, 1929. Hours earlier, the stock market had closed with a sharp, dizzying drop of 13 percent after a week of downward convulsions; today was by far the greatest fall. The darkening downtown streets still teemed with anxious brokers in their fedoras and flat caps, messenger boys and switchboard girls, all gossiping and speculating about the collapse. What caused the fall? How much further might it go tomorrow? Would the markets even open?",
      "As Mitchell made his way to his office, the teller windows he passed reflected the weary puffiness under his eyes and his disheveled, graying eyebrows. He collapsed into the chair behind his mahogany desk. The room was furnished with the high formality befitting an eighteenth\u2011century statesman: antique wood chairs, a grandfather clock that stood against the cream\u2011white woodwork flanked by portraits of George Washington orchestrating the newly independent nation with the purpose and resolve that Mitchell sought to emulate in his own life.",
      "The athletic fifty\u2011two\u2011year\u2011old bank chairman \u2014 an unusually optimistic man whom the press called \"Sunshine Charlie\" \u2014 had spent the afternoon in emergency meetings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, puzzling over how to calm the market. It was a moment for which a self\u2011consciously Great Man like Mitchell should have been utterly prepared. He had the experience, the stature, and the steely nerves necessary to steer Wall Street through these tough times.",
      "Yet he felt exposed, vulnerable.",
      "But he didn't have time to consider his emotional state.",
      "He walked upstairs to confer with Hugh Baker, who ran National City's stock\u2011trading unit.",
      "Baker, a tall, bald man with piercing eyes, began to explain to Mitchell, calmly, if somewhat obliquely, what had taken place while Mitchell had been at the Federal Reserve.",
      "\"Our portfolio today has been tremendously increased in our holdings of National City Bank stock,\" Baker told him.",
      "Mitchell stared at him, waiting to hear exactly what he meant.",
      "Baker finally blurted out: \"We purchased seventy\u2011odd thousand shares.\"",
      "Mitchell, who could calculate numbers instantly in his head, immediately grasped the nature and scale of the problem. That is unbelievable, he thought. The bank didn't have the cash to pay for so many shares. He was outraged \u2014 and terrified. Everything he had built was suddenly at grave risk of collapse.",
      "Barely a month earlier, Mitchell had been on top of the world. He had finalized an agreement to take over the Corn Exchange Bank, a bold acquisition that would turn National City from the largest bank in the country into the largest in the world, stealing the mantle from London and helping New York finally eclipse its rival city as the world financial center. This was history in the making, an overthrow of the established order, the kind of gambit that made Mitchell a king among men.",
      "But to pull off the deal, Mitchell had made a big \u2014 and risky \u2014 bet on the strength of his own stock. Corn Exchange shareholders could take $360 in cash for each of their shares, or four fifths of a share in National City Bank. On paper, the stock was the better deal: As long as National City stock stayed above $450, four fifths of a share was worth more than $360 in cash. At the time the deal was struck, it was comfortably higher, trading at $496 a share. Mitchell needed it to stay there until the deal could be completed, likely in the next month \u2014 because, in truth, National City didn't have the cash to pay everyone, a crucial detail he kept to himself.",
      "So he quietly instructed his traders to buy the bank's shares whenever the price slipped.",
      "In a relatively stable market, this posed no problem. Big publicly traded companies bought back their own shares all the time. In a rapidly falling market, however, doing so could quickly become like shoveling money into a furnace, which was what had been happening that afternoon. In the chaos of all that selling pressure, National City's bids had been accepted so quickly that they lost track of how many they had amassed. By the time traders got a handle on the situation, National City had committed to buy seventy\u2011one thousand of its own shares, far more than it could afford to hold.",
      "\"With that news,\" he told Baker, \"I could be knocked over with a feather.\"",
      "There were very few good options. To fund their daily operations, big banks like National City had to constantly borrow against their assets. But banking law prevented them from offering their own stock as collateral. Thus, those seventy\u2011one thousand shares \u2014 which cost about $32 million \u2014 were a deadweight that could possibly take down the whole bank.",
      "\"It would be embarrassing for us to attempt to borrow on that stock in other banks,\" Mitchell said, knowing full well that his rivals would seize on any such move as a sign of vulnerability. With the market in free fall, short sellers \u2014 traders who bet that stocks would go down \u2014 were lining up targets, probing for weakness.",
      "The stock market was at the breaking point. Sales volume had overwhelmed the human apparatus of the trading floor to such an extent that, on the previous Thursday, the ticker had fallen four hours behind in reporting stock prices, more than twice the longest previous delay.",
      "What this meant was that the big board of prices that loomed over the floor of the New York Stock Exchange was hopelessly inaccurate. Trading stocks in this environment was like being a gambler at a baseball game in the eighth inning and looking at a scoreboard that hadn't been updated since the third, while everybody around you was shouting conflicting opinions about which team was ahead and by how much. The prices of stocks sold privately \u2014 known as \"off\u2011exchange,\" which was the case with National City shares \u2014 were even further behind because they were tied to the broader market's movements without being fully updated in real time, exacerbating the delay. For Wall Street traders, the only prudent decision was to sell and get the hell out of the market. Which is exactly what they were doing.",
      "Mitchell knew that if he tried to unload even a small fraction of National City's position back into such a weak market, rumors would begin to fly about the bank's solvency, and that could easily turn into a vicious cycle that would be impossible to stop. If prices declined fast enough, it could trigger a much larger crisis: A \"lack of confidence might bring a run,\" Mitchell told Baker, envisioning depositors lining up outside every one of its fifty\u2011eight branches around the country.",
      "A run on the country's largest bank. There was nothing bankers feared more.",

      "\"We felt Dubai was the perfect place for our investment,\" Sagsoz said.",
      "For a price tag of 3,600 dirhams (around $980), the brew offers an experience of floral and fruity flavors reminiscent of tea.",

      "Several factors are driving this increase. First, volatile weather, including both heavy rain and droughts in major coffee-producing countries, such as Brazil and Colombia, is depressing crop yields, Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News.",
      "Lempert also said American tariffs on foreign imports are having an impact on domestic coffee prices. As of 2023, the U.S. imported about 80% its unroasted beans from Latin America,\u00a0according\u00a0to the USDA, with Hawaii and Puerto Rico the only U.S. states or territories that produce much coffee.",
      "The Trump administration this year has imposed new tariffs on several major coffee producers that export to the U.S. That includes a 50% levy on Brazil, which has led producers there to withhold shipments as they negotiate with American roasters over who will absorb the added costs, according to investment bank UBS.",

    "summary": "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" said one mother of two about a looming freeze in food aid.",
    "story": [
      "Roughly 42 million Americans rely on food stamps that arrive every month on their electronic benefit transfer cards. On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, potentially leaving households scrambling to figure out how to put food on the table.",
      "People enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, told CBS News they're bracing for some tough financial choices. Kasey McBlais, a 42-year-old single mother living in Buckfield, Maine, said she's planning to delay paying her electric and credit card bills to make sure her two children have enough to eat.",
      "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" McBlais, who works for a Maine social services agency and who draws about $600 a month in SNAP benefits, said. \"My children won't go hungry.\"",
      "The suspension of food aid comes as Democratic and Republican lawmakers continue to trade blame over the\u00a0government shutdown, which now stands as the second-longest funding lapse in U.S. history. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds the SNAP program, warned earlier this month that there would be insufficient funding to pay full November benefits if the shutdown continued, prompting local governments to post notices on their websites about the potential interruption in payments.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the USDA said in a memo\u00a0posted Sunday on its website. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.\"",
      "A stoppage in SNAP payments on Saturday isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday, Oct. 31, that the Trump administration is required by law to\u00a0use contingency funds\u00a0to pay at least partial SNAP benefits.",
      "The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have asked the USDA to use contingency funds to cover most of next month's SNAP benefits, but an agency memo surfaced on Friday that says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "That means beginning Nov. 1, the government will halt about $8 billion in monthly SNAP payments, cutting off food assistance for the one in eight Americans who are enrolled in the program. Recipients, who include households in every state, typically get about $187 a month on a prepaid card to help cover the cost of groceries.",
      "Unused benefits on SNAP recipients' cards will roll over into November.",
      "\"That's money that's already been appropriated. It's been put on their card,\" Mackenzie Libbey, a staff attorney with Community Legal Services, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"So we definitely do not want people rushing out to try to use up their benefits at the end of October thinking they're not going to be able to buy anything in November.\"",
      "The USDA said it is incumbent on Democrats in Congress to end the government shutdown.",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely\" SNAP benefits and other federal food aid, the agency said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Some U.S. states, including Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia, have vowed to continue disbursing SNAP benefits even if the federal government suspends payments. New York on Monday\u00a0pledged $30 million in emergency food assistance, while also recently committing to provide millions more in support for food banks. The USDA memo stipulates that states won't be reimbursed for temporarily providing food aid to residents, raising questions about the viability of that approach.",
      "Other states are taking legal action.",
      "A coalition of 25 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday\u00a0sued the Trump administration, alleging that the suspension of food stamps is unlawful and threatens the health and well-being of millions. The states are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the USDA to provide SNAP benefits in November by tapping into a contingency fund, which is estimated to hold around $5 billion.",
      "\"Where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sharlene Sutton, a 45-year-old single mother of four in Dorchester, Massachusetts, who left her job as a security officer last month to care for one of her children, who has epilepsy, said she relies on the $549 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to feed her family.",
      "\"I was freaking out because I'm like, 'Oh my god, now I don't have a job,'\" she told CBS News. \"I'm not worried about myself that much. It's about the kids. Like, where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sutton said she's looking for a food bank to help fill the gap if her food aid is cut off. But experts warn that the non-profit organizations alone aren't capable of filling the $8 billion monthly hole left by a looming SNAP suspension.",
      "\"The charitable food system and food banks don't have the resources to replace all those food dollars,\" John Sayles, CEO of Vermont Foodbank in Barre, Vermont, told CBS News.",
      "Already, food banks are getting an influx of calls from SNAP recipients who are worried about the payment freeze, and food shelves could see long lines next month if the shutdown persists, Sayles said.",
      "\"There is no safety net after SNAP other than the food shelf,\" he added.",
      "Albuquerque, New Mexico's Roadrunner Food Bank, which typically serves 83,000 households per week, is \"seeing panic\" among residents due to the SNAP halt, said Katy Anderson, vice president of strategy, partnerships and advocacy at the nonprofit organization.",
      "George Matysik, executive director of the Share Food Program in Philadelphia, has also noticed an uptick in demand. He told CBS News in a text message that some of the pantries the hunger relief nonprofit works with have reported 12-fold increases in new registrations week to week.",
      "Even before this new surge in demand, food banks were already facing pressures because of the growing number of people seeking their services, aggravated this year by\u00a0persistent inflation\u00a0and funding constraints. In March, the\u00a0USDA said it was nixing $420 million in funding\u00a0for a program that allows food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "Broader economic impact",
      "A temporary halt in $8 billion in monthly food aid could also impact local businesses, from grocers to farm stands, said Sayles of Vermont Foodbank. Each $1 in SNAP benefits provides an economic benefit of $1.60, he said, referring to the so-called\u00a0multiplier effect\u00a0in which dollars flowing through the local economy help support spending, jobs and growth.",
      "\"SNAP is the foundation of economic support for a lot of food retailers, like those smaller places in rural areas and the corner store in our cities,\" said Kate Bauer, an associate professor of nutritional services at the University of Michigan. \"So this has far-reaching impacts beyond just the people who get SNAP.\"",
      "SNAP is designed to provide supplemental aid for a family's grocery budget, but some families depend on it as their main source of income to buy food, Bauer noted. For those living paycheck to paycheck, even a short disruption in benefits can have immediate consequences, experts said.",
      "The loss of SNAP funding threatens some of the most vulnerable people in the U.S., with the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities noting that two-thirds of food-stamp recipients are children, seniors or people with disabilities.",
      "For McBlais, the single mom, the issue isn't political. Rather, it's about making sure families can eat in an economy where many are already struggling to afford rent, utilities and basic groceries, she told CBS News.",

    "summary": "With food-stamp funding set to lapse Saturday, recipients are asking what happens to their benefits \u2014 and when help might resume.",
    "story": [
      "The prolonged U.S.\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0is putting millions of Americans at risk of missing their November food stamp benefits, a vital lifeline for low-income households.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, stated in a memo on Sunday that no benefits will be issued on Nov. 1, leaving the program's roughly 42 million beneficiaries uncertain about how they'll pay for groceries next month.",
      "SNAP recipients receive an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card, and many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. Many of those registered with the program are asking if they will still be able to use the remaining dollars on their cards once funding is suspended and if they'll receive their November benefits retroactively, should lawmakers reach a deal to reopen the government.",
      "A stoppage in SNAP payments on Nov. 1 isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday, Oct. 31, that the Trump administration is required by law to\u00a0use contingency funds\u00a0to pay at least partial SNAP benefits.",
      "The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "With just days to go before a potential suspension in SNAP funding, here's what to know.",
      "Will current SNAP benefits roll over to November?",
      "While SNAP benefits will not be disbursed as scheduled in November, program recipients can use existing funds on their EBT cards to make purchases. If someone enrolled in the program hasn't spent all their October EBT dollars, for example, those benefits would roll over into November.",
      "Some states are advising recipients to use their remaining food stamps wisely, given the stalemate over funding the federal government.",
      "\"If you have remaining balances from previous months, we encourage you to plan your shopping carefully and purchase essential food items when needed,\" Hawaii's Department of Human Services said on its website.",
      "Will SNAP recipients get paid retroactively for missed payments?",
      "The USDA hasn't indicated whether SNAP benefits would be paid retroactively once the government shutdown ends.",
      "But social service experts who spoke with CBS News said they expect the USDA to pay the delayed November benefits once federal funding resumes.",
      "\"It is our understanding that SNAP benefits will be issued retroactively when the shutdown ends,\" said Lizbeth Ginsburg, a managing attorney in the welfare law unit at Greater Boston Legal Services.",
      "Federal rules\u00a0governing the food-stamp program stipulate that SNAP recipients are entitled to their benefits, and that they should receive them if there's a disruption, said Gina Plata-Nino, interim SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on ending hunger.",
      "\"That's why many state agencies have done a very good job of saying, 'Your benefits will be delayed,' versus, 'You are not getting benefits,'\" she told CBS News.",
      "Can states step in to fund SNAP?",
      "While SNAP is federally funded and overseen by the USDA, each state is responsible for administering the program to its residents.",
      "Some states are taking action, with Democratic lawmakers\u00a0urging\u00a0Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to tap into an estimated $5 billion in contingency funds to cover SNAP benefits next month. On Tuesday, a coalition of officials from 25 states and the District of Columbia\u00a0sued the Trump administration\u00a0over the suspension of benefits, arguing that it is unlawful. The\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0notes that this would mark the first delay in SNAP benefits in the program's history.",
      "In recent days, several states have pledged to step in to ensure SNAP recipients can afford food in November. Their approaches vary, with some states promising to dispatch troops to support food banks, while others are allocating funds for general hunger relief.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry\u00a0signed an emergency declaration on Oct. 24 intended to fund SNAP benefits for people who rely on the program, while Vermont lawmakers on Oct. 29 approved a plan to cover its residents' food stamp benefits through Nov. 15.",
      "Other states say they plan to ramp up support for local food banks by providing on-site personnel and additional funding. California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0said\u00a0last week he would deploy National Guard troops to assist food bank operations and fast-track $80 million to keep the state's food banks stocked.",
      "In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she is providing $30 million in state funding to support 16 million meals. Roughly 3 million people in New York are on food stamps.",
      "Other states that have announced actions to help SNAP recipients include\u00a0Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia\u00a0and\u00a0Washington.",
      "Officials in these states are stepping in despite the USDA saying states lack the authority to cover benefits and won't be reimbursed.",
      "\"There is no provision or allowance under current law for states to cover the cost of benefits and be reimbursed,\" the agency said in its memo.",
      "Plata-Nino said that puts states in a difficult position, given their already limited reserves. It also diverts attention and funding from other priorities, she added.",
      "\"These are resources that could have gone to other places,\" she said.",

    "summary": "\"I'm wondering how I'm going to be able to afford everything\" if federal food aid is halted, one single mom said.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are sliding toward a financial cliff as the\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0stretches into a second month, with four federal assistance programs for low-income families set to run out of funding on Nov. 1.",
      "Some families could lose access to multiple sources of government support. Ashley Trent, a 37-year-old single mother of six, expressed concern she could soon be without aid provided under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), better known as food stamps, and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, which provides food aid for mothers of young children.",
      "\"I'm wondering how I'm going to be able to afford everything,\" Trent, a Bloomington, Ill., resident who works full-time as a housing navigator, told CBS News. \"It's very stressful \u2014 what bills will I have to put off? I have a car note, I have insurance, I have clothes I have to get my kids because it's getting colder.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds SNAP and WIC, has said it will halt payments for the anti-hunger programs on Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown. Head Start programs serving 65,000 low-income children will also lose federal funding on Saturday, potentially disrupting preschool for thousands of families,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Head Start Association.",
      "The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps struggling households heat their homes, could be next to run short of funding.",
      "Halting funding for these programs \u2014 which help cover food, education, and energy costs \u2014 could have lasting consequences for poor families already strained by high grocery and utility prices, said Ailen Arreaza, executive director of the advocacy group ParentsTogether Action.",
      "Although funding will resume once Congress passes legislation to reopen the government, she warned that the damage to households could persist.",
      "\"What we are hearing from parents is desperation \u2014 parents going without meals, making impossible decisions about not paying bills or going without medication,\" Arreaza told CBS News. \"This has so many implications, because these kids need these programs to get ahead.\"",
      "Experts note that hunger can hinder children's ability to learn, while parents who fall behind on bills may face utility shutoffs or other lasting setbacks.",
      "Food stamps",
      "The USDA is set to\u00a0halt SNAP payments on Nov. 1, leaving about 42 million Americans uncertain how they'll afford groceries next month. Recipients receive an average of about $187 a month on prepaid cards that can be used to buy food at grocery stores, farmers' markets and other retailers.",
      "A prolonged cessation in food-stamp funding isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday that the Trump administration is required by law to use contingency funds to pay at least partial SNAP benefits. The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "Meanwhile, more than a dozen states are trying to fill the gap by using state funds to support food aid or local food banks. But food bank leaders say charities can't make up for a cutoff in food stamps.",
      "\"It's going to hurt us really bad,\" said Taylour Grant, 29, a Tampa medical assistant who relies on $970 a month in SNAP benefits to feed her four children, plus WIC support for her youngest, who is 1-year-old. \"It's really scary because I know I'll go without to make sure my kids are fed.\"",
      "Grant said many people misunderstand who relies on SNAP. \"We're not on it because we want to be \u2014 no one makes enough to live off these days. That help is really needed,\" she said.",
      "WIC",
      "Nearly 7 million low-income pregnant women, new mothers and children under 5 who receive WIC could lose federal aid in November because of the government shutdown.",
      "Unlike food stamps, WIC provides funds specifically to purchase formula and nutritious foods for pregnant women and young children, though many families rely on both programs, said Georgia Machell, CEO of the National WIC Association.",
      "\"None of these programs operate in a vacuum,\" she said. \"Often, if a family is participating in WIC, they're also participating in SNAP.\"",
      "WIC continued paying benefits in October after the Trump administration tapped\u00a0$300 million\u00a0in leftover tariff revenue from the previous fiscal year. But with the stalemate in Congress continuing into November, that funding could run out.",
      "The USDA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it could tap additional tariff revenue to fund the program. At this point, the program is set to delay payments on Nov. 1, according to the National WIC Association.",
      "WIC has been able to maintain funding during previous shutdowns in its 50-year history, according to the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on stopping hunger. \"The disruptions we're concerned about would be fairly historic,\" Machell said.",
      "Some states have pledged to use their own funds to keep WIC running, but many lack the budget, according to FRAC.",
      "Head Start",
      "About 140 Head Start programs in 41 states and Puerto Rico will lose federal funding with the shutdown set to extend past Nov. 1, affecting roughly 65,000 children, according to the National Head Start Association. Nationwide, about 750,000 children are enrolled in Head Start.",
      "Some programs may not be able to stay open, regional program directors warn.",
      "\"Everybody is trying to do everything they can to keep children in classrooms and families at work,\" Michelle Haimowitz, executive director of the Massachusetts Head Start Association,\u00a0told CBS News Boston. \"But it is incredibly difficult to operate without those federal funds.\"",
      "Minnesota mother Jaycee Chrudimsky said she fears that the closure of her local Head Start program could force her to miss work and affect her 4-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It would impact her, and that's the thing I worry about the most, because she looks forward to coming to school every single day and seeing her friends and being a part of the program,\" Chrudimsky\u00a0told\u00a0CBS News Minnesota this week.",
      "LIHEAP",
      "Another program threatened by the shutdown is the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). The program helps about 6 million low-income households pay their energy bills.",
      "\"We are now at a point where the government shutdown is going to cause serious delays in the release of LIHEAP funds,\" Wolfe told CBS News.",
      "The delay could leave millions of families behind on utility bills and facing power shutoffs just as\u00a0energy prices are skyrocketing, he added.",
      "NEADA projects the\u00a0average cost for people to heat a home this winter\u00a0will rise nearly 8%.",
      "\"It's a perfect storm of misery for low- and middle-income households,\" Wolfe said.",

    "summary": "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol doesn't expect AI to replace baristas as the coffee chain focuses on improving the \"human-to-human experience\" for customers.",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol took the helm in September 2024, inheriting a company facing its first revenue decline in four years amid customer complaints about high prices and long wait times. A year later, the coffee giant has halted the slide but faces fresh pressures, from surging coffee bean costs to store closures.",
      "Coffee prices\u00a0jumped 30% from January through September, squeezing Starbucks' profit margins even as Niccol vowed not to raise menu costs this year. The restaurant chain said last month it would spend $1 billion to close underperforming stores and cut 900 jobs.",
      "As Niccol told CBS News' Jo Ling Kent, the retail chain can't rule out price hikes in 2026 due to rising coffee prices, although he described this step as a \"last resort.\" At the same time, Niccol noted that Starbucks has no plans to introduce a value menu like McDonald's and other fast-food chains appealing to budget-conscious patrons.",
      "\"We have a huge point of difference and that is, I think, that customer connection and the experience you get in our stores,\" Niccol told CBS News. \"I just believe, at the end of the day, the experience sets us apart from everybody else.\"",
      "He added, \"Pricing would be one of those things that we do as a last resort, and we do it very surgically. To say never, you know, I don't think you can do that in this environment.\"",
      "\"Human-to-human\"",
      "Starbucks' reboot involves what the company calls its \"Green Apron service model,\" which aims to hire more baristas, improve customer service and cut down on customer wait times.",
      "\"What we're doing right now is making sure that we're staffed correctly,\" Niccol said. \"The teams are trained correctly for the demand that we know we have in the morning, and we know that we're growing in the afternoon.\"",
      "While other companies are turning to artificial intelligence to replace some workers, Niccol said he doesn't envision AI supplanting baristas. He said the technology could be useful for behind-the-scenes tasks, such as managing the company's supply chain.",
      "\"I don't see [AI] replacing our baristas \u2014 that human-to-human experience is just too important,\" Niccol said. \"And I think it really separates our experience from everybody else.\"",
      "While Starbucks is bolstering its barista ranks, it also faces the threat of strikes from Starbucks Workers United, which represents 9,500 workers in some 550 Starbucks cafes across the country. Overall, the company has roughly 201,000 employees working in 10,000 stores across North America.",
      "Niccol said he's open to talking with union members, but also described his company's pay and benefits as generous, adding that their demands \"to date have been unreasonable.\"",
      "\"We already give them the best job in retail. We have the lowest turnover in the industry \u2014 it's below 50%,\" Niccol told CBS News. \"We also have the best benefits in the industry, and we actually have the best wages in the industry.\"",
      "Although other companies have noted a pullback from low- or middle-income consumers as inflation continues to tick upwards, Niccols said Starbucks patrons are still opening their wallets.",
      "\"Transactions are up, our sales are up,\" Niccol said. \"What we hear from them is they love the experience and they think it's a great value proposition, so I think they're being much more judicious in where they want to spend their money.\"",

    "summary": "Unionized baristas will begin voting Friday on whether to authorize a strike amid stalled contract negotiations, Starbucks Workers United said.",
    "story": [
      "Thousands of Starbucks workers are gearing up to vote on whether to go on strike next week.",
      "The strike authorization vote is set to begin Friday and will remain open for several days, with Starbucks Workers United expected to share results after voting ends. Employees represented by the union have staged two national strikes over the last year, most recently in May to protest Starbucks' new dress code. Thousands of workers\u00a0also walked off the job\u00a0in December 2024.",
      "As the voting gets underway, the union is also planning a series of rallies and pickets over the weekend outside Starbucks stores in dozens of U.S. cities.",
      "Starbucks Workers United originated in Buffalo, New York, in 2021 and now represents 9,500\u00a0workers in approximately 550 Starbucks cafes across the country.",
      "A union spokesperson confirmed that contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in May 2024 but fell apart in December. The group entered mediation in February, which ended two months later with Workers United rejecting Starbucks' contract proposal. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are noneconomic proposals.",
      "The union spokesperson said the coffee giant has since refused to come to the table with a new proposal that meets workers' demands, which is why negotiations have stalled.",
      "For its part, Starbucks says it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations but claims that Workers United ultimately presented union members with an incomplete outline of single-store contracts to vote on.",
      "\"Workers United only represents around 4% of our partners but chose to walk away from the bargaining table,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News in an email statement. \"If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",
      "What workers want",
      "The workers' demands are threefold, according to the union \u2014 increased hours and\u00a0higher take-home pay, as well as a resolution from Starbucks for what the union refers to as \"unfair labor practice charges\" for union busting.",
      "\"Too many baristas still aren't getting enough hours to pay the bills or meet the threshold for benefits,\" the union says in its statement of demands on its website.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board, including over its dress code.",
      "The union has not specified the size of the pay increase it is seeking. Starbucks said employees receive $30 an hour in pay and benefits. Store managers, or \"coffeehouse leaders\" as they're referred to by the retailer, are salaried. The company contends that nearly 85% of its employees work their preferred hours.",
      "Limited impact",
      "Susan Schurman, a distinguished professor at Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said previous Workers United strikes have had a limited effect on persuading the company to return to the bargaining table.",
      "\"The basic problem is that not enough Starbucks stores are organized yet so that a strike inflicts serious financial or publicity damage to the company,\" Schurman said in an email.",
      "Last month, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company was shuttering certain locations and cutting about 900 jobs. The closures affected 59 union stores, according to Starbucks Workers United.",
      "In a letter to employees at the time, Niccol framed the decision to close stores as part of a \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, an effort he initiated in 2024 to revitalize sales and foot traffic at the chain's coffee shops. The plan includes adding more personal touches to the customer store experience, like handwritten notes on Starbuck's cups.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has\u00a0openly questioned whether Niccol's strategy is working, whereas Starbucks has painted the plan as a success.",
      "\"The facts show that 'Back to Starbucks' is making the experience better for both customers and partners,\" Anderson said. \"We've invested more than $500M to improve our coffeehouse staffing, training, and support on top of offering the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging over $30 per hour for hourly partners.\"",

    "story": [
      "Diane Reynolds said she was caught off guard when someone contacted the Maryland retiree online and said access to her computer had been blocked for safety reasons.",
      "\"There was a voice message that was coming on with this that said, 'Don't turn your computer on, don't turn your computer off,'\" she told CBS News.",
      "Reynolds was also instructed to call a phone number she was led to believe would provide her with tech support. Instead, she was connected to a\u00a0scam artist\u00a0who claimed that hackers had obtained access to her bank account. The only way to protect her money was to convert the funds into bitcoin, the person told Reynolds.",
      "She withdrew her entire bank account balance, which totaled $13,100, and followed the scammer's directions to go to a bitcoin ATM at a nearby gas station. The ATM was operated by Athena Bitcoin, which has more than 4,000 such terminals across the U.S.",
      "Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb said such incidents highlight the surge in cryptocurrency scams linked to bitcoin ATM providers, resulting in the theft of millions of dollars.",
      "\"Bitcoin ATMs are a tool that scammers, that criminals, are using to separate people, including D.C. residents, from their hard-earned money,\" Schwalb told CBS News. \"Athena, as a bitcoin operator, knows that its kiosks are being used by this element, and yet [has] failed to put proper anti-fraud prevention systems in place to keep it from happening.\"",
      "He added, \"What makes it worse is they are profiting from this because they're charging very substantial fees.\"",
      "Schwalb in September filed a lawsuit against Athena, alleging that it charges \"undisclosed fees on deposits that it knows are often the result of scams, and for failing to implement adequate anti-fraud measures.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Athena Bitcoin said it \"strongly disagrees with the allegations\" and that it will contest the charges in court.",
      "\"We employ aggressive safety protocols to protect the financial interests of our customers. ...Our kiosks employ multiple safeguards, from prominent warnings and daily transaction limits to five separate verification screens designed to stop coerced transactions,\" the company said.",
      "Reynolds is also suing Athena Bitcoin. Her attorney, Vaught Stewart, accused the company of \"not just allowing the fraud to happen \u2014 they're profiting from it.\"",
      "In Washington, D.C., Athena Bitcoin charged fees of up to 26% per transaction, while 93% of all deposits made through the company's ATMs are linked to scams, Schwalb alleged in his suit.",
      "For her part, Reynolds wants to help others avoid losing their savings. \"Now I'm an advocate for just telling people this is real,\" she said. \"Be aware.\"",
      "Financial scams connected to bitcoin ATMs are on the rise, according to the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "The Better Business Bureau, which ranks crypto-related fraud as one of the most common types of financial scams, notes that fraudsters tend to target the senior population.",

    "story": [
      "Billie Eilish wants billionaires to donate more.",
      "As the Grammy and Oscar winner accepted the music award at this year's WSJ. Magazine Innovator Awards on Wednesday night, she urged the ultra-wealthy to address more of the world's issues.",
      "\"We're in a time right now where the world is really, really bad and really dark and people need empathy and help more than, kind of, ever, especially in our country,\" Eilish said to an audience that included Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, as well as \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas. \"I'd say if you have money, it would be great to use it for good things, maybe give it to some people that need it.\"",
      "Late-night host Stephen Colbert\u00a0introduced Eilish onstage at New York's Museum of Modern Art by announcing that she would donate $11.5 million of the proceeds from her Hit Me Hard and Soft tour to causes dedicated to food equity, climate justice and reducing carbon pollution.",
      "In accepting the award, the \"Bad Guy\" singer added a polite but direct call to others in the room, saying a lot of people, especially in the U.S., could use some help right now.",
      "\"Love you all, but there's a few people in here who have a lot more money than me,\" she said, to a smattering of applause. \"And if you're a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? And no hate, but give your money away, shorties.\"",
      "Through her Changemaker Program, Eilish has worked with the nonprofit Reverb for years on its Music Decarbonization Project and its Music Climate Revolution initiative, alongside artists ranging from Dead & Company to Harry Styles.",
      "Chan was also honored at the event, receiving the \"Philanthropy of Science Innovator of the Year\" award. A spokesperson for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Brandi Hoffine Barr, said Zuckerberg and Chan have committed to giving away 99% of their Meta shares to philanthropy over the course of their lifetimes and have already granted out $7 billion. According to Forbes, Zuckerberg's current net worth is around $224 billion.",
      "Eilish's comments come as the number of billionaires worldwide continues to grow, with 204 new billionaires added in 2024, according to a January report from\u00a0Oxfam International titled \"Takers Not Makers.\"",
      "The report found that the billionaires grew wealthier three times faster in 2024 than in 2023, pointing to an increased concentration of resources globally.",
      "Oxfam predicted that at least five people will become trillionaires in the next decade, up from one person the year before. The group called for higher taxes on the rich and other measures to break up monopolies, cap CEO pay and require companies to pay living wages.",
      "The wealthiest Americans have a long history of calling on each other to give away more of their money. In 1889, the steel magnate and industrialist Andrew Carnegie argued in the essay \"The Gospel of Wealth\" that the richest should give away their fortunes within their lifetimes, in part to lessen the sting of growing inequality.",
      "In 2010,\u00a0Bill Gates,\u00a0Melinda French Gates\u00a0and\u00a0Warren Buffett\u00a0took up that call by creating the\u00a0Giving Pledge, a commitment for billionaires to give away more than half their wealth in their lifetimes or when they die.",
      "Fifteen years on, some 256 billionaires have taken the pledge, with 110 of them coming from the U.S., according to a recent\u00a0report by the Charity Reform Initiative\u00a0of the Institute for Policy Studies. Those U.S. billionaires represent 13% of the total 876 billionaires in the U.S., according to the report, revealing the small portion of the wealthiest people who have publicly committed to giving away their fortunes.",
      "The report found that of the 22 billionaires who have died since taking the pledge, only one gave away his fortune before he died. Meanwhile, only eight of the 22 deceased pledgers fulfilled the commitment by giving away half of their wealth or more at their death, though some of their estates are still being resolved.",
      "Chuck Collins, one of the authors of the report and an expert at the Institute for Policy Studies, said Eilish's comments are part of a growing realization that the rules of the economy favor those with assets over those who earn wages.",
      "He thinks the Giving Pledge has created an expectation and competition for the wealthiest to give away their money, but the fortunes of many of the pledgers have increased over time, meaning they will need to move even more aggressively if they are to fulfill the commitment.",
      "\"In the end, philanthropy is not a substitute for a fair and effective tax system,\" Collins said. \"The level of extreme inequality will require some form of restoring progressivity to the tax system, a wealth tax as well as progressive income tax.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Oct 2025 12:24:21 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

      "Americans are expected to open their wallets this holiday season, increasing their gift budgets even as a slowing job market and stubborn inflation weigh on consumer confidence, according to a new analysis from Visa Business and Economic Insights.",
      "U.S. consumers are forecast to spend an average of $736 each on holiday gifts, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year, Visa said in its 2025 holiday spending outlook.",
      "Inflation partly explains this year's projected sales growth, with the Consumer Price Index showing that prices rose 3% on an annual basis in September. But Americans are also planning on upping their gifting, especially older consumers, with baby boomers forecasted to boost their holiday spending by 21%, the study found.",
      "The robust spending outlook highlights consumers' resilience, even as confidence surveys paint a more cautious picture.",
      "\"We are clearly seeing consumers spend in a far better, more robust way than what we're seeing in the consumer sentiment and confidence data,\" Michael Brown, a principal U.S. economist at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Visa tapped retail sales data from the U.S. Department of Commerce \u2014 excluding automobiles, gas stations and restaurants \u2014 for its holiday spending projections.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, changes in consumer spending corresponded more closely with consumer sentiment, Visa's analysis shows. But that link has weakened in recent years. In April, for example, when consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since the pandemic, real consumer spending increased 3.1% on an annual basis, the Visa report points out.",
      "Consumers continue to express dour views about the economy, with sentiment falling for a third consecutive month\u00a0in October due to worries about a weaker job market and rising inflation, according to the latest University of Michigan sentiment index. Another measure from the Conference Board, a nonprofit group, also shows confidence in the economy edged down slightly this month.",
      "What explains the disconnect? Steady wage gains have kept spending aloft, with many Americans continuing to shop despite higher prices because their take-home pay remains solid, Brown said.",
      "Other holiday outlook forecasts from groups like Abode for Business and polling firm\u00a0Gallup point to the same conclusion as Visa's: Americans are planning to dish out billions on holiday gifts, travel and food despite their gloomy views on the economy.",
      "Still, some are exercising caution in their purchasing, Brown said, noting that low- and middle-income households will face the biggest tradeoffs this holiday season. Higher costs for essentials such as groceries are leaving them with less room for discretionary spending, he added.",
      "\"There is absolutely an undercurrent of trying to make the dollar stretch, given some of those necessities are costing a bit more this season,\" Brown said.",

      "Cinnamon's tainted history",
      "Lead has a history of finding its way into the nation's cinnamon supply, with several factors playing a role, according to Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports.",
      "\"Cinnamon comes from the inner bark of several tree species and can absorb lead from the soil in which it's grown, and the soil can be contaminated with lead from industrial byproducts,\" he explained. \"Lead can also enter cinnamon from processing equipment, storage containers or packaging.\"",
      "To protect against contamination, the FDA monitors and regulates lead levels in foods. In 2023, the agency launched an investigation to find the source of tainted cinnamon in applesauce pouches that caused hundreds of children to get lead poisoning. The products, which were eventually recalled, were sold by brands WanaBana, Weis and Schnucks.",
      "In a separate move last year, the FDA issued three alerts identifying ground cinnamon products with elevated levels of lead. The agency launched a third alert in August 2024, which it continues to update.",
      "\"Overall, it's troubling that these elevated lead levels continue to be found in cinnamon,\" Ronholm said. \"It's also reassuring that the FDA is continuing to scrutinize these products given all of the budget and staffing uncertainty they are experiencing.\"",
      "The FDA in March announced\u00a0plans to cut 3,500 employees, although some dismissals\u00a0have since been reversed.",
      "Thousands of FDA-regulated products, ranging from food to drugs to cosmetics, are recalled each year in an effort to protect the public from potential harm.",
      "Lead's impact on health",
      "According to the FDA, there is no known safe level of contact with lead. The agency says that continued exposure to elevated levels of lead for months or longer can lead to a range of adverse health effects, particularly in young children.",
      "\"High levels of exposure to lead in utero, infancy and early childhood can lead to neurological effects such as learning disabilities, behavior difficulties and lowered IQ,\" the FDA states in its most recent alert.",
      "Lead can also cause long-term health problems in adults, according to the World Health Organization, including increased risk of high blood pressure, cardiovascular problems and kidney damage.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted Thursday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on countries around the world, the third in a trio of rebukes of the president's trade policy this week.",
      "In a 51 to 47 vote, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve the resolution. Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, along with Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, supported the resolution. It was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation, requiring just a simple majority.",
      "The resolution is largely symbolic since it almost certainly won't be taken up by the House, where GOP leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs. Senate Democrats forced a vote on the resolution, which was led by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, by bypassing GOP leadership using a provision of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the law that the president invoked to impose the tariffs.",
      "In April, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency, citing \"structural imbalances in the global trading system.\" The president then announced the U.S. would impose a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, dubbing it \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "Wyden, speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, said the president's \"actions clearly go beyond what the law allows, which is why I'm urging passage of this bill to finally end the president's unlawful tariffs.\"",
      "\"The Senate is not a spectator to the workings of the federal government,\" Wyden said. \"When it comes to international trade, and tariffs in particular, the United States Congress has clear authority.\"",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, spoke out against the resolution, saying \"at this juncture, this resolution is counterproductive to helping American families and businesses of all sizes.\"",
      "\"It's no secret that for decades, countries around the globe have raised tariff and non-tariff barriers against Americans and against American business, and have raised the cost for Americans and American businesses without response from the United States. President Trump is now responding,\" Crapo said. \"The president's negotiations are bearing fruit.\"",
      "The vote came after Mr. Trump announced overnight that he would cut tariffs on Beijing after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. China was part of the \"Liberation Day\" tariffs and has been embroiled in a months-long trade war with the U.S.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, who met with Senate Republicans earlier this week on the issue, defended the tariffs, telling reporters that \"tariffs give us the ability to put American workers first.\"",
      "\"They force American industry to reinvest in the United States of America, instead of a foreign country,\" the vice president said. \"They're also incredible leverage for the president of the United States in negotiating these trade deals overseas.\"",
      "The Senate on Tuesday approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure. Then, on Wednesday, the Senate approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada, with support from four Republicans.",
      "Thursday's vote also marked the second time the chamber has weighed in on the issue, after the Senate voted in April on a resolution to Mr. Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.

      "Richards said the $1,800 in pennies the bank had were gone in two weeks. His branches are keeping small amounts of pennies for customers who need to cash checks, but that's it.",
      "The lack of pennies has also become a legal minefield for stores and retailers. In some states and cities, it is illegal to round up a transaction to the nearest nickel or dime because doing so would run afoul of laws that are supposed to place cash customers, as well as debit and credit card customers, on an equal playing field when it comes to item costs.",
      "To avoid lawsuits, retailers are rounding down. While two or three cents may not seem like much, that extra change can add up over tens of thousands of transactions. A spokesman for Kwik Trip, the Midwest convenience store chain, said it has been rounding down every cash transaction to the nearest nickel.",
      "That's expected to cost the company roughly $3 million this year. Some retailers are asking customers to give their change to local or affiliated charities at the cash register, in an effort to avoid pennies as well.",
      "Costs more than they're worth",
      "To be sure, retailers and banks aren't clamoring for pennies to stick around. Pennies, especially in bulk, are heavy and largely used to give customers change.",
      "\"We have been advocating abolition of the penny for 30 years. But this is not the way we wanted it to go,\" said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.",
      "The penny, which dates from the\u00a0early days of the U.S. Mint\u00a0after its establishment in 1792, now costs more to manufacture than the coin is worth. One penny cost about 3.7 cents to manufacture and distribute in 2024, according to the U.S. Mint's 2024\u00a0annual report.",
      "\"Let's rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a Feb. 9 post on his Truth Social social media platform.",
      "The Treasury Department said in May that it was placing its last order of copper-zinc planchets \u2014 the blank metal disks that are minted into coins. In June, the last pennies were minted, and by August those pennies were distributed to banks and armored vehicle service companies.",
      "Despite their coppery look, pennies are mostly made of zinc, with their distinctive appearance coming from a copper overlay. Zinc's cost per metric ton is more than double what it was in 2000, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Piling up in jars",
      "The U.S. Mint issued 3.2 billion pennies in 2024, the last full year of production, more than double that of the second-most minted coin in the country: the quarter. But the problem with pennies is they are issued, given as change and rarely recirculated back into the economy. Americans store their pennies in jars or use them for decoration. This requires the Mint to produce significant sums of pennies each year.",
      "The government is expected to save $56 million by not minting pennies, according to the Treasury Department. Despite losing money on the penny, the Mint is profitable for the U.S. government through its production of other circulating coins as well as coin proof and commemorative sets that appeal to numismatic collectors.",
      "In 2024, the Mint made $182 million in seigniorage, which is its equivalent of profit.",
      "Besides Americans' penny-hoarding habit, a logistical issue is also preventing pennies from circulating.",
      "The distribution of coins is handled by the Federal Reserve system. Several companies, mostly armored carrier companies, operate coin terminals where banks can withdraw and deposit coins. Roughly a third of these 170 coin terminals are now closed to both penny deposits as well as penny withdrawals.",
      "Bank lobbyists say these terminals being closed to penny deposits is exacerbating the penny shortage, because parts of the country that may have some surplus pennies are unable to get those pennies to parts of country with shortages.",
      "\"As a result of the U.S. Department of the Treasury's decision to end production of the penny, coin distribution locations accepting penny deposits and fulfilling orders will vary over time as (penny) inventory is depleted\" a Federal Reserve spokeswoman said.",
      "The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment on whether they had any guidance for retailers or banks regarding the penny shortage, or the issues regarding penny circulation.",
      "\"We don't want the penny back\"",
      "The U.S. isn't the first country to transition away from small denomination coins or discontinue out-of-date coins. But in all of these cases, governments wound down the use of their out-of-date coins over a period of, often, years.",
      "For example, Canada announced it would eliminate its one-cent coin in 2012, transitioning away from one-cent cash transactions starting in 2013 and is still redeeming and recycling one-cent coins a decade later. The \"decimalization\" process of converting British coins from farthings and shillings to a 100-pence-to-a-pound system took much of the 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "The U.S. removed the penny from commerce abruptly, without any action by Congress or any regulatory guidance for banks, retailers or states. The retail and banking industries, rarely allies in Washington on policy matters related to point-of-sale, are demanding that Washington issue guidance or pass a law fixing the issues that are arising due to the shortage.",
      "\"We don't want the penny back. We just want some sort of clarity from the federal government on what to do, as this issue is only going to get worse,\" said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted Wednesday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on Canada, a day after the chamber rebuked the president with another vote to block tariffs on Brazil.",
      "In a 50 to 46 vote, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve the measure, which would terminate the national emergency used to impose tariffs on some goods from Canada. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky broke with their party to vote in favor of the resolution, which required a simple majority and was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation.",
      "The move is mostly symbolic, since it is unlikely to be taken up in the GOP-controlled House. Republican leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs in the lower chamber.",
      "For months, trade tensions have flared between the U.S. and Canada. In August, the president raised tariffs on the country to 35%, though a large share of goods remain exempt under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Then, over the weekend, Mr. Trump said he is raising tariffs on Canada by an additional 10%, blasting the U.S.'s northern neighbor over an anti-tariff ad by the government of Ontario that used quotes from former President Ronald Reagan.",
      "In February, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency with respect to \"the public health crisis of deaths due to the use of fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and the failure of Canada to do more\" to combat \"drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and drugs.\"",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, forced a vote to challenge the move under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, effectively bypassing Senate leadership. He has argued that the tariffs on one of the nation's top trading partners aren't justified under the emergency.",
      "\"I don't think you can say that fentanyl is not an emergency vis-a-vis Mexico or China, but it is ridiculous to say that fentanyl is an emergency with respect to Canada,\" Kaine said. \"And it's a pretext that's just being used to pour more and more tariffs onto Canada.\"",
      "The vote came after the Senate on Tuesday approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure. Wednesday's vote also marked the second time lawmakers have weighed in on the Canada tariffs, after the Senate approved a resolution aimed at blocking the levies in April.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-today-fomc-meeting/",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 15:53:53 -0400",
    "summary": "The Fed on Wednesday announced its second interest-rate cut of 2025, reducing borrowing costs in a move to spur U.S. hiring.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, but Chair Jerome Powell hinted that the central bank might pause before further lowering borrowing costs.",
      "The Fed cut lowers the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.75% and 4%, down from its prior range of 4% to 4.25%. The Fed reduced rates by the same amount in September, its first cut since December of 2024.",
      "In a Wednesday afternoon press conference to discuss the decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said another rate cut at its next meeting, set for Dec. 10, \"isn't a foregone conclusion.\" That may disappoint some borrowers and investors, given that the Fed last month had penciled in an additional rate cut for its final meeting of the year.",
      "\"There were strongly differing views on how to proceed in December\" during the central bank's meeting today, Powell said. Those conflicting views mean \"we haven't made a decision about December. I'm saying something in addition here \u2014 that it's not to be seen as a foregone conclusion. In fact, far from it.\"",
      "He added, \"We've cut 50 more basis points in the last two meetings, and there's a sense from some, 'Let's pause here,' and a sense from others, 'Let's go ahead.'\"",
      "Stocks erased modest gains after Powell's comments, with the S&P 500 slipping 0.2% in afternoon trading and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipping 0.4%.",
      "The central bank's move to ease monetary policy is aimed at shoring up economic growth by lowering borrowing costs, spurring consumer spending and investment by businesses. Although the ongoing U.S. government shutdown has delayed release of the Labor Department's September jobs report, other indicators point to a continued slowdown in hiring. The ADP National Employment Report, for instance, showed private-sector payrolls shrinking by 32,000 last month.",
      "In its policy\u00a0statement on Wednesday, the Fed said \"downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve's so-called dual mandate requires monetary policymakers to keep both inflation and unemployment low, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting last month that risks to the labor market are growing.",
      "While Powell said the Fed is watching layoff announcements from large businesses such as Amazon, he added that the weakness in the job market does not appear to be accelerating. His comments indicate that another back-to-back rate cut this year isn't a certainty, financial experts said.",
      "\"The knee-jerk reaction of the markets to the Fed meeting (and press conference) was to sell stocks and bonds, because Chairman Powell said that an additional rate cut in December wasn't a sure thing,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email. Investors \"were negatively surprised that future cuts might be taken off the table.\"",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the panel that sets the Fed's monetary policy, isn't scheduled to meet on interest rates in November.",
      "Data blackout",
      "The near-total blackout on government economic data during the shutdown may complicate the Fed's decision-making, experts said. Typically, Fed officials are able to draw on a host of official reports, ranging from measures of employment growth to inflation markers, as they seek to determine the best path for policy.",
      "\"While today's rate cut and the general direction of future policy remain relatively clear, guidance on the committee's perspective on economic conditions is more necessary than ever,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email. \"A prolonged government shutdown and ongoing tariff negotiations continue to introduce significant uncertainty into the immediate monetary policy outlook.\"",
      "Powell noted that the lack of official economic data may complicate the Fed's December decision, given that the central bank relies on such information to assess the economy.",
      "\"What do you do when you are driving in the fog? You slow down,\" Powell said.",
      "On Wednesday, 10 of the 12 FOMC members voted in favor of the quarter-point cut, with two members objecting. Fed Governor Stephen Miran dissented, preferring a 0.50 percentage point cut, as he did at the September meeting. Kansas City Fed President Jeffry Schmid also dissented, saying he preferred no rate change.",
      "Inflation battle",
      "While the Fed is now focused on weakness in the labor market, its battle against inflation isn't over. The Fed cranked rates higher after consumer prices soared during the pandemic, with inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "Because higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow, businesses and consumers typically react by paring spending, which dampens demand throughout the economy and cools inflation. Since mid-2022, inflation has receded to an annual rate of 3% as of September, although that remains higher than the Fed's target of a 2% annual pace.",
      "While the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs are starting to trickle through to consumer prices, the impact has been more muted than economists had predicted earlier this year. Some businesses are eating some of the tariff costs, while others stocked up on imports earlier in the year to get ahead of the import duties.",
      "\"Though inflation is still higher than comfortable, the jobs market is holding on to signs of weakness, and their desire to stimulate the economy further is likely to continue outweighing inflation concerns,\" said Steve Rick, chief economist at financial services company TruStage.",

      "Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs companywide on Wednesday (Paramount Skydance owns CBS News.) The rest of the cuts are expected to be made at a later date. In all, 2,000 job reductions amount to about 10% of Paramount's total workforce.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk's partisan stances and foray into politics in recent years have dented the electric vehicle maker's business, Yale researchers say.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk is widely recognized as an electric car pioneer. Yet the Tesla CEO has also single-handedly chilled the automaker's sales, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at Yale University.",
      "Public controversy over Musk's role as leader of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as his acquisition of social media platform Twitter (now known as X) in 2022, reduced Tesla's sales by up to 1.2 million vehicles over a three-year period, the researchers estimated in a working paper published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research that aimed to measure the effect of Musk's politics on Tesla's business.",
      "\"This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be,\" the researchers wrote. \"We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business.\"",
      "Musk's adverse impact on Tesla's business became visible starting in mid-2022, with sales especially dropping in Democratic-leaning states and counties, the study further concludes.",
      "\"Musk's actions antagonized his most loyal customer base, for, as we show, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to purchase a Tesla,\" the researchers said.",
      "The study's lead author is energy and environmental economist Kenneth Gillingham, who is the senior associate dean of academic affairs at the Yale School of the Environment. His research focuses on consumer behavior and policy in the transportation and energy sectors.",
      "Musk announced in May that he was pulling back from DOGE, which the Trump administration formed to shrink the federal government and cut spending.",
      "Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the paper's findings.",
      "Musk's foray into politics and emergence as a prominent adviser to President Trump early in his second term raised the entrepreneur's visibility but alienated some potential Tesla customers, Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, previously told CBS News.",
      "Tesla last week reported third-quarter earnings of $1.4 billion, down 37% from the year-ago period, citing higher costs and tariff-related headwinds. Tesla's vehicle sales fell 1% in 2024 despite a 7% increase in EV sales across the car industry.",
      "Tesla's stock fell 27% in February, a period of time that coincided with Mr. Trump's first full month in the White House. But the shares have rebounded and are now up roughly 14% on the year, with investors betting on growth in the company's fledgling robotaxi business, autonomous driving technology and plans to build AI-powered humanoid robots.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\"\u00a0Wedbush Securities technology analyst Dan Ives said in a recent report, adding that he expects the Trump administration to fast-track such initiatives.",
      "Another measure of Musk's perceived value to Tesla is the enormous pay package shareholders are preparing to vote on for the executive. That total package could be worth up to $1 trillion in a decade, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history.",
      "For Musk to earn the full amount, Tesla would have to hit certain profitability and production targets, as well as reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion \u2014 nearly six times its current value \u2014 in 10 years.",
      "Robyn Denholm, chairman of Tesla's board of directors, is urging shareholders to approve Musk's proposed compensation. \"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor,\"\u00a0 Denholm said in the letter.",

      "Nvidia on Wednesday became the first publicly listed company to be valued at $5 trillion, driven by investor confidence in the growth of artificial intelligence.",
      "Nvidia's shares rose $9.08, or 4.5%, to $210.11 in early morning trading, lifting its market capitalization to $5.1 trillion. The company crossed the new threshold less than four months after it had reached a market value of $4 trillion in July.",
      "The Santa Clara, California-based company has been buoyed by growing demand for its graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are used in AI applications as well as video gaming. Its shares have surged 51% this year amid plans to roll out new products such as an updated quantum computing platform, as well as partnerships with businesses including AI leaders such as OpenAI and Palantir.",

      "Hitting the new market benchmark underscores the upheaval caused by AI, a development widely viewed as the biggest shift in tech since Apple co-founder Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago. Apple rode the iPhone's success to become the first publicly traded company to be valued at $1 trillion, $2 trillion and, eventually, $3 trillion.",
      "But some on Wall Street are voicing concerns about a possible AI bubble, with officials at the Bank of England earlier this month cautioning about the growing risk that tech stock prices pumped up by the AI boom could burst. The surge in AI-related stocks has lifted the stock market as a whole, with the S&P 500 hitting a record high on Tuesday.",
      "\"The rally, led by technology stocks riding the artificial intelligence wave, has caused many market-watchers to question whether the stock market is in a bubble and if dotcom crash 2.0 might be coming,\" said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, in an email, referring to the 2001 crash in internet-based companies.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 09:43:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Amazon and UPS on Tuesday announced tens of thousands of job cuts, the latest signal that the U.S. labor market is downshifting.",
    "story": [
      "For most of 2025, the job market was described by economists as \"no hire, no fire\" \u2014 a stretch of time when job seekers faced slim prospects, but workers could count on job security. But that fragile balance may now be shifting, labor experts warn, as mass layoffs at companies like Amazon and UPS signal a possible turning point for the labor market.",
      "Amazon on Tuesday announced 14,000 job cuts, citing a shift toward artificial intelligence, while UPS on the same day said it has reduced its workforce by 48,000 from a year earlier. Paramount Skydance, the owner of CBS News, on Wednesday also announced it is shedding jobs, part of an ongoing effort to cut costs at the entertainment and media company.",
      "Target on Tuesday also notified a state employment agency in Minnesota, where the retailer is based, that it plans to lay off more than 800 workers in January as part of a broader corporate restructuring,\u00a0CBS News Minnesota reported. The retailer announced last week that it would cut 1,800 corporate positions as the chain trims its global workforce by about 8%.",
      "The mass layoffs come as the Federal Reserve scrutinizes the labor market for signs of weakness, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month citing concerns about slower hiring\u00a0in announcing the central bank's first interest-rate cut of 2025. The announcements from Amazon and UPS could signal that the Fed has good reason to be worried, experts said.",
      "\"No question that this is a shift, and it does seem to me it signals that 'no hire, no fire' is a thing of the past,\" John Challenger, CEO of outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS News.",
      "\"These are major layoffs, the kind of which we only see in periods of real change in the economy,\" he added.",
      "Layoffs picking up",
      "Even before Tuesday's job cuts, layoffs had been trending higher, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Employers across the U.S. cut nearly 950,000 jobs this year through September, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, its most recent data shows.",
      "Official federal reports on the state of the labor market have been suspended due to the government shutdown, which means the Fed will make its next interest rate decision tomorrow, Oct. 29, without information about hiring in September.",
      "But job growth has slowed sharply in recent months, with average monthly payroll gains of roughly 27,000 between May and August \u2014 down from average gains of nearly 123,000 per month between January and April, labor data shows.",
      "On Oct. 1, the ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September.",
      "At the same time, recent reports suggest layoffs have accelerated in October, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist with Oxford Economics, said in a report Wednesday. State-level data also shows jobless claims by federal employees topped 10,000 in the week ended Oct. 18, a sign the stalemate in Congress is taking a toll, the investment advisory firm said in a separate research note.",
      "To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low by historical standards, edging up to 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July. The latest layoffs are unlikely to dramatically drive up joblessness, experts say.",
      "\"When we look at the scale of the announcements vis-\u00e0-vis the broader economy and the data we have from unemployment claims, we don't see them yet at a scale where the unemployment rate is going to shoot up,\" said Andy Stettner, director of economy and jobs at the left-leaning Century Foundation.",
      "But, he added, \"These larger corporate downsizings are happening at a time when there aren't many job openings.\"",
      "That means some workers who lose their jobs could struggle to find new employment, experts say. As a result, the ranks of long-term unemployed people, or those who have been searching for work for more than six months, are predicted to rise even higher from its August figure of almost 2 million, the highest level since 2022.",
      "What's impacting the labor market?",
      "Employers are cutting jobs due to several factors, experts say, ranging from artificial intelligence to economic uncertainty. Earlier this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the e-commerce giant's investment in AI tools would allow the company to\u00a0trim its human workforce\u00a0as the business becomes more efficient.",
      "\"Amazon really pointed to robotics, AI and new technology \u2014 and being on the cutting edge of that technology \u2014 for shifting jobs,\" Challenger said.",
      "About one-quarter of technology industry workers said they had experienced layoffs or role eliminations due to AI adoption during the past two years, according to a new study from career site Indeed.",
      "Other companies are holding off on hiring or are cutting jobs for other reasons. UPS cited the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, as well as shipping declines from Amazon, its biggest customer, on its business. Amazon has been building its own delivery infrastructure, leading it to cut back on its use of UPS.",
      "On Monday, children's clothing brand Carter's said it is cutting 300 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, and closing 150 stores over the next three years due to higher costs from tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies to the federal government.",
      "The Trump administration has said that its tariffs would help protect U.S. manufacturing and boost domestic production as businesses move their operations stateside.",
      "In the meantime, Americans are growing more pessimistic about the job market, according to recent\u00a0CBS News polling. About 52% of Americans describe the labor market as \"bad,\" up seven percentage points from April, the poll found.",
      "\"We are moving more into a time where job security might be more precarious,\" Challenger said.",

    "story": [
      "Election Day 2025 is almost here, with closely watched races in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia, as well as a redistricting ballot measure in California \u2014 all of which could be viewed as bellwethers for next year's midterm elections.",
      "Here are the races to watch Tuesday:",
      "New York City",
      "New York City's highly-watched mayoral election is a rare three-person race that has attracted the attention of former New Yorker, President Trump.",
      "Democrats chose Queens state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani as their nominee in the June primary, a democratic socialist whose campaign on affordability has been embraced by the grassroots. New York City is heavily Democratic, so the winner of the party's primary is generally considered the favorite to win in November. Mamdani defeated former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who led polls early in the mayoral race.",
      "Mayor Eric Adams, who was indicted on federal corruption charges in September 2024, which were dropped in the early days of the Trump administration, skipped the June Democratic primary, instead opting to be on the ballot as an independent candidate. But facing a lack of funds and polling in the single digits, Adams dropped out in September and later\u00a0threw his support behind Cuomo.",
      "Cuomo has remained in the race, and although he lagged in raising money earlier in the race, his fundraising improved in October after Adams dropped out. Mamdani, meanwhile, has shattered fundraising expectations, with his campaign saying it reached the $8 million spending cap for New York City matching funds in early September.",
      "A trio of polls released on Oct. 30 showed Mamdani with a commanding lead, though others earlier in the week showed an uptick in support for Cuomo. Early voting has substantially risen compared to 2021. Since Oct. 25, more than 730,000 New Yorkers\u00a0have cast their ballots early, compared to the\u00a0nearly 170,000 who cast their ballots early in 2021.",
      "If Mamdani, 34, wins, he will become the second-youngest mayor in New York City history as well as the first Muslim mayor. He was first elected to the state Assembly in 2020 to represent Astoria, Queens \u2014 one of the most progressive parts of New York City. Mamdani said he will ask New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch to stay on if he wins. She has not yet said whether she will accept.",
      "Cuomo, who was elected New York governor three times before resigning amid sexual misconduct allegations, has tried to paint Mamdani as an elitist, since his father is a Columbia University professor and his mother is a film director. Cuomo's father, Mario Cuomo, was a three-term governor of New York. Andrew Cuomo has also attacked Mamdani for living in a rent-stabilized apartment, even as Cuomo himself moved to his daughter's apartment in New York City before he ran for mayor.",
      "Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee in 2021, is back on the ballot on the GOP line, although some Republicans have called on him to drop out to help Cuomo's candidacy. Mr. Trump has called Sliwa \"not exactly prime time\" and suggested Cuomo would be a better mayor.",
      "All 51 seats of the New York City Council are also on the ballot. There is also a voter initiative on moving local elections to presidential election years.",
      "New Jersey governor",
      "Former GOP New Jersey state Rep. Jack Ciattarelli is making his third run for governor, after losing to Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in 2021. He's facing off against Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who's trying to deliver Democrats a third consecutive term in the governor's mansion, a feat that has not been accomplished by either party since the 1970s.",
      "Sherrill, who flipped a Republican congressional seat in 2018, is running as a moderate and trying to tie Ciattarelli to Mr. Trump. But Ciattarelli is promoting his ties to the president, and accused Sherrill in a September debate of blaming Mr. Trump for everything.",
      "Both Ciattarelli and Sherrill are appealing to voters' concerns about the high cost of living: Ciattarelli is touting a \"Make New Jersey Affordable Again\" pitch, while Sherrill features an \"Affordability Agenda\" on her campaign website.",
      "In September, CBS News reported that a branch of the National Archives released a mostly unredacted version of Sherrill's military records to an ally of Ciattarelli in error. Republicans allied with Ciattarelli have been examining Sherrill's record in the Navy, looking for information about a Naval Academy cheating scandal that implicated over 100 midshipmen. Sherrill was not accused of wrongdoing but did not walk in her graduation, which she said was because she \"didn't turn in some of my classmates.\" Sherrill had an unblemished career in the Navy and, as a midshipman, received a Navy Achievement Medal in 1991 for saving the life of a classmate.",
      "Virginia governor's race",
      "Virginia governors may not run for consecutive terms under state law, so Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin is not on the ballot.",
      "Virginia's gubernatorial election is often seen as a potential referendum on the incumbent president. The president's party often loses the Virginia governor's race, which always falls in the year following a presidential election. In recent history, Terry McAuliffe bucked that trend when he won the election in 2013, a year after President Barack Obama's reelection.",
      "The Trump administration's broadsides against the federal workforce hit Virginia hard, since the state has hundreds of thousands of civilian federal employees and thousands of government contractors and active-duty military. Most are going without pay during the government shutdown that's now stretching into its second month.",
      "Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is running against former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger in the race. Either Spanberger or Earle-Sears will make history as the commonwealth's first female governor, and if Earle-Sears wins, she will become the first female Black governor.",
      "One of Youngkin's paths to victory in 2021 was tying McAuliffe, who was running for a non-consecutive term, to unpopular progressive social issues, which Earle-Sears has tried to replicate in the race against Spanberger. But Spanberger, a former CIA operations officer, has run as a centrist and has touted endorsements from the Virginia Police Benevolent Association, which backed Youngkin in 2021, as well as former Republican Reps. Barbara Comstock and Denver Riggleman.",
      "Mr. Trump has not endorsed Earle-Sears.",
      "Virginia attorney general",
      "Democrat Jay Jones was leading incumbent Jason Miyares in a Washington Post poll in early October in the Virginia attorney general's race, but before the poll was released, text messages Jones had sent in 2022 resurfaced involving fantasies of violence against Todd Gilbert, who was then the Republican speaker of the House of Delegates.",
      "In a statement to CBS News when the messages resurfaced, Jones said he took full responsibility for his actions.",
      "But Republicans, including the president, have called on Jones to drop out. Miyares has seized on the controversy, running ads saying, \"Can you trust Jay Jones to protect your children?\"",
      "In a Washington Post poll conducted from Oct. 16-21 \u2014 after the text messages were released \u2014 Jones and Miyares were statistically tied with 46% each.",
      "California's Proposition 50",
      "Proposition 50 would allow California Democrats to temporarily change the boundaries of U.S. House districts and make them more favorable to the party. The initiative is their response to Mr. Trump's push for Republican-controlled states, like Texas, to change their congressional maps so the GOP has a better chance at holding on to its narrow House majority next year.",
      "California has 52 congressional districts, 43 represented by Democrats and nine by Republicans. The five GOP-led districts targeted under Proposition 50 are District 1, represented by Rep. Doug LaMalfa; District 3, represented by Rep. Kevin Kiley; District 22, represented by Rep. David Valadao; District 41, represented by Rep. Ken Calvert; and District 48, represented by Rep. Darrell Issa.",
      "A recent CBS News poll found that among voters who plan to support Proposition 50, one reason they're doing so is to oppose the Trump administration \u2014 which they also feel generally treats California worse than other states \u2014 and oppose national Republicans.",
      "Prop 50, according to the poll, has 62% support among likely voters.",
      "In total, more than $167.9 million has been raised in support of Prop 50 as of Oct. 28, according to the California Secretary of State's office. According to the Secretary of State's office, Top donors supporting Prop 50 include the House Majority PAC for Proposition 50, with $46 million in contributions, and billionaire investor George Soros' Fund for Policy Reform, with $10 million.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The head of the Food and Drug Administration's drug center abruptly resigned Sunday after federal officials began reviewing \"serious concerns about his personal conduct,\" according to a government spokesperson.",
      "Dr. George Tidmarsh, who was named to the FDA post in July, was placed on leave Friday after officials in the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of General Counsel were notified of the issues, HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard said in an email. Tidmarsh then resigned Sunday morning.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy expects the highest ethical standards from all individuals serving under his leadership and remains committed to full transparency,\" Hilliard said.",
      "The departure came the same day that a drugmaker connected to one of Tidmarsh's former business associates filed a lawsuit alleging that he made \"false and defamatory statements\" during his time at the FDA.",
      "The lawsuit, brought by Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, alleges that Tidmarsh used his FDA position to pursue a \"longstanding personal vendetta\" against the chair of the company's board of directors, Kevin Tang.",
      "Tang previously served as a board member of several drugmakers where Tidmarsh was an executive, including La Jolla Pharmaceutical, and Tidmarsh was involved in his ouster from those leadership positions, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Messages placed to Tidmarsh and his lawyer were not immediately returned late Sunday.",
      "Tidmarsh founded and led a series of pharmaceutical companies over several decades working in California's pharmaceutical and biotech industries. Before joining the FDA, he also served as an adjunct professor at Stanford University. He was recruited to join the agency over the summer after meeting with FDA Commissioner Marty Makary.",
      "Upheaval at FDA",
      "Tidmarsh's ouster is the latest in a string of leadership changes at the agency, which has been rocked for months by firings, departures and controversial decisions on vaccines, fluoride and other products.",
      "Dr. Vinay Prasad, who oversees FDA's vaccine and biologics center, resigned in July after coming under fire from conservative activists close to President Trump, only to rejoin the agency two weeks later at the behest of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "The FDA's drug center, which Tidmarsh oversaw, has lost more than 1,000 staffers over the past year to layoffs or resignations, according to agency figures. The center is the largest division of the FDA and is responsible for the review, safety and quality control of prescription and over-the-counter medicines.",
      "In September, Tidmarsh drew public attention for a highly unusual post on LinkedIn stating that one of Aurinia Pharmaceutical's products, a kidney drug, had \"not been shown to provide a direct clinical benefit for patients.\" It's very unusual for an FDA regulator to single out individual companies and products in public comments online.",
      "According to the company's lawsuit, Aurinia's stock dropped 20% shortly after the post, wiping out more than $350 million in shareholder value.",
      "Tidmarsh later deleted the LinkedIn post and said he had posted it in his personal capacity, not as an FDA official.",
      "Aurinia's lawsuit also alleges, among other things, that Tidmarsh used his post at FDA to target a type of thyroid drug made by another company, American Laboratories, where Tang also serves as board chair.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court of Maryland, seeks compensatory and punitive damages and \"to set the record straight,\" according to the company.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/latino-voters-new-poll-2026-midterm-elections/",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Nov 2025 05:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "According to the Unidos Bipartisan Poll of Hispanic Voters: The Road to 2026, 53% of Latino voters cite the cost of living and inflation as their leading concern.",
    "story": [
      "A sweeping new survey of 3,000 registered Latino voters across the country finds that economic anxiety continues to dominate the political mood heading into the 2026 midterm elections, with cost of living, jobs, and housing far outpacing other issues as top priorities for the nation's second-largest voting bloc.",
      "In the new survey, immigration, while still important to this increasingly swing electorate, is not the top issue but 5th behind affordability, jobs and other kitchen table issues.",
      "According to the Unidos Bipartisan Poll of Hispanic Voters: The Road to 2026, first obtained by CBS News, 53% of Latino voters cite the cost of living and inflation as their leading concern, followed by jobs and the economy (36%), housing (32%), health care (30%) and immigration reform (20%). More than one-third say the economy is worse than it was a year ago, while just 14% believe it has improved.",
      "Pocketbook concerns dominate nearly every measure of voter sentiment. Nearly two-thirds (65%) of Latino voters surveyed say President Trump and congressional Republicans are not doing enough to improve the economy \u2014 a 5-point increase since April \u2014 and half of respondents believe Mr. Trump's economic policies will make them personally worse off next year.",
      "The perception of declining economic stability is fueling discontent with Washington: 81% of Latino voters say Congress is failing to fulfill its checks-and-balances role, and 62% disapprove of how the Republican Party is leading Congress. A similar share, 61%, blame Republicans for the recent government shutdown, compared to just 22% who fault Democrats.",
      "\"Hispanic voters keep stressing the need to address low wages and the rising cost of living, yet feel that the administration and Republicans whom they hold most responsible for the shutdown are not focusing enough on this,\" Clarissa Martinez de Castro, vice president of UnidosUS, told CBS News.",
      "\"Making matters worse, Hispanic voters also feel that civil rights and freedoms, and their personal safety or that of their loved ones are at risk. Perhaps that is why an overwhelming 81% are concerned that Congress is giving the president too much authority and power.\"",
      "In the new poll by the nation's largest Latino advocacy organization, 64% of Latinos disapprove of Mr. Trump's job performance, with 13% of his 2024 supporters saying they would not vote for him again and another 9% uncertain. The issues most shaping opinions of the president include cost of living and inflation, immigration arrests and deportations, jobs, and cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs.",
      "For the president, the results mark a sharp contrast with his 2024 performance among Hispanic voters \u2014 a constituency that helped fuel his return to the White House. Now, economic pessimism and disapproval of congressional Republicans could reshape Latino turnout and partisan alignment heading into the next midterm cycle.",
      "If the midterms were held today, 52% of Latinos surveyed say they would vote for the Democratic House candidate, compared to 28% for the Republican \u2014 underscoring a widening partisan gap since 2024, when Mr. Trump carried 48% of Latino voters overall and 54% of Latino men in his successful presidential bid, according to Pew Research.",
      "By and large, Latino voters stand by their 2024 presidential vote choices, however, including those who supported the president a year ago. Asked if they had to do it over again, would they still vote for President Trump or former Vice President Harris, 78% of Trump supporters said they would and 93% of Harris supporters also responded in the affirmative.",
      "\"The fascinating part is that the Democrats haven't really lost Latino voters, but they're not winning them back,\" Daniel Garza from the right-leaning LIBRE initiative said in an interview with CBS in response to the poll. \"We're at this inflection point. And they're waiting for somebody to win them over with something positive, productive that's going to move us forward. And right now, I don't think that Trump is meeting expectations, but Democrats have done nothing. They're worse off, actually.\" Garza described them as \"obstructionists\" in the ongoing government shutdown.",
      "Garza predicts that if the economy improves by the spring under the Trump administration's economic policies, \"Democrats may lose (Latino voters) forever.\"",
      "According to the poll, Latino voters are leaning towards Democrats on a range of issues, with 55% saying the Democratic Party cares \"a great deal\" about the Latino community, compared to just 29% who say the same of Republicans. One in three view the GOP as \"hostile\" to Latinos.",
      "When asked which party they trust most on key policy areas, Democrats hold advantages on several key issues including health care. However, the GOP maintains an edge on border security.",
      "The bipartisan survey  was conducted across the country with over samples of 400 registered Latino voters in Arizona, California, Florida, Colorado, Texas and Georgia.",
      "In California, which is holding a special election on Tuesday to decide on a California ballot measure that would allow state Democrats to redraw several congressional districts to make them more favorable to their party, Latino voter turnout could wield outsized influence on how this contest plays out. California has the largest Latino-eligible electorate. Both sides of the Proposition 50 debate have been appealing to the Hispanic populations. The Democratic National Committee announced earlier this fall a bilingual organizing initiative that targets these potential voters and includes 41,000 volunteers canvassing and phone banking traditionally Latino communities in California.",
      "On the subject of immigration, the survey captures deep unease about civil liberties and public safety: 72% of those surveyed oppose a recent Supreme Court decision allowing immigration agents to use a person's language, appearance and work location as grounds for making a stop, 59% say their rights and liberties feel less secure than before, and about half oppose deploying U.S. troops to cities for crime or immigration enforcement.",
      "The high court froze a district court's temporary restraining order that prevented federal immigration authorities from stopping people in southern California by relying solely on four factors: apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or speaking English with an ascend, being at a specific location like a day laborer pickup site, and a person's occupation. In the survey, 41% of the respondents said they fear they or someone close to them might be arrested by federal immigration agents despite having legal status.",
      "Nearly half (49%) also said they are \"very concerned\" that they or someone close could become a victim of political violence, with 44% blaming the rise in such violence mostly on Republican rhetoric.",
      "The UnidosUS survey was conducted Oct. 8 through Oct. 22 by BSP Research and Shaw & Company Research, the head of which, Daron R. Shaw, serves as part of the polling team for Fox News. BSP Research conducted polls for Democrats in 2024.",
      "CBS News polling throughout the 2024 campaign pointed to dissatisfaction with the economy and rising prices as key drivers of voting decisions. This year, CBS News polling also indicated that many voters are still unhappy with the direction of the country and the economy specifically.",
      "According to a CBS News national survey last month, most Latinos rank either the economy/jobs (26%) or inflation (25%) as the most important issue facing the country. Two-thirds of Latinos rate the national economy negatively. And Mr. Trump's job approval rating has slid to 38% among Latinos, from a high of 49% at the start of his term.",
      "Mr. Trump's approval rating on handling inflation has fallen to a 32% among Latinos, and majorities say his policies are costing the U.S. jobs and making them worse off financially. Nationwide, most Latinos now say whether or not they support him, they believe that Mr. Trump is not following through on the promises he made during his campaign.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut said she \"found no credible evidence\" that protests in the city grew out of control before the president federalized the troops.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Oregon on Sunday barred President Trump's administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, until at least Friday, saying she \"found no credible evidence\" that protests in the city grew out of control before the president federalized the troops earlier this fall.",
      "The city and state sued in September to block the deployment.",
      "It's the latest development in weeks of legal back-and-forth in Portland, Chicago and other U.S. cities as the Trump administration has moved to federalize and deploy the National Guard in city streets to quell protests.",
      "The ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, an appointee of Mr. Trump, followed a three-day trial in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law.",
      "In a 16-page filing late Sunday, Immergut said she would issue a final order on Friday due to the voluminous evidence presented at trial, including more than 750 exhibits.",
      "The purpose of the deployment, according to the Trump administration, is to protect federal personnel and property where protests are occurring or likely to occur. Legal experts said that a higher appellate court order that remains in effect would have barred troops from being deployed anyway.",
      "Immergut wrote that most violence appeared to be between protesters and counter-protesters and found no evidence of \"significant damage\" to the immigration facility at the center of the protests.",
      "\"Based on the trial testimony, this Court finds no credible evidence that during the approximately two months before the President's federalization order, protests grew out of control or involved more than isolated and sporadic instances of violent conduct that resulted in no serious injuries to federal personnel,\" she wrote.",
      "The complex case comes as Democratic cities targeted by Mr. Trump for military involvement \u2014 including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue \u2014 seek to push back. They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states' sovereignty. The administration argues that it needs the troops because it has been unable to enforce the law with regular forces \u2014 one of the conditions set by Congress for calling up troops.",
      "Immergut issued two orders in early October that blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. She previously found that Mr. Trump had failed to show that he met the legal requirements for mobilizing the National Guard. She described his assessment of Portland, which Mr. Trump has called \"war-ravaged\" with \"fires all over the place,\" as \"simply untethered to the facts.\"",
      "One of Immergut's orders was paused Oct. 20 by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But late Tuesday, the appeals court vacated that decision and said it would rehear the matter before an 11-judge panel. Until the larger panel rehears the case, the appeals court's initial order from early October \u2014 under which the National Guard is federalized but not deployed \u2014 remains in effect.",
      "During the Portland trial, witnesses including local police and federal officials were questioned about the law enforcement response to the nightly protests at the city's ICE building. The demonstrations peaked in June, when Portland police declared one a riot. The demonstrations typically drew a couple dozen people in the weeks leading up to Mr. Trump's National Guard announcement.",
      "The Trump administration said it has had to shuffle federal agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the Portland protests, which it has characterized as a \"rebellion\" or \"danger of rebellion\" \u2014 another one of the conditions for calling up troops under federal law.",
      "Federal officials working in the region testified about staffing shortages and requests for more personnel that have yet to be fulfilled. Among them was an official with the Federal Protective Service, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that provides security at federal buildings, whom the judge allowed to be sworn in as a witness under his initials, R.C., due to safety concerns.",
      "R.C., who said he would be one of the most knowledgeable people in DHS about security at Portland's ICE building, testified that a troop deployment would alleviate the strain on staff. When cross-examined, however, he said he did not request troops and that he was not consulted on the matter. He also said he was \"surprised\" to learn about the deployment and that he did not agree with statements about Portland burning down.",
      "Attorneys for Portland and Oregon said city police have been able to respond to the protests. After the police department declared a riot on June 14, it changed its strategy to direct officers to intervene when person and property crime occurs, and crowd numbers have largely diminished since the end of that month, police officials testified.",
      "Another Federal Protective Service official whom the judge also allowed to testify under his initials said protesters have at times been violent, damaged the facility and acted aggressively toward officers working at the building.",
      "The ICE building closed for three weeks over the summer due to property damage, according to court documents and testimony. The regional field office director for ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, Cammilla Wamsley, said her employees worked from another building during that period. The plaintiffs argued that was evidence that they were able to continue their work functions.",
      "Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Scott Kennedy said that \"without minimizing or condoning offensive expressions\" or certain instances of criminal conduct, \"none of these incidents suggest ... that there's a rebellion or an inability to execute the laws.\"",

      "The news comes after the Pentagon announced on Oct. 24 that it would be sending the USS Gerald R. Ford, the Navy's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, to the waters off Latin America. This move dramatically increased the number of service members and ships dedicated to the Trump administration's\u00a0campaign\u00a0to counter narcotics traffickers.",
      "President Trump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States. He has asserted the U.S. is engaged in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels, relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration when it declared a war on terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.",
      "The White House has repeatedly rebuffed U.S. lawmakers in their demand that the administration release more information about the legal justification for the strikes, as well as greater details about which cartels have been targeted and the individuals killed.",
      "Hegseth, in his Saturday post announcing the latest strike, said \"narco-terrorists are bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans at home\" and the Defense Department \"will treat them EXACTLY how we treated Al-Qaeda.\"",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro said in an exclusive interview with CBS News on Oct. 24 that some of those killed in the U.S. strikes have been innocent civilians, and he reiterated his accusation that the attacks violate international law.",
      "Senate Democrats renewed their request for more information about the strikes in a letter on Friday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Hegseth.",
      "\"We also request that you provide all legal opinions related to these strikes and a list of the groups or other entities the President has deemed targetable,\" the senators wrote.",
      "Among those signing the letter were Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as well as Sens. Jack Reed, Jeanne Shaheen, Mark Warner, Chris Coons, Patty Murray and Brian Schatz.",
      "The letter says that thus far the administration \"has selectively shared what has at times been contradictory information\" with some members, \"while excluding others.\"",
      "Earlier Friday, the Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee released a pair of letters sent to Hegseth, written in late September and early October, requesting the department's legal rationale for the strikes and the list of drug cartels that the Trump administration has designated as terrorist organizations in its justification for the use of military force.",
      "Warner told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that Hegseth \"doesn't tell the truth\" on the briefing being shared on a bipartisan basis, saying \"we asked for the legal opinion back in July when it was first written.\"",
      "\"That is not the way the system is supposed to work when you further partisan national security \u2014 when we're putting troops in harm's way,\" Warner said. \"I got an aircraft carrier from Norfolk that's in the Caribbean right now. How do I answer the families of those sailors about whether this operation is even legal? This document needs to be shared with every member of the Senate this week, so that as we get into this discussion about war powers, we've got the basis of how the administration is claiming that it's legal.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 15:08:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the federal government will \"stop traffic\" if it becomes a safety issue, adding, \"We're not going to let that happen.\"",
    "story": [
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Sunday that airport delays are \"going to get worse\" as the government shutdown threatens to stretch into a fifth week and air traffic controllers were not paid this week.",
      "\"I think the real consequence is, what kind of rolling delays do you have throughout the system, right?\" Duffy said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"We've seen problems at L.A., in Dallas, in D.C., Boston, Atlanta. And so I think it's only going to get worse.\"",
      "Duffy said the federal government will \"stop traffic\" if it becomes a safety issue, adding, \"We're not going to let that happen.\"",
      "Duffy's appearance comes as ground delays were reported at major airports on Sunday, including a four-hour ground delay at Newark Liberty Airport, one of the nation's busiest transit hubs. There were staffing triggers reported at airports in Nashville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; Austin, Texas; Denver, Colorado; Northern California and Newark, New Jersey.",
      "The airport chaos is just weeks ahead of some of the busiest travel days of the year around Thanksgiving.",
      "As the government shutdown has stretched on for more than 30 days, air traffic controllers have gone without several paychecks, although they will get back pay when the shutdown ends. Duffy emphasized Sunday that air traffic controllers are being \"confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid?\"",
      "However, Duffy ruled out the Trump administration finding a way to pay air traffic controllers, similar to how the active-duty military has been paid so far. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned active-duty military personnel won't be paid on Nov. 15.",
      "\"So we're looking for pots of money to pay essential workers, but there's really strict rules around what money we can use and how we can use it, and we have to follow the law,\" Duffy said about paying air traffic controllers. \"And so we were able to fund a central air service, service to more rural communities. We've kept our academy up and running thus far. We don't have a ton of time, a couple more weeks of that funding. But I don't have the resources to do that, and the simple answer is, vote to open the government, negotiate your differences. \"",
      "While Duffy suggested on Oct. 9 that if air traffic controllers didn't show up to work, they could be \"let go,\" he said on Sunday that he doesn't plan on firing controllers.",
      "\"Again, when they're making decisions to feed their families, I'm not going to fire air traffic controllers,\" Duffy said. \"I have, I have loved them and supported them as they're trying to go through this process and it's challenging for them. They need support, they need money, they need a paycheck. They don't need to be fired.\"",
      "The Trump administration has continued to blame Democrats for the shutdown, but Democratic Sen. Mark Warner on Sunday suggested that ending the shutdown is \"going to require the active intervention of the president.\"",
      "\"The notion of at least sitting down to talk about health care, making sure that $6 billion that is set aside for SNAP benefits gets paid out so people don't go hungry and we get the government reopened again,\" Warner said in a separate appearance on \"Face the Nation.\" \"The president of the United States has said when he was not president that it's the responsibility of a president to end shutdowns. He has paid no attention to the shutdown. He's stopped his many international trips; come sit down and let's get this resolved.\"",
      "A CBS News poll released Sunday found that Americans are increasingly voicing concern about the shutdown's impact on the U.S. economy, as a big majority feel Congress isn't even working to try to end it. There's also increased worry from people over being personally affected, particularly among those with lower incomes.",

    "story": [
      "Americans are increasingly voicing concern about the shutdown's impact on the U.S. economy, as a big majority feel Congress isn't even working to try to end it.",
      "There's also increased worry from people over being personally affected, particularly among those with lower incomes, along with that concern about national impact.",
      "Politically, that means no one is \"winning\" overall: Congressional Democrats, Republicans and President Trump are all drawing increasingly negative marks for their handling of it as it has gone on.",
      "Democrats express more concern over the economic impact than Republicans do.",
      "Other governmental functions, including air travel, also draw concern due to the shutdown.",
      "Most disapprove of how all the players involved are handling it, and those views have become a bit more negative over October, the month when the shutdown began.",
      "Looking within the rank-and-file of each party, both congressional Republicans and Democrats draw majority approval from their respective partisans. But the Republican base is even more solidly approving of its delegation than the Democrats are of their own.",
      "Some of that is related to attention: the Democrats who don't approve or are unsure of their party aren't following news of the shutdown as closely. Another may be financial: Rank-and-file Democrats generally express more concern about the shutdown's effects on the economy and on themselves, and the Democrats who do approve are also a little more likely to call their own financial situation good, so they may think of themselves in a better position to weather any impact.",
      "But overall, Congress isn't perceived as even working to end it.",
      "Continued uncertainty in the economy",
      "Americans are especially sensitive because the economy continues to elicit uncertainty.",
      "Ratings of it have been bad for years \u2014 nothing much has changed there \u2014 and expectations for the coming year remain mixed at best. Support for tariffs remains negative as it has been; views of the job market are also negative \u2014 and there's also continuing concern, amid all the recent news about AI investment and the market, that AI will take jobs.",
      "But perhaps most of all, prices are still seen as rising \u2014 a reminder amid a sea of other measures that it is prices, not the rate of change in inflation, that Americans often perceive most immediately.",
      "Few expect prices to come down in the next few months, either.",
      "Those who expect continued higher prices and have a more negative outlook on the economy are particularly concerned about the economic effects of the shutdown.",
      "Politics, parties and the week ahead",
      "One year on from his election victory, most Americans do perceive Mr. Trump as trying to fulfil his campaign promises, even though many say it's a different approach than they expected \u2014 nor do all approve.",
      "And as we're reminded again this week amid more state elections, politics is about choices, not just evaluations.",
      "On the policy front, Mr. Trump and the Republicans' perceived approaches to both economic and immigration policy are today favored over the Democrats' in a straight-up comparison. (A sizable number don't seem to like either, or aren't sure.)",
      "For context, ahead of this week's races and as we head into a midterm election year, there's always the political question of how much of a factor Donald Trump will be in other contests, and whether Democrats also need to move this needle on perceived policy approach to be competitive.",
      "One item drawing attention this week is the New York mayor's race (which most people nationally say they're following, if not very closely.) We asked Democrats nationwide what they thought their party's economic policies should be as it regards socialism and capitalism \u2014 and most Democrats would see their party have a mix of both, but not more of one exclusively.",
      "And another topic in focus this week will be redistricting, where Californians will vote on a redistricting measure, while debates over redrawing lines take place across multiple states.",
      "The American public is not so keen on all that. Most of them think the lines ought to be left alone until 2030, or that more competitive \u2014 not more gerrymandered \u2014 districts ought to be drawn.",
      "Only a quarter of the public (largely, only the strongest partisans) want more districts one party can win.",
      "Specific issues",
      "Meanwhile all of that economic uncertainty \u2014 and mixed approach \u2014 does continue to take its toll on Mr. Trump's ratings on inflation and the economy, specifically. Those, along with the shutdown, continue to weigh on his overall approval, and all have been ticking down over time to their lows for this term. Inflation, in particular, sees him with two-thirds disapproving.",
      "Mr. Trump does get relatively better, if not positive, marks on immigration. That's been the case for a while, in part, because his GOP is so solidly behind him on the matter, including his deportation program, and in part because Americans overall do say border crossings are down under his administration.",
      "The negotiated peace deal between Israel and Hamas has given Mr. Trump a bump in his approval on handling that conflict. He gets relatively higher approval from independents (and Democrats to some extent)\u00a0 on handling the Israel-Hamas conflict than he does overall.",
      "He gets more positive marks on this than he does overall and on the economy, inflation and immigration, more specifically.",
      "Overall, Mr. Trump's approval has ticked down just a point from early October, and remains in the low 40s where it has generally been since mid-summer.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,124 U.S. adults interviewed between October 29-31, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So our CBS polling shows that there is real concern among Americans regarding the effect of the shutdown on all transportation. Should Americans also have safety concerns at this point?",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Listen, I think that's a great question. We work overtime to make sure the system is safe. And we will slow traffic down. You'll see delays. We'll have flights canceled to make sure the system is safe.",
      "But we have to be honest. When we have controllers, where we have shortages and towers and TRACONs doing two jobs, does it add more risk into the system? Sure, it does. But, again, we're always managing that. Again, we don't \u2013 we don't want crashes. We want people to go safely.",
      "And so we will slow and stop traffic if we don't think we can manage it in a way that keeps people safe as they go from point A to point B.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I did see that the FAA said, up in New York, 80 percent of air traffic controllers were absent from New York area airports. And, that same day, there was a near miss at La Guardia Airport. One United plane clipped another one.",
      "Was that pilot error or was that linked to some kind of shortage?",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Well, you mentioned the shortages of air traffic controllers in the New York airspace. We had a couple days ago three-hour delays throughout New York.",
      "And, again, I haven't got the readout yet on whether that was pilot error. And, usually, when these planes are \u2013 are traveling very close to each other, it's their job to stay away from one another. That's not controllers. It's usually pilot error. But, again, I will \u2013 I will have to look and see what directive was given by the air traffic controllers.",
      "But it's normally the pilot's responsibility to stay away from aircraft on the tarmac.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So if this shutdown continues, how \u2013 I \u2013 when does it become an emergency in terms of passenger safety and the safety of those who are trying to, for example, get home for Thanksgiving in a few weeks?",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Well, does it become a flight emergency, a safety issue? No. We will stop traffic. So we're not going to let that happen.",
      "I think the real consequence is, what kind of rolling delays do you have throughout the system, right? We've seen problems at L.A., in Dallas, in D.C., Boston, Atlanta. And so I think it's only going to get worse. We have controllers who some of them are new controllers. We have trainee controllers who are very helpful in the tower. They don't make a lot of money.",
      "And they're now confronted. They haven't had a paycheck for over a month. They're confronted with a decision. Do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent, or do I go to work and not get paid?",
      "And they're making decisions. I have encouraged them all to come to work. I want them to come to work. But they're making life decisions that they shouldn't have to make. Let's open the government up. Let's pay these people, these young controllers.",
      "Margaret, it's really important. And I think you've covered this. We don't have the best equipment in our towers and centers for air traffic control. But we have the safest airspace, we have the most efficient airspace because we have the best controllers in the world that work our skies and keep our people safe. They deserve a paycheck.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, given that they are so essential, is there any way the administration can find a pot of money, like seems to be getting found for others like the military\u2026",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 to pay controllers so they can show up to work? Why isn't the administration able to do that?",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Yes. Well, I think that's a great question.",
      "So we have done all we can. President Trump has done all he can to minimize the pain of the shutdown on the American people. Again, you remember, under Barack Obama's shutdown, he was trying to gate off open-air monuments in Washington, D.C., and was shutting down parks, just walking paths.",
      "President Trump has tried to make it less painful on the American people. So we're looking for pots of money to pay essential workers, but there's really strict rules around what money we can use and how we can use it, and we have to follow the law.",
      "And so we were able to fund essential air service, service to more rural communities. We've kept our academy up and running thus far. We don't have a ton of time, a couple more weeks of that funding. But I don't have the resources to do that.",
      "And the simple answer is, vote to open the government, negotiate your differences. That's fine. That's fair. But, again, these people should be paid. And to say that it's Donald Trump's fault, to say he has to find money, when Democrats have said there's no money for you because we've shut the government down, I mean, that's a contorted analysis.",
      "And Democrats are trying to do that, and I don't think it really works. Give the money and we'll pay the controllers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, well, I saw reports that air traffic controllers only received partial pay mid-October, and this past week they missed a paycheck altogether.",
      "So, practically speaking, for those who are in these jobs, would you advise them to pick up part-time work elsewhere?",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: No, I'm \u2013 I'm clearly asking them, I \u2013 come to work. It is your job to come to work, and eventually you will be paid.",
      "But as I have traveled around the country and talked to air traffic controllers, they've told me that a lot of them can navigate missing one paycheck. None of them can manage missing two paychecks. And they're like every American family.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Everyone watching your show today, as they think about their own finances, how many paychecks can they miss before it becomes real stress, real strife in their life?",
      "And so they're \u2013 at the \u2013 next week, they're going to have \u2013 they're going to get a notice of what their next paycheck is going to be. And if the government doesn't open, the notice will be another big fat zero, and you're going to see more of them probably make the decisions of funding their families, putting food on their table, gas in their cars, versus coming into work.",
      "That's not what I want, but I'm a realist as well, Margaret. These are the decisions of life and survival that these controllers have to make. By the way, it's the technicians also. We have old equipment. We have technicians that work in the towers that keep the equipment operational.",
      "They're not getting paid. I have train inspectors who are working to keep our trains running, and running safely. They're working without pay. I have pipeline inspectors, same thing. Across the system, we have a number of people who are working without pay. We talk about the air traffic controllers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: But I have thousands of employees who are showing up, doing the work and trying to keep this system safe for the American people. All the while, they don't get paid to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "So you said back on Fox Business on October 9 that \"I can't have people not showing up for work\" and that they may be let go. There's a shortage of 4,000 controllers already. You're not firing people, are you? You can't afford to.",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: No, so, when \u2013 we're 2,000 to 3,000 controllers short, but that's a huge number. And you make an interesting point, because I have tried to surge air traffic controllers into the system through our academy.",
      "Margaret, we're up 20 percent of controllers through the academy this year alone. It takes them about a year to two to get certified in a tower, but this shutdown is impacting my pipeline of controllers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: And so as \u2013 when everyone forgets about air traffic control and the shutdown, I'm going to deal with the consequences of, again, delivering for the American people and getting more controllers in the towers, not less.",
      "And you bring up a good point. We're already stressed, in that we don't have enough controllers in our system. And this shutdown, when we have staffing triggers where they're not coming in because they're funding their families and food on their tables, that makes it more difficult because we're already short long. Long-term consequences\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're not going to fire them?",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: I don't plan on firing control \u2013 no, listen, I have \u2013 no, I \u2013 again, when they're making decisions to feed their families, I'm not going to fire air traffic controllers. I have \u2013 I have loved them and supported them as they're trying to go through this process and it's challenging for them.",
      "They need support. They need money. They need a paycheck. They don't need to be fired.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Secretary Duffy, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For more from our latest CBS News poll, we turn to our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "So, Anthony, how are people feeling about the economy?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: I will start with prices, because that's where people tell us they start.",
      "They see prices as still high. They expect prices to keep going up. In some respects, that's not new. That's been the case for years, but that's rather the point. Things haven't changed. So the ratings are still very low for the economy.",
      "On another front, the stock market's going up. There's been an A.I. boom helping fuel that, but people have very mixed views of the U.S. job market. And part of that is, they think A.I. may come along and take their jobs, they tell us, right?",
      "Now, here's how that all plays politically, Margaret. And that is, on ratings for handling the economy, handling inflation, the president's ratings have been ticking down through the course of his term and continue to do so. That's a big reason that he won a year ago. That's one of the things they \u2013 people tell us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The economy.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: On the economy. People tell us today they still rate him on that and on handling immigration, where he does relatively a little bit better, especially with the base.",
      "But what I did was, I asked people, OK, compared to a year ago, do you think the president is trying to keep his campaign promises? And most people say yes. There's a but there. And there's a substantial number who say, but his approach isn't what they expected. And they're more mixed on that.",
      "So they see, and some give credit for trying. But for things like tariffs as it regards to the economy, the approach is much more mixed. And that underlines all those ratings for him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we have an election in some states Tuesday. What should we be watching for?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, he will certainly be a factor. I think the question for Democrats as you watch these races is, can they just run against him?",
      "So what I did was, I asked them \u2013 asked folks to compare nationally Donald Trump's approach and what they perceive as the Democrats' approach. And Donald Trump still leads the Democrats on those measures for the economy and on immigration.",
      "And what that tells you is, it may be, as you watch these races, Democrats can't just run against Donald Trump. They have got to have ideas of their own. We will see these races as sort of testing labs for what the parties may do ahead of 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be watching that closely.",
      "Anthony Salvanto, busy week for you.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Indeed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I know you've been in and out of Washington. But largely, the House members have not been here in town. The House hasn't voted since September 19th. It will be the seventh consecutive week now that they've been working from home. Would you urge Speaker Johnson to bring everyone back to try to break the impasse over government funding?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: It's up to the speaker. House Republicans and House Democrats coming back to Washington will not break the impasse. Let's not forget that the House passed a clean CR. And it was a temporary CR, OK.",
      "And, you know, Democrats keep saying, you know, the Republicans have no intent to negotiate. We can't trust them to want to negotiate if we reopen the government. That's nonsense. If we \u2013 look, if we had passed a year- long CR, I think they could make that argument. That's usually an indicator that we really don't want to talk about the budget right now. We want to \u2013 we want to kick the can down the road for a year.",
      "But when you pass a very short-term duration CR, a seven-week one \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: It is a clear indication that we intend on continuing those conversations.",
      "So, look, there's other things we could do. The reason I keep going back is because I work on the Intelligence Committee and I have to do that work from inside D.C. There's a number of reasons people go back.",
      "But, look, in the end, the Senate has to deal with this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: And Senate Democrats just have to reopen the government. It's that simple. They voted \u2013 I don't know, what is it, 15 times now to keep it closed?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: They wouldn't even vote to keep federal workers paid. I \u2013 that was a crazy lifeline that \u2013 that Senator Thune gave them, allowing them to vote \u2013 almost having the easy way out, allow them to at least vote to take the pain off of federal workers, and they voted that down, too. I really don't know what their strategy is at this point. They're the ones who need to figure this out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 so you heard \u2013 perhaps you heard Senator Warner at the top of the program say, you know, conversations are happening this week. He was hoping that there would be some \u2013 some end.",
      "On \u2013 on your side of the \u2013 of the Capitol, you're saying you don't see signs of this ending this week?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Don't see what? Sorry? Yes, I don't \u2013 I don't \u2013 I don't see us going back into session. I think we would have been notified by now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: But, again, the impasse is not in the House. You know, we passed it out of the House. I realize that \u2013 that it was \u2013 there was a Democrat (ph) vote there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. But to come to an agreement, which is what he was \u2013 the senator was talking about everyone getting together and going to the White House with the president to \u2013 to hammer this out, the speaker at least. It doesn't sound like you have that level of optimism.",
      "But let \u2013 let's talk about the impact where you are. Your district includes parts of Houston. We checked the numbers and it appears 350,000 Houston area families may have some difficulty with their food stamps, these SNAP benefits, because of the standoff. Have you gotten any guidance from the state or from the administration about whether people get food payments this week?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Well, from what I can tell from the administration's statements, I mean, they're going to try to use the emergency contingency fund for \u2013 on a temporary basis.",
      "But look, the entire \u2013 I think there's about $6 billion in the fund.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Monthly SNAP benefits cost Americans $9 billion. So, that's \u2013 that is a very, very small band-aid. And the only way you're going to get SNAP benefits back on track is if Democrats vote for our clean CR.",
      "I visit a food bank recently. Yes, they're \u2013 they're preparing for a huge influx in demand.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: You know, the state could only do so much on this. Every \u2013 we \u2013 we \u2013 all of us can only do so much. There's \u2013 there's a really simple solution to this, which is, just keep the government open. And, you know, you want to negotiate this very complex health care issue, which is what Democrats say they want. I think they've kind of chose it out of randomly and all of a sudden decided to throw this temper tantrum.",
      "But, fine, let's negotiate it. But you have to do it with the government open and not hold \u2013 you're not holding a gun to our heads. You're holding a gun to the regular American people's heads.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are on the Intelligence Committee. You mentioned you had \u2013 have had to come back here to view what I assume is classified intelligence. The president confirmed a few weeks back that he had authorized some CIA activity in Venezuela. He didn't give detail on that. But have you seen any evidence that the U.S. pressure campaign on Nicolas Maduro is working? That all this military hardware that's being moved around into the region is doing something?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: I can \u2013 I can only tell you what I can assume. Look, having been out of session, we aren't getting the briefings because \u2013 because we aren't there. One of the reasons I keep going back is to look into these things.",
      "The broader question, this is more of a geopolitical question, is the pressure campaign working? Look, deterrence almost always works, especially when you're dealing with \u2013 with, you know, dictators like Maduro. They only listen to one thing, which is power.",
      "And \u2013 and Venezuela has been largely left alone by American administrations. The western hemisphere has been left alone.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: And I think this president's taking it much more seriously. Look, the Venezuelan government is a \u2013 it's \u2013 it's \u2013 it's a fake government, right? He ran a rigged election. Everyone knows that. It's propped up by the Cubans and by the Russians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: They have been in collusion with terrorist groups, like the FARC, for years. It has been an annoyance to countries like Colombia for years. There's many high-ranking officials in government \u2013 in Venezuelan government that are literally under indictment for drug trafficking. It is effectively a narco terrorist state supporting narco terrorists.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Maduro is still in power. Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Maduro, what? I'm sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he still is in \u2013 in power. That's what \u2013 we were just talking about that with Senator Warner, the need for more information to go to lawmakers about exactly what the extent is going to be of U.S. military involvement. Would you support U.S. land strikes of Venezuela?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Actually, boots on the ground in Venezuela?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Land strikes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Yes, I mean I think we would have to have a longer conversation about doing something to that extent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: But I think what the \u2013 what the president is doing right now is very much within rational legal means, looking at drug boats that we have \u2013 that \u2013 and people ask, though, do we have the intelligence to really know what these drug boats are and who's on them? Yes, we do. That I can say. Right. We have \u2013 we have multisource intelligence that we \u2013 so, we know for sure what we're \u2013 what we're actually shooting at. And we don't even shoot at all the targets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: And people say, well, why can't you just interdict it all? And I say, well, how \u2013 how many boats do you think we have? How many boats and helicopters do you think we have?",

      "I've had a long-standing feud with Tucker Carlson. I'm glad everyone is also waking up now to how bad of a person he is. He's changed a lot over the last 20 years. You know, hard to say why. But it doesn't really matter why. I mean you have a guy like Fuentes on your show. You're \u2013 you're uplifting what is \u2013 a guy who has really fallen off the radar, you know?",
      "He \u2013 he used to send his followers to my events and try to ask me a bunch of questions about the Jews and Israel support and all that and try to disrupt events and they would try to infiltrate the MAGA movement. You know, they were really on a \u2013 on a downhill slide. And for Tucker to have him on, you know, Senator Cruz is exactly right. And this idea that we have to, you know, that it's cancel culture if we \u2013 if we \u2013 if we \u2013 if we keep Tucker out of our circles from now on is just nonsense. It's a \u2013 I literally wrote a book on cancel culture. So, you know, I've thought deeply about this.",
      "Cancel culture means you're \u2013 you're canceling someone for what is basically a mainstream belief, or maybe a \u2013 maybe small \u2013 like honest mistake they made. That would be maybe considered cancel culture. It's not cancel culture when you say, look, I want to disassociate myself from you because your believes are crazy and you're psychopathic.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A family of four receiving food stamps makes $31,000 or less per year. That program gives less than $200 a month to one in eight Americans. That's 42 million people. I know you joined this lawsuit to try to sue the administration to get them to use emergency funding to pay for food stamps during the government shutdown. Given what happened with the courts Friday, will food stamp payments be going out this week? It's your state that has to administer the program, right?",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: Yes. I don't know, Margaret, because the president hasn't said whether he's going to approve the release of those contingency funds. I mean, the impact of this is just devastating. One in eight Americans, you say. I have about one in seven Massachusetts residents who are on SNAP. I was at food pantries yesterday. I mean people across our state do not want to see people go hungry. But people woke up on Saturday morning not having access to their benefits.",
      "The reason we sued, Margaret, 28 states, and I'm glad and grateful to the A.G.s for getting the favorable ruling. It basically tells the president, do what you're supposed to do, which is, use the contingency funds that have been set aside for exactly this purpose. When there is a shutdown, among other things, release those funds, continue the SNAP payments to our states.",
      "I strongly urge that. I hope it happens immediately on Monday. People in this country should not go hungry. And I think Americans don't want to see their brothers and sisters go hungry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that federal judge in Rhode Island ordered full payments by Monday or partial SNAP payments by Wednesday. On another network the Treasury secretary was asked if \u2013 if the administration would do just that, and he said, \"could be.\"",
      "Practically speaking, how do you \u2013 how quickly can you turn it on? I mean if that comes through Wednesday, do people in Massachusetts get to eat on Thursday?",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: No. I mean the problem, Margaret, with what the president has done is that he cut this off. And it takes a few days to load up those cards. I mean anywhere between two and five days.",
      "I will tell you what I am doing as governor, because I've got to protect my residents. I've got to work with others to make sure that they are fed. We've advanced funding to our food pantries. We stood up a United Way fund and already, you know, 3 million, I think, in contributions have come through this week. We have seen an incredible outpouring of volunteers. I was at food pantries yesterday and the turnout is something.",
      "And, you know, but \u2013 but this is not sustainable, right? I mean we cannot continue along this path, which is why he needs to release those funds as at least one court told him to do right now, as soon as possible, because it takes us time to load up those cards.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, here's how President Trump described the shutdown impact Friday. Take a listen.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All they have to do is say, the government is open, and that's the end of it. And, you know, largely, when you talk about SNAP, you're talking about largely Democrats. But I'm president. I want to help everybody. I want to help Democrats and Republicans. But when you're talking about SNAP, if you look, it's largely Democrats. They're hurting their own people.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Doesn't he have a point that your party is responsible for some of this pain?",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: Yes, absolutely not. And, frankly, that's a really insulting comment.",
      "You know, Margaret, I've got 21,000 veterans, men and women who have served our country, who are SNAP beneficiaries in Massachusetts, who had their benefits turned off, who face hunger right now. To be clear, you want to know who SNAP beneficiaries are in the country? They're our seniors, they're kids, and they're people with disabilities. They live in every state, and every city and town around the country. And for the president to even suggest something like that or say something like that is insulting.",
      "And this is the part \u2013 this is the problem with D.C. You showed the poll, right? I mean, at the end of the day, the president and Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House. And, you know, Mike Johnson hasn't had these guys back in session I think but for 12 out of 100 of the last days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: So, get back to Washington. Get back to the table. Sort this out. Americans want to see that people are fed. They want to make sure that they have access to childcare, because health \u2013 Headstart's getting turned off, too. And they don't want to see their health premiums go up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: I mean that's what's happening right now. And the impact is being felt everywhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We checked and the top five states are districts with the highest percentage of residents who use food stamps are in New Mexico, D.C., Louisiana, Oregon, and Oklahoma. Two of those states are ruby red and voted for President Trump in last election. I think that's what you're pointing to in terms of insult.",
      "But on the substance of why we are in this shutdown, Democrats have refused to sign on to a clean government funding bill. On that point, don't Democrats bear some responsibilities?",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: What Democrats in Congress did is stand with hundreds of thousands, millions of Americans right now who are seeing their premiums go up. I've got people in Massachusetts who just got notices because of the expiration of these subsidies. They're going to see their premiums rise as much as $20,000. American families can't afford that, you know?",
      "And I'm focused on economic hardship and what I can do to protect my people. And I think most of us are in our states as governors. Which is why the folks in D.C. need to get back to work. Mike Johnson needs to call his members back because, how are you going to get a negotiation if you're not even in D.C., right? You got to get back to D.C. The president has got to give a clear directive to Republicans that they need to reopen government because Americans are suffering and continue to suffer every single day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Healey, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Juan Andrade, CEO of financial services company USAA. Many of its nearly 14 million customers are in the military or veterans. And he joins us from San Antonio.",
      "Sir, Secretary Bessent said on this program just last Sunday that by November 15th the troops and service members aren't going to be paid. What level of anxiety are you seeing among your customers?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE (President and CEO, USAA): Margaret, thank you for having me on your show.",
      "What we're seeing today is uncertainty, anxiety, and, for some, real hardship. And that's really within the \u2013 the active duty community. It's also important to note that 30 percent of federal employees are also veterans or military spouses. So, this is more than an impact to a Household budget. This can really undermine morale and focus. And our goal is to provide stability for people who are living paycheck to paycheck and who are, frankly, losing ground.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I've seen that you're offering interest free loans to customer. Is that everyone or just specifically active duty military? And if they can't qualify for a loan, what do they do?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE: So, we're offering our government shutdown program to all eligible members of USAA. So, as you said, that's currently about 14.5 million people. And at that point we've acted swiftly and decisively. In the first 48 hours of the shutdown, we funded $150 million in zero interest loans. We are now up to $400 million to date. But that's also in addition to payment extensions that we've done on credit cards, auto loans, mortgages. We've also waived fees for overdraft. And we've also had flexible insurance arrangements across our property casualty, life, and health insurance businesses.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: $400 million in zero interest loans. So, people are already looking to try to figure out how to make ends meet.",
      "We looked, and a quarter of all active-duty military members are food insecure according to the Department of Agriculture. That was well before this shutdown. That means they don't have a good diet or they're not able to afford food.",
      "We already saw strain on a lot of that active-duty military. Can you give us a sense of what this means for someone now to look at the calendar and know November 15th there's no pay coming?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE: Yes. And I agree. This is one of the reasons why we've already funded 400 million in loans at this point in time. People are preparing for an uncertain period of time. And this is very important to them, particularly if we think about our younger enlisted, and particularly those with families.",
      "Dual incomes in military families is not a luxury, it's a necessity. So, these are people that we're very worried about. And we want to make sure that they're stable through this period of time.",
      "The other part of this, and, frankly, the reason for doing these zero interest loans, is we want to make sure that they don't turn to high interest rate payday loans or high interest rate credit cards at the same time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the unemployment rate among civilian military spouses is almost five times the national average, to your point, they need dual income. Many can't do that.",
      "But the Congressional Budget Office projection is that there will be an economic cost. That the shutdown itself could lead to $7 billion to $14 billion in lost growth. What's the impact on the communities like yours where you are living down in Texas, you know, in areas where there are bases around this country?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE: Sure. I think you see it in a few ways. I think one is definitely on consumer spending. Right now people are prioritizing basic needs, whether it's health or food at this point in time. So, they're definitely cutting back on \u2013 on discretionary spending. I think that's part of that.",
      "The other aspect of it is, you're going to see more people who are food insecure. And this is one of the reasons why we have also been supporting our local communities. Our offices are all located near major military installations. And we have donated millions to military aid societies who are best positioned to provide food and over services in installations. And we've also been donating to local food banks in our communities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, how does this compare to the last extended shutdown that we had during the first Trump administration?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE: The last shutdown basically has not \u2013 did not last as long. I think that was a big part of that. And we also had the certainty that the military would be getting paid. Now, clearly, up until now, they have been getting paid. The question of the uncertainty that we're seeing from our members is, what happens over the next couple of weeks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you were already planning for that November 15 \u2013 when you say the shutdown wasn't this long, you were assuming the government does not get funded for how long?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE: We're already \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How long can you keep doing this?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE: We're already planning for a second loan to members. So, we've had a number take us up certainly on the first offer of loan. Now they're taking us up on the second offer of loan. And we're prepared to assist. That's our job. And to take our members in the military community. So, we will keep up with this. And if we have to do more, we will do more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Well, we \u2013 we are thinking of your customers at this time. We'll continue to track what happens with that real-world impact.",

It basically tells the President do what you're supposed to do, which is use the contingency funds that have been set aside for exactly this purpose, when there is a shutdown among other things, release those funds, continue the SNAP payments to our states. I strongly urge that. I hope it happens immediately on Monday. People in this country should not go hungry, and I think Americans don't want to see their brothers and sisters go hungry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that federal judge in Rhode Island ordered full payments by Monday or partial SNAP payments by Wednesday. On another network, the Treasury Secretary was asked if, if the administration would do just that, and he said, could be. Practically speaking how do you, how quickly can you turn it on? I mean, if that comes through Wednesday, do people in Massachusetts get to eat on Thursday?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: No. I mean the problem, Margaret, with what the President has done is that he cut this off and it takes a few days to load up those cards. I mean anywhere between two and five days. I will tell you what I am doing as governor because I've got to protect my residents. I've got to work with others to make sure that they are fed. We've advanced funding to our food pantries. We stood up a United Way fund, and already, you know, 3 million, I think, in contributions have come through this week. We have seen an incredible outpouring of volunteers. I was at food pantries yesterday, and the turnout is something. And, you know, but, but this is not sustainable. Right? I mean we cannot continue along this path, which is why he needs to release those funds, as at least one court told him to do, right now. As soon as possible, because it takes us time to load up those cards.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So here's how President Trump described the shutdown impact Friday. Take a listen.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All they have to do is say the government is open, and that's the end of it. And you know, largely, when you talk about SNAP, you're talking about largely Democrats. But I'm President, I want to help everybody. I want to help Democrats and Republicans. But when you're talking about SNAP, if you look, it's largely Democrats. They're hurting their own people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Doesn't he have a point that your party is responsible for some of this pain?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: Absolutely not and, frankly, that's a really insulting comment. You know, Margaret, I've got 21,000 veterans, men and women who have served our country, who are SNAP beneficiaries in Massachusetts, who had their benefits turned off, who face hunger right now. To be clear, you want to know who SNAP beneficiaries are in this country? They're our seniors, they're kids, and they're people with disabilities. They live in every state, in every city and town around this country. And for the President to even suggest something like that or to say something like that is insulting. And this is the part, this is the problem with, with D.C. You showed the poll, right? I mean, at the end of the day, the President and Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House, and, you know, Mike Johnson hasn't had these guys back in session, I think, but for 12 out of 100 of the last days. So get back to Washington, get back to the table. Sort this out. Americans want to see that people are fed. They want to make sure that they have access to child care, because health, Head Start's getting turned off too. And they don't want to see their health premiums go up. I mean, that's what's happening right now, and the impact is being felt everywhere",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We checked and the top five states or districts with the highest percentage of residents who use food stamps are New Mexico, D.C., Louisiana, Oregon and Oklahoma. Two of those states are ruby red and voted for President Trump in last election. I think that's what you're pointing to in terms of insult, but on the substance of why we are in this shut down, Democrats have refused to sign on to a clean government funding bill. On that point, don't Democrats bear some responsibility?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: What Democrats in Congress did is stand with hundreds of\u00a0 thousands, millions of Americans right now who are seeing their premiums go up. I've got people in Massachusetts who just got notices because of the expiration of the subsidies. They're going to see their premiums rise as much as $20,000. American families can't afford that, you know. And I'm focused on economic hardship and what I can do to protect my people and I think most of us are in our states as governors, which is why the folks in D.C. need to get back to work. Mike Johnson needs to call his members back because how are you going to get a negotiation if you're not even in D.C., right? You got to get back to D.C. The president has got to give a clear directive to Republicans that they need to reopen government because Americans are suffering and continue to suffer every single day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, Healy, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\" We turn now to Texas Republican Congressman Dan Crenshaw, who joins us this morning from Humble, Texas. Welcome to \"Face the Nation.\"",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I know you've been in and out of Washington, but largely that the House members have not been here in town. The House hasn't voted since September 19. It will be the seventh consecutive week now that they've been working from home. Would you urge Speaker Johnson to bring everyone back to try to break the impasse over government funding?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: It's up to the Speaker. House Republicans and House Democrats coming back to Washington, will not break the impasse. Let's not forget that the House passed a clean CR. It was a temporary CR, okay. And you know, Democrats keep saying the Republicans have no intent to negotiate. We can't trust them to want to negotiate if we reopen the government. That's nonsense. If we had- look, if we had passed a year-long CR, I think they could make that argument. That's usually an indicator that we really don't want to talk about the budget right now, we want to- we want to keep the can down the road for a year. But when you pass a very short term duration CR, a seven-week one, it is a clear indication that we intend on continuing those conversations. So look, there's other things we could do. The reason I keep going back is because I work on the Intelligence Committee, and I have to do that work from inside DC. There's a number of reasons people go back. But look, in the end, the Senate has to deal with this, and Senate Democrats just have to reopen the government. It's that simple. They voted- I don't even what is it, 15 times now, to keep it closed. They wouldn't even vote to keep federal workers paid. That was a crazy lifeline that Senator Thune gave them, allowing them to vote, almost have the easy way out, allow them to at least vote to take the pain off of federal workers. And they voted that down too. I really don't know what their strategy is at this point. They're the ones that need to figure this out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you heard- perhaps you heard Senator Warner at the top of the program say, you know, conversations are happening this week. He was hoping that there would be some- some end. On your side of the- of the Capitol. You're saying you don't see signs of this ending this week?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Don't see what- sorry, yeah- I don't, I don't see us going back into session. I think we would have been notified by now. Yeah, but again, the impasse is not in the House. You know, we passed it out of the House--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Understood-- but to come to an agreement, which is was- the senator was talking about everyone getting together and going to the White House with the President to hammer this out. The speaker, at least, it doesn't sound like you have that level of optimism. But let's talk about the impact where you are. Your district includes parts of Houston. We checked the numbers, and it appears 350,000 Houston area families may have some difficulty with their food stamps, these SNAP benefits because of the standoff. Have you gotten any guidance from the state or from the administration about whether people get food payments this week?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Well, from what I can tell from the administration's statements, I mean, they're going to try to use the emergency contingency fund for- on a temporary basis. But look the entire- I think there's about $6 billion in that fund. The monthly SNAP benefits cost Americans $9 billion so that's- that is a very, very small band aid. And the only way you're going to get SNAP benefits back on track is if Democrats vote for our clean CR. I visited a food bank recently. Yeah, they're preparing for a huge influx in demand. You know, the state can only do so much on this. We- all of us can only do so much there's- there's a really simple solution to this, which is just keep the government open and you know, you want to negotiate this very complex health care issue, which is what Democrats say they want. I think they kind of chose it out of- randomly, and all of a sudden decided throw this temper tantrum. But fine, let's negotiate it, but you have to do it with the government open and not hold- you're not holding a gun to our heads. You're holding a gun to the regular American people's heads.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are on the Intelligence Committee. You mentioned you had, have had to come back here to view what I assume is classified intelligence. The President confirmed a few weeks back that he had authorized some CIA activity in Venezuela, he didn't give detail on that, but have you seen any evidence that the US pressure campaign on Nicolas Maduro is working, that all this military hardware that's being moved around into the region is doing something?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: I can only tell you what I can assume, having been out of session, we aren't getting the briefings because- because we aren't there. One of the reasons I keep going back is to look into these things. The broader question- this is more of a geopolitical question, is the pressure campaign working? Well, look, deterrence almost always works, especially when you're dealing with- with dictators like Maduro. They only listen to one thing, which is power. And Venezuela has been largely left alone by American administrations. The western hemisphere has been left alone, and I think this President is taking it much more seriously. Look, the Venezuelan government is a, it's- it's- it's a fake government, right? He ran a rigged election. Everyone knows that it's propped up by the Cubans and by the Russians. They have been in collusion with terrorist groups like the FARC for years. It has been an annoyance to countries like Colombia for years. There's many high-level ranking officials in government- in Venezuelan government that are literally under indictment for drug trafficking. It is effectively a narco-terrorist state--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But Maduro is still in power--",
      "REP. CRENSHAW:-- Maduro, what? Sorry--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that he still is in- in power. That's what we were just talking about that with Senator Warner. The- the need for more information to go to lawmakers about exactly what the extent is going to be of US military involvement. Would you support US land strikes in Venezuela?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Actually boots on the ground in Venezuela?--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Land strikes--",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: -- I think we would have to have to have a longer conversation about doing something to that extent. But I think what the- what the President is doing right now is very much within rational legal means, looking at drug boats that we have- people ask, do we have the intelligence to really know what these drug boats are and who's on them? Yes, we do. That I can say, right. We have multi-source intelligence that- so we know for sure what we're- what we're- what we're actually shooting at, and we don't even shoot at all the targets. And people say, well, why can't you just interdict it all? And I say, well how many boats do you think we have? How many boats and helicopters do you think you have? And you know how risky an interdiction operation is? You're going to people- put people's lives at stake. And you know, we've been doing that for years, and it hasn't worked. So, you do need to try something new, because it is an imminent harm to the United States, and that's clearly within the President's authority under Article Two. So, I don't wring my hands over what's going on right now. Talking hypotheticals about invading Venezuela. I mean, that's not really what we're talking about right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No- no, I was asked about land strikes. But- but let me ask you about something some of your fellow conservatives have been talking quite a lot about including Mitch McConnell, he's been concerned about antisemitism. On the right, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said he's seen more antisemitism in the past six months than in his entire life. Take a listen.",
      "(START SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "SEN. TED CRUZ: \"This is a poison, and I believe we are facing an existential crisis in our party and in our country. ///// If you sit there with someone who says Adolf Hitler was very cool and that their mission is to combat and defeat global Jewry, and you say nothing, then you are a coward, and you are complicit in that evil.\"",
      "(END SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was specifically referring there to a widely watched interview Tucker Carlson did with far-right commentator and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes. Do you share Senator Cruz's concern about your party?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Oh, yeah. Mr. Cruz, put it pretty well. I've had a long-standing feud with Tucker Carlson. I'm glad everyone else is- is also waking up now to how bad of a person he is. He's changed a lot over the last 20 years. You know, hard to say why, but it doesn't really matter why. I mean, you have a guy like Fuentes on your show, you're- you're uplifting what is a guy who has really fallen off the radar. You know, he- he used to send his followers to my events and try to ask me a bunch of questions about the Jews and Israel support and all that, and try to disrupt events. And they would try to infiltrate the MAGA movement. You know, they were really on a downhill slide. And for Tucker to have him on- Senator Cruz is exactly right. And this idea that we have to, you know, that it's cancel culture, if we- if we- if we- if we keep Tucker out of our circles from now on, is just nonsense. I literally wrote a book on cancel culture. So, you know, I've thought deeply about this. Cancel culture means you're- you're canceling someone for what is basically a mainstream belief, or maybe- maybe a small, like, honest mistake they made that would be maybe considered cancel culture. It's not cancel culture when you say, look, I want to disassociate myself from you because your beliefs are crazy and you're psychopathic and you're- you are falling apart in front of everyone. You know this disassociation is not canceling anyone, and I know some have suggested it is. So, I think moral- moral clarity is a lot more important in this case.",

      "SEN. MARK WARNER: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on this shutdown, we have seen the CEO of all the major airlines come out. The union that represents the air traffic controllers all support the Republican position of just quickly fund the government with a short term clean spending bill. The American Federation of Government Employees also echoing that, AFSA, which represents the diplomats our country has, are coming out and saying that. They're saying in high threat posts they don't have armored vehicles because they can't afford to repair them. Cyber-attacks are up. Consular officers are paying out of pocket to visit ill or incarcerated Americans. Medication shipments aren't arriving, bills aren't being paid. At what point does all of this pain and pressure end the shutdown?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I hope it ends it this week. Frankly, I see it from my folks. I was greeting voters yesterday, we have early- early vote for our gubernatorial election, but I hear people also very angry at this president. I mean, we knew this wasn't going to end unless Donald Trump was back in the country. He's now back in the country. He got to go ahead and put America first and sit down with us, deal with the health care shortage, deal as well- and to show the just cruelty of this administration, there were $6 billion set aside for SNAP benefits. He's had judges say spend that money. We're still waiting to see whether the administration wants to appeal that. Get the money out to people in need, sit down with us, get this resolved this week, and let's get everybody back to work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say it's going to end this week, does that mean you're going to see more Democrats cross the aisle and agree to vote for a short term spending bill--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "SEN. WARNER: What I think it means is that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --three have.",
      "[CROSSTALK ENDS]",
      "SEN. WARNER: What we've seen from your polling, everything else, it's a pox on both your houses. We got to put this to bed. It's going to require Trump in the room. It's why the bipartisan conversation so far, I don't think we'll ever get to yes, because unfortunately, my Republican colleagues can't move on anything without a Trump sign off. Trump has spent enough time going out there now trying to audition for a Nobel Prize, running around the world. Come back and put America first. Sit down and let's get this resolved. It can be done in an hour using Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, what is the Democratic ask at this point to get that. Because leader Thune said, hey, I'll talk to you about health care open the government first.",
      "SEN. WARNER: The Democratic ask is- everyone, as of Saturday, saw health care rates skyrocket. This is an immediate crisis too--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, we've blown past that date of November 1--",
      "SEN. WARNER: They can- we can- but we can deal with this jointly, but it's going to require the active intervention of the President.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning you need to see some sort of negotiation on an extension to government health care subsidies before voting to reopen the government?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Listen, President Trump has ended up- and I'm a big supporter of Ukraine, has met more with Volodymyr Zelenskyy this year than he's met with any Democrat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the ask is the meeting?",
      "SEN. WARNER: The meeting is, let's sit down and resolve it. I can't believe Donald Trump, the great deal maker of deal makers- who at least how he presents himself, sitting down with us, we couldn't reach an agreement in an hour.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But at this point, what I hear you saying is, you are not willing to cross the aisle for an immediate, short term funding bill that is clean. You still need a negotiation over health care.",
      "SEN. WARNER: The notion of at least sitting down to talk about health care, making sure that $6 billion that is set aside for SNAP benefits gets paid out so people don't go hungry and we get the government reopened again. The President of the United States has said when he was not President that it's the responsibility of a president to end shutdowns. He has paid no attention to the shutdown. He's- stopped his many international trips, come sit down and let's get this resolved.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And there's been outreach, or there hasn't been outreach?",
      "SEN. WARNER: There's lots of conversations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when you say you're optimistic- or would you say you're optimistic about it after this week?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I think as- what your poll indicated, people are pox on both your houses at this point, get the darn thing open. Deal with the health care cliff. Don't let people go hungry when we've got money set aside on SNAP. That can all be accomplished, sooner the better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be talking about those food stamps later in the program. I want to ask you about your national security portfolio. Just overnight, there was another US strike on an alleged drug boat. I know you have been concerned that Democrats are being excluded, particularly from a key meeting that happened this past week with only Republicans in the room. Secretary Hegseth was asked shortly after your press conference by our Ellee Watson of CBS about his plans to share evidence with Congress. Take a listen.",
      "[SOT]",
      "SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PETE HEGSETH: We are presenting it to Congress. We have time and time again on a bipartisan basis they have been given the evidence directly.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says it's been given. So is your complaint that the evidence is not sufficient, or you disagree with the--",
      "SEN. WARNER: The Secretary of Defense doesn't tell the truth on this matter, we asked for the legal opinion back in July when it was first written. We had been promised it time and again. The Secretary of State, my former colleague and friend, Marco Rubio, looked me in the eye nine days ago and said, Mark, you're going to get it right away. We still didn't get the legal opinion. And then a group of random Republican senators was shared on a partisan basis what is the President's understanding of why these- why it's legal to take these actions. That- you know Margaret, that is not the way the system is supposed to work. When you further partisan national security- when we're putting troops in harm's way. I got an aircraft carrier from Norfolk that's in the Caribbean right now. How do I answer the families of those sailors about whether this operation is even legal? This document needs to be shared with every member of the Senate this week, so that as we get into this discussion about war powers, we've got the basis of how the administration is claiming that it's legal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know the administration says this isn't about war powers that the President has has authorities under Title Two. But let me read to you, because the White House knew you were coming on, they reached out to us yesterday to assert they've provided six bipartisan briefings to members or staff, including your staff, plus the Gang of Eight. A senior Administration official also said classified documents were made available.",
      "SEN. WARNER: There were no classified documents made available to the Gang of Eight members until after a partisan briefing was made to Republicans only. That is not the way our system is supposed to work. If you want to put Americans in harm's way, it needs to be done on a bipartisan basis. My Republican colleagues, many of them afterwards, said, oh yeah, that was not really good. Well, I wish they would have got up and walked out of the damn room, because everyone knows partisanship should not be involved in these national security matters, particularly when we're putting our soldiers and sailors in harm's way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it wasn't just you. The Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican and his Democratic colleague, Jack Reed, said they have twice written to Secretary Hegseth, asking for execute orders specifically legal justifications and the list of terror organizations tied to these strikes. They don't have that information, and they have oversight of the military.",
      "SEN. WARNER: I rest my case. This is what we're all saying, come clean. And the fact is, if, as the administration says, these are all bad guys, and yeah, they're all drugs on these boats, interdict these boats and show the world. Listen the Maduro government in Venezuela. And by the way, none of- none of this legal opinion has anything to do with the Venezuelan Government, Maduro is a bad guy. We should have pushed harder on him when the people of Venezuela voted him out under President Biden. Biden didn't do enough. The drugs are all cocaine it has nothing to do with fentanyl.

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 2, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We go now to the Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, who joins us this morning from Far Hills, New Jersey. Welcome to Face The Nation.",
      "TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY:\u00a0 Hey, thanks, Margaret, good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So our CBS polling shows that there is real concern among Americans regarding the effect of the shutdown on all transportation. Should Americans also have safety concerns at this point?",
      "SEC. DUFFY: I think that's a great question. We work overtime to make sure the system is safe. And we will slow traffic down, you'll see delays, we'll have flights canceled to make sure the system is safe. But we have to be honest, when we have controllers, where we have shortages and towers and TRACONs doing two jobs, does it add more risk into the system? Sure, it does. But again, we're always managing that. Again, we don't- we don't want crashes, we want people to go safely, and so we will slow and stop traffic if we don't think we can manage it in a way that keeps people safe as they go from point A to point B.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, I did see that the FAA said, up in New York, 80% of air traffic controllers were absent from New York area airports, and that same day, there was a near miss at LaGuardia Airport. One United plane clipped another one. Was that pilot error? Or was that linked to some kind of shortage?",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 Well, you mentioned the shortages of air traffic controllers in the New York airspace. We had a couple days ago, three hour delays throughout New York. And again, I haven't got the readout yet on whether that was pilot error. And usually, when these planes are- are traveling very close to each other, it's their job to stay away from one another. That's not controllers, it's usually pilot error. But again, I'll have to look and see what directive was given by the air traffic controllers. But it's normally the pilot's responsibility to stay away from aircraft on the tarmac.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So if this shutdown continues, how- when does it become an emergency in terms of passenger safety and the safety of those who are trying to, for example, get home for Thanksgiving in a few weeks.",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 Well, does it become a flight emergency, a safety issue? No, we will stop traffic. So we're not going to let that happen. I think the real consequence is, what kind of rolling delays do you have throughout the system, right? We've seen problems at LA, in Dallas, in DC, Boston, Atlanta. And so I think it's only going to get worse. We have controllers who, some of them are new controllers. We have trainee controllers who are very helpful in the tower. They don't make a lot of money, and they're now confronted, they haven't had a paycheck for over a month. They're confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid? They're making decisions. I've encouraged them all to come to work. I want them to come to work, but they're making life decisions that they shouldn't have to make. Let's open the government up. Let's pay these people, these young controllers. Margaret, it's really important, I think you've covered this, we don't have the best equipment in our towers and centers for air traffic control. But we have the safest airspace, we have the most efficient airspace because we have the best controllers in the world that work our skies and keep our people safe. They deserve a paycheck.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, given that they are so essential, is there any way the administration can find a pot of money like seems to be getting found for others, like the military, to pay controllers so they can show up to work? Why isn't the administration able to do that?",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 Yeah, well, I think that's a great question. So we have done all we can. President Trump has done all he can to minimize the pain of the shutdown on the American people. Again, you remember under Barack Obama's shutdown, he was trying to gate off open air monuments in Washington, DC, and were shutting down parks just walking paths. President Trump has tried to make it less painful on the American people. So we're looking for pots of money to pay essential workers, but there's really strict rules around what money we can use and how we can use it, and we have to follow the law. And so we were able to fund a central air service, service to more rural communities. We've kept our academy up and running thus far. We don't have a ton of time, a couple more weeks of that funding. But I don't have the resources to do that, and the simple answer is, vote to open the government, negotiate your differences. That's fine, that's fair. But again, these people should be paid. And to say that it's Donald Trump's fault, to say he has to find money, when Democrats have said there's no money for you because we've shut the government down, I mean, that's a contorted analysis. And Democrats are trying to do that, and I don't think it really works. Give the money and we'll pay the controllers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Yeah, well, I saw reports that air traffic controllers only received partial pay mid-October, and this past week they missed a paycheck altogether. So practically speaking, for those who are in these jobs, would you advise them to pick up part time work elsewhere?",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 No, I'm clearly asking them, come to work. It is your job to come to work, and eventually you will be paid. But as I've traveled around the country and talked to air traffic controllers, they've told me that a lot of them can navigate missing one paycheck. None of them can manage missing two paychecks. And they're like every American family, everyone watching your show today as they think about their own finances, how many paychecks can they miss before it becomes real stress, real strife in their life? And so they're- at the- next week, they're going to get a notice of what their next paycheck is going to be. And if the government doesn't open, the notice will be another big fat zero, and you're going to see more of them probably make the decisions of funding their families, putting food on their table, gas in their cars, versus coming into work. That's not what I want, but I'm a realist as well, Margaret, these are the decisions of life and survival that these controllers have to make. By the way, it's the technicians, also. We have old equipment. We have technicians that work in the towers that keep the equipment operational. They're not getting paid. I have train inspectors who are working to keep our trains running and running safely. They're working without pay. I have pipeline inspectors, same thing. Across the system. We have a number of people who are working without pay. We talk about the air traffic controllers, but I have thousands of employees who are showing up, doing the work and trying to keep this system safe for the American people all the while they don't get paid to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Understood. So you said back on Fox Business on October 9 that \"I can't have people not showing up for work and that they may be let go.\" There's a shortage of 4,000 controllers already. You're not firing people, are you? You can't afford to.",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 No, so when- we're 2-3,000 controllers short, but that's a huge number. And you make an interesting point, because I've tried to surge air traffic controllers into the system through our academy. Margaret, we're up 20% of controllers through the academy this year alone. It takes them about a year to two to get certified in a tower, but this shutdown is impacting my pipeline of controllers. And so as- when everyone forgets about air traffic control and the shutdown, I'm going to deal with the consequences of, again, delivering for the American people and getting more controllers in the towers, not less. And you bring up a good point. We're already stressed in that we don't have enough controllers in our system, and this shutdown, when we have staffing triggers where they're not coming in because they're funding their families and food on their tables, that makes it more difficult because we're already short long. Long term consequences--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're not going to fire them?",
      "SEC. DUFFY: I don't plan on firing control. No, listen, I have, no, I- again when they're making decisions to feed their families, I'm not going to fire air traffic controllers. I have, I have loved them and supported them as they're trying to go through this process and it's challenging for them. They need support, they need money, they need a paycheck. They don't need to be fired.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 All right. Secretary Duffy, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dinosaur-mystery-t-rex-rival-species-researchers-say/",
    "published": "Thu, 30 Oct 2025 13:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" the study's co-author said.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have long puzzled over the origins of a mysterious dinosaur excavated in the 1940s: Was it a young T. rex or another type of dinosaur?",
      "At first, researchers had only a tyrannosaur skull to go by, making it hard to tell if it belonged to a child or adult. Another skull and skeleton nicknamed Jane added to the debate, but didn't settle the controversy.",
      "Now, a research team says new evidence resolves the case. The latest clue comes from a complete skeleton \u2014 first uncovered in Montana in 2006 \u2014 that scientists say identifies the mystery reptile as its own species and not a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" said study co-author Lindsay Zanno with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina State University.",
      "Growth rings within the bones found in Montana's Hell Creek Formation told scientists the new dinosaur was an adult about half the size of a fully fledged T. rex. From growth comparisons to other reptiles like crocodiles, they also found that the major differences between the creature's skull and an adult T. rex's \u2014 changes in bone structure, nerve patterns and sinuses \u2014 were unlikely to form from simply going through puberty.",
      "Signs pointed to a dinosaur that's a distant T. rex cousin known as Nanotyrannus lancensis, the researchers reported in a study published Thursday in the journal Nature, calling it a rival species.",
      "\"Nanotyrannus is a small-bodied predator designed for speed. It's very agile and has long powerful arms [that are] larger than those of the T. rex,\"\u00a0Zanno told Nature.",
      "There's now \"more support and evidence than there ever has been\" that this T. rex relative could exist, said Holly Woodward, a fossil bone expert from Oklahoma State University who had no role in the new study. But she's not yet convinced that the other mystery skeletons like Jane are something new.",
      "Case of mistaken identity",
      "Other independent scientists also said the debate isn't over. The new skeleton is indeed an adult, but it could be a sister species to T. rex and not a distant relative, said vertebrate paleontologist Thomas Carr of Carthage College.",
      "There are similarities between the shape of T. rex's skull and the mystery specimens that keep him from switching camps.",
      "\"I don't think this study settles everything,\" he said.",
      "Resolving this case of mistaken identity is important to understanding how T. rex grew up, said study co-author James Napoli with Stony Brook University. Another big question is whether T. rex was the main predator prowling toward the end of the age of dinosaurs 67 million years ago \u2014 or whether a tinier, but still mighty predator also roamed.",
      "\"I suspect that these two species would have occasionally come into conflict, as predators tend to do, but the long legs of Nanotyrannus, and its small size, suggest that it mostly hunted smaller, faster prey than Tyrannosaurus,\" Napoli told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The new skeleton is dubbed \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" because it was found intertwined with the bones of a Triceratops, and is currently on display at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.",
      "The study comes just days after new research suggested dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike. The evidence came from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that's been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "In June, scientists identified a smaller-bodied ancestor of the T. rex that roamed the plains of Mongolia as a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",

      "\"It was astronomical, and you don't know how many rounds you're going to need,\" Quinn said.",
      "With limited insurance coverage, the Florida couple started researching what's known as \"fertility tourism,\" where patients travel abroad for more affordable fertility care.",
      "Ricardo, who is originally from Colombia, found a clinic in the country's capital of Bogota offering a dramatic price difference\u2014a package of four IVF rounds in Colombia for $11,000 compared to around $60,000 for four rounds in the U.S. Medication costs were also less than half of those in the U.S.",
      "\"It's a no-brainer, especially because I'm from there,\" Escobar said. \"We found that the clinic had an excellent rating and really good results.\"",
      "At the clinic, called Inser, the couple met with Dr. Juan Luis Giraldo, who treats patients from around the world. He said nearly half of his clients come from outside Colombia, and about 15% are from the United States.",
      "\"From the U.S., they mainly come for two things,\" Giraldo said. \"The first is cost, and the second is personalized treatment. It's really common that patients there feel they don't have a close relationship with their doctor.\"",
      "The couple made several trips to Colombia, where their first IVF round produced four viable embryos. After multiple embryo transfers, Quinn became pregnant and gave birth to their son, Lorenzo, in 2023. They returned the following year for another round and are now expecting again.",
      "Quinn estimates they saved between $15,000 and $20,000 per round. Her flexible work schedule made the travel possible, and some bloodwork and ultrasounds were completed in Florida.",
      "Dr. Sangita Jindal, with the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, advises Americans pursuing fertility treatment abroad to carefully review local laws.",
      "\"I would want to know that there is a flexible legal framework that would allow me to bring my embryos back to the U.S. for transfer to my uterus,\" Jindal said. \"Some countries may have prohibitive laws around that.\"",
      "The global fertility-tourism market has grown by more than $50 million in the past year and is projected to reach $800 million by 2030.",
      "For Quinn and Escobar, who became pregnant again after two rounds of IVF, the journey has been more emotional.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk's partisan stances and foray into politics in recent years have dented the electric vehicle maker's business, Yale researchers say.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk is widely recognized as an electric car pioneer. Yet the Tesla CEO has also single-handedly chilled the automaker's sales, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at Yale University.",
      "Public controversy over Musk's role as leader of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as his acquisition of social media platform Twitter (now known as X) in 2022, reduced Tesla's sales by up to 1.2 million vehicles over a three-year period, the researchers estimated in a working paper published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research that aimed to measure the effect of Musk's politics on Tesla's business.",
      "\"This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be,\" the researchers wrote. \"We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business.\"",
      "Musk's adverse impact on Tesla's business became visible starting in mid-2022, with sales especially dropping in Democratic-leaning states and counties, the study further concludes.",
      "\"Musk's actions antagonized his most loyal customer base, for, as we show, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to purchase a Tesla,\" the researchers said.",
      "The study's lead author is energy and environmental economist Kenneth Gillingham, who is the senior associate dean of academic affairs at the Yale School of the Environment. His research focuses on consumer behavior and policy in the transportation and energy sectors.",
      "Musk announced in May that he was pulling back from DOGE, which the Trump administration formed to shrink the federal government and cut spending.",
      "Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the paper's findings.",
      "Musk's foray into politics and emergence as a prominent adviser to President Trump early in his second term raised the entrepreneur's visibility but alienated some potential Tesla customers, Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, previously told CBS News.",
      "Tesla last week reported third-quarter earnings of $1.4 billion, down 37% from the year-ago period, citing higher costs and tariff-related headwinds. Tesla's vehicle sales fell 1% in 2024 despite a 7% increase in EV sales across the car industry.",
      "Tesla's stock fell 27% in February, a period of time that coincided with Mr. Trump's first full month in the White House. But the shares have rebounded and are now up roughly 14% on the year, with investors betting on growth in the company's fledgling robotaxi business, autonomous driving technology and plans to build AI-powered humanoid robots.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\"\u00a0Wedbush Securities technology analyst Dan Ives said in a recent report, adding that he expects the Trump administration to fast-track such initiatives.",
      "Another measure of Musk's perceived value to Tesla is the enormous pay package shareholders are preparing to vote on for the executive. That total package could be worth up to $1 trillion in a decade, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history.",
      "For Musk to earn the full amount, Tesla would have to hit certain profitability and production targets, as well as reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion \u2014 nearly six times its current value \u2014 in 10 years.",
      "Robyn Denholm, chairman of Tesla's board of directors, is urging shareholders to approve Musk's proposed compensation. \"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor,\"\u00a0 Denholm said in the letter.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut said she \"found no credible evidence\" that protests in the city grew out of control before the president federalized the troops.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Oregon on Sunday barred President Trump's administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, until at least Friday, saying she \"found no credible evidence\" that protests in the city grew out of control before the president federalized the troops earlier this fall.",
      "The city and state sued in September to block the deployment.",
      "It's the latest development in weeks of legal back-and-forth in Portland, Chicago and other U.S. cities as the Trump administration has moved to federalize and deploy the National Guard in city streets to quell protests.",
      "The ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, an appointee of Mr. Trump, followed a three-day trial in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law.",
      "In a 16-page filing late Sunday, Immergut said she would issue a final order on Friday due to the voluminous evidence presented at trial, including more than 750 exhibits.",
      "The purpose of the deployment, according to the Trump administration, is to protect federal personnel and property where protests are occurring or likely to occur. Legal experts said that a higher appellate court order that remains in effect would have barred troops from being deployed anyway.",
      "Immergut wrote that most violence appeared to be between protesters and counter-protesters and found no evidence of \"significant damage\" to the immigration facility at the center of the protests.",
      "\"Based on the trial testimony, this Court finds no credible evidence that during the approximately two months before the President's federalization order, protests grew out of control or involved more than isolated and sporadic instances of violent conduct that resulted in no serious injuries to federal personnel,\" she wrote.",
      "The complex case comes as Democratic cities targeted by Mr. Trump for military involvement \u2014 including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue \u2014 seek to push back. They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states' sovereignty. The administration argues that it needs the troops because it has been unable to enforce the law with regular forces \u2014 one of the conditions set by Congress for calling up troops.",
      "Immergut issued two orders in early October that blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. She previously found that Mr. Trump had failed to show that he met the legal requirements for mobilizing the National Guard. She described his assessment of Portland, which Mr. Trump has called \"war-ravaged\" with \"fires all over the place,\" as \"simply untethered to the facts.\"",
      "One of Immergut's orders was paused Oct. 20 by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But late Tuesday, the appeals court vacated that decision and said it would rehear the matter before an 11-judge panel. Until the larger panel rehears the case, the appeals court's initial order from early October \u2014 under which the National Guard is federalized but not deployed \u2014 remains in effect.",
      "During the Portland trial, witnesses including local police and federal officials were questioned about the law enforcement response to the nightly protests at the city's ICE building. The demonstrations peaked in June, when Portland police declared one a riot. The demonstrations typically drew a couple dozen people in the weeks leading up to Mr. Trump's National Guard announcement.",
      "The Trump administration said it has had to shuffle federal agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the Portland protests, which it has characterized as a \"rebellion\" or \"danger of rebellion\" \u2014 another one of the conditions for calling up troops under federal law.",
      "Federal officials working in the region testified about staffing shortages and requests for more personnel that have yet to be fulfilled. Among them was an official with the Federal Protective Service, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that provides security at federal buildings, whom the judge allowed to be sworn in as a witness under his initials, R.C., due to safety concerns.",
      "R.C., who said he would be one of the most knowledgeable people in DHS about security at Portland's ICE building, testified that a troop deployment would alleviate the strain on staff. When cross-examined, however, he said he did not request troops and that he was not consulted on the matter. He also said he was \"surprised\" to learn about the deployment and that he did not agree with statements about Portland burning down.",
      "Attorneys for Portland and Oregon said city police have been able to respond to the protests. After the police department declared a riot on June 14, it changed its strategy to direct officers to intervene when person and property crime occurs, and crowd numbers have largely diminished since the end of that month, police officials testified.",
      "Another Federal Protective Service official whom the judge also allowed to testify under his initials said protesters have at times been violent, damaged the facility and acted aggressively toward officers working at the building.",
      "The ICE building closed for three weeks over the summer due to property damage, according to court documents and testimony. The regional field office director for ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, Cammilla Wamsley, said her employees worked from another building during that period. The plaintiffs argued that was evidence that they were able to continue their work functions.",
      "Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Scott Kennedy said that \"without minimizing or condoning offensive expressions\" or certain instances of criminal conduct, \"none of these incidents suggest ... that there's a rebellion or an inability to execute the laws.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 15:26:31 -0500",
    "summary": "The shooting happened at an Airbnb in Bath Township, about 15 miles northwest of Akron. It was not immediately clear if all nine people were shot.",
    "story": [
      "Gunfire erupted early Sunday at a large rental home where teenagers had gathered for a birthday party that was promoted on social media, injuring nine people. The scene in northeastern Ohio was chaotic as some people fled and first responders performed life-saving measures, police said.",
      "The shooting happened at around 12:15 a.m. in Bath Township, about 15 miles northwest of Akron.",
      "At a Sunday morning news conference, Police Chief Vito Sinopoli said the seriousness of the victims' injuries was not clear. It was also not immediately clear if all nine people were shot \u2014 one person's leg injury may have been caused by a fall, he said.",
      "Sinopoli said the large home had been rented out on Airbnb, which is not allowed under local zoning ordinances, and most of the people at the party were under 18. He said the victims may include a mix of juveniles and adults. Their ages range from 15 to 20, CBS affiliate WOIO reported.",
      "Social media posts about the party drew a big crowd, Sinopoli said. It was not immediately known what sparked the shooting and how many people fired guns, he said. No arrests were announced.",
      "\"The Bath Township community experienced a tragic and senseless act of violence early this morning,\" Sinopoli said.",
      "Akron police and firefighters responded to the shooting, and Mayor Shammas Malik said the city will provide any assistance to the investigation that's underway.",
      "\"Those who perpetrate violence anywhere in our community must be held accountable for their actions. This kind of deadly behavior cannot be normalized,\" Malik said in a statement posted to social media. \"In addition, the reports of so many young people at a rented house party are very concerning. As we learn more about the situation that occurred last night, it appears to be part of a broader issue - helping make sure youth across our community are safe.\"",
      "Airbnb said in a statement Sunday that it prohibits \"unauthorized and disruptive gatherings,\" and it has suspended the property listing and removed the account of the person who rented the home. It said it has seen a 50% decrease in the rate of reported parties since 2020, when it put into effect a global party ban policy.",
      "\"We are heartbroken by this senseless act of gun violence, and our thoughts are with the injured victims and all those affected by it,\" the company said, adding that it was cooperating with the police investigation.",
      "Sinopoli said another shooting at an Airbnb rental home in town in 2017 wounded a person, who suffered a leg injury.",
      "\"It's pretty much an indicator that no community is immune from violence, and this happened to be in Bath Township again, unfortunately,\" he said.",
      "Sinopoli said he talked with the property owner about the shooting and discussed the town's prohibition against short-term home rentals. He said home rentals are not a crime, only a zoning violation.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 15:08:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the federal government will \"stop traffic\" if it becomes a safety issue, adding, \"We're not going to let that happen.\"",
    "story": [
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Sunday that airport delays are \"going to get worse\" as the government shutdown threatens to stretch into a fifth week and air traffic controllers were not paid this week.",
      "\"I think the real consequence is, what kind of rolling delays do you have throughout the system, right?\" Duffy said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"We've seen problems at L.A., in Dallas, in D.C., Boston, Atlanta. And so I think it's only going to get worse.\"",
      "Duffy said the federal government will \"stop traffic\" if it becomes a safety issue, adding, \"We're not going to let that happen.\"",
      "Duffy's appearance comes as ground delays were reported at major airports on Sunday, including a four-hour ground delay at Newark Liberty Airport, one of the nation's busiest transit hubs. There were staffing triggers reported at airports in Nashville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; Austin, Texas; Denver, Colorado; Northern California and Newark, New Jersey.",
      "The airport chaos is just weeks ahead of some of the busiest travel days of the year around Thanksgiving.",
      "As the government shutdown has stretched on for more than 30 days, air traffic controllers have gone without several paychecks, although they will get back pay when the shutdown ends. Duffy emphasized Sunday that air traffic controllers are being \"confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid?\"",
      "However, Duffy ruled out the Trump administration finding a way to pay air traffic controllers, similar to how the active-duty military has been paid so far. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned active-duty military personnel won't be paid on Nov. 15.",
      "\"So we're looking for pots of money to pay essential workers, but there's really strict rules around what money we can use and how we can use it, and we have to follow the law,\" Duffy said about paying air traffic controllers. \"And so we were able to fund a central air service, service to more rural communities. We've kept our academy up and running thus far. We don't have a ton of time, a couple more weeks of that funding. But I don't have the resources to do that, and the simple answer is, vote to open the government, negotiate your differences. \"",
      "While Duffy suggested on Oct. 9 that if air traffic controllers didn't show up to work, they could be \"let go,\" he said on Sunday that he doesn't plan on firing controllers.",
      "\"Again, when they're making decisions to feed their families, I'm not going to fire air traffic controllers,\" Duffy said. \"I have, I have loved them and supported them as they're trying to go through this process and it's challenging for them. They need support, they need money, they need a paycheck. They don't need to be fired.\"",
      "The Trump administration has continued to blame Democrats for the shutdown, but Democratic Sen. Mark Warner on Sunday suggested that ending the shutdown is \"going to require the active intervention of the president.\"",
      "\"The notion of at least sitting down to talk about health care, making sure that $6 billion that is set aside for SNAP benefits gets paid out so people don't go hungry and we get the government reopened again,\" Warner said in a separate appearance on \"Face the Nation.\" \"The president of the United States has said when he was not president that it's the responsibility of a president to end shutdowns. He has paid no attention to the shutdown. He's stopped his many international trips; come sit down and let's get this resolved.\"",
      "A CBS News poll released Sunday found that Americans are increasingly voicing concern about the shutdown's impact on the U.S. economy, as a big majority feel Congress isn't even working to try to end it. There's also increased worry from people over being personally affected, particularly among those with lower incomes.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 so, the White House and the Republicans are in disagreement on this?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, there is not a lack of disagreement from members of the Senate that we've been asking for this legal justification for months.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: And they are now hiding the ball and only giving it out on a partisan basis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Senator Warner, thank you for your time today.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the secretary of transportation, Sean Duffy, who joins us this morning from Far Hills, New Jersey.",
      "Welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "SEAN DUFFY (U.S. Transportation Secretary): Hey. Thanks, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So our CBS polling shows that there is real concern among Americans regarding the effect of the shutdown on all transportation. Should Americans also have safety concerns at this point?",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Listen, I think that's a great question. We work overtime to make sure the system is safe. And we will slow traffic down. You'll see delays. We'll have flights canceled to make sure the system is safe.",
      "But we have to be honest. When we have controllers, where we have shortages and towers and TRACONs doing two jobs, does it add more risk into the system? Sure, it does. But, again, we're always managing that. Again, we don't \u2013 we don't want crashes. We want people to go safely.",
      "And so we will slow and stop traffic if we don't think we can manage it in a way that keeps people safe as they go from point A to point B.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I did see that the FAA said, up in New York, 80 percent of air traffic controllers were absent from New York area airports. And, that same day, there was a near miss at La Guardia Airport. One United plane clipped another one.",
      "Was that pilot error or was that linked to some kind of shortage?",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Well, you mentioned the shortages of air traffic controllers in the New York airspace. We had a couple days ago three-hour delays throughout New York.",
      "And, again, I haven't got the readout yet on whether that was pilot error. And, usually, when these planes are \u2013 are traveling very close to each other, it's their job to stay away from one another. That's not controllers. It's usually pilot error. But, again, I will \u2013 I will have to look and see what directive was given by the air traffic controllers.",
      "But it's normally the pilot's responsibility to stay away from aircraft on the tarmac.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So if this shutdown continues, how \u2013 I \u2013 when does it become an emergency in terms of passenger safety and the safety of those who are trying to, for example, get home for Thanksgiving in a few weeks?",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Well, does it become a flight emergency, a safety issue? No. We will stop traffic. So we're not going to let that happen.",
      "I think the real consequence is, what kind of rolling delays do you have throughout the system, right? We've seen problems at L.A., in Dallas, in D.C., Boston, Atlanta. And so I think it's only going to get worse. We have controllers who some of them are new controllers. We have trainee controllers who are very helpful in the tower. They don't make a lot of money.",
      "And they're now confronted. They haven't had a paycheck for over a month. They're confronted with a decision. Do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent, or do I go to work and not get paid?",
      "And they're making decisions. I have encouraged them all to come to work. I want them to come to work. But they're making life decisions that they shouldn't have to make. Let's open the government up. Let's pay these people, these young controllers.",
      "Margaret, it's really important. And I think you've covered this. We don't have the best equipment in our towers and centers for air traffic control. But we have the safest airspace, we have the most efficient airspace because we have the best controllers in the world that work our skies and keep our people safe. They deserve a paycheck.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, given that they are so essential, is there any way the administration can find a pot of money, like seems to be getting found for others like the military\u2026",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 to pay controllers so they can show up to work? Why isn't the administration able to do that?",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Yes. Well, I think that's a great question.",
      "So we have done all we can. President Trump has done all he can to minimize the pain of the shutdown on the American people. Again, you remember, under Barack Obama's shutdown, he was trying to gate off open-air monuments in Washington, D.C., and was shutting down parks, just walking paths.",
      "President Trump has tried to make it less painful on the American people. So we're looking for pots of money to pay essential workers, but there's really strict rules around what money we can use and how we can use it, and we have to follow the law.",
      "And so we were able to fund essential air service, service to more rural communities. We've kept our academy up and running thus far. We don't have a ton of time, a couple more weeks of that funding. But I don't have the resources to do that.",
      "And the simple answer is, vote to open the government, negotiate your differences. That's fine. That's fair. But, again, these people should be paid. And to say that it's Donald Trump's fault, to say he has to find money, when Democrats have said there's no money for you because we've shut the government down, I mean, that's a contorted analysis.",
      "And Democrats are trying to do that, and I don't think it really works. Give the money and we'll pay the controllers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, well, I saw reports that air traffic controllers only received partial pay mid-October, and this past week they missed a paycheck altogether.",
      "So, practically speaking, for those who are in these jobs, would you advise them to pick up part-time work elsewhere?",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: No, I'm \u2013 I'm clearly asking them, I \u2013 come to work. It is your job to come to work, and eventually you will be paid.",
      "But as I have traveled around the country and talked to air traffic controllers, they've told me that a lot of them can navigate missing one paycheck. None of them can manage missing two paychecks. And they're like every American family.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Everyone watching your show today, as they think about their own finances, how many paychecks can they miss before it becomes real stress, real strife in their life?",
      "And so they're \u2013 at the \u2013 next week, they're going to have \u2013 they're going to get a notice of what their next paycheck is going to be. And if the government doesn't open, the notice will be another big fat zero, and you're going to see more of them probably make the decisions of funding their families, putting food on their table, gas in their cars, versus coming into work.",
      "That's not what I want, but I'm a realist as well, Margaret. These are the decisions of life and survival that these controllers have to make. By the way, it's the technicians also. We have old equipment. We have technicians that work in the towers that keep the equipment operational.",
      "They're not getting paid. I have train inspectors who are working to keep our trains running, and running safely. They're working without pay. I have pipeline inspectors, same thing. Across the system, we have a number of people who are working without pay. We talk about the air traffic controllers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: But I have thousands of employees who are showing up, doing the work and trying to keep this system safe for the American people. All the while, they don't get paid to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "So you said back on Fox Business on October 9 that \"I can't have people not showing up for work\" and that they may be let go. There's a shortage of 4,000 controllers already. You're not firing people, are you? You can't afford to.",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: No, so, when \u2013 we're 2,000 to 3,000 controllers short, but that's a huge number. And you make an interesting point, because I have tried to surge air traffic controllers into the system through our academy.",
      "Margaret, we're up 20 percent of controllers through the academy this year alone. It takes them about a year to two to get certified in a tower, but this shutdown is impacting my pipeline of controllers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: And so as \u2013 when everyone forgets about air traffic control and the shutdown, I'm going to deal with the consequences of, again, delivering for the American people and getting more controllers in the towers, not less.",
      "And you bring up a good point. We're already stressed, in that we don't have enough controllers in our system. And this shutdown, when we have staffing triggers where they're not coming in because they're funding their families and food on their tables, that makes it more difficult because we're already short long. Long-term consequences\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're not going to fire them?",
      "SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: I don't plan on firing control \u2013 no, listen, I have \u2013 no, I \u2013 again, when they're making decisions to feed their families, I'm not going to fire air traffic controllers. I have \u2013 I have loved them and supported them as they're trying to go through this process and it's challenging for them.",
      "They need support. They need money. They need a paycheck. They don't need to be fired.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Secretary Duffy, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For more from our latest CBS News poll, we turn to our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "So, Anthony, how are people feeling about the economy?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: I will start with prices, because that's where people tell us they start.",
      "They see prices as still high. They expect prices to keep going up. In some respects, that's not new. That's been the case for years, but that's rather the point. Things haven't changed. So the ratings are still very low for the economy.",
      "On another front, the stock market's going up. There's been an A.I. boom helping fuel that, but people have very mixed views of the U.S. job market. And part of that is, they think A.I. may come along and take their jobs, they tell us, right?",
      "Now, here's how that all plays politically, Margaret. And that is, on ratings for handling the economy, handling inflation, the president's ratings have been ticking down through the course of his term and continue to do so. That's a big reason that he won a year ago. That's one of the things they \u2013 people tell us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The economy.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: On the economy. People tell us today they still rate him on that and on handling immigration, where he does relatively a little bit better, especially with the base.",
      "But what I did was, I asked people, OK, compared to a year ago, do you think the president is trying to keep his campaign promises? And most people say yes. There's a but there. And there's a substantial number who say, but his approach isn't what they expected. And they're more mixed on that.",
      "So they see, and some give credit for trying. But for things like tariffs as it regards to the economy, the approach is much more mixed. And that underlines all those ratings for him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we have an election in some states Tuesday. What should we be watching for?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, he will certainly be a factor. I think the question for Democrats as you watch these races is, can they just run against him?",
      "So what I did was, I asked them \u2013 asked folks to compare nationally Donald Trump's approach and what they perceive as the Democrats' approach. And Donald Trump still leads the Democrats on those measures for the economy and on immigration.",
      "And what that tells you is, it may be, as you watch these races, Democrats can't just run against Donald Trump. They have got to have ideas of their own. We will see these races as sort of testing labs for what the parties may do ahead of 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be watching that closely.",
      "Anthony Salvanto, busy week for you.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Indeed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I know you've been in and out of Washington. But largely, the House members have not been here in town. The House hasn't voted since September 19th. It will be the seventh consecutive week now that they've been working from home. Would you urge Speaker Johnson to bring everyone back to try to break the impasse over government funding?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: It's up to the speaker. House Republicans and House Democrats coming back to Washington will not break the impasse. Let's not forget that the House passed a clean CR. And it was a temporary CR, OK.",
      "And, you know, Democrats keep saying, you know, the Republicans have no intent to negotiate. We can't trust them to want to negotiate if we reopen the government. That's nonsense. If we \u2013 look, if we had passed a year- long CR, I think they could make that argument. That's usually an indicator that we really don't want to talk about the budget right now. We want to \u2013 we want to kick the can down the road for a year.",
      "But when you pass a very short-term duration CR, a seven-week one \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: It is a clear indication that we intend on continuing those conversations.",
      "So, look, there's other things we could do. The reason I keep going back is because I work on the Intelligence Committee and I have to do that work from inside D.C. There's a number of reasons people go back.",
      "But, look, in the end, the Senate has to deal with this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: And Senate Democrats just have to reopen the government. It's that simple. They voted \u2013 I don't know, what is it, 15 times now to keep it closed?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: They wouldn't even vote to keep federal workers paid. I \u2013 that was a crazy lifeline that \u2013 that Senator Thune gave them, allowing them to vote \u2013 almost having the easy way out, allow them to at least vote to take the pain off of federal workers, and they voted that down, too. I really don't know what their strategy is at this point. They're the ones who need to figure this out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 so you heard \u2013 perhaps you heard Senator Warner at the top of the program say, you know, conversations are happening this week. He was hoping that there would be some \u2013 some end.",
      "On \u2013 on your side of the \u2013 of the Capitol, you're saying you don't see signs of this ending this week?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Don't see what? Sorry? Yes, I don't \u2013 I don't \u2013 I don't see us going back into session. I think we would have been notified by now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: But, again, the impasse is not in the House. You know, we passed it out of the House. I realize that \u2013 that it was \u2013 there was a Democrat (ph) vote there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. But to come to an agreement, which is what he was \u2013 the senator was talking about everyone getting together and going to the White House with the president to \u2013 to hammer this out, the speaker at least. It doesn't sound like you have that level of optimism.",
      "But let \u2013 let's talk about the impact where you are. Your district includes parts of Houston. We checked the numbers and it appears 350,000 Houston area families may have some difficulty with their food stamps, these SNAP benefits, because of the standoff. Have you gotten any guidance from the state or from the administration about whether people get food payments this week?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Well, from what I can tell from the administration's statements, I mean, they're going to try to use the emergency contingency fund for \u2013 on a temporary basis.",
      "But look, the entire \u2013 I think there's about $6 billion in the fund.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Monthly SNAP benefits cost Americans $9 billion. So, that's \u2013 that is a very, very small band-aid. And the only way you're going to get SNAP benefits back on track is if Democrats vote for our clean CR.",
      "I visit a food bank recently. Yes, they're \u2013 they're preparing for a huge influx in demand.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: You know, the state could only do so much on this. Every \u2013 we \u2013 we \u2013 all of us can only do so much. There's \u2013 there's a really simple solution to this, which is, just keep the government open. And, you know, you want to negotiate this very complex health care issue, which is what Democrats say they want. I think they've kind of chose it out of randomly and all of a sudden decided to throw this temper tantrum.",
      "But, fine, let's negotiate it. But you have to do it with the government open and not hold \u2013 you're not holding a gun to our heads. You're holding a gun to the regular American people's heads.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are on the Intelligence Committee. You mentioned you had \u2013 have had to come back here to view what I assume is classified intelligence. The president confirmed a few weeks back that he had authorized some CIA activity in Venezuela. He didn't give detail on that. But have you seen any evidence that the U.S. pressure campaign on Nicolas Maduro is working? That all this military hardware that's being moved around into the region is doing something?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: I can \u2013 I can only tell you what I can assume. Look, having been out of session, we aren't getting the briefings because \u2013 because we aren't there. One of the reasons I keep going back is to look into these things.",
      "The broader question, this is more of a geopolitical question, is the pressure campaign working? Look, deterrence almost always works, especially when you're dealing with \u2013 with, you know, dictators like Maduro. They only listen to one thing, which is power.",
      "And \u2013 and Venezuela has been largely left alone by American administrations. The western hemisphere has been left alone.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: And I think this president's taking it much more seriously. Look, the Venezuelan government is a \u2013 it's \u2013 it's \u2013 it's a fake government, right? He ran a rigged election. Everyone knows that. It's propped up by the Cubans and by the Russians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: They have been in collusion with terrorist groups, like the FARC, for years. It has been an annoyance to countries like Colombia for years. There's many high-ranking officials in government \u2013 in Venezuelan government that are literally under indictment for drug trafficking. It is effectively a narco terrorist state supporting narco terrorists.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Maduro is still in power. Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Maduro, what? I'm sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he still is in \u2013 in power. That's what \u2013 we were just talking about that with Senator Warner, the need for more information to go to lawmakers about exactly what the extent is going to be of U.S. military involvement. Would you support U.S. land strikes of Venezuela?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Actually, boots on the ground in Venezuela?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Land strikes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Yes, I mean I think we would have to have a longer conversation about doing something to that extent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: But I think what the \u2013 what the president is doing right now is very much within rational legal means, looking at drug boats that we have \u2013 that \u2013 and people ask, though, do we have the intelligence to really know what these drug boats are and who's on them? Yes, we do. That I can say. Right. We have \u2013 we have multisource intelligence that we \u2013 so, we know for sure what we're \u2013 what we're actually shooting at. And we don't even shoot at all the targets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: And people say, well, why can't you just interdict it all? And I say, well, how \u2013 how many boats do you think we have? How many boats and helicopters do you think we have?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: And do you know how risky an interdiction operation is? You're going to people \u2013 put people's lives at stake.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right/",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: So, you do need to try something new, because it is an imminent harm to the United States. And that's clearly within the president's authority under Article Two.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No. No, no, I was asking about land strikes. But \u2013 but let me ask you about something some of your fellow conservatives have been talking quite a lot about, including Mitch McConnell. He's been concerned about anti-Semitism on the right.",

      "I've had a long-standing feud with Tucker Carlson. I'm glad everyone is also waking up now to how bad of a person he is. He's changed a lot over the last 20 years. You know, hard to say why.

You know, they were really on a \u2013 on a downhill slide. And for Tucker to have him on, you know, Senator Cruz is exactly right. And this idea that we have to, you know, that it's cancel culture if we \u2013 if we \u2013 if we \u2013 if we keep Tucker out of our circles from now on is just nonsense. It's a \u2013 I literally wrote a book on cancel culture. So, you know, I've thought deeply about this.",
      "Cancel culture means you're \u2013 you're canceling someone for what is basically a mainstream belief, or maybe a \u2013 maybe small \u2013 like honest mistake they made. That would be maybe considered cancel culture. It's not cancel culture when you say, look, I want to disassociate myself from you because your believes are crazy and you're psychopathic.",

I know you joined this lawsuit to try to sue the administration to get them to use emergency funding to pay for food stamps during the government shutdown. Given what happened with the courts Friday, will food stamp payments be going out this week? It's your state that has to administer the program, right?",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: Yes. I don't know, Margaret, because the president hasn't said whether he's going to approve the release of those contingency funds. I mean, the impact of this is just devastating. One in eight Americans, you say. I have about one in seven Massachusetts residents who are on SNAP. I was at food pantries yesterday. I mean people across our state do not want to see people go hungry. But people woke up on Saturday morning not having access to their benefits.",

      "Practically speaking, how do you \u2013 how quickly can you turn it on? I mean if that comes through Wednesday, do people in Massachusetts get to eat on Thursday?",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: No. I mean the problem, Margaret, with what the president has done is that he cut this off. And it takes a few days to load up those cards. I mean anywhere between two and five days.",
      "I will tell you what I am doing as governor, because I've got to protect my residents. I've got to work with others to make sure that they are fed. We've advanced funding to our food pantries. We stood up a United Way fund and already, you know, 3 million, I think, in contributions have come through this week. We have seen an incredible outpouring of volunteers. I was at food pantries yesterday and the turnout is something.",
      "And, you know, but \u2013 but this is not sustainable, right? I mean we cannot continue along this path, which is why he needs to release those funds as at least one court told him to do right now, as soon as possible, because it takes us time to load up those cards.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, here's how President Trump described the shutdown impact Friday. Take a listen.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All they have to do is say, the government is open, and that's the end of it. And, you know, largely, when you talk about SNAP, you're talking about largely Democrats. But I'm president. I want to help everybody. I want to help Democrats and Republicans. But when you're talking about SNAP, if you look, it's largely Democrats. They're hurting their own people.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Doesn't he have a point that your party is responsible for some of this pain?",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: Yes, absolutely not. And, frankly, that's a really insulting comment.",
      "You know, Margaret, I've got 21,000 veterans, men and women who have served our country, who are SNAP beneficiaries in Massachusetts, who had their benefits turned off, who face hunger right now. To be clear, you want to know who SNAP beneficiaries are in the country? They're our seniors, they're kids, and they're people with disabilities. They live in every state, and every city and town around the country. And for the president to even suggest something like that or say something like that is insulting.",
      "And this is the part \u2013 this is the problem with D.C. You showed the poll, right? I mean, at the end of the day, the president and Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House. And, you know, Mike Johnson hasn't had these guys back in session I think but for 12 out of 100 of the last days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: So, get back to Washington. Get back to the table. Sort this out. Americans want to see that people are fed. They want to make sure that they have access to childcare, because health \u2013 Headstart's getting turned off, too. And they don't want to see their health premiums go up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: I mean that's what's happening right now. And the impact is being felt everywhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We checked and the top five states are districts with the highest percentage of residents who use food stamps are in New Mexico, D.C., Louisiana, Oregon, and Oklahoma. Two of those states are ruby red and voted for President Trump in last election. I think that's what you're pointing to in terms of insult.",
      "But on the substance of why we are in this shutdown, Democrats have refused to sign on to a clean government funding bill. On that point, don't Democrats bear some responsibilities?",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: What Democrats in Congress did is stand with hundreds of thousands, millions of Americans right now who are seeing their premiums go up. I've got people in Massachusetts who just got notices because of the expiration of these subsidies. They're going to see their premiums rise as much as $20,000. American families can't afford that, you know?",
      "And I'm focused on economic hardship and what I can do to protect my people. And I think most of us are in our states as governors. Which is why the folks in D.C. need to get back to work. Mike Johnson needs to call his members back because, how are you going to get a negotiation if you're not even in D.C., right? You got to get back to D.C. The president has got to give a clear directive to Republicans that they need to reopen government because Americans are suffering and continue to suffer every single day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Healey, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Juan Andrade, CEO of financial services company USAA. Many of its nearly 14 million customers are in the military or veterans. And he joins us from San Antonio.",
      "Sir, Secretary Bessent said on this program just last Sunday that by November 15th the troops and service members aren't going to be paid. What level of anxiety are you seeing among your customers?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE (President and CEO, USAA): Margaret, thank you for having me on your show.",
      "What we're seeing today is uncertainty, anxiety, and, for some, real hardship. And that's really within the \u2013 the active duty community. It's also important to note that 30 percent of federal employees are also veterans or military spouses. So, this is more than an impact to a Household budget. This can really undermine morale and focus. And our goal is to provide stability for people who are living paycheck to paycheck and who are, frankly, losing ground.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I've seen that you're offering interest free loans to customer. Is that everyone or just specifically active duty military? And if they can't qualify for a loan, what do they do?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE: So, we're offering our government shutdown program to all eligible members of USAA. So, as you said, that's currently about 14.5 million people. And at that point we've acted swiftly and decisively. In the first 48 hours of the shutdown, we funded $150 million in zero interest loans. We are now up to $400 million to date. But that's also in addition to payment extensions that we've done on credit cards, auto loans, mortgages. We've also waived fees for overdraft. And we've also had flexible insurance arrangements across our property casualty, life, and health insurance businesses.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: $400 million in zero interest loans. So, people are already looking to try to figure out how to make ends meet.",
      "We looked, and a quarter of all active-duty military members are food insecure according to the Department of Agriculture. That was well before this shutdown. That means they don't have a good diet or they're not able to afford food.",
      "We already saw strain on a lot of that active-duty military. Can you give us a sense of what this means for someone now to look at the calendar and know November 15th there's no pay coming?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE: Yes. And I agree. This is one of the reasons why we've already funded 400 million in loans at this point in time. People are preparing for an uncertain period of time. And this is very important to them, particularly if we think about our younger enlisted, and particularly those with families.",
      "Dual incomes in military families is not a luxury, it's a necessity. So, these are people that we're very worried about. And we want to make sure that they're stable through this period of time.",
      "The other part of this, and, frankly, the reason for doing these zero interest loans, is we want to make sure that they don't turn to high interest rate payday loans or high interest rate credit cards at the same time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the unemployment rate among civilian military spouses is almost five times the national average, to your point, they need dual income. Many can't do that.",
      "But the Congressional Budget Office projection is that there will be an economic cost. That the shutdown itself could lead to $7 billion to $14 billion in lost growth. What's the impact on the communities like yours where you are living down in Texas, you know, in areas where there are bases around this country?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE: Sure. I think you see it in a few ways. I think one is definitely on consumer spending. Right now people are prioritizing basic needs, whether it's health or food at this point in time. So, they're definitely cutting back on \u2013 on discretionary spending. I think that's part of that.",
      "The other aspect of it is, you're going to see more people who are food insecure. And this is one of the reasons why we have also been supporting our local communities. Our offices are all located near major military installations. And we have donated millions to military aid societies who are best positioned to provide food and over services in installations. And we've also been donating to local food banks in our communities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, how does this compare to the last extended shutdown that we had during the first Trump administration?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE: The last shutdown basically has not \u2013 did not last as long. I think that was a big part of that. And we also had the certainty that the military would be getting paid. Now, clearly, up until now, they have been getting paid. The question of the uncertainty that we're seeing from our members is, what happens over the next couple of weeks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you were already planning for that November 15 \u2013 when you say the shutdown wasn't this long, you were assuming the government does not get funded for how long?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE: We're already \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How long can you keep doing this?",
      "JUAN ANDRADE: We're already planning for a second loan to members. So, we've had a number take us up certainly on the first offer of loan. Now they're taking us up on the second offer of loan. And we're prepared to assist. That's our job. And to take our members in the military community. So, we will keep up with this. And if we have to do more, we will do more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Well, we \u2013 we are thinking of your customers at this time. We'll continue to track what happens with that real-world impact.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 10:26:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Universities have found themselves under pressure from President Trump \u2013 from blocked funds for research, to attacks on their admission policies and diversity programs. Princeton's president says, \"The stakes are really high.\"",
    "story": [
      "\"It's a hard time to be a university president,\" said Princeton University President Christopher Eisgruber. \"But even in the best of times, you're dealing with such a wide set of constituencies, right? Trustees, alumni, students \u2026 sometimes the president of the United States.\"",
      "Eisgruber found his university under pressure from President Trump this past spring. Along with other schools, Princeton's federal support was frozen \u2013 more than $200 million in grants. \"These were grants in fields like quantum science or artificial intelligence that are high on our list of priorities, and that are also high on the list of priorities for the Trump administration,\" he said. \"So, we were surprised to see those grants suspended.\"",
      "But for many in Mr. Trump's circle, it was anything but a surprise. It was the latest chapter in the president's shakeup of higher education.",
      "Although Mr. Trump graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, the Ivy League has been one of his biggest targets. In the wake of campus protests, the Trump administration has put an emphasis on addressing charges of antisemitism. In recent weeks the administration has ramped up its efforts, offering universities a so-called \"compact\" in exchange for preferential treatment on funding. Universities would have to align with the White House's priorities, from how it defines gender to protecting conservative speech.",
      "On Oct. 20, May Mailman, who has been a key player inside the Trump White House, told the Fox Business channel, \"The federal government has to make difficult decisions, and universities should only get funding if there's going to be a benefit for Americans on the other side of it.\"",
      "So far, only one university (New College of Florida) has agreed to sign the compact. Many have rejected it (including the University of Pennsylvania, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Southern California), and others are reviewing the terms. Princeton is not signing the compact, and Eisgruber, an expert on constitutional law, calls the proposal \"dangerous.\"",
      "In his new book, \"Terms of Respect: How Colleges Get Free Speech Right,\" Eisgruber defends higher education on free speech, and gives universities a road map on how to navigate free speech issues they encounter.",
      "When asked about his book's conclusion that there is a civic crisis  in the United States, Eisgruber said universities often reflect what is  happening in the culture. \"It's on campuses because it's in society,\" Eisgruber replied. \"So, we've got an American crisis in the United States, where we are having trouble talking to one another across political differences. Campuses are part of that society, and they're a place where civil discussions and discussions across difference are especially important.\"",
      "Free speech and political violence",
      "Princeton has had its own stand-offs over speech. In 2015, students held a sit-in in Eisgruber's office, calling for the renaming of the university's School of International Relations, citing racist comments by former President Woodrow Wilson; and personnel disputes have led to sharp criticism from some conservatives.",
      "Eisgruber acknowledges there is work to be done, but says universities need to be careful about moving too close to any particular viewpoint in some debates. \"We shouldn't make the mistake of thinking that what we're doing is looking to mirror political views on a college campus,\" he said. \"It's not our job to just be making the same arguments that are being made out in society. So, there might be a lot of division about, say, vaccines within our society, and a scholarly consensus that is inconsistent with those divisions that says vaccines have been safe and vaccines have been effective. There's not some obligation on the part of universities to reflect the political argument.\"",
      "Making things even more complicated is the specter of political violence. When conservative activist Charlie Kirk was gunned down on a college campus in Utah, Eisgruber said, \"I was so deeply saddened. First of all, I was saddened for Charlie Kirk's family. I was saddened for our country and our Constitution, because whatever else is true and whatever political views one may have, we have got to be a country where people can have discussions without the threat of assassination and political violence. So, I worried. I worried about our future because as these events occur, I fear they deepen our crisis  \"",
      "Asked about the reaction by students to such violence, Eisgruber said, \"First of all, I think college campuses are great places to have conversations and great places to be and, in general, safe places to be, right? We've seen a lot of political violence in our country, you know, at the homes of Minnesota lawmakers, at the Israeli embassy in Washington, at the home of the Pennsylvania governor, at our nation's Capitol. So, I think college campuses in general have done a pretty good job of allowing controversial speech.\"",
      "Universities are not the only institutions in American life dealing with the White House: law firms, arts organizations, even late-night hosts have found themselves the targets of criticism from this administration. But longtime leaders in higher ed are keeping close watch on how universities are responding.",
      "Lawrence Summers, the former president of Harvard, said, \"They're facing tougher problems than any university president has faced since the Vietnam War period 50 years ago.\"",
      "Lee Bollinger, who was president of both Columbia and the University of Michigan, said, \"This is a broad-based attack on norms and values that are really fundamental to the United States as we have known it.\"",
      "Back at Princeton, the school is engaging with the Trump administration to protect its research, and it has been able to get roughly half of the suspended grants restored, after underscoring how those efforts \u2013 in science, energy, and other fields \u2013 matter for the country. But Eisgruber and other university leaders know the storm in higher educations is far from over.",
      "\"The stakes are really high,\" he said. \"There are a number of things \u2013 our Constitution, our commitment to freedom, our commitment to the individual \u2013 that have made a difference to America and have strengthened the world. But our investment, our smart investment by the federal government in research universities and education has been critical to the leadership that we have developed in the world, and it is critical to America's future.\"",

    "story": [
      "Daylight saving time has come to an end for 2025. Early Sunday morning, the clocks fell back and we gained an hour. Here's what to know about the seasonal time change.",
      "When did the time change for the end of daylight saving 2025?",
      "Daylight saving time came to an end on Sunday, Nov. 2, at 2 a.m., when the time went back to 1 a.m.",
      "Daylight saving time\u00a0began last spring\u00a0on March 9. Clocks will \"spring forward\" next year on March 8, 2026, when daylight saving time returns.",
      "Did we lose or gain an hour when daylight saving time ended?",
      "People gained an hour as clocks fell back on Sunday. For most Americans, that means an extra hour of sleep.",
      "Many digital clocks will automatically reset overnight, but remember to change any watches or clocks that need to be manually adjusted.",
      "Darkness will arrive earlier in the evening, and sunrise in the morning will also come earlier.",
      "Why was daylight saving time created in the first place?",
      "Annual clock changes have been around for decades, but the origins of the practice remain something of a mystery. People have pointed toward farmers wanting more daylight or cited various proponents of getting up earlier in the day, but some of those theories are disputed.",
      "Germany began observing daylight saving time in 1916 during World War I, with the thought that it would save energy. Other European countries and the U.S. followed suit in the next few years.",
      "There was some debate around the practice in the decades that followed, but eventually, daylight saving time was enacted in the U.S. as a legal requirement by the Uniform Time Act of 1966, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.",
      "Which states don't do daylight saving time?",
      "While clocks changed for most of the U.S., there are two states and several territories that do not observe daylight saving time. Clocks will not change in Hawaii or Arizona (except for in the Navajo Nation), American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to the Department of Transportation, which oversees the nation's time zones",
      "States can opt out of observing daylight saving time, but they cannot choose to permanently be on daylight saving time.",
      "Most countries around the world do not observe daylight saving, with the U.S. and most of Europe being the exception rather than the rule, according to the\u00a0Pew Research Center. Parts of Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean also observe daylight saving time.",
      "Among countries that do change their clocks, most of them rolled back an hour in October, according to timeanddate.com.",
      "The debate over daylight saving time today",
      "A 2022 CBS News/YouGov poll found that nearly 80% of Americans supported changing the current system, with more Americans preferring daylight saving time to standard time.",
      "That same year, the Senate passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act that would have made daylight saving time permanent, but it never advanced in the House of Representatives.",
      "President Trump, before his return to office for his second term, said he'd push to eliminate the time change.",
      "\"The Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn't! Daylight Saving Time is inconvenient, and very costly to our Nation,\" he wrote on Truth Social in December of last year.",
      "While his December comment called for the elimination of daylight saving time, Mr. Trump has, in the past, called for permanent daylight saving \u2014 that is, keeping clocks shifted one hour ahead.",
      "There have been a number of studies finding that changing clocks twice a year can be disruptive for people's health. In addition to impacting mood and mental health,\u00a0researchers at Stanford Medicine this year said that falling back and springing forward may lead to an increase in heart attacks, obesity and strokes.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 09:46:36 -0500",
    "summary": "For some, the high cost of child care in the U.S. is a higher expense than rents and mortgages, or even in-state college tuition, and has pushed tens of thousands of women out of the workforce this year alone.",
    "story": [
      "As parents to a one- and three-year-olds, Dr. Yeni Abraham and husband Dele could use a good night's sleep. But one thing in particular keeps them up at night: The cost of child care. According to Yeni, it costs them $100 more than their mortgage. \"It's just insane,\" she said.",
      "The couple lives in Texas. She's a physical therapist, he's an IT engineer. They say the cost of child care is crushing. But that's not the only problem: their friends were signing up for daycare as soon as they found out they were pregnant. \"The demand is there,\" Yeni said. \"And it just never occurred to me that the supply would be so low.\"",
      "Yeni would sometimes have to bring her baby to work with her. \"I'm taking my son to the clinic. He was on my hip while I was treating my patient. Real life, true story,\" she said.",
      "In the United States, child care for two kids costs on average more than rents and mortgages, and even in-state college tuition. It's pushed parents into debt, and pulled thousands of women out of the workforce this year alone.",
      "Reshma Sujani, CEO and founder of the group Moms First, said that of the choices some families are being forced to make, \"none of them are good. And because two-thirds of the caregiving work is often done by women, it's moms who are having to make this choice. So, they're downshifting their jobs. They're dropping out of the workforce entirely.",
      "\"We have lots of conversations about the cost of housing, about the cost of gas, about the cost of eggs,\" Sujani said. \"But when you look at a family's budget and you say, 'What is the most expensive line item?' the answer is child care.\"",
      "And it's not just families who are struggling: \"Part of the reason why we have a shortage is because we don't have enough child care workers,\" said Sujani. \"And we don't have enough child care workers because we've never paid them adequately.\"",
      "Dozens of countries consistently outrank the United States when it comes to child care, most offering free or highly-subsidized programs \u2013 ideas that aren't as foreign to America as you might think. Back in the 1940s, child care was paid for by Uncle Sam. \"We knew the men were going off to war and somebody needed to work,\" said Sujani. \"This was funded by the federal government during World War II. But when the men came back, they dismantled it. And ever since then, we've done really nothing to really fix it or solve it.\"",
      "\"This is how you strengthen your community\"",
      "Fast forward to 2025. While millions of families continue to struggle, calls for solutions have intensified. A growing number of red and blue states are making changes. But none has gone as far as New Mexico. Starting this month, New Mexico becomes the first state to offer free child care to all residents, paid for largely with tax money from the oil and gas industry.",
      "Since 2022, Kari Ellis and her wife, Amanda Cordova, have participated in an early phase of New Mexico's child care reform. They choose the provider; the state foots the bill.",
      "\"If you want people to work, this is how you do it,\" said Ellis. \"You give them the tools and the resources. This is how you strengthen your community.\"",
      "Asked if she could you imagine life if she still had to pay for child care, Ellis replied, \"We wouldn't be in this house right now. She probably wouldn't have her own business. This opened up doors that I don't know would have been possible before. We were able to find a quality place where they are getting the education and support that they need while we're trying to raise good humans.\"",
      "The program has its critics, including those who say child care is the responsibility of the family, not the government.",
      "To the suggestion that previous generations had figured out child care, Ellis said, \"I think that a lot of grandparents probably are still working themselves, and are not even in a position to be able to watch their grandchildren.\"",
      "Cordova said, \"People used to be able to afford a house, and their full family on one income, right? Like, mom could stay home, or whoever could stay home. But we can't do that anymore.\"",
      "An economic issue",
      "It's a message that's made its way to Washington, D.C., and across party lines. Republican Senator Katie Britt of Alabama and Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia disagree on plenty, but not this.",
      "\"Our economy loses $122 billion a year because of affordability or accessibility of child care,\" said Britt.",
      "I asked, \"So, this isn't just a social issue, it's an economic issue?\"",
      "\"Absolutely,\" Britt replied. \"Studies show that 59% of stay-at-home and/or part-time working parents say that they want to reenter the workforce, but this reliability, affordability, accessibility issue is keeping them out of it.\"",
      "This year, as part of the \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" Britt and Kaine updated child care tax credits for the first time in a quarter-century. They also increased tax benefits for businesses providing child care assistance, and larger contributions to dependents care flexible spending accounts.",
      "Kaine said, \"Let's spread the word, because again, getting this done in the statute is one thing. But making sure people know to take advantage of it [is another].\"",
      "Critics argue the larger bill cuts other key social programs and will ultimately hurt families. [In fact, Kaine himself did not vote for the bill.] But both senators say the child care provisions are a win.",
      "I asked, \"So if today, child care is the number one expense that families are facing, when do you think that's gonna change?\"",
      "\"This is a classic thing where there's no one, you know, part of government that's got the whole answer to this,\" said Kaine. \"You do see states doing some cool things. And that's to be encouraged. I have a feeling this work will always be before us. But we've taken a really good step together on this.\"",
      "\"So, what would you say to the parent who's watching now, sitting at their kitchen table, trying to figure out how to pay these bills?\"",
      "Britt said, \"We're fighting for you. And so, we're gonna keep working and keep making sure that we deliver solutions.\"",

Earlier in President Trump's term, it had larger majority approval, but since mid-summer, the program has hovered around more even division. Its approval is a bit higher today than last month.",
      "Part of the rationale for people supporting or opposing it has been their perception of who is being targeted for deportation.",
      "When Americans think criminals are being prioritized, they're far more likely to back the program. That perception, too, is divided.",
      "Specifically, of late, slightly more than half the country feels ICE is being too tough in detaining and stopping people, more so than not tough enough. And a majority feel ICE officers should not be allowed to wear masks while on duty.",

      "More broadly, a majority of Americans think Mr. Trump's policies are making migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border go down, and those who do largely approve of the administration's deportation program, perhaps indicating that the two are connected in their minds in gauging the overall approach to immigration.",

    "summary": "The 2025 federal government shutdown, in the first year of Trump's second term, is one of the longest in U.S. history.",
    "story": [
      "The federal government is now in the midst of its second-longest shutdown, after Congress has repeatedly failed to pass a bill to fund the government on a temporary basis. The 2025 shutdown is a few days shy of the record set by the 2018-2019 shutdown, which lasted 35 days and took place during President Trump's first administration.",
      "On Sept. 19, the House passed a measure that would have kept the government running through Nov. 21, but the bill failed to make it out of the GOP-led Senate the same day. Since government funding lapsed on Oct. 1, the Senate has held a number of votes, but Republicans have not been able to garner the support they need from Democrats to advance the bill.",
      "Here's the government shutdown by the numbers:",
      "13: Number of times the Senate has held failed votes to end the shutdown",
      "Since just before the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the Senate has voted 13 times on a House-passed resolution to fund the government until Nov. 21. There are 53 Republicans in the Senate, 45 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. When all senators are present, there have been 55 votes in favor of funding the government, five short of the 60 needed to move the bill forward.",
      "The Senate, which has 100 senators, requires only a simple majority to pass most legislation. But the Senate's filibuster rule effectively requires nearly all legislation \u2014 including the continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government \u2014 to reach a 60-vote threshold first. A single senator may delay a bill during debate by invoking a filibuster, which can only be ended if a supermajority of 60 senators vote to end debate.",
      "52: Senate Republicans supporting resolution to fund the government and end the shutdown",
      "43: Senate Democrats/independents opposed, plus 1 Republican",
      "GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is the lone Republican joining most Democratic senators in voting against advancing the resolution to fund the government. He opposes the measure because it adds to the nation's rising debt.",
      "3: Senate Democrats/independents supporting resolution to fund the government and end the shutdown",
      "Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada have voted with Republicans in support of the measure, as has independent Sen. Angus King of Maine.",
      "5: Number of senators necessary to change their votes to advance the resolution",
      "\"We need five Democrats to show a little courage,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on Oct. 23, a day after the 12th vote failed. \"Reopen the government and let's get to work.\"",
      "42 million: The number of people who will lose food stamp benefits on Nov. 1",
      "Roughly 42 million Americans rely on food stamps that arrive every month on their electronic benefit transfer cards, according to data from the USDA. On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. On Oct. 28, 25 states asked a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the Agriculture Department to provide benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for November, including by tapping into a contingency fund to ensure the assistance continues to flow to more than 25 million people living within their borders.",
      "They argue the administration's decision to cut off food stamp payments is unlawful and threatens to deprive millions of Americans of essential food benefits that help protect against food insecurity and hunger.",
      "$9.2 billion: The cost of funding food stamps for November",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins says it would cost about $9.2 billion to keep SNAP benefits flowing next month. The Agriculture Department's contingency fund has around $5 billion, which Rollins has argued the administration doesn't have the legal ability to use.",
      "Some lawmakers from both parties have called for standalone legislation to fund SNAP.",
      "At least 670,000: Government workers who have been furloughed since the shutdown began",
      "According to the Bipartisan Policy Center's analysis of daily Treasury statements and the center's own workforce estimates, at least 670,000 federal employees are furloughed. The Congressional Budget Office estimated last month that compensation for furloughed workers is roughly $400 million per day.",
      "About 730,000: Federal employees who are working without pay",
      "Government workers who are determined to be essential are still working, albeit without pay, and there are about 730,000 of these employees, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.",
      "Over 4,000: Federal workers the government disclosed it was trying to lay off during shutdown",
      "On Oct. 28, a judge indefinitely barred the Trump administration from firing government employees due to the shutdown while a lawsuit challenging the effort makes its way through the courts.",
      "In mid-October, the administration already sent \"reduction in force\" layoff notices to over 4,000 federal employees across seven agencies.",
      "Here are the approximate numbers:",
      "$130 million: The private donation Trump says he's used to help pay the military",
      "President Trump says an unnamed \"patriot\" donated $130 million to fund troops' paychecks, which are normally cut off during shutdowns. The New York Times reported that donor is Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire and scion to the Mellon family banking fortune.",
      "That nine-figure check likely isn't enough to cover the military's entire payroll. There are around 1.3 million active-duty service members, so the donation comes out to roughly $100 per person.",
      "At least $7 billion: The economic cost of the shutdown",
      "The shutdown could temporarily cut the nation's economic output by billions of dollars as unpaid federal workers curtail their spending and SNAP benefits are paused, leading to a 1-percentage-point GDP drop if the shutdown lasts four weeks and a 2-point dip if it drags on for eight weeks, the Congressional Budget Office said in an Oct. 29 estimate.",
      "Much of that decline will be reversed after the government reopens and the spigot of federal spending turns back on \u2014 but not all of it. The GDP will face a sustained drop of $7 billion after a four-week shutdown, $11 billion after six weeks and $14 billion after eight weeks, the CBO says.",

    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to open their wallets this holiday season, increasing their gift budgets even as a slowing job market and stubborn inflation weigh on consumer confidence, according to a new analysis from Visa Business and Economic Insights.",
      "U.S. consumers are forecast to spend an average of $736 each on holiday gifts, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year, Visa said in its 2025 holiday spending outlook.",
      "Inflation partly explains this year's projected sales growth, with the Consumer Price Index showing that prices rose 3% on an annual basis in September. But Americans are also planning on upping their gifting, especially older consumers, with baby boomers forecasted to boost their holiday spending by 21%, the study found.",
      "The robust spending outlook highlights consumers' resilience, even as confidence surveys paint a more cautious picture.",
      "\"We are clearly seeing consumers spend in a far better, more robust way than what we're seeing in the consumer sentiment and confidence data,\" Michael Brown, a principal U.S. economist at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Visa tapped retail sales data from the U.S. Department of Commerce \u2014 excluding automobiles, gas stations and restaurants \u2014 for its holiday spending projections.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, changes in consumer spending corresponded more closely with consumer sentiment, Visa's analysis shows. But that link has weakened in recent years. In April, for example, when consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since the pandemic, real consumer spending increased 3.1% on an annual basis, the Visa report points out.",
      "Consumers continue to express dour views about the economy, with sentiment falling for a third consecutive month\u00a0in October due to worries about a weaker job market and rising inflation, according to the latest University of Michigan sentiment index. Another measure from the Conference Board, a nonprofit group, also shows confidence in the economy edged down slightly this month.",
      "What explains the disconnect? Steady wage gains have kept spending aloft, with many Americans continuing to shop despite higher prices because their take-home pay remains solid, Brown said.",
      "Other holiday outlook forecasts from groups like Abode for Business and polling firm\u00a0Gallup point to the same conclusion as Visa's: Americans are planning to dish out billions on holiday gifts, travel and food despite their gloomy views on the economy.",
      "Still, some are exercising caution in their purchasing, Brown said, noting that low- and middle-income households will face the biggest tradeoffs this holiday season. Higher costs for essentials such as groceries are leaving them with less room for discretionary spending, he added.",
      "\"There is absolutely an undercurrent of trying to make the dollar stretch, given some of those necessities are costing a bit more this season,\" Brown said.",

      "Jerusalem\u00a0- Palestinian militants have so far released the remains of 20 hostages that were held in Gaza for the past two years as part of the ceasefire agreement in the Israel-Hamas war. But the process of returning the bodies of the last eight remaining hostages, as called for under the U.S. peace plan, is progressing slowly, with militants releasing just one or two bodies every few days.",
      "Hamas says it has not been able to reach all of the remains because they are buried under rubble of buildings destroyed by Israel's two-year offensive in the Gaza Strip. Israel's government and the families of the hostages have accused Hamas of dragging its feet, however, and officials have threatened to resume military operations or withhold humanitarian aid if all of the remains are not returned.",
      "In the most recent release, Hamas returned the bodies on Sunday of three troops killed during its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on southern Israel. Israel's military confirmed that the remains belonged to hostages Omer Neutra, Oz Daniel and Col. Assaf Hamami.",
      "In return, Israel has so far released the bodies of 270 Palestinians back to Gaza, including 45 handed over on Monday, according to Palestinian media. Israel has not provided any details on their identities, and it is unclear if they were killed in Israel during the attack on Oct. 7, or if they were Palestinian detainees who died in Israeli custody, or bodies that were taken from Gaza by Israeli troops during the war.",

The family held a double funeral for the couple. They are survived by four children and six grandchildren.",

      "The mountaineers, all Germans, were hit by the avalanche at about 4 p.m. on Saturday while climbing near the Cima Vertana, in the Ortles mountains, at an altitude of more than 11,500 feet. It is unknown why the climbers were still on their way up at this relatively late hour, rescuers said.",

    "story": [
      "British police dismissed speculation on Sunday that a mass stabbing attack on a London-bound train that hospitalized 11 people the night before was terrorism-related.",
      "Police said one person injured in the incident remains in life-threatening condition, among six people hospitalized in the wake of the stabbing. One man, born in the United Kingdom, was in custody Sunday after a second man arrested in connection with the attack was released without charges. Both were arrested eight minutes after the first emergency calls were made from aboard the train, where passengers had reported scenes of panic and chaos as many ran through the carriages and some sought safety in the bathrooms.",
      "The 32-year-old British man still in custody was undergoing questioning by police on suspicion of attempted murder, police said. They also said that they determined the 35-year-old man previously arrested in connection with the stabbing was not involved in the crime.",
      "\"It's a shocking incident, and first and foremost, my thoughts are with the family and friends of those who' been affected and those who are injured,\" British Transport Police Superintendent John Loveless said in a news conference outside the station in Huntingdon in eastern England, where the train halted soon after the attack.",
      "\"There is nothing to suggest this is a terrorist incident,\" he added.",
      "The police superintendent also gave an update on those injured in the attack, reducing the number in life-threatening condition from nine to two. Four of the injured have been discharged from the hospital, he said. One other person had arrived at the hospital, taking the overall number injured in the attack to 11.",
      "Emergency services, including armed police and air ambulances,\u00a0were quick to arrive\u00a0on the scene shortly after they were alerted after 7:30 p.m. local time Saturday as the train drew into Huntingdon, a market town a few miles northwest of the university city of Cambridge. The two people were arrested at the station, which is around 75 miles north of London.",
      "Police said the stabbing attack occurred on the Doncaster to London King's Cross train as it headed into Huntingdon. It did not provide a motive for the attack.",
      "During their immediate response to the stabbing, police said that \"Plato,\" the national code word used by police and emergency services when responding to what could be a \"marauding terror attack,\" had been initiated. But the declaration was later rescinded.",
      "\"At this early stage, it would not be appropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident,\" Loveless said.",
      "The British newspaper The Times\u00a0reported\u00a0that a witness described seeing a man with a large knife. The witness told The Times there was \"blood everywhere,\" with people hiding in bathrooms to escape, and some getting \"stamped (on) by others\" as they tried to flee.",
      "Paul Bristow, the mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, said in a post on X that he had heard of reports of \"horrendous scenes\" on the train. Cambridge is located in the county of Cambridgeshire.",
      "Passenger Olly Foster told the CBS News partner BBC News that he heard people shouting \"run, run, there's a guy literally stabbing everyone,\" and initially thought it might have been a Halloween prank \u2014 Saturday was a day after Halloween. But as passengers pushed past him to get away, he noticed his hand was covered in blood from a chair he had leaned on.",
      "In\u00a0a social media post, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the attack an \"appalling incident\" that was \"deeply concerning,\" and urged people in the area to \"follow the advice of the police.\"",
      "\"My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response,\" he wrote.",
      "Britain's King Charles III sent his sympathies and thoughts to those affected and said he was \"truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack.\"",
      "\"Our deepest sympathy and thoughts are with all those affected, and their loved ones,\" the king said. \"We are particularly grateful to the emergency services for their response to this awful incident.\"",
      "London North Eastern Railway, or LNER, which operates the East Coast Mainline services in the U.K., confirmed the incident had happened on one of its trains and said there would be major disruption on the route until Monday.",

      "The U.S. military has carried out another lethal strike on alleged drug smugglers in the Caribbean Sea, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Saturday.",
      "Hegseth, in a social media post, said a U.S.-designated terrorist organization allegedly operated the vessel but did not name which group was targeted. He said three people were killed in the strike.",
      "It's at least the 15th such strike carried out by the U.S. military in the Caribbean or eastern Pacific since early September. The U.S. military has now killed at least 64 people in the strikes.",

      "The news comes after the Pentagon announced on Oct. 24 that it would be sending the USS Gerald R. Ford, the Navy's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, to the waters off Latin America. This move dramatically increased the number of service members and ships dedicated to the Trump administration's\u00a0campaign\u00a0to counter narcotics traffickers.",
      "President Trump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States. He has asserted the U.S. is engaged in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels, relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration when it declared a war on terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.",
      "The White House has repeatedly rebuffed U.S. lawmakers in their demand that the administration release more information about the legal justification for the strikes, as well as greater details about which cartels have been targeted and the individuals killed.",
      "Hegseth, in his Saturday post announcing the latest strike, said \"narco-terrorists are bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans at home\" and the Defense Department \"will treat them EXACTLY how we treated Al-Qaeda.\"",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro said in an exclusive interview with CBS News on Oct. 24 that some of those killed in the U.S. strikes have been innocent civilians, and he reiterated his accusation that the attacks violate international law.",
      "Senate Democrats renewed their request for more information about the strikes in a letter on Friday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Hegseth.",
      "\"We also request that you provide all legal opinions related to these strikes and a list of the groups or other entities the President has deemed targetable,\" the senators wrote.",
      "Among those signing the letter were Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as well as Sens. Jack Reed, Jeanne Shaheen, Mark Warner, Chris Coons, Patty Murray and Brian Schatz.",
      "The letter says that thus far the administration \"has selectively shared what has at times been contradictory information\" with some members, \"while excluding others.\"",

      "Warner told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that Hegseth \"doesn't tell the truth\" on the briefing being shared on a bipartisan basis, saying \"we asked for the legal opinion back in July when it was first written.\"",
      "\"That is not the way the system is supposed to work when you further partisan national security \u2014 when we're putting troops in harm's way,\" Warner said. \"I got an aircraft carrier from Norfolk that's in the Caribbean right now. How do I answer the families of those sailors about whether this operation is even legal? This document needs to be shared with every member of the Senate this week, so that as we get into this discussion about war powers, we've got the basis of how the administration is claiming that it's legal.\"",

Many of its nearly 14 million customers are in the military or veterans, and he joins us from San Antonio. Sir, Secretary Bessent said on this program just last Sunday that by November 15, the troops and service members aren't going to be paid. What level of anxiety are you seeing among your customers?",
      "USAA PRESIDENT JUAN ANDRADE: Margaret, thank you for having me on your show. What we're seeing today is uncertainty, anxiety and, for some, real hardship, and that's really within the- the active duty community. It's also important to note that 30% of federal employees are also veterans or military spouses. So this is more than an impact to a household budget. This can really undermine morale and focus, and our goal is to provide stability for people who are living paycheck to paycheck and who are frankly losing ground.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I've seen that you're offering interest free loans to customers. Is- is that everyone, or just specifically active duty military? And- and if they can't qualify for a loan, what do they do?",
      "ANDRADE: So we're offering our government shutdown program to all eligible members of USAA. So as you said, that's currently about 14 and a half million people, and at this point, we've acted swiftly and decisively. In the first 48 hours of the shutdown, we funded 150 million in zero interest loans. We are now up to 400 million to date. But that's also in addition to payment extensions that we've done on credit cards, auto loans, mortgages. We've also waived fees for overdraft and we've also had flexible insurance arrangements across our property, casualty, life and health insurance businesses.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Four hundred million in zero interest loans. So people are already looking to try to figure out how to make ends meet. We looked, and a quarter of all active duty military members are food insecure, according to the Department of Agriculture, that was well before this shutdown. That means they don't have a good diet, or they're not able to afford food. We already saw strain on a lot of that active duty military. Can you give us a sense of- of what this means for someone now, to- to look at the calendar and know November 15, there's no pay coming?",
      "ANDRADE: Yeah, and- and- and I agree this is one of the reasons why we've already funded 400 million in loans at this point in time. People are preparing for an uncertain period of time, and this is very important to them, particularly if we think about our younger enlisted and particularly those with families. Dual incomes in military families is not a luxury, it's a necessity. So these are people that we're very worried about, and we want to make sure that they're stable through this period of time. The other part of this, and frankly, the reason for doing these zero interest loans is we want to make sure that they don't turn to high interest rate payday loans or high interest rate credit cards at the same time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the unemployment rate among civilian military spouses is almost five times the national average, to your point, that they need dual income. Many can't do that, but the Congressional Budget Office projection is that there will be an economic cost, that the shutdown itself could lead to seven to 14 billion in lost growth. What's the impact on the communities like yours, where you were living, down in Texas, you know, in areas where there are bases around this country?",
      "ANDRADE: Sure, I think you see it in a few ways. I think one is definitely on consumer spending. Right now, people are prioritizing basic needs, whether it's health or food at this point in time, so they're definitely cutting back on- on discretionary spending. I think that's part of that. The other aspect of it is you're going to see more people who are food insecure, and this is one of the reasons why we have also been supporting our local communities. Our offices are all located near major military installations, and we have donated millions to military aid societies who are best positioned to provide food and other services in installations, and we've also been donating to local food banks in our communities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So how does this compare to the last extended shutdown that we had during the first Trump administration?",
      "ANDRADE: The- the last shutdown basically has not- did not last as long. I think that was a big part of that. And we also had the certainty that the military would be getting paid. Now, clearly, up until now, they have been getting paid. The question of the uncertainty that we're seeing from our members is what happens over the next couple of weeks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you were already planning for that November 15- when you say the shutdown wasn't this long, you're assuming the government does not get funded for how long? How long can you keep doing this?",
      "ANDRADE: We're already- we're already planning for a second loan to members, so we've had a number take us up, certainly on the first offer of loan. Now, they're taking us up on the second offer of loan, and we're prepared to assist. That's our-our job, and to take care of our members in the military community. So we will keep up with this. And if we have to do more, we will do more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Well, we- we are thinking of your customers at this time, we will continue to track what happens with that real world impact. Thank you, Mr. Andrade.",
      "ANDRADE: Thank you, Margaret.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, a Democrat, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 2, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Massachusetts Democratic Governor Maura Healey, who joins us this morning from Boston. Governor, welcome to Face The Nation.",
      "GOVERNOR MAURA HEALEY: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A family of four receiving food stamps makes $31,000 or less per year. That program gives less than $200 a month to one in eight Americans. It's 42 million people. I know you joined this lawsuit to try to sue the administration to get them to use emergency funding to pay for food stamps during the government shutdown. Given what happened with the courts Friday, will food stamp payments be going out this week? It's your state that has to administer, administer the program, right?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: Yeah, I don't know Margaret because the President hasn't said whether he's going to approve the release of those contingency funds. I mean, the, the impact of this is just devastating. One in eight Americans, you say, I have about one in seven Massachusetts residents who are on SNAP. I was at food pantries yesterday. I mean people across our state do not want to see people go hungry, but people woke up on Saturday morning not having access to their benefits. The reason we sued, Margaret, 28 states, and I'm glad and grateful to the AGs for getting the favorable ruling. It basically tells the President do what you're supposed to do, which is use the contingency funds that have been set aside for exactly this purpose, when there is a shutdown among other things, release those funds, continue the SNAP payments to our states. I strongly urge that. I hope it happens immediately on Monday. People in this country should not go hungry, and I think Americans don't want to see their brothers and sisters go hungry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that federal judge in Rhode Island ordered full payments by Monday or partial SNAP payments by Wednesday. On another network, the Treasury Secretary was asked if, if the administration would do just that, and he said, could be. Practically speaking how do you, how quickly can you turn it on? I mean, if that comes through Wednesday, do people in Massachusetts get to eat on Thursday?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: No. I mean the problem, Margaret, with what the President has done is that he cut this off and it takes a few days to load up those cards. I mean anywhere between two and five days. I will tell you what I am doing as governor because I've got to protect my residents. I've got to work with others to make sure that they are fed. We've advanced funding to our food pantries. We stood up a United Way fund, and already, you know, 3 million, I think, in contributions have come through this week. We have seen an incredible outpouring of volunteers. I was at food pantries yesterday, and the turnout is something. And, you know, but, but this is not sustainable. Right? I mean we cannot continue along this path, which is why he needs to release those funds, as at least one court told him to do, right now. As soon as possible, because it takes us time to load up those cards.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So here's how President Trump described the shutdown impact Friday. Take a listen.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All they have to do is say the government is open, and that's the end of it. And you know, largely, when you talk about SNAP, you're talking about largely Democrats. But I'm President, I want to help everybody. I want to help Democrats and Republicans. But when you're talking about SNAP, if you look, it's largely Democrats. They're hurting their own people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Doesn't he have a point that your party is responsible for some of this pain?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: Absolutely not and, frankly, that's a really insulting comment. You know, Margaret, I've got 21,000 veterans, men and women who have served our country, who are SNAP beneficiaries in Massachusetts, who had their benefits turned off, who face hunger right now. To be clear, you want to know who SNAP beneficiaries are in this country? They're our seniors, they're kids, and they're people with disabilities. They live in every state, in every city and town around this country. And for the President to even suggest something like that or to say something like that is insulting. And this is the part, this is the problem with, with D.C. You showed the poll, right? I mean, at the end of the day, the President and Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House, and, you know, Mike Johnson hasn't had these guys back in session, I think, but for 12 out of 100 of the last days. So get back to Washington, get back to the table. Sort this out. Americans want to see that people are fed. They want to make sure that they have access to child care, because health, Head Start's getting turned off too. And they don't want to see their health premiums go up. I mean, that's what's happening right now, and the impact is being felt everywhere",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We checked and the top five states or districts with the highest percentage of residents who use food stamps are New Mexico, D.C., Louisiana, Oregon and Oklahoma. Two of those states are ruby red and voted for President Trump in last election. I think that's what you're pointing to in terms of insult, but on the substance of why we are in this shut down, Democrats have refused to sign on to a clean government funding bill. On that point, don't Democrats bear some responsibility?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: What Democrats in Congress did is stand with hundreds of\u00a0 thousands, millions of Americans right now who are seeing their premiums go up. I've got people in Massachusetts who just got notices because of the expiration of the subsidies. They're going to see their premiums rise as much as $20,000. American families can't afford that, you know. And I'm focused on economic hardship and what I can do to protect my people and I think most of us are in our states as governors, which is why the folks in D.C. need to get back to work. Mike Johnson needs to call his members back because how are you going to get a negotiation if you're not even in D.C., right? You got to get back to D.C. The president has got to give a clear directive to Republicans that they need to reopen government because Americans are suffering and continue to suffer every single day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, Healy, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\" We turn now to Texas Republican Congressman Dan Crenshaw, who joins us this morning from Humble, Texas. Welcome to \"Face the Nation.\"",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I know you've been in and out of Washington, but largely that the House members have not been here in town. The House hasn't voted since September 19. It will be the seventh consecutive week now that they've been working from home. Would you urge Speaker Johnson to bring everyone back to try to break the impasse over government funding?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: It's up to the Speaker. House Republicans and House Democrats coming back to Washington, will not break the impasse. Let's not forget that the House passed a clean CR. It was a temporary CR, okay. And you know, Democrats keep saying the Republicans have no intent to negotiate. We can't trust them to want to negotiate if we reopen the government. That's nonsense. If we had- look, if we had passed a year-long CR, I think they could make that argument. That's usually an indicator that we really don't want to talk about the budget right now, we want to- we want to keep the can down the road for a year. But when you pass a very short term duration CR, a seven-week one, it is a clear indication that we intend on continuing those conversations. So look, there's other things we could do. The reason I keep going back is because I work on the Intelligence Committee, and I have to do that work from inside DC. There's a number of reasons people go back. But look, in the end, the Senate has to deal with this, and Senate Democrats just have to reopen the government. It's that simple. They voted- I don't even what is it, 15 times now, to keep it closed. They wouldn't even vote to keep federal workers paid. That was a crazy lifeline that Senator Thune gave them, allowing them to vote, almost have the easy way out, allow them to at least vote to take the pain off of federal workers. And they voted that down too. I really don't know what their strategy is at this point. They're the ones that need to figure this out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you heard- perhaps you heard Senator Warner at the top of the program say, you know, conversations are happening this week. He was hoping that there would be some- some end. On your side of the- of the Capitol. You're saying you don't see signs of this ending this week?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Don't see what- sorry, yeah- I don't, I don't see us going back into session. I think we would have been notified by now. Yeah, but again, the impasse is not in the House. You know, we passed it out of the House--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Understood-- but to come to an agreement, which is was- the senator was talking about everyone getting together and going to the White House with the President to hammer this out. The speaker, at least, it doesn't sound like you have that level of optimism. But let's talk about the impact where you are. Your district includes parts of Houston. We checked the numbers, and it appears 350,000 Houston area families may have some difficulty with their food stamps, these SNAP benefits because of the standoff. Have you gotten any guidance from the state or from the administration about whether people get food payments this week?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Well, from what I can tell from the administration's statements, I mean, they're going to try to use the emergency contingency fund for- on a temporary basis. But look the entire- I think there's about $6 billion in that fund. The monthly SNAP benefits cost Americans $9 billion so that's- that is a very, very small band aid. And the only way you're going to get SNAP benefits back on track is if Democrats vote for our clean CR. I visited a food bank recently. Yeah, they're preparing for a huge influx in demand. You know, the state can only do so much on this. We- all of us can only do so much there's- there's a really simple solution to this, which is just keep the government open and you know, you want to negotiate this very complex health care issue, which is what Democrats say they want. I think they kind of chose it out of- randomly, and all of a sudden decided throw this temper tantrum. But fine, let's negotiate it, but you have to do it with the government open and not hold- you're not holding a gun to our heads. You're holding a gun to the regular American people's heads.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are on the Intelligence Committee. You mentioned you had, have had to come back here to view what I assume is classified intelligence. The President confirmed a few weeks back that he had authorized some CIA activity in Venezuela, he didn't give detail on that, but have you seen any evidence that the US pressure campaign on Nicolas Maduro is working, that all this military hardware that's being moved around into the region is doing something?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: I can only tell you what I can assume, having been out of session, we aren't getting the briefings because- because we aren't there. One of the reasons I keep going back is to look into these things. The broader question- this is more of a geopolitical question, is the pressure campaign working? Well, look, deterrence almost always works, especially when you're dealing with- with dictators like Maduro. They only listen to one thing, which is power. And Venezuela has been largely left alone by American administrations. The western hemisphere has been left alone, and I think this President is taking it much more seriously. Look, the Venezuelan government is a, it's- it's- it's a fake government, right? He ran a rigged election. Everyone knows that it's propped up by the Cubans and by the Russians. They have been in collusion with terrorist groups like the FARC for years. It has been an annoyance to countries like Colombia for years. There's many high-level ranking officials in government- in Venezuelan government that are literally under indictment for drug trafficking. It is effectively a narco-terrorist state--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But Maduro is still in power--",
      "REP. CRENSHAW:-- Maduro, what? Sorry--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that he still is in- in power. That's what we were just talking about that with Senator Warner. The- the need for more information to go to lawmakers about exactly what the extent is going to be of US military involvement. Would you support US land strikes in Venezuela?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Actually boots on the ground in Venezuela?--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Land strikes--",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: -- I think we would have to have to have a longer conversation about doing something to that extent. But I think what the- what the President is doing right now is very much within rational legal means, looking at drug boats that we have- people ask, do we have the intelligence to really know what these drug boats are and who's on them? Yes, we do. That I can say, right. We have multi-source intelligence that- so we know for sure what we're- what we're- what we're actually shooting at, and we don't even shoot at all the targets. And people say, well, why can't you just interdict it all? And I say, well how many boats do you think we have? How many boats and helicopters do you think you have? And you know how risky an interdiction operation is? You're going to people- put people's lives at stake. And you know, we've been doing that for years, and it hasn't worked. So, you do need to try something new, because it is an imminent harm to the United States, and that's clearly within the President's authority under Article Two. So, I don't wring my hands over what's going on right now. Talking hypotheticals about invading Venezuela. I mean, that's not really what we're talking about right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No- no, I was asked about land strikes. But- but let me ask you about something some of your fellow conservatives have been talking quite a lot about including Mitch McConnell, he's been concerned about antisemitism. On the right, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said he's seen more antisemitism in the past six months than in his entire life. Take a listen.",
      "(START SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "SEN. TED CRUZ: \"This is a poison, and I believe we are facing an existential crisis in our party and in our country. ///// If you sit there with someone who says Adolf Hitler was very cool and that their mission is to combat and defeat global Jewry, and you say nothing, then you are a coward, and you are complicit in that evil.\"",
      "(END SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was specifically referring there to a widely watched interview Tucker Carlson did with far-right commentator and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes. Do you share Senator Cruz's concern about your party?",
      "REP. CRENSHAW: Oh, yeah. Mr. Cruz, put it pretty well. I've had a long-standing feud with Tucker Carlson. I'm glad everyone else is- is also waking up now to how bad of a person he is. He's changed a lot over the last 20 years. You know, hard to say why, but it doesn't really matter why. I mean, you have a guy like Fuentes on your show, you're- you're uplifting what is a guy who has really fallen off the radar. You know, he- he used to send his followers to my events and try to ask me a bunch of questions about the Jews and Israel support and all that, and try to disrupt events. And they would try to infiltrate the MAGA movement. You know, they were really on a downhill slide. And for Tucker to have him on- Senator Cruz is exactly right. And this idea that we have to, you know, that it's cancel culture, if we- if we- if we- if we keep Tucker out of our circles from now on, is just nonsense. I literally wrote a book on cancel culture. So, you know, I've thought deeply about this. Cancel culture means you're- you're canceling someone for what is basically a mainstream belief, or maybe- maybe a small, like, honest mistake they made that would be maybe considered cancel culture. It's not cancel culture when you say, look, I want to disassociate myself from you because your beliefs are crazy and you're psychopathic and you're- you are falling apart in front of everyone. You know this disassociation is not canceling anyone, and I know some have suggested it is. So, I think moral- moral clarity is a lot more important in this case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Crenshaw, we have to leave it there. Thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back.",

The American Federation of Government Employees also echoing that, AFSA, which represents the diplomats our country has, are coming out and saying that. They're saying in high threat posts they don't have armored vehicles because they can't afford to repair them. Cyber-attacks are up. Consular officers are paying out of pocket to visit ill or incarcerated Americans. Medication shipments aren't arriving, bills aren't being paid. At what point does all of this pain and pressure end the shutdown?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I hope it ends it this week. Frankly, I see it from my folks. I was greeting voters yesterday, we have early- early vote for our gubernatorial election, but I hear people also very angry at this president. I mean, we knew this wasn't going to end unless Donald Trump was back in the country. He's now back in the country. He got to go ahead and put America first and sit down with us, deal with the health care shortage, deal as well- and to show the just cruelty of this administration, there were $6 billion set aside for SNAP benefits. He's had judges say spend that money. We're still waiting to see whether the administration wants to appeal that. Get the money out to people in need, sit down with us, get this resolved this week, and let's get everybody back to work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say it's going to end this week, does that mean you're going to see more Democrats cross the aisle and agree to vote for a short term spending bill--",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --three have.",
      "[CROSSTALK ENDS]",
      "SEN. WARNER: What we've seen from your polling, everything else, it's a pox on both your houses. We got to put this to bed. It's going to require Trump in the room. It's why the bipartisan conversation so far, I don't think we'll ever get to yes, because unfortunately, my Republican colleagues can't move on anything without a Trump sign off. Trump has spent enough time going out there now trying to audition for a Nobel Prize, running around the world. Come back and put America first. Sit down and let's get this resolved. It can be done in an hour using Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, what is the Democratic ask at this point to get that. Because leader Thune said, hey, I'll talk to you about health care open the government first.",
      "SEN. WARNER: The Democratic ask is- everyone, as of Saturday, saw health care rates skyrocket. This is an immediate crisis too--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, we've blown past that date of November 1--",
      "SEN. WARNER: They can- we can- but we can deal with this jointly, but it's going to require the active intervention of the President.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning you need to see some sort of negotiation on an extension to government health care subsidies before voting to reopen the government?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Listen, President Trump has ended up- and I'm a big supporter of Ukraine, has met more with Volodymyr Zelenskyy this year than he's met with any Democrat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the ask is the meeting?",
      "SEN. WARNER: The meeting is, let's sit down and resolve it. I can't believe Donald Trump, the great deal maker of deal makers- who at least how he presents himself, sitting down with us, we couldn't reach an agreement in an hour.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But at this point, what I hear you saying is, you are not willing to cross the aisle for an immediate, short term funding bill that is clean. You still need a negotiation over health care.",
      "SEN. WARNER: The notion of at least sitting down to talk about health care, making sure that $6 billion that is set aside for SNAP benefits gets paid out so people don't go hungry and we get the government reopened again. The President of the United States has said when he was not President that it's the responsibility of a president to end shutdowns. He has paid no attention to the shutdown. He's- stopped his many international trips, come sit down and let's get this resolved.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And there's been outreach, or there hasn't been outreach?",
      "SEN. WARNER: There's lots of conversations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when you say you're optimistic- or would you say you're optimistic about it after this week?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I think as- what your poll indicated, people are pox on both your houses at this point, get the darn thing open. Deal with the health care cliff. Don't let people go hungry when we've got money set aside on SNAP. That can all be accomplished, sooner the better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be talking about those food stamps later in the program. I want to ask you about your national security portfolio. Just overnight, there was another US strike on an alleged drug boat. I know you have been concerned that Democrats are being excluded, particularly from a key meeting that happened this past week with only Republicans in the room. Secretary Hegseth was asked shortly after your press conference by our Ellee Watson of CBS about his plans to share evidence with Congress. Take a listen.",
      "[SOT]",
      "SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PETE HEGSETH: We are presenting it to Congress. We have time and time again on a bipartisan basis they have been given the evidence directly.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says it's been given. So is your complaint that the evidence is not sufficient, or you disagree with the--",
      "SEN. WARNER: The Secretary of Defense doesn't tell the truth on this matter, we asked for the legal opinion back in July when it was first written. We had been promised it time and again. The Secretary of State, my former colleague and friend, Marco Rubio, looked me in the eye nine days ago and said, Mark, you're going to get it right away. We still didn't get the legal opinion. And then a group of random Republican senators was shared on a partisan basis what is the President's understanding of why these- why it's legal to take these actions. That- you know Margaret, that is not the way the system is supposed to work. When you further partisan national security- when we're putting troops in harm's way. I got an aircraft carrier from Norfolk that's in the Caribbean right now. How do I answer the families of those sailors about whether this operation is even legal? This document needs to be shared with every member of the Senate this week, so that as we get into this discussion about war powers, we've got the basis of how the administration is claiming that it's legal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know the administration says this isn't about war powers that the President has has authorities under Title Two. But let me read to you, because the White House knew you were coming on, they reached out to us yesterday to assert they've provided six bipartisan briefings to members or staff, including your staff, plus the Gang of Eight. A senior Administration official also said classified documents were made available.",
      "SEN. WARNER: There were no classified documents made available to the Gang of Eight members until after a partisan briefing was made to Republicans only. That is not the way our system is supposed to work. If you want to put Americans in harm's way, it needs to be done on a bipartisan basis. My Republican colleagues, many of them afterwards, said, oh yeah, that was not really good. Well, I wish they would have got up and walked out of the damn room, because everyone knows partisanship should not be involved in these national security matters, particularly when we're putting our soldiers and sailors in harm's way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it wasn't just you. The Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican and his Democratic colleague, Jack Reed, said they have twice written to Secretary Hegseth, asking for execute orders specifically legal justifications and the list of terror organizations tied to these strikes. They don't have that information, and they have oversight of the military.",
      "SEN. WARNER: I rest my case. This is what we're all saying, come clean. And the fact is, if, as the administration says, these are all bad guys, and yeah, they're all drugs on these boats, interdict these boats and show the world. Listen the Maduro government in Venezuela. And by the way, none of- none of this legal opinion has anything to do with the Venezuelan Government, Maduro is a bad guy. We should have pushed harder on him when the people of Venezuela voted him out under President Biden. Biden didn't do enough. The drugs are all cocaine it has nothing to do with fentanyl. If you are going to try to make a case to the American public, make it publicly, don't do this and then try to hide the legal justification and give it out only on a partisan basis?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does your Republican colleague, the Chair of the Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton, hear you on this? Is he working with you on this?",
      "SEN. WARNER: To his credit, he did not attend this Republican only briefing that took place earlier this week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And neither did Roger Wicker, Armed Services--",
      "SEN. WARNER: --the notion here is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the White House and the Republicans are in disagreement on this.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, there is not a lack of disagreement from members of the Senate that we've been asking for this legal justification for months, and they are now hiding the ball and only giving it out on a partisan basis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator Warner, thank you for your time today.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 2, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We go now to the Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, who joins us this morning from Far Hills, New Jersey. Welcome to Face The Nation.",
      "TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY:\u00a0 Hey, thanks, Margaret, good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So our CBS polling shows that there is real concern among Americans regarding the effect of the shutdown on all transportation. Should Americans also have safety concerns at this point?",
      "SEC. DUFFY: I think that's a great question. We work overtime to make sure the system is safe. And we will slow traffic down, you'll see delays, we'll have flights canceled to make sure the system is safe. But we have to be honest, when we have controllers, where we have shortages and towers and TRACONs doing two jobs, does it add more risk into the system? Sure, it does. But again, we're always managing that. Again, we don't- we don't want crashes, we want people to go safely, and so we will slow and stop traffic if we don't think we can manage it in a way that keeps people safe as they go from point A to point B.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, I did see that the FAA said, up in New York, 80% of air traffic controllers were absent from New York area airports, and that same day, there was a near miss at LaGuardia Airport. One United plane clipped another one. Was that pilot error? Or was that linked to some kind of shortage?",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 Well, you mentioned the shortages of air traffic controllers in the New York airspace. We had a couple days ago, three hour delays throughout New York. And again, I haven't got the readout yet on whether that was pilot error. And usually, when these planes are- are traveling very close to each other, it's their job to stay away from one another. That's not controllers, it's usually pilot error. But again, I'll have to look and see what directive was given by the air traffic controllers. But it's normally the pilot's responsibility to stay away from aircraft on the tarmac.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So if this shutdown continues, how- when does it become an emergency in terms of passenger safety and the safety of those who are trying to, for example, get home for Thanksgiving in a few weeks.",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 Well, does it become a flight emergency, a safety issue? No, we will stop traffic. So we're not going to let that happen. I think the real consequence is, what kind of rolling delays do you have throughout the system, right? We've seen problems at LA, in Dallas, in DC, Boston, Atlanta. And so I think it's only going to get worse. We have controllers who, some of them are new controllers. We have trainee controllers who are very helpful in the tower. They don't make a lot of money, and they're now confronted, they haven't had a paycheck for over a month. They're confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid? They're making decisions. I've encouraged them all to come to work. I want them to come to work, but they're making life decisions that they shouldn't have to make. Let's open the government up. Let's pay these people, these young controllers. Margaret, it's really important, I think you've covered this, we don't have the best equipment in our towers and centers for air traffic control. But we have the safest airspace, we have the most efficient airspace because we have the best controllers in the world that work our skies and keep our people safe. They deserve a paycheck.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, given that they are so essential, is there any way the administration can find a pot of money like seems to be getting found for others, like the military, to pay controllers so they can show up to work? Why isn't the administration able to do that?",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 Yeah, well, I think that's a great question. So we have done all we can. President Trump has done all he can to minimize the pain of the shutdown on the American people. Again, you remember under Barack Obama's shutdown, he was trying to gate off open air monuments in Washington, DC, and were shutting down parks just walking paths. President Trump has tried to make it less painful on the American people. So we're looking for pots of money to pay essential workers, but there's really strict rules around what money we can use and how we can use it, and we have to follow the law. And so we were able to fund a central air service, service to more rural communities. We've kept our academy up and running thus far. We don't have a ton of time, a couple more weeks of that funding. But I don't have the resources to do that, and the simple answer is, vote to open the government, negotiate your differences. That's fine, that's fair. But again, these people should be paid. And to say that it's Donald Trump's fault, to say he has to find money, when Democrats have said there's no money for you because we've shut the government down, I mean, that's a contorted analysis. And Democrats are trying to do that, and I don't think it really works. Give the money and we'll pay the controllers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Yeah, well, I saw reports that air traffic controllers only received partial pay mid-October, and this past week they missed a paycheck altogether. So practically speaking, for those who are in these jobs, would you advise them to pick up part time work elsewhere?",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 No, I'm clearly asking them, come to work. It is your job to come to work, and eventually you will be paid. But as I've traveled around the country and talked to air traffic controllers, they've told me that a lot of them can navigate missing one paycheck. None of them can manage missing two paychecks. And they're like every American family, everyone watching your show today as they think about their own finances, how many paychecks can they miss before it becomes real stress, real strife in their life? And so they're- at the- next week, they're going to get a notice of what their next paycheck is going to be. And if the government doesn't open, the notice will be another big fat zero, and you're going to see more of them probably make the decisions of funding their families, putting food on their table, gas in their cars, versus coming into work. That's not what I want, but I'm a realist as well, Margaret, these are the decisions of life and survival that these controllers have to make. By the way, it's the technicians, also. We have old equipment. We have technicians that work in the towers that keep the equipment operational. They're not getting paid. I have train inspectors who are working to keep our trains running and running safely. They're working without pay. I have pipeline inspectors, same thing. Across the system. We have a number of people who are working without pay. We talk about the air traffic controllers, but I have thousands of employees who are showing up, doing the work and trying to keep this system safe for the American people all the while they don't get paid to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Understood. So you said back on Fox Business on October 9 that \"I can't have people not showing up for work and that they may be let go.\" There's a shortage of 4,000 controllers already. You're not firing people, are you? You can't afford to.",
      "SEC. DUFFY:\u00a0 No, so when- we're 2-3,000 controllers short, but that's a huge number. And you make an interesting point, because I've tried to surge air traffic controllers into the system through our academy. Margaret, we're up 20% of controllers through the academy this year alone. It takes them about a year to two to get certified in a tower, but this shutdown is impacting my pipeline of controllers. And so as- when everyone forgets about air traffic control and the shutdown, I'm going to deal with the consequences of, again, delivering for the American people and getting more controllers in the towers, not less. And you bring up a good point. We're already stressed in that we don't have enough controllers in our system, and this shutdown, when we have staffing triggers where they're not coming in because they're funding their families and food on their tables, that makes it more difficult because we're already short long. Long term consequences--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're not going to fire them?",
      "SEC. DUFFY: I don't plan on firing control. No, listen, I have, no, I- again when they're making decisions to feed their families, I'm not going to fire air traffic controllers. I have, I have loved them and supported them as they're trying to go through this process and it's challenging for them. They need support, they need money, they need a paycheck. They don't need to be fired.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 All right. Secretary Duffy, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back.",

      "Rescuers and aid workers fanned out across Jamaica on Saturday to distribute food and water and reach communities still isolated four days after Hurricane Melissa hit the island.",
      "One of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes to make landfall, Melissa has been blamed for at least 19 deaths in Jamaica, 31 in nearby Haiti, and at least one death in the Dominican Republic. Melissa made landfall in southwest Jamaica on Tuesday as a Category 5 hurricane with top winds of 185 mph.",
      "Health Minister Christopher Tufton recognized that the death toll in Jamaica was probably higher as many places are still hard to access, but said that it would be unwise to speculate.",
      "Less than half the island has communications, and nearly 400 water systems were knocked out by the storm.",
      "The U.S. Army\u00a0deployed\u00a0three CH-47 Chinook helicopters to Jamaica Friday for humanitarian and disaster relief efforts, with another five helicopters on the way.",
      "According to Agence-France Presse, Jamaican officials on Saturday also announced plans to set up multiple field hospitals after several hospitals in western Jamaica were especially hard-hit by the storm.",
      "\"That facility will come fully equipped, which will include an operating theater and other critical diagnostic equipment, and some team members to support the local team,\" Tufton said in a briefing Saturday, according to AFP, adding that officials expect the hospital to be up and running in the coming week.",
      "There were desperate scenes in Montego Bay, as residents lined up to get food, water and cash. Many U.S. tourists are still working to make their way home. The Florida-based nonprofit Gray Bull Rescue Foundation found a way to get 341 American citizens back from two very hard-hit Montego Bay resorts.",
      "Essential relief supplies are now rolling into hurricane-stricken St. Elizabeth and Westmoreland, most of which had been cut off by fallen concrete posts and trees strewn across roads.",
      "But in some parts, people were forced to dip buckets into rivers, collecting the muddy water for everyday use, while others have been drinking coconut water and roasting breadfruit.",
      "In Westmoreland, mangled metal sheets, splintered wooden frames of houses and fragments of furniture littered the coastline.",
      "Social Security Minister Pearnel Charles Jr. was among several convoys of emergency responders en route to deliver ready-to-eat meals, water, tarpaulins, blankets, medicine and other essentials.",
      "\"The priority now is to get help to those who need it,\" said Charles Jr. during a brief stop en route to Black River for the first time with long-awaited relief supplies. Prime Minister Andrew Holness had declared Black River ground zero and said the town will have to be rebuilt.",
      "The Jamaica Defense Force set up a satellite disaster relief site at the Luana community center near Black River where care packages are being dispatched to hurricane-stricken residents.",
      "Many have been without vital supplies since Tuesday and quickly converged around a JDF truck as word spread that relief supplies were being distributed in the sweltering afternoon sun.",
      "\"Everyone is homeless right now,\" Rosemarie Gayle said. \"Thank you, thank you. I can't say thank you enough,\" she said, as she accepted a package of rice, beans, sardines, powdered milk, cooking oil and other essentials.",
      "Melissa has left devastation in its wake, snapping power lines and toppling buildings, disrupting food and water distribution and destroying crop fields.",
      "Satellite photographs showed the southwestern Jamaican fishing village of White House and the nearby town of Black River before and after Melissa slammed into the island. Each pair captures a once vibrant-looking town reduced to dirt and rubble.",
      "Some people have been walking for miles in search of basic goods and to check on loved ones, as more than 60% of the island remained without power. Helicopters have been dropping food in cut-off communities.",
      "\"People are in shock and they're waiting on relief,\" said World Vision's national director of domestic humanitarian and emergency affairs Mike Bassett, who traveled to the town of Santa Cruz in St. Elizabeth on Friday.",
      "\"The biggest needs are clean water, tarps for roof damage, canned proteins, hygiene and cleaning supplies,\" he said.",
      "On Saturday, the United Nations' World Food Program received 2,000 boxes of emergency food assistance shipped from Barbados, to be distributed in shelters and in the most-affected communities in the St. Elizabeth area.",
      "\"They will help meet the needs of 6,000 people for one week,\" said communications officer for WFP Alexis Masciarelli.",
      "Tufton also warned about the risk of increased mosquitoes, waterborne diseases and food poisoning. \"Please discard spoiled food,\" he said.",
      "A U.S. regional disaster assistance response team was on the ground after being activated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier this week, the U.S. Embassy in Jamaica said.",
      "\"The United States stands with Jamaica as they respond to the impacts of the hurricane and remains prepared to swiftly deliver emergency relief items,\" it said.",
      "Jamaica's Water and Environment Minister Matthew Samuda took to the social media platform X in a desperate bid to find tarpaulin after Melissa tore off scores of roofs on homes in western Jamaica. X users chimed in to help, indicating where they had seen supplies.",
      "Falmouth, a popular fishing spot on Jamaica's north coast, had suffered significant damage including flooding and flattened buildings, Holness said on Saturday.",
      "\"Our immediate priority is to restore electricity and telecommunications and to ensure that essential services, particularly at the Falmouth Hospital, are stabilized,\" he said on X, adding that Jamaica would rebuild \"stronger and wiser.\"",
      "Following the devastation, the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility said that it would make a record payout to Jamaica of $70.8 million.",
      "The facility enables countries to pool their individual risks to provide affordable coverage against natural disasters. The payout will be made within 14 days, the group said on Friday.",
      "Finance Minister Fayval Williams said Thursday that the CCRIF insurance policy was just one part of the government's financial plan to respond to natural disasters. She pointed to a contingencies fund, a national natural disaster reserve and a catastrophe bond.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump threatened to stop all aid to Nigeria and has instructed the Pentagon to \"prepare for possible action\" in the West African country, accusing the country's government of allegedly failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.",
      "In a post on Truth Social on Saturday, Mr. Trump accused the Nigerian government for a second-straight day of not doing enough to prevent the killings of Christians. He threatened that the U.S. \"may very well go into that now disgraced country, 'guns-a-blazing' to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.\"",
      "\"If we attack, it will be fast, vicious and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians! WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "In a post to X Saturday night in response to Mr. Trump's statement, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote, \"Yes sir.\"",
      "\"The killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria \u2014 and anywhere \u2014 must end immediately. The Department of War is preparing for action,\" Hegseth wrote. \"Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.\"",
      "The Department of War is the Trump administration's preferred term for the Defense Department. \"",
      "The Nigerian government has vehemently rejected the claims, and analysts say that while Christians are among those targeted, the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria's Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.",
      "Nigeria's President Bola Ahmed Tinubu said Saturday on social media that the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality.",
      "\"Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,\" Tinubu said. \"Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.\"",
      "The warning of possible military action follows an announcement on Friday that he would designate Nigeria \"a country of particular concern\" as it relates to religious freedom, a move that had been pushed by some U.S. lawmakers.",
      "The designation does not necessarily mean that sanctions, which could include a ban on all non-humanitarian aid, will be imposed, but it is one step ahead of that.",
      "\"Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria,\" Mr. Trump said\u00a0in a social media post. \"Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter. I am hereby making Nigeria a 'COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR CONCERN.'\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he would be asking several U.S. lawmakers to look into the matter and report back on what the response to the designation should be.",
      "\"The United States cannot stand by while such atrocities are happening in Nigeria, and numerous other Countries. We stand ready, willing, and able to save our Great Christian population around the World!\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Designating a \"country of particular concern\" under the\u00a01998 International Religious Freedom Act\u00a0is an executive prerogative that normally follows recommendations from both the congressionally mandated U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and the State Department.",
      "The State Department usually releases\u00a0its annual\u00a0Report on International Religious Freedom in the spring, but has not yet done so this year. The report may or may not include \"particular concern\" designations, which can be done at any time. And, such designations, which authorize U.S. penalties, do not necessarily impose sanctions.",
      "The State Department's most recent religious freedom reports cover 2023 and were released last year under the Biden administration. These reports, like others on broader human rights and human trafficking, cover the previous calendar year and are often late in being submitted.",
      "The designation comes after Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has been trying to rally fellow evangelical Christians to urge Congress to designate Nigeria as a violator of religious freedom with claims of \"Christian mass murder.\"",
      "Nigeria was first placed on the \"country of particular concern\"\u00a0list\u00a0by the U.S. in 2020 in what the State Department called \"systematic violations of religious freedom.\" But the designation did not single out attacks on Christians. The designation was lifted in 2023 in what many saw as a way to improve ties between the countries ahead of a visit by then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken.",

    "summary": "The pipeline supplies the Russian army with gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from refineries.",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian forces\u00a0hit an important fuel pipeline in the Moscow region that supplies the Russian army, Ukraine's military intelligence said Saturday, as Russia kept up a sustained campaign of massive drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.",
      "The operation was carried out late Friday, according to a statement on the Telegram messaging channel. The agency, which is known by its acronym HUR, described it as a \"serious blow\" to Russia's military logistics.",
      "HUR said its forces struck the Koltsevoy pipeline, which spans 250 miles and supplies the Russian army with gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from refineries in Ryazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Moscow.",
      "The operation, which targeted infrastructure near the Ramensky district, destroyed all three fuel lines, HUR said.",
      "The pipeline was capable of transporting up to 3 million tons of jet fuel, 2.8 million tons of diesel and 1.6 million tons of gasoline annually, HUR said.",
      "\"Our strikes have had more impact than sanctions,\" said Kyrylo Budanov, the head of HUR, referring to international sanctions on Russia\u00a0imposed over its all-out war and the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Moscow strains to take key eastern city",
      "Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry on Saturday claimed its forces defeated a team of Ukrainian special forces that were rushed to the eastern frontline hot spot of Pokrovsk in a bid to stop Russian troops from pushing farther into the city.",
      "It later posted videos showing two men it said were Ukrainians who surrendered in the embattled city. The videos show the men, one dressed in fatigues and the other in a dark green jacket, sat against a peeling wall in a dark room, as they speak of fierce fighting and encirclement by Russian forces. The videos' authenticity could not be independently verified, and there was no immediate public comment from Kyiv on the Russian ministry's claims.",
      "Russia and Ukraine have presented conflicting accounts of what is happening in Pokrovsk, a key Ukrainian stronghold in the eastern Donetsk region. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed last week that his forces had encircled the city's Ukrainian defenders.",
      "But Ukraine's army chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Saturday that while the situation in Pokrovsk remains \"hardest\" for Ukrainian forces, who are trying to push Russian troops out of the city, there is no encirclement or blockade as Moscow has maintained.",
      "\"A comprehensive operation to destroy and push out enemy forces from Pokrovsk is ongoing. The main burden lies on the shoulders of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, particularly UAV operators and assault units,\" Syrskyi said in a statement on Telegram.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy acknowledged on Friday that some Russian units had infiltrated Pokrovsk, but insisted that Ukraine is weeding them out.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Russia had deployed around 170,000 troops in Donetsk in a major push to capture the city and claim a major battlefield victory.",
      "Putin is trying to persuade the United States, which wants him to seek a peace deal, that Ukraine can't hold out against Russian military superiority. He has also stressed what he says is Russia's improving nuclear capability as he refuses to budge from what he says are his country's legitimate war aims.",
      "A key goal for Moscow has been to take all of Ukraine's industrial heartland of Donbas, made up of the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk provinces. Kyiv still controls about a 10th of the coal-rich region.",
      "Russian nighttime strikes kill 1,\u00a0wound dozens",
      "Elsewhere, a civilian died and 19 more were wounded, including a 9-year-old girl, when Russia struck the southern Mykolaiv region with an Iskander ballistic missile on Saturday morning, local official Vitaliy Kim said.",
      "Another Russian strike early Saturday sparked a fire at a gas plant in the central Poltava region, Ukraine's emergency service reported.",
      "The strikes came as Russia pressed large drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, bringing power outages and restrictions across the country earlier this week in what Kyiv described as a \"systematic energy terror.\"",
      "Moscow launched 223 drones at Ukraine overnight into Saturday, 206 of which were shot down, according to the Ukrainian air force. Seventeen struck targets in seven Ukrainian regions, the air force said, without providing details.",
      "Russia also hit an agricultural enterprise in Ukraine's northern Chernihiv region, injuring a 66-year old woman, according to a Telegram update by regional government official Viacheslav Chaus.",
      "Russian forces during the night shot down or intercepted 98 Ukrainian drones over the country, including six on the approach to Moscow, the Russian Defense Ministry said Saturday.",
      "There were no immediate reports of casualties, but local authorities reported a rare large-scale power outage in a Russian city of over 100,000 people. The municipal administration of Zhukovsky, 25 miles southeast of Moscow, in a Telegram update blamed the blackout on an \"automatic equipment shutdown.\"",

      "Carney also confirmed that he apologized to the president during a dinner at\u00a0the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit this week because Mr. Trump was \"offended.\"",
      "Ontario's television advertisement that aired in the U.S. criticizes Mr. Trump's tariffs by citing a speech from former U.S.\u00a0President Ronald Reagan.",
      "The ad infuriated Mr. Trump, who ended trade talks with Canada and said he plans to hike tariffs on imports of Canadian goods by an extra 10%.",
      "When asked on Saturday what Ontario Premier Doug Ford's response was to being asked not to run the ad, Carney said, \"Well, you saw what came of it.\"",
      "\"It's not something I would have done,\" Carney added at a news conference as he wrapped a nine-day trip to Asia.",
      "Ford is a populist Conservative, while Carney is a Liberal. As premier, Ford is the equivalent of a U.S. governor.",
      "\"I'm the one who is responsible, in my role as prime minister, for the relationship with the president of the U.S., and the federal government is responsible for the foreign relationship with the U.S. government,\" Carney said.",
      "A spokesperson for Ford didn't immediately respond when asked if Carney told Ford not to run the ad.",
      "Ford previously said Carney and Carney's chief of staff watched the ad before it was released.",
      "Ford pulled the ad last Monday but allowed it to be shown in the first two games of the World Series, where the Toronto Blue Jays are playing the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "Mr. Trump said the ad misrepresented the position of Reagan, a two-term president and a beloved figure in the Republican Party. But Reagan was wary of tariffs and used much of the 1987 address featured in Ontario's ad, spelling out the case against them, saying tariffs work \"only for a short time\" and \"hurt every American worker and consumer.\"",
      "\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,\" Reagan\u00a0said, as quoted by the ad.",
      "Mr. Trump has complained that the ad was aimed at influencing the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of arguments scheduled this month that could decide whether Mr. Trump has the power to impose his sweeping tariffs, a key part of his economic strategy. Lower courts had ruled he had exceeded his authority.",
      "Carney met with Mr. Trump at the White House last month and has been trying to secure a trade deal to lower some tariffs on sectors like steel and aluminum. Tariffs are taking a toll on the aluminum, steel, auto and lumber sectors.",
      "More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly 3.6 billion Canadian dollars ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border daily.",
      "On Wednesday, the Senate voted to approve a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada. In a 50 to 40 vote, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve the measure, which would terminate the national emergency used to impose tariffs on some goods from Canada.",
      "The move is mostly symbolic, since it is unlikely to be taken up in the GOP-controlled House.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Nov 2025 13:18:31 -0400",
    "summary": "The Grand Egyptian Museum has taken 30 years to become a reality, but finally opened its doors, with an equally grand opening ceremony.",
    "story": [
      "Cairo \u2014\u00a0Egypt's government hosted dozens of foreign leaders and dignitaries on Saturday as it held an official opening ceremony for the Grand Egyptian Museum, a $1 billion project decades in the making that was plagued by multiple delays and a ballooning of the budget.",
      "The GEM is one of the largest museums in the world, and the largest dedicated to a single civilization: ancient Egypt. Its subject matter spans some 7,000 years, from prehistory to the end of the Greek and Roman eras around 400 A.D.",
      "\"It is a great day for Egypt and for humanity. This is Egypt's gift to the world. It's a dream come true, after all these years, the GEM is finally and officially open,\" Nevine El-Aref, media adviser to the Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, told CBS News.",
      "The initial cost for the more than 5-million-square-foot, triangular-themed structure about a mile from the iconic pyramids of Giza was estimated at $500 million, but the final price tag was more than double that. Costing over $1 billion, the\u00a0project was funded through Egyptian resources and international cooperation.",
      "In front of the main entrance stands the imposing 53-foot-high Hanging Obelisk, the only such structure in the world. The obelisk itself is about 3,500 years old, but it sits suspended overhead on a modern structure with a glass floor, so visitors can peer up and view its ancient inscriptions from an angle never before possible.",
      "Beyond is the Grand Staircase, with 108 steps bringing people up the equivalent of six floors to the main galleries, with colossal statues on view the whole way up.",
      "The GEM has 12 primary exhibition halls, covering about 194,000 square feet.",
      "The number of artifacts on display has nearly doubled initial expectations thanks to Egypt's wealth of antiquities, with officials saying about 100,000 items will be housed in the halls.",
      "To put that in perspective, if a visitor were to spend one minute looking at each artifact on display in the museum, it would take almost 70 sleepless days to view the entire collection.",
      "The museum's triangular architecture radiates outward from its entrance toward the three main pyramids of Giza, aligning perfectly with their positions. Its walls and sloping ceilings follow the same lines, rising toward the pyramids' highest points, but not exceeding the height of the ancient structures, out of respect for their builders.",
      "The museum's interior offers stunning panoramic views of the pyramids. The concept may sound simple, but it required a significant reshaping of the local topography, including the excavation and removal of some 79 million cubic feet of sand, which took workers seven months.",
      "King Ramses II was there first",
      "In the entrance courtyard of the GEM, stands a massive, 3,200-year-old statue of King Ramses II. The statue was moved in 2006 from a busy square in central Cairo to a site near the Great Pyramids, where it stood awaiting the new landmark museum's construction.",
      "The 83-ton statue's journey took 10 hours, processing slowly through the streets of Egypt under heavy security as people watched on TV.",
      "Later Ramses was moved to a new permanent home, about 400 yards away, and the museum was built around it.",
      "King Tut's complete collection",
      "The GEM's main attraction, it could be argued, is the complete collection of the famous King Tutankhamun, the golden boy.",
      "All 5,398 items from the tomb of the 13th pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of ancient Egypt, who ruled from around 1333 to 1323 B.C., will be displayed together in one place for the first time since they were discovered by Howard Carter in 1922.",
      "The new showroom is six times the size of the one that previously housed much of the Tut collection, at the old Egyptian Museum in central Cairo.",
      "King Khufu's Boats",
      "The GEM also boasts the King Khufu's Boats Museum, showing the 4,500-year-old the boats that were designed to be used in the journey to the afterlife.",
      "The two royal boats were discovered in 1954 near the Pyramid of Khufu. It took experts more than 10 years to reassemble the first boat. It is now fully reconstructed and was moved to the museum in 2021. Visitors of the museum can also view the conservation work underway on the second one.",
      "Scholars believe they were either used in Khufu's funeral procession or they were intended for his journey with the sun god Re in the afterlife.",
      "The long road to the Grand Egyptian Museum",
      "The idea for a grand museum on this site in Egypt dates back more than 32 years. The government first allocated 117 acres for the project at the location in 1992.",
      "At the very beginning of 2002, Egypt launched a massive international architectural competition to find a winning design for the museum. A total of 2,227 architects from 103 countries applied to submit designs, and by August of that year, 1,550 from 83 countries had submitted conceptual drawings.",
      "A couple months later officials had whittled the options down to only 20 designs to put forward for a second stage. In July 2003, the prize - and the massive contract - was awarded to the Irish architectural firm Heneghan Peng.",
      "The plan was originally for the museum to open in 2010, but a series of events, including financial crises, political uprisings, the COVID-19 pandemic and regional wars, delayed the curtain raising.",
      "A total of 79 official delegations are expected to participate in the opening ceremony, including 39 delegations headed by kings, princes, and heads of state and government, a spokesman for the presidency said.",
      "Egyptian officials hope the new museum will boost the country's tourism industry, and with it, the still-struggling economy. They have predicted that the GEM will attract some 5 million visitors per year.",

      "The incident occurred at the Swamy Venkateswara Temple in the Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh state where hundreds of devotees had gathered to mark one of Hinduism's sacred days, \"Ekadashi,\" senior police officer K. V. Maheswra Reddy told the Associated Press.",
      "On this day, the devotees fast and offer prayers to Lord Vishnu, a key Hindu deity known as the preserver and protector of the universe, according\u00a0to BBC News.",
      "An initial investigation suggests that an iron grille meant to maintain the queue of worshippers at the temple broke, leading to the uncontrolled crowd surge, Reddy said.",
      "Senior local government official Swapnil Dinkar Pundkar said more casualties were feared. \"Initially, we had reports of seven deaths, but two more people have succumbed to their injuries, while the condition of two others is critical,\" he said.",
      "Of the deceased, eight are women and one is a child, Pundkar said, adding that at least 16 devotees injured in the crowd surge are being treated at a local hospital, while 20 others are in a state of shock and put under observation at a different hospital.",
      "Video footage on local media showed people rushing to help those who fainted in the crowd surge and were gasping for breath. Some were seen rubbing the hands of those who fell on the ground.",
      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Andhra Pradesh's highest-elected official, N. Chandrababu Naidu, expressed grief and offered their condolences to the families of the bereaved.",
      "State authorities in Andhra Pradesh said the location was a private temple on 12 acres of land and wasn't under the control of the government administration. Despite its maximum capacity of 3,000, the crowd swelled to around 25,000 on Saturday, officials said.",
      "\"Arrangements were not made accordingly, nor was information provided to the government by the concerned individual. This is the reason for the accident,\" the state's fact-check unit said in a statement on social media.",
      "Naidu vowed strict action against those responsible for the deadly stampede and ordered an inquiry into the incident, according to local media.",
      "Crowd surges at religious gatherings are not uncommon in India, where massive groups often congregate at temples or pilgrimage sites, sometimes overwhelming local infrastructure and security measures.",

At least 30 people died in January during the Kumbh Mela festival in the northern city of Prayagraj. A month later, at least 18 people were killed at a railway station in New Delhi while on the way to the festival.",

      "She has been charged with complicity in organized theft and criminal conspiracy with a view to committing a crime.",
      "The 38-year-old woman was in tears as she confirmed that she lives in the northern La Courneuve suburb of Paris, an AFP journalist said.",

      "The remains of three people handed over by Hamas to the Red Cross this week did not belong to any of the hostages, an Israeli source told CBS News on Saturday. It is the latest setback that could undermine the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between\u00a0Israel and Hamas.",
      "The unidentified remains of the three people were returned late Friday to Israel, where they were examined overnight. At the time, a military official told the Associated Press that Israeli intelligence suggested they did not belong to any of the hostages taken by Hamas terrorists during the Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack in southern Israel that sparked the war. The Israeli official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office on Saturday confirmed that the remains did not belong to any of the hostages, without giving further details, the Associated Press reported. CBS News has reached out to Netanyahu's office for additional comment.",
      "The Israeli army declined to comment to CBS News on Saturday, saying it did not announce it received the bodies.",
      "\"The reports in question were not issued by us, therefore, we won't confirm their accuracy,\" an IDF spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "Hamas' armed wing said in a subsequent statement on Saturday that it had offered to hand over samples on Friday of unidentified bodies, but that Israel had refused to receive them and asked for the remains for examination.",
      "\"We handed the bodies over to stop the claims of Israel,\" the statement said.",
      "It's unclear who the remains belonged to.",
      "Since the\u00a0U.S.-brokered ceasefire\u00a0between Israel and Hamas took effect on Oct. 10, Palestinian militants have released the remains of 17 hostages that were held in Gaza for the past two years.",
      "But the process of returning the bodies of the last 11 remaining hostages, as called for under the truce deal, is progressing slowly, with militants releasing just one or two bodies every few days.",
      "The total number of Palestinian bodies returned by Israel since the ceasefire began stands at 225. Only 75 of those have been identified by families, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry. It is unclear if those returned were killed in Israel during the Oct. 7, 2023 attack, whether they died in Israeli custody as detainees or were recovered from Gaza by troops during the war.",
      "Under the ceasefire deal, Hamas released\u00a0all living Israeli hostages in return for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and wartime detainees. Israel pulled back its troops to a designated line within Gaza, halted its military offensive and increased aid into the territory.",
      "The fragile truce faced its\u00a0biggest challenge\u00a0earlier this week when Israel carried out strikes across Gaza that killed more than 100 people, following the killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, and the incomplete return of hostages.",

    "story": [
      "None of the French crown jewels stolen in the brazen daytime robbery of the landmark Louvre Museum had been located 10 days after the heist, the Paris prosecutor said Wednesday, and\u00a0two suspects detained so far\u00a0were formally charged with theft and conspiracy to commit a crime.",
      "\"I want to remain hopeful that [the jewels] will be found and they can be brought back to the Louvre, and more broadly to the nation,\" Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau told reporters.",
      "She said the two suspects, who were arrested Saturday, partially admitted to a role in the heist.",
      "The jewels date back hundreds of years and are considered national treasures with an estimated value of some $102 million. Experts have told CBS News the elaborate pieces of jewelry may have already been broken down into their component parts, greatly diminishing their value, and they may never be found.",
      "At least four people in total were seen on security camera video taking part in the robbery on Oct. 19, and Beccuau said at a news conference in the French capital on Wednesday afternoon that her office could not rule out the culprits being part of a larger criminal gang.",
      "Dozens of detectives have been on the trail of the four thieves, who used a cherry picker lift and cutting gear to break into a first-floor gallery at the world-renowned museum and then fled with the jewels.",
      "But few details have emerged so far about how investigators have managed to track down the culprits, some of whom wore balaclavas and high-visibility vests.",
      "The two men charged in connection with the heist will remain in custody and await a trial.",
      "A source close to the case this weekend said the men in their 30s were known to the police for committing thefts, and Beccuau said they were believed to be the ones who actually broke into the museum gallery, based, in part, on DNA evidence.",
      "The two men hailed from Seine-Saint-Denis, a region just outside Paris, and one was arrested as he was about to board a plane for Algeria, the source said, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.",

      "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel joins \u2018America\u2019s Newsroom\u2019 to break down new research showing why longer walks may deliver greater health benefits than shorter ones.",
      "Recent studies have shown that even if you feel healthy and fit, your immune system could be aging quicker than you think, which could increase the risk of infections and immune-related disorders.",
      "\"Immune aging, like all aging, means that our immune systems start to slow down, make more mistakes and be less effective at protecting us from infection as we get older,\" Chris Rhodes, Ph.D., a nutritional biochemist and longevity expert in California, told Fox News Digital.",
      "When the immune system ages, immune cells become less able to perform crucial functions like fighting infection, destroying cancer cells and healing wounds, according to Rhodes, who is also the CEO and co-founder of Mimio Health in San Francisco.",
      "SCIENTISTS UNCOVER HOW SOME 80-YEAR-OLDS HAVE THE MEMORY OF 50-YEAR-OLDS",
      "\"After the age of 35, our immune systems become less and less able to adapt to new antigens, allergens and other inflammatory stimuli \u2014 and our thymus, the organ responsible for producing T-cells, gradually shrinks, meaning our immunity and ability to respond to new infections becomes more compromised with age,\" the doctor added.",
      "Inflammation is a key driver of declining immune function, leading to what many experts call \"inflammaging.\"",

      "Fatigue, joint stiffness, aches and pains, recurrent viral flare-ups and a weaker vaccine response could also indicate a declining immune system.",
      "5 ways to slow down immune aging",

      "\"A wide variety of polyphenols, fibers and omega-3 fats nourishes the gut microbiome, which trains and regulates immune cells,\" she said. \"Because roughly 70% of immune tissue resides in the gut, microbial diversity directly predicts immune resilience.\"",
      "When the immune system ages, immune cells become less able to perform crucial functions like fighting infection, destroying cancer cells and healing wounds. (iStock)",
      "Diet plays an \"enormous role\" in immune functionality and longevity, according to Rhodes, as the effects of certain foods can boost inflammation and lead to immune system stress. Over time, this can promote autoimmune disorders, contribute to disease progression and decrease longevity.",
      "\"The best way to keep your immune system youthful and happy is to focus on a diet rich in antioxidants, polyphenols and plant bioactives that have anti-inflammatory effects, as well as whole foods that avoid the glucose and lipid spikes that promote inflammation,\" he advised.",
      "Diet plays an \"enormous role\" in immune functionality and longevity.",
      "Rhodes also recommends considering intermittent fasting to minimize the time the body spends in the \"post-prandial (post-eating) state\" and to benefit from \"powerful anti-inflammatory effects.\"",
      "Lack of sleep and chronic stress can cause immune cells to be more worn out, less effective at their jobs and more prone to making mistakes, according to Rhodes.",
      "\"Increases in cortisol caused by lack of sleep or high stress levels will promote immune system activation, which can be beneficial in the short term to avoid infection, but will lead to accelerated immune cell aging and less effective functionality over time,\" he warned.",

      "\"Ultimately, chronic activation of the immune system due to lack of sleep and high stress will burn out your immune cells faster and accelerate their aging.\"",

      "She recommends getting seven to eight hours of quality sleep nightly and cultivating a stable circadian rhythm.",
      "Finding \"intentional\" ways to manage stress \u2014 such as journaling, meditating and spending time outdoors \u2014 can also help boost immunity.",
      "Exercise is known to strengthen immunity by lowering stress hormones, reducing chronic inflammation and helping immune cells move through the body.",
      "Rhodes cautioned, however, that while exercise is essential to promoting long-term health and longevity, it can also be \"pro-inflammatory,\" as the damage done to the muscle during exercise also activates the immune system and causes inflammation.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"High-impact and intense-burst exercise like sprinting, HIIT training or heavy weight lifting will be the most inflammatory, as these typically cause the highest level of acute muscle and joint stress and promote cellular growth pathways associated with aging,\" he said.",

      "\"Core nutrients like vitamin D, magnesium, zinc and omega-3s remain foundational,\" she said. \"Beyond that, NAD\u207a boosters, senolytic compounds and select peptides \u2014 such as thymosin alpha-1 for immune modulation and BPC-157 for tissue repair \u2014 are promising adjuncts for supporting repair and lowering chronic inflammation.\"",
      "\"Most people begin to experience measurable immune decline by their late 30s to early 40s, but lifestyle and metabolic health can delay it significantly.\"",
      "The doctor noted, however, that these supplements should complement, not replace, healthy lifestyle behaviors.",

      "\"While the immune system needs essential vitamins, minerals, proteins and fatty acids to function properly, taking high doses of these micronutrients will typically not add any additional benefit beyond avoiding deficiencies,\" he said.",
      "Some of the best supplements to take are those with anti-inflammatory effects, Rhodes said.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES",
      "\"These can be compounds like EGCG from green tea, omega-3 fatty acids, anthocyanins from berries, and biomimetics like palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA) that recreate the body\u2019s natural anti-inflammatory signaling.\"",
      "People should speak with a doctor before starting a new vitamin or supplement regimen.",

      "Exposing children to peanuts when they are 4 to 11 months old \u2014 instead of waiting until they are 3, as previously recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics \u2014 appears to be making a dent in the number of peanut allergy diagnoses, the study published in Pediatrics suggests.",

      "Hill, one of the study authors, noted that new-onset food allergies overall dropped by 36% in that age group.",
      "Peanuts are one of the primary causes of serious allergic reactions in children.

      "Evolving advice",
      "Before 2015, it was standard practice to caution parents about peanut exposure for children under 3 years of age. Then in 2015, a landmark study \u2014 the Learning Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) trial \u2014 sparked a change in clinical practice.",
      "The study found that for infants who had severe eczema or an egg allergy, exposing them to peanuts when they were between 4 and 11 months old could reduce peanut allergy risk by 81%.",
      "Exposing children to peanuts when they are 4 to 11 months old \u2014 instead of waiting until they are 3, as previously recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics \u2014 appears to be reducing the number of peanut allergy diagnoses. (iStock)",
      "Based on the LEAP trial, leading organizations in pediatric allergy and immunology revised their guidelines for clinical practice in 2015 and 2017, allowing early exposure to peanuts for high-risk children.",
      "\"It just seems like there's this window of tolerance during early infancy.\"",
      "The guidelines were updated again in 2021, encouraging the introduction of peanut, egg and other major food allergens as early as 4 to 6 months for all children \u2014 including those without a history of prior reaction, according to health experts.",
      "\"It just seems like there's this window of tolerance during early infancy, so if we introduced the foods during that window, you will prevent food allergy,\" Dr. Susan Schuval, chief of the Division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology at Stony Brook Children's Hospital in New York, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Food allergies can cause hives, difficulty breathing, swelling and vomiting, which can be immediate and life-threatening. (iStock)",

      "These effects can sometimes linger even after the person has recovered from the infection.

      "Dr. Halland Chen, a double board-certified physician in New York who specializes in longevity, reiterated that studies in both animals and early human models show that maintaining healthy NAD+ levels can improve energy metabolism, cognitive function and overall vitality.",
      "\"Restoring NAD+ is ultimately about cellular repair and mitochondrial optimization, not just an energy boost,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Clinical experience shows that NAD+ therapy enhances energy, focus and endurance, while supporting detoxification and reducing oxidative stress from daily life, travel or poor sleep.\"",

      "Methods of boosting NAD+",
      "In clinical studies, patients with age-related diseases have taken compounds designed to boost NAD+.",
      "While NAD+ itself is a large molecule that can\u2019t cross into cells, NAD+ \"precursors\" can enter cells and then work to create NAD+, experts confirm.",
      "These precursors include nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). Most people take these NAD+ precursors in the form of pills, capsules or powders.",
      "\"Clinical experience shows that NAD+ therapy enhances energy, focus and endurance while supporting detoxification.\"",
      "\"Oral NAD precursors can modestly raise NAD+ levels and are convenient for daily maintenance,\" Kahn said. \"In contrast, injections or IV infusions bypass the gut and deliver NAD+ directly into circulation, leading to more rapid and noticeable effects on energy, focus and recovery.\"",

      "COMMON VITAMIN SHOWN TO SLASH SKIN CANCER RISK IN SOME GROUPS, STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "\"In general, I find that combining daily oral precursors with weekly NAD+ injections offers the most comprehensive support for both intracellular and extracellular NAD stores,\" she advised.",

      "\"Sessions typically last two to four hours and are administered as a series of three infusions within seven to 10 days, followed by monthly maintenance.\"",
      "A doctor noted that oral supplements are best for maintenance, while IV therapy is often chosen for a \"rapid cellular reboot, post-travel recovery or enhanced performance.\" (iStock)",
      "NAD+ therapy tends to have the most benefit for those managing fatigue, metabolic dysfunction or neurological decline, as well as anyone seeking to enhance energy, focus and recovery, Chen said.",
      "\"In healthy adults, benefits are typically modest, but can be amplified when combined with optimized nutrition, exercise and sleep,\" he added.",

      "When choosing a NAD+ product, quality matters more than quantity, according to multiple experts.",
      "\"Patients should look for clinically validated, third-party-tested formulations and start with lower doses to gauge tolerance,\" Chen said.",

      "A new video advertisement from pro-Israel group Canary Mission is calling out the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) for scheming to take over the Democratic Party from within.\u00a0(CREDIT: Canary Mission)",
      "After an antisemitism watchdog posted a new video warning about socialist efforts to take over the Democratic Party from within, socialist leaders from across the country embraced the video and its message, appearing unafraid of such accusations.",
      "The Canary Mission's advertisement included recorded remarks from various leaders of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) describing their opposition to, and in some cases \"hatred\" of the Democratic Party, which one speaker says must be torn down. The video also shared remarks from DSA leaders describing how the Democratic Party, which one of the socialist speakers in the video referred to as \"toxic,\" can be used as a \"tool\" to push forward their aims of destroying the current capitalist society we live in.",
      "At the center of the ad was something Canary Mission referred to as the \"cuckoo analogy.\"",

      "\"In nature, the cuckoo survives by trickery. It lays its egg in another bird's nest. The unsuspecting parents raise the impostor as their own until the cuckoo grows strong enough to push the true chicks out,\" the video's narrator explains. \"The DSA is the cuckoo inside the Democratic Party.\"",
      "But the analogy, which pointed to candidates like self-proclaimed socialist Zohran Mamdani, did not appear to bother the socialists it was targeting. Rather, they applauded the video advertisement as a great recruitment tool to get more people to join their ranks.",
      "\"New DSA recruitment ad for communists just dropped,\" joked Nicol\u00e1s Vargas in response to the video. Vargas has been affiliated with the Central Brooklyn branch of the DSA, according to a 2022 DSA national convention resolution on COVID protections.",
      "\"Are you trying to make young people find the DSA more cool?\" quipped Marxist-socialist blogger C. Derrick Varn.",
      "\"New recruitment ad unlocked,\" joked Giovanetta Marangoz, co-chair of the New York City Young Democratic Socialists of America.",
      "Other socialist activists were a little more direct in their view that the Democratic Party must be extinguished.",
      "\"My biggest gripe is the idea that we\u2019re being deceptive,\" Allan Frasheri, an at-large delegate to the 2023 DSA Convention who spent time as a co-chair of the University of Florida's DSA chapter, said in response to the video. \"DSA is loud and proud: we are fighting for a worker\u2019s party. Only a party of, by and for working people can bring about a better world. The Democratic Party is ultimately one for the billionaires.\"",
      "MAMDANI FORCED TO ADDRESS UNEARTHED VIDEO EXPOSING VILE NYPD COMPARISON",
      "\"This is the best DSA ad I\u2019ve ever seen,\" added DSA organizer Miko Ludoviko. \"The DSA is an anti-capitalist organization with the long-term goal of taking state power. The Democratic Party is a tool we use for local elections, but it remains an enemy of the working class.\"",
      "Part of Canary Mission's video focused on New York City's Mamdani, who is running for New York City mayor on the Democratic Party's ticket. He beat out former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic Party primary earlier this year to be the party's candidate. Cuomo is now running as an Independent.",
      "Mamdani, who is a member of DSA's NYC chapter, brought several DSA members on stage during a \"New York Is Not For Sale\" rally last week. He was also a keynote speaker at the group's national convention in 2023 while serving as a New York state representative.",

      "DSA has admitted to closely collaborating with Mamdani's campaign, including regularly holding meetings with his team.",
      "\"With Zohran, we're in basically the best possible position to seize state power that we can be in because, you know, we're like this,\" Goulden said during an August DSA panel, indicating with his fingers that the campaign and organization are very close. Goulden went on to suggest that \"one of the things that made Zohran really successful with his policy rollouts is specifically relying on DSA.\"",
      "\"We wrote the platform with him. The team was so happy to work with us on this,\" he explained. \"What we explicitly wanted to do was use the power of New York City to provide free gender-affirming care \u2013 and I say free in case insurance companies decide to boot us off \u2013 free gender-affirming care, not just to people in New York City, but across the country.\"",

      "In addition to the responses to Canary Mission's new video, other messaging materials the pro-Israel group has put out, such as a graphic slamming socialists for attempting to \"weaken and ultimately dismantle\" the United States, have similarly been met with praise by DSA socialists.",
      "For example, in response to a Canary Mission graphic exposing DSA\u2019s Red Star Caucus for their stated goal of striving to \"weaken and ultimately dismantle US empire,\" a user on X, who describes themselves as \"DSA's favorite Maoist,\" remarked that the slogan Canary Mission was calling out \"needs to be the line of the DSA as a whole.\"",
      "\"I will use every tool at my disposal to make it so,\" they added.",
      "\"That's right,\" another X user with the handle \"centristmarxist\" said in response to a second graphic slamming DSA\u2019s Marxist Unity Group for their stated goal. \"With every tool available to us, we must erode the political, cultural, and physical hegemony of the U.S. police state.\"",

      "The Rev. Al Sharpton on Saturday slammed what he called \"ugly Islamophobia\" sweeping New York City\u2019s mayoral race, accusing some of labeling every Muslim a terrorist to attack Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani.",
      "Sharpton, an MSNBC host and progressive activist, was speaking at an event he was hosting for Mamdani in Harlem, and the mayoral candidate was throwing jabs too, accusing President Donald Trump of smearing and gutting welfare programs. The democratic socialist drew parallels to the Reconstruction-era agency created to help newly freed slaves to hammer home his point.",
      "The pair were joined by Pastor Miles Travis Boyd, whose mother died on 9/11, as well as other faith leaders.",
      "\"I am outraged at the ugly Islamophobia that has been used in this campaign to act as though every Muslim is a terrorist and to act like something ugly, as what happened to us on 9/11 is an insult to the intelligence of all New Yorkers,\" Sharpton told a lively crowd at the House of Justice, his National Action Network headquarters.",

      "Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo faced criticism from Mamdani after Cuomo\u2019s exchange with radio host Sid Rosenberg, who claimed Mamdani would be \"cheering\" if another 9/11 happened. Cuomo had argued during the segment that Mamdani was unprepared to lead the city in a time of crisis.",
      "After Sharpton\u2019s remarks on Saturday, Cuomo denied accusations of Islamophobia and said comments from Republican Councilwoman Inna Vernikov \u2014 who has endorsed him and has been accused of making inflammatory statements \u2014 were hers alone. Cuomo, in turn, accused Mamdani of fueling division and antisemitism for allegedly refusing to denounce calls for an \"intifada\" and for making past statements he described as offensive toward Jews.",
      "Sharpton also argued Saturday that just showing up at someone\u2019s campaign or shaking their hand doesn\u2019t mean you share blame for whatever they\u2019ve been accused of. Sharpton was likely referencing a meeting Mamdani had last week with Siraj Wahhaj, a Brooklyn imam who is an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and who has been linked to other terrorist activity in the United States.",
      "Sharpton said he denounced both the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks in Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza.",
      "\"I\u2019m against Islamophobia. But to bring it into the politics of the biggest city in the world should not be allowed to go unchecked,\" Sharpton said. \"We are not going to sit by silently while they do this. We are Christian. I\u2019m a born-again Baptist, but I embrace the Muslim community to come from the shadows. The Jewish community to come from the shadows. And let\u2019s walk down Broadway together.\"",

Recently, when critics questioned Mamdani\u2019s ties to hardline Brooklyn Imam Siraj Wahhaj, she\u00a0sprang to action, helping to organize a protest to defend Wahhaj.",

    "summary": "Former Miss Venezuela Carmen Maria Montiel, now a Republican congressional candidate, blames socialism for her country&apos;s decline from oil-rich prosperity to poverty.",
    "story": [
      "Carmen Montiel describes how her once-prosperous homeland descended into crime and repression \u2014 and why she believes most Venezuelans would back U.S. action to end Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s rule.",
      "Americans unfamiliar with Venezuela may not know that in the not-so-distant past the nation was rich with oil and opportunity.",
      "Congressional candidate Carmen Maria Montiel remembers a Venezuela that brimmed with optimism \u2014 before decades of political and economic turmoil turned it into one of the hemisphere\u2019s poorest nations.",
      "\"Socialism and open borders,\" Montiel told Fox News Digital in an interview, are what sent her country into decline.",
      "The Houston-area Republican won the Miss Venezuela title at age 19 in 1984 and later finished as a runner-up for Miss Universe. But long before her pageant fame, she says, Venezuela\u2019s political foundations were already beginning to crack.",

      "Venezuela-born Carmen Maria Montiel is running for Congress as a Republican in Texas.\u00a0 (Fox News digital)",
      "While the nation remained a democracy for decades, two socialist parties dominated power.",
      "\"We got the influx of illegal immigrants, crime went up, drugs started to be a problem,\" she said. \"The first thing they destroyed was the healthcare system. Venezuela used to have one of the most wonderful healthcare systems \u2014 it was paid for, it was our social security. Because the country was so rich, it provided so many services to the Venezuelan people. And of course, no country has the infrastructure for a vertical growth of the population.\"",
      "Montiel came to the U.S. for college in 1988, hoping the unrest at home would ease. Instead, she watched from abroad as Hugo Ch\u00e1vez led two coup attempts in 1992, and the country erupted in riots and looting.",

      "\"I decided I\u2019m gonna stay a little longer, see if things get better,\" she said. \"But they never did.\"",
      "From Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s failed coup to Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s current hold on power, Montiel sees a straight line \u2014 one she says runs through corruption, cartel influence and foreign alliances with Russia and Iran.",
      "\"Communism always runs out of money,\" Montiel said. \"Even in a rich country like Venezuela, oil production collapsed, and what was left for them was crime. That\u2019s why they joined the cartels \u2014 it\u2019s a criminal communist regime.\"",

      "U.S. officials have long accused members of Maduro\u2019s inner circle of involvement in narcotics trafficking, particularly through the Cartel de los Soles \u2014 a network of Venezuelan military officers implicated in smuggling cocaine to North America and Europe. Washington has also sanctioned dozens of Venezuelan officials for corruption and ties to terrorist groups, though Caracas denies the charges.",
      "Montiel supports the recent U.S. military strikes targeting alleged drug-trafficking networks off Venezuela\u2019s coast and believes they are justified given the threat she says the regime poses to the United States.",
      "\"Venezuela presents a very high risk to the United States,\" she said. \"It\u2019s the drug trafficking, the Tren de Aragua trafficking \u2026 the problems that many Venezuelan people escaped, now we\u2019re facing in the United States.\"",

      "The Department of War has conducted 14 lethal strikes on vessels allegedly smuggling narcotics toward U.S. shores over the past two months.",
      "In Montiel\u2019s view, dismantling cartel networks and exposing the Venezuelan military\u2019s complicity are essential steps toward toppling the regime. \"This is a criminal communist regime and we should never remove the word \u2018communist,\u2019\" she said.",
      "At the same time, the U.S. has intensified pressure on Maduro, whom it does not recognize as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate leader. The Justice Department is offering a $50 million reward for information leading to Maduro\u2019s arrest.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss hackers using airport USB charging ports and phishing texts to target victims.",
      "A security researcher found a serious weakness in the software that powers thousands of e-commerce sites. The platform, called Magento, and its paid version Adobe Commerce, has a bug that lets attackers break into active shopping sessions. Some attackers can even take control of the entire store.",
      "The flaw is known as SessionReaper. It allows hackers to pretend they are real customers without needing a password. Once they are inside, they can steal data, make fake orders, or install tools that collect credit card details.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "Why is this attack so serious?",
      "The problem starts in the part of the system that handles how a store communicates with other online services. Because the software does not properly check the information it receives, it sometimes trusts data that it should not. Hackers take advantage of this by sending fake session files that the store accepts as real.",
      "Researchers at SecPod warn that successful attacks can lead to stolen customer data, fake purchases and even full control of the store's server.",
      "Once the attack method was shared publicly, cybercriminals began using it right away. Security experts at Sansec reported that more than 250 online stores were compromised within a single day. This shows how quickly attacks can spread once a vulnerability becomes public.",
      "Hackers are exploiting a new flaw called SessionReaper to hijack active shopping sessions on thousands of e-commerce sites running Adobe Commerce and Magento. (Kurt Knutsson)",
      "Why are many stores still unprotected?",
      "Adobe released a security update on Sept. 9 to fix the issue. Weeks later, about 62% of affected stores still have not installed it. Some store owners are afraid an update might break features on their site. Others simply do not know how serious the risk is.",
      "Every unpatched store remains an open door for attackers who want to steal information or install malicious code.",
      "MAJOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING GOOGLE AND DIOR, HIT BY MASSIVE SALESFORCE DATA BREACH",
      "How can you stay safe when shopping online?",
      "While store owners are responsible for fixing the problem, you can still take smart steps to protect yourself when shopping online. These actions can help you spot danger early and keep your personal information safe.",
      "Always pay attention to how a website behaves. If a page looks odd, loads slowly or shows error messages, it could mean something is wrong behind the scenes. Check for the small padlock symbol in the address bar that shows the site uses HTTPS encryption. If it is missing or the site redirects you to an unfamiliar page, stop and close the browser tab immediately. Trust your instincts if something feels off.",
      "Cybercriminals often use fake promotional emails or ads that look like real store offers. Instead of clicking links in messages or banners, type the store's web address directly into your browser to avoid phishing pages designed to steal your login details or card information. Since attacks like SessionReaper can expose your personal data to criminal marketplaces, consider using a reputable data removal service that continuously scans and deletes your private information, such as your address, phone number and email, from data broker sites. This reduces your risk of identity theft if your information has been leaked through a compromised online store.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Strong antivirus protection is your silent guard online. Choose reputable software that offers real-time protection, safe browsing alerts and automatic updates. A strong antivirus program can detect malicious code that tries to run on your device, block unsafe sites and alert you to potential threats. This adds another crucial layer of defense when visiting online stores that may not be fully secure.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Whenever possible, choose payment services that add an extra layer of protection between your bank account and the online store. Platforms like PayPal, Apple Pay or Google Pay do not share your card number with the retailer. This reduces the chance of your information being stolen if the store is compromised. These payment gateways also offer dispute protection if a purchase turns out to be fraudulent.",
      "Stick to stores with a solid reputation. Well-known brands usually have better security and faster response times when issues arise. Before buying from a new website, check its reviews on trusted consumer sites. Look for signs of credibility such as clear contact information, a professional design and verified payment options. A few minutes of research can save you from weeks of frustration.",
      "TRANSUNION BECOMES LATEST VICTIM IN MAJOR WAVE OF SALESFORCE-LINKED CYBERATTACKS, 4.4M AMERICANS AFFECTED",
      "Updates may seem annoying, but they are one of the most effective ways to protect your data. Make sure your computer, smartphone and web browser all have the latest security patches installed. Updates often fix the exact kinds of flaws hackers use to spread attacks like SessionReaper. Enable automatic updates if you can, so your devices stay protected without extra effort.",
      "If you create accounts on shopping sites, make sure each one has its own strong password. Avoid using the same password across multiple platforms. Consider using a password manager to generate and store long, random passwords. That way, if one account is compromised, your other logins stay safe.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "If a site or payment service offers\u00a0two-factor authentication, enable it. This adds a second security step, such as a code sent to your phone or generated by an app. Even if hackers steal your password, they will not be able to access your account without that second verification.",
      "Even weeks after Adobe issued a critical patch for the SessionReaper vulnerability, nearly two-thirds of affected online stores remain unprotected, leaving customer data and payment information at high risk of theft. (CyberGuy.com)",
      "FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 1.1M AMERICANS",
      "Public Wi-Fi networks\u00a0in places like caf\u00e9s, airports and hotels are often unsecured. Avoid entering payment information or logging in to accounts while connected to public networks. If you must make a purchase while away from home, use a mobile data connection or a reliable VPN to encrypt your activity.",
      "Check your financial statements regularly for any unusual activity. Small, unauthorized charges can be early signs of fraud. Report any suspicious transactions to your bank or credit card company right away so they can freeze your account or issue a new card.",
      "If you notice anything strange during or after an online purchase, act quickly. Contact the store's customer service to report what you saw. You should also inform your payment provider or credit card company so they can block unauthorized transactions. Reporting early can help stop further damage and alert other shoppers to potential risks.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The SessionReaper attack shows how fast online threats can appear and how long they can linger when updates are ignored. Even well-known stores can become unsafe overnight. For retailers, installing patches quickly is critical. For shoppers, staying alert and choosing secure payment methods are the best ways to stay protected.",

      "The dark web often feels like a mystery, hidden beneath the surface of the internet that most people use every day. But to understand how scams and cybercrimes actually work, you need to know what happens in those hidden corners where criminals trade data, services and stolen access.",
      "Cybercriminals rely on a structured underground economy, complete with marketplaces, rules and even dispute systems to operate safely away from law enforcement. By learning how these systems function, you can better understand the threats that could reach you and avoid becoming the next target.",

      "5 SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY TIPS TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE",
      "Learn how to protect your personal information from dark web threats with simple cybersecurity habits and tools. (Phil Barker/Future Publishing via Getty Images)",
      "Inside the hidden layers of the internet",
      "The internet is often divided into three layers: the clear web, the deep web and the dark web. The clear web is the open part of the internet that search engines like Google or Bing can index, including news sites, blogs, stores and public pages. Beneath it lies the deep web, which includes pages not meant for public indexing, such as corporate intranets, private databases and webmail portals. Most of the content in the deep web is legal but simply restricted to specific users.",
      "The dark web, however, is where anonymity and illegality intersect. It requires special software such as Tor to access, and much of its activity happens behind encryption and invitation-only walls. Tor, short for The Onion Router, was originally developed by the U.S. Navy for secure communication but has since become a haven for both privacy advocates and criminals.",
      "It anonymizes users by routing traffic through multiple encrypted layers, making it almost impossible to trace where a request truly came from. This anonymity allows criminals to communicate, sell data and conduct illegal trade with reduced risk of exposure.",
      "Over time, the dark web has become a hub for criminal commerce. Marketplaces once operated like eBay for illegal goods, offering everything from drugs and stolen credit card data to hacking tools and fake identities. Many of these platforms have been shut down, but the trade continues on smaller, more private channels, including encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram. Vendors use aliases, ratings and escrow systems to build credibility.",
      "Ironically, even among criminals, trust is a critical part of business. Forums often have administrators, verified sellers and mediators to settle disputes. Members who cheat others or fail to deliver are quickly blacklisted, and reputation becomes the main currency that determines who can be trusted.",
      "The criminal economy and how scams are born",
      "Every major cyberattack or data leak often traces back to the dark web's underground economy. A single attack typically involves several layers of specialists. It begins with information stealers, malware designed to capture credentials, cookies and device fingerprints from infected machines. The stolen data is then bundled and sold in dark web markets by data suppliers. Each bundle, known as a log, might contain login credentials, browser sessions and even authentication tokens, often selling for less than $20.",
      "Another group of criminals, known as initial access brokers, purchases these logs to gain entry into corporate systems. With that access, they can impersonate legitimate users and bypass security measures such as multi-factor authentication by mimicking the victim's usual device or browser. Once inside, these brokers sometimes auction their access to larger criminal gangs or ransomware operators who are capable of exploiting it further.",
      "Some of these auctions are run as competitions, while others are flash sales where well-funded groups can buy access immediately without bidding. Eventually, this chain of transactions ends with a ransomware attack or an extortion demand, as attackers encrypt sensitive data or threaten to leak it publicly.",
      "Interestingly, even within these illegal spaces, scams are common. New vendors often post fake listings for stolen data or hacking tools, collect payments and disappear. Others impersonate trusted members or set up counterfeit escrow services to lure buyers.",
      "Despite all the encryption and reputation systems, no one is truly safe from fraud, not even the criminals themselves. This constant cycle of deception forces dark web communities to build internal rules, verification processes and penalties to keep their operations somewhat functional.",
      "What you can do to stay ahead of dark web-driven threats",
      "For ordinary people and businesses, understanding how these networks operate is key to preventing their effects. Many scams that appear in your inbox or on social media originate from credentials or data first stolen and sold on the dark web. That is why basic digital hygiene goes a long way. Below are some steps you can take to stay protected.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "One of the easiest ways to stay safe online is to use unique, complex passwords for every account you own. Many breaches happen because people reuse the same password across multiple services. When one site is hacked, cybercriminals take those leaked credentials and try them elsewhere, a technique known as credential stuffing. A password manager eliminates this problem by generating strong, random passwords and securely storing them for you.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Antivirus software remains one of the most effective ways to detect and block malicious programs before they can steal your information. Modern antivirus solutions do far more than just scan for viruses. They monitor system behavior, detect phishing attempts and prevent infostealer malware from sending your credentials or personal data to attackers.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Outdated software is one of the biggest entry points for attackers. Cybercriminals often exploit known vulnerabilities in operating systems, browsers and plugins to deliver malware or gain access to systems. Installing updates as soon as they are available is one of the simplest yet most effective forms of defense. Enable automatic updates for your operating system, browsers and critical applications.",
      "Even if your password gets leaked or stolen,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an additional barrier for attackers. With 2FA, logging in requires both your password and a secondary verification method. This includes code from an authentication app or a hardware security key.",
      "Identity theft protection can provide early warnings if your personal information appears in data breaches or on dark web marketplaces. These services monitor your sensitive data, such as Social Security numbers, bank details or email addresses. If anything suspicious is detected, they alert you. Many providers also offer recovery assistance, helping you restore stolen identities or close fraudulent accounts. While no service can prevent identity theft entirely, these tools can shorten your response time and limit potential damage if your data is compromised.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The dark web thrives on the idea that anonymity equals safety. But while criminals may feel protected, law enforcement and security researchers continue to monitor and infiltrate these spaces. Over the years, many large marketplaces have been dismantled, and hundreds of operators have been caught despite their layers of encryption. The takeaway for everyone else is that the more you understand how these underground systems function, the better prepared you are to recognize warning signs and protect yourself.",

      "Starcloud aims to build the first orbital data centers, cutting emissions and speeding up global computing. (Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images)",
      "Why space data centers matter for the future",
      "Every time you send a message, store a file in the cloud or use AI, large computers on Earth handle the work. These data centers use massive amounts of electricity and water to stay cool. They also release heat, noise and greenhouse gases that affect local communities.",
      "Space offers a different environment. Solar energy is abundant, and cooling happens naturally in the cold vacuum.\u00a0\"The only environmental cost is the launch,\" said Starcloud CEO Philip Johnston.\u00a0\"After that, we could save ten times the carbon emissions compared with running data centers on Earth.\"",
      "For a world searching for greener technology, that goal matters.",
      "How the NVIDIA GPU will work in orbit",
      "The Starcloud-1 satellite, about the size of a small refrigerator, will carry NVIDIA's H100 GPU. It is nearly one hundred times more powerful than any chip ever sent into orbit.",
      "Once in space, the GPU will process huge amounts of satellite data. It will study images of Earth to identify wildfires, track crops and monitor weather. Normally, satellites send this data back to Earth for processing, which can cause long delays. Doing the analysis in orbit allows faster results and better decisions on the ground.",

      "By processing satellite data in orbit, Starcloud hopes to make Earth monitoring faster and more efficient. (Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images)",
      "Starcloud plans to build space data centers",
      "Starcloud hopes this is only the beginning. The company plans to build larger data centers in space powered by sunlight and cooled by the natural chill of orbit. Future systems will include the next generation of NVIDIA GPUs called Blackwell, which promise even higher performance.",
      "Starcloud's long-term goal is to create a five-gigawatt orbital data center about 2.5 miles wide (around 13,000 feet across). It could handle massive AI workloads while cutting costs and carbon emissions. As launch prices continue to fall, building data centers beyond Earth could soon become practical.",
      "Johnston believes that by the 2030s, many new data centers will operate in orbit instead of on land.",
      "What this space mission means for you",
      "If this works, the technology that powers your apps, games and AI tools might soon be running in space. This change could make cloud services faster, more efficient and less harmful to the planet.",
      "Space-based data centers could also speed up disaster response, improve weather forecasts and save millions of gallons of water every year. The idea shows that innovation and sustainability can grow together.",

Student Taki Allen was waiting for his ride at Kenwood High School in Essex, Maryland, last Monday when he placed an empty bag of chips in his pocket, according to\u00a0WMAR-2 News. Moments later, police officers suddenly surrounded him, ordering him to the ground and handcuffing him, the local station reported.",

      "Microsoft's blog recently gave a firm warning: unsupported systems aren't just outdated, they're unprotected. That message targets anyone still using Windows 10, and it's serious. In Microsoft's Digital Defense Report, over 90% of ransomware attacks hit unsupported PCs. That statistic alone should make every Windows 10 user think twice.",
      "When an operating system stops receiving updates, it becomes an open door for hackers. Security patches dry up, and vulnerabilities grow. So while your computer might seem fine today, it could already be compromised without your knowledge.",

      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Why are unsupported systems dangerous",
      "Unsupported Windows 10 systems no longer get the updates that keep you safe. Without those patches, ransomware and malware have easy access to your files. Once inside, attackers can encrypt your personal data or steal credentials and banking details.",
      "It's not just about losing files. Identity theft and financial fraud often start with outdated systems. The older the software, the easier it is for cybercriminals to exploit weaknesses that will never be fixed.",
      "The \"just one more year\" trap",
      "Many people tell themselves they'll upgrade later. Microsoft calls this \"just one more year\" thinking. The problem is that every delay increases your risk. Extended security updates only offer limited coverage, and they don't stop new types of attacks.",
      "Without Microsoft's regular monitoring, new vulnerabilities stay hidden. You could be using your computer for months while attackers quietly collect your data. That's a frightening thought, especially when most of it can be prevented by upgrading.",
      "Upgrading to Windows 11 keeps your system protected with ongoing security updates. (Microsoft)",
      "MICROSOFT SOUNDS ALARM AS HACKERS TURN TEAMS PLATFORM INTO 'REAL-WORLD DANGERS' FOR USERS",
      "The hidden costs of waiting to upgrade to Windows 11",
      "It's easy to think upgrading costs too much. But what about the cost of losing your photos, business files or financial information? Data recovery, fraud resolution and downtime can cost far more than a new device.",
      "Hackers know users delay updates, and they actively look for outdated systems. Even one unsupported device in a home or office network can create a weak spot that exposes everything else.",
      "How to stay safe from unsupported Windows 10 security risks",
      "You can protect yourself right now with a few smart steps. These actions reduce your exposure, tighten your online defenses and prepare you for a smooth upgrade to Windows 11. The good news is that most of these changes only take a few minutes but make a major difference in your security.",
      "HACKERS FOUND A WAY TO TURN OFF WINDOWS DEFENDER REMOTELY",
      "Start by checking whether your PC can handle Windows 11. Most modern AMD and Intel processors already meet the system requirements. Upgrading keeps your computer protected with ongoing updates that patch vulnerabilities and improve overall performance. It's one of the simplest ways to defend against ransomware and malware before they strike.",
      "Be cautious with every link and attachment you receive. Cybercriminals love sending fake update notifications that look like official Microsoft messages. These phishing scams often contain malicious links that install malware in seconds. Before you click, hover over links to verify their source and only download updates directly from Microsoft's official site. To add an extra layer of protection, install strong antivirus software that can detect and block malicious files before they infect your system.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

These services help remove your name, address, phone number and other personal details that scammers often use for phishing or social-engineering attacks. By limiting what's publicly available about you, you make it much harder for cybercriminals to target you, especially if your older, unsupported Windows 10 system is ever exposed online.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Unlike performance tech built for pros, Project Amplify is designed for everyday movers such as runners, walkers and commuters. It helps anyone who wants to go a little faster and a little farther with less effort. Think of it like the running world's version of an e-bike.

A personal data removal service automates the task by contacting over 420 data brokers on your behalf. It also reissues removal requests if your data reappears and shows you a dashboard of confirmed removals.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

    "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/how-tiny-retinal-implant-helping-people-regain-sight",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Oct 2025 13:00:21 -0400",
    "summary": "Revolutionary retinal implant restores central vision in 80% of patients with advanced macular degeneration, offering hope where treatments once only slowed blindness.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A new study in\u00a0The New England Journal of Medicine revealed that the PRIMA brain computer interface (BCI) retinal implant helped people with advanced age-related macular degeneration regain some central vision. The device uses a tiny 2 millimeter by 2 millimeter photovoltaic implant that is only 30 micrometers thick, and thinner than a strand of hair. It sits beneath the retina and works with a special pair of smart glasses. The glasses capture images and send them as near-infrared light to the implant. The implant converts that light into small electrical signals that stimulate the optic nerve. This process mimics how healthy retinal cells normally send visual information to the brain.",
      "The study followed 38 participants, 32 of whom completed one year of follow-up. Twenty-six patients experienced measurable improvement in vision, which equals about 80% of the group. Many participants could read letters, numbers and even full pages of text again. Although the restored vision is black and white and slightly blurry, the results are remarkable for people who once believed they would never see clearly again.",

      "Why this matters for AMD treatment",
      "Age-related macular degeneration, often called AMD, is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness in older adults. Until now, available treatments could only slow down vision loss. None of them could restore what had already been lost.",
      "The PRIMA implant works with smart glasses to bring central vision back to life. (PRIMA by Science)",
      "The PRIMA implant takes a different approach. It directly replaces the missing function of the retina by turning light into electrical signals. Patients can still use their natural peripheral vision while the implant restores some central vision. This combination creates a more complete visual experience.",
      "The trial showed that the surgery is generally safe. Most side effects occurred within the first two months and resolved soon after. Importantly, the implant did not reduce the patients' remaining natural peripheral vision. Researchers call this a major step toward restoring sight rather than only slowing its decline.",
      "The PRIMA implant was developed by Science Corporation, a brain-computer interface company founded by Max Hodak, who previously cofounded Neuralink. Science Corporation acquired the PRIMA technology from the French firm Pixium Vision, continuing its development toward clinical use.",
      "EYE DROPS MAY REPLACE READING GLASSES FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH AGE-RELATED VISION LOSS",
      "The tiny chip sits under the retina and turns light into visual signals. (PRIMA by Science)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you or someone you love lives with late-stage AMD, this breakthrough may offer real hope. For the first time, there is a device that can restore some sight instead of only preserving what remains. You may want to talk with your ophthalmologist about upcoming trials or future approval of the PRIMA system in your area.

Now, researchers are proving that restoration is possible. While this generation of the implant provides limited black and white vision, it gives real, functional sight to people who had none. That alone changes lives. More work remains to improve image clarity, color perception and comfort. Still, this is only the beginning. Future versions of the device and smart glasses may make vision restoration even more effective and accessible.",

      "With one trick, you won't have to worry about forgetting passwords on your iPhone again.",
      "Keeping your computer secure is more important than ever. Cyberattacks target computers, accounts and sensitive data daily. Traditional passwords have long been the cornerstone of security, but they come with real challenges. Many of us reuse passwords across sites, and even strong passwords can be compromised in data breaches.",
      "Passkeys offer a safer and more convenient way to authenticate. However, they're still relatively new, and many of us are still trying to figure out how they work. For example, Peter recently reached out asking, \"How do I get a passkey from a PC desktop that doesn't have a camera or fingerprint device?\"",
      "That's a great question, Peter, and you're not alone in wondering about this. The good news is that passkeys are designed to work on virtually any device, whether or not it has biometric hardware like a fingerprint reader or camera. Let's explore what passkeys are, why they're worth using and how to set them up on both Windows and Mac, regardless of your hardware setup.",

      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Passkeys make signing in faster and safer by replacing traditional passwords with encrypted keys. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What are passkeys?",
      "Passkeys use cryptography to prove who you are. When you create a passkey, your device makes two keys, one public and one private. The public key goes to the website, and your private key stays on your device. During login, your device confirms your identity with the private key. The website never sees or stores it.",
      "This process blocks phishing and password theft. It also makes sign-in faster. You don't need to remember or type long passwords anymore.",
      "While passkeys simplify authentication, they don't eliminate the need for a secure password manager. Password managers can safely store and sync your passkeys, just as they do with passwords, allowing you to access your credentials across devices and browsers \u2014 even if those devices don't natively sync passkeys, such as between Windows and Apple systems. Using a password manager alongside passkeys creates a bridge between platforms and provides an additional layer of security and convenience.",
      "Can you use passkeys without biometrics?",
      "Yes, you can. A PC or Mac without a camera or fingerprint reader can still use passkeys. On Windows, you unlock them with your Windows Hello PIN. On Apple devices, you can use Touch ID, Face ID or your passcode. The key is having an updated operating system and browser that support passkeys.",
      "If you manage multiple accounts or devices, a password manager that supports passkeys can act as your central vault. This lets you use passkeys even on systems that don't directly support syncing through iCloud or Google Password Manager. It's an easy way to ensure you always have access to your credentials, no matter what kind of device you use.",
      "Why you still need passwords",
      "Not every website supports passkeys yet. Some services still rely on passwords. Keep strong, unique passwords for those accounts. Passwords also serve as backup if you lose a device or can't use your passkey. Over time, more sites will support password-free logins.",
      "This is where password managers continue to play an important role. They bridge the gap between old and new authentication methods, allowing you to store both traditional passwords and passkeys in one secure place. Until the web is fully passkey-ready, combining the two provides both convenience and resilience, giving you a seamless experience across multiple devices and services.",
      "Passkeys also prevent phishing because your private key never leaves your device during sign-in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Passkey support by platform",
      "Works on\u00a0Windows 10 and 11.Windows 11 version 22H2 (KB5030310+) includes passkey management.Unlock with\u00a0Windows Hello PIN, face, or fingerprint.",

      "Regularly backing up your Mac or PC to a secure cloud service or external drive ensures that you can recover important data in case of hardware failure, malware attack, or accidental deletion.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Passkeys are a major upgrade over traditional passwords, but we're not living in an all-passkey world just yet. Many sites still rely on passwords, and you'll need backups if something happens to your device. Supplementing passkeys with a password manager is the best move right now; it lets you store, sync and protect both passkeys and passwords under one roof. The good news is that setting up passkeys takes just a few minutes, and once they're enabled, logging in becomes faster and more secure.",

      "Speaking on the sidelines of the Shurat HaDin conference at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York City this week, Cohen, who led Israel\u2019s intelligence agency until 2021, described the operation as a turning point for Israel\u2019s security and the region\u2019s diplomatic future.",

      "Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn reports on the charges against a New York City man accused of targeting Jewish victims at pro-Israel demonstrations and allegedly calling himself a 'Jew-hater.'",
      "Tarek Bazrouk could have faced up to 30 years in prison for antisemitic attacks but will instead serve 17 months.",
      "The 20-year-old Palestinian American, who prosecutors say supports Hamas and Hezbollah, was charged with multiple federal hate crimes. He was accused of punching and kicking Jewish protesters at several pro-Israel rallies over a nine-month period in New York City, starting last year. He pleaded guilty to one count in a plea deal.",
      "\"I think it's disgusting. I was wearing an Israeli flag. I was wearing my hat with the Israeli flag. I had my Jewish star out \u2026 it\u2019s just disgusting what he did,\" said pro-Israel protester Roman Efraimov.

      "Court papers say Bazrouk \"identified himself as a Jew-hater, labeled Jews as worthless, exhorted Allah to get us rid of Jews,\" and, in one text message presented by prosecutors, wished that he could set a Jewish protester on fire.",
      "But in court, he was contrite and said that he apologized.",
      "\"I\u2019m sorry, guys, and I hope that you forgive me for my actions,\" said Bazrouk, as he turned around and addressed Efraimov and Elisha Baker, who said he was assaulted by Bazrouk. \"I promise you, Judge, that if you give me a chance, you will not be disappointed.\"",

      "For Hannah Szretter, the government shutdown is more than just a political fight.",
      "The 26-year-old Buffalo-area resident said she has had Type 1 diabetes since she was 10 and also now has a mental health disorder that prevents her from working. The $300 she receives each month in food assistance from the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program has been a needed lifeline to make sure she is able to maintain her blood sugar level.",
      "\u201cI need these benefits for my food. If I don\u2019t get the food, I won\u2019t be able to control my numbers,\u201d she told NBC News. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get it taken care of, you can lose toes or limbs, or could go blind.\u201d",
      "Now she is among the more than 40 million people who may not receive their November SNAP benefits as the government shutdown goes into its sixth week with no end in sight.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d she said.",
      "Along with the loss of SNAP benefits and the disruption of other social service programs for millions of people, the government shutdown has resulted in federal employees going without pay. Many of them have turned to food banks and unemployment benefits to get by.",
      "The shutdown is compounding problems that have intensified broader anxiety over an economy that in recent months has been marked by lingering high prices for many consumer goods, rough jobs numbers, mass layoffs at major companies \u2014 including Amazon and Target \u2014 and an uptick in inflation.",
      "That stagnation has in recent months eroded the high approval marks President Donald Trump once enjoyed on the economy.",
      "The bleak picture has some Republicans sounding the alarm to the White House \u2014 even though delivering the news isn\u2019t easy.",
      "\u201cNo one wants to tell the president he\u2019s losing on the economy,\u201d said a Republican strategist who said they recently warned the White House about their concerns.",
      "Trump\u2019s overall approval rating sits at 43%, while just 34% of registered voters say he has \u201clived up\u201d to expectations on the economy, 33% say he has \u201clooked out for the middle class\u201d and 30% say he met expectations on inflation, according to a new NBC News poll released Sunday.",
      "A White House official blamed Democrats for the prolonged shutdown and argued that some indicators, like growing wages and a booming stock market, are proof the economy has bright spots. The person also argued that the massive tax cuts and tariffs pursued by Trump are going to take time to fully take effect.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is under any illusions that things are perfect \u2026 but looking at the data, we feel good about the trajectory here,\u201d said the White House official, who, like others in this article, was granted anonymity to speak candidly.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is that the actual buying power and actual purchasing power of American consumers is going up, and, as far as specific prices go, you know there are things like gas and eggs that have gone down,\u201d the official said. They also asserted that Trump\u2019s pursuit of investment in the U.S. will pay major dividends in the future for American workers and consumers.",
      "Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican and Trump ally, said in an interview with NBC News that he remains optimistic about the economy.",
      "\u201cThe state of the economy is very strong, if you look at real wages that continue to go up,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cThe Working Families Tax Cut Act worked really well. ... The big thing is, obviously, the Democrats don\u2019t want the economy to be successful, which is decently sad considering they should be cheering for the American people. But they shut down the government because they want Trump to fail.\u201d",
      "Republicans are pushing for the passage of a \u201ccontinuing resolution,\u201d which would extend current funding levels until Nov. 21. Democrats, meanwhile, want to include an extension of tax credits that help people buy private insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Those credits expire at the end of the year, and without the extension, millions of people who receive them are likely to see steep premium increases. Republicans have argued the health care fight should be handled separately, after the government reopens.",
      "For his part, Trump for weeks has largely been focused on issues aside from the shutdown and economic concerns, with the exception of deals around his tariffs. Democrats have called on him to become more engaged to help end the stalemate.",
      "On Tuesday night, Trump did write on social media that Senate Republicans should use the \u201cnuclear option\u201d to get rid of the filibuster. The drastic move would allow Republicans to reopen the government without needing 60 votes \u2014 and the cooperation of Democrats \u2014 but it was swiftly rejected by Republican leaders.",
      "Last week, Trump\u2019s attention was in Asia, far from the pain of the shutdown, with a big announcement on tariffs. Before that, much of his focus was on demolishing the East Wing of the White House to build a $300 million ballroom funded by private donors, a project that is ongoing.",
      "And on Thursday, a reporter asked Vice President JD Vance about the loss of SNAP benefits, and whether the administration was working to find a funding solution, as it has tried to do to pay troops and law enforcement during the shutdown.",
      "Vance avoided answering whether there would be a push around SNAP, instead blaming Democrats.",
      "\u201cThe unfortunate reality \u2014 and we\u2019re starting to see this with our aviation industry \u2014 we\u2019re going to find out the hard way with SNAP benefits, the American people are already suffering, and the suffering is going to get a lot worse,\u201d Vance said.",
      "Some relief could be coming \u2014 but if it does, it\u2019s over the Trump administration\u2019s objections. On Friday, a federal judge ordered the administration to distribute money to SNAP recipients \u201cas soon as possible\u201d by tapping a contingency fund. Another federal judge in a separate case also said it was unlawful for the administration not to pay out the benefits.",
      "The White House has argued that it cannot use those funds and is seeking further clarification from the courts.",
      "Hannah\u2019s mom, Betty, a 63-year-old recent retiree who is a caretaker for her daughter and a longtime Trump supporter, said she is losing confidence in the president she once supported amid the shutdown fight.",
      "\u201cI think deep down he wants to help the country with things like food insecurity,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now he is busy out of the country and demolishing the White House. I know that is being paid for with private funds, but those could be used to help people.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt all seems very selfish,\u201d she added.",
      "Betty Szretter said she now regrets voting for Trump in 2024 and would prefer a Democrat in the White House to \u201cprotect benefits he [Trump] wants to cut.\u201d",
      "Several recent public polls have pointed to Trump having an economic problem, one that is quickly turning into a political one for Republicans trying to maintain slim majorities in the House and Senate headed into the 2026 midterms \u2014 an election where Republicans will have to energize Trump voters without his presence on the ballot.",
      "The new NBC News poll found Republicans have just a 1-point advantage over Democrats on \u201cdealing with the economy,\u201d a margin that has consistently been 15-20 points in favor of Republicans going back to 2018.",
      "Chuck Rocha, a Democratic strategist who advised freshman Sen. Ruben Gallego\u2019s winning campaign in Arizona last year, said that economic hardship gives his party\u2019s candidates an opening to win key segments of the electorate \u2014 including the young men who helped Trump take back the White House \u2014 if they focus on making the argument that their policies are better than the president\u2019s.",
      "\u201cRight now, people\u2019s prices are going up. Their prices are going up for the utility bills, going up for lots of things in their life, because of the tariffs,\u201d Rocha said. \u201cIf you show up and start talking to folks about actually trying to provide for their family, there\u2019s going to be a lot of men who right now feel a little regret because they were promised lower prices and they\u2019re not getting them.\u201d",
      "Moreno said he was not worried \u201cabout the politics\u201d of the shutdown, noting that he has pledged to serve no more than two Senate terms and, as a native of Colombia, is constitutionally ineligible to be president. But he said Republicans need to better articulate their message: that they hold Democrats responsible for the shutdown and its economic ramifications.",
      "He specifically alluded to recent remarks from House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., who in an interview with Fox News acknowledged that families would \u201csuffer\u201d because of the shutdown but emphasized that Democrats needed to exert their political \u201cleverage\u201d to address health care costs.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to speak up more loudly and more aggressively, like [Senate Majority Leader] John Thune did the other day. I think we haven\u2019t shown enough outrage. We do it privately, but we haven\u2019t done it enough publicly. Just call these guys out. It\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Moreno said.",
      "\u201cWe need to speak clearly, with humanity, not political talk,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump remains popular with Republicans on things like immigration enforcement \u2014 Betty Szretter says she still supports the president on that issue \u2014 but pocketbook issues more often than not have an outsize role in swaying election outcomes.",
      "The NBC News poll found 83% of registered voters said the \u201ccost of living\u201d was their single most important issue or very important to them, a number that was at 58% when they were asked about \u201cimmigration and border security.\u201d",
      "On the Asia trip last week, Trump nevertheless told reporters he had the \u201chighest [poll] numbers I ever had.\u201d",
      "He has also directly avoided questions about the economy.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s just make it about this subject,\u201d Trump said at an event centered around an autism announcement last month. \u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about some nonsense on the economy. I will say this: The economy is unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Republicans running in swing House seats across the country, however, have not been eager to talk about Trump\u2019s economy.",
      "NBC News reached out to eight Republicans either defending swing seats they currently hold or challenging Democrats in winnable seats; seven did not return requests seeking comment.",
      "Brinker Harding is a Republican city councilman in Omaha running to replace Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who is not seeking re-election in one of the most up-for-grab seats in the country. Harding said he believes that once the midterm campaigns really begin, moves Trump has made will have the economy in a better place.",
      "\u201cCome next November, Republicans\u2019 tax cuts for working families and small businesses, in addition to projected interest rate cuts, will have the American economy moving more than it already is,\u201d he said.",
      "Other swing state Republicans where vulnerable Democrats are on the ballot are pinning economic woes on those Democrats.",
      "\u201cMaine\u2019s issues are especially pronounced on the economic front,\u201d said Lauren LePage, who is the Republican national committeewoman from Maine. \u201cAnd the blame for our high cost of living, nation-leading electricity price increases and more lies at the feet of Democrats here.\u201d",
      "Maine is home to one of the nation\u2019s most closely watched 2026 Senate contests as Democrats try to knock off Republican Sen. Susan Collins. LePage\u2019s father, former Republican Gov. Paul LePage, is himself running to challenge Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, in a House seat that is considered winnable for either party.",
      "Other Republicans, including some former Trump allies, are acknowledging that prices have remained stubbornly high during Trump\u2019s second term in office.",
      "\u201cPrices have not come down at all,\u201d Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said on \u201cThe Tim Dillon Show\u201d last week. \u201cThe job market is extremely difficult. Wages have not gone up.\u201d",
      "She has also made an uncharacteristic pivot in recent weeks. After being one of Trump\u2019s staunchest defenders, she has been critical of the president and her own party of late, agreeing with Democrats that the Affordable Care Act tax credits should be included as part of any deal to reopen the government.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to the point where families are spending anywhere from $1,500 to $2,000 a month and looking at hikes coming on their insurance premiums, I think that\u2019s unforgivable,\u201d she told NBC News in early October.",
      "For people like Betty Szretter, they just want the fight to be over and the focus to return to Americans hurting in the current economic climate.",
      "\u201cI would say practice what you preach and save the country as a true servant,\u201d she said when asked what she would say to Trump directly. \u201cThere are not a lot of people who use their wealth to actually help others. Really no one.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration has begun detailed planning for a new mission to send U.S. troops and intelligence officers into Mexico to target drug cartels, according to two U.S. officials and two former senior U.S. officials familiar with the effort.",
      "The early stages of training for the potential mission, which would include ground operations inside Mexico, has already begun, the two current U.S. officials said. But a deployment to Mexico is not imminent, the two U.S. officials and one of the former U.S. officials said. Discussions about the scope of the mission are ongoing, and a final decision has not been made, the two current U.S. officials said.",
      "The U.S. troops, many of whom would be from Joint Special Operations Command, would operate under the authority of the U.S. intelligence community, known as Title 50 status, the two current officials said. They said officers from the Central Intelligence Agency also would participate.",
      "A U.S. mission using American forces to hit drug cartel targets inside Mexico would open a new front in President Donald Trump\u2019s military campaign against drug cartels in the Western Hemisphere. So far, the administration has focused on Venezuela and conducting strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats.",
      "The mission currently being planned for would be a break with past U.S. administrations, which have quietly deployed CIA, military and law enforcement teams to Mexico to support local police and army units fighting cartels but not to take direct action against them.",
      "If the mission is given the final green light, the administration plans to maintain secrecy around it and not publicize actions associated with it, as it has with recent bombings of suspected drug-smuggling boats, the two current and two former U.S. officials said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is committed to utilizing an all-of-government approach to address the threats cartels pose to American citizens,\u201d a senior administration official said in response to this story.",
      "The CIA declined to comment. The Pentagon referred questions to the White House.",
      "Under the new mission being planned, U.S. troops in Mexico would mainly use drone strikes to hit drug labs and cartel members and leaders, the two current U.S. officials and two former U.S. officials said. Some of the drones that special forces would use require operators to be on the ground to use them effectively and safely, the officials said.",
      "In February, the State Department designated six Mexican drug cartels, as well as MS-13 and the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, as foreign terrorist organizations, giving U.S. spy agencies and military units sweeping legal authorities to conduct espionage and covert operations targeting the criminal networks. Trump publicly acknowledged earlier this month that he authorized covert CIA action inside Venezuela and has said his administration could strike drug cartel targets on land there.",
      "NBC News reported in April that the Trump administration was considering launching drone strikes on drug cartels in Mexico. Trump administration officials are still debating precisely how aggressive to be in Mexico as part of its fight against drug cartels, according to the two former U.S. officials and another former administration official with knowledge of the effort.",
      "Unlike in Venezuela, the mission being planned for Mexico is not designed to undermine the country\u2019s government, the two current and two former U.S. officials said.",
      "After NBC\u2019s story in April, Mexico\u2019s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, addressed it at a news conference. \u201cWe reject any form of intervention or interference. That\u2019s been very clear, Mexico coordinates and collaborates, but does not subordinate itself,\u201d she said, according to a translation provided by the Mexican Embassy to the U.S.",
      "The administration would prefer to coordinate with the Mexican government on any new mission against drug cartels, but officials have not ruled out operating without that coordination, the two current and two former U.S. officials said.",
      "Since early September, Trump has overseen a military campaign against boats in waters near Venezuela that his administration says were destined to smuggle narcotics into the U.S. The Pentagon has said 64 people, including members of Tren de Aragua from Venezuela, have been killed in 15 strikes on 16 boats in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Officials have not released the names or other details of those killed.",
      "The administration has produced no evidence supporting its allegations about the boats, their passengers, the cargo or the number of people killed, injured or surviving.",
      "Trump has said the strikes are sending a strong message to the cartels that they will face lethal punishment if they try to smuggle narcotics into the U.S.He\u2019s called drug trafficking by Mexican, Venezuelan and other gangs a threat to national security, arguing that law enforcement methods \u2014 such as seizing narcotics at the U.S. border, at airports and at sea, and investigating cartel bosses and financing \u2014 have failed to solve the problem that claims the lives of tens of thousands of Americans every year.",
      "There has been both support for and bipartisan criticism of Trump\u2019s military campaign against alleged drug-smuggling boats.",
      "Trump\u2019s focus on Venezuela includes not only military strikes on alleged drug boats, but also a pressure campaign against the country\u2019s president, Nicolas Maduro. The administration has accused Maduro of being a member of a drug cartel and is offering a $50 million reward for information that leads to his arrest.",
      "In Mexico, Sheinbaum already has allowed the CIA to expand surveillance flights, which began during the Biden administration, NBC News has reported. Under her leadership, Mexico has deployed 10,000 troops to the U.S. border, increased fentanyl seizures and extradited 55 senior cartel figures to the U.S.",
      "Trump\u2019s public comments have suggested the Mexican government is unable to control the cartels.",
      "\u201cI have great respect for the president, a woman that I think is a tremendous woman,\u201d Trump said last month. \u201cShe\u2019s a very brave woman, but Mexico is run by the cartels.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Taking melatonin for long periods of time could be a sign of underlying heart problems.",
      "Long-term use of the popular over-the-counter sleep aid has been linked to a higher risk of heart failure and early death in adults with insomnia, according to research released Monday.",
      "There\u2019s no evidence that melatonin supplements themselves cause heart problems, the researchers said. But a need to take them on a regular basis to help with falling and staying asleep could be a signal that the body is experiencing cardiac issues.",
      "\u201cInsomnia can increase blood pressure, stress hormones and inflammation,\u201d said Dr. Ekenedilichukwu Nnadi, lead author of the new study and an internal medicine resident at SUNY Downstate/Kings County Primary Care in New York City.",
      "Nnadi and colleagues looked at five years of electronic health records from 130,828 adults, average age 56, finding that people who took melatonin regularly for at least a year were nearly twice as likely to develop heart failure compared to those who didn\u2019t use the supplement, though the actual rates were relatively low: 4.6% of people in the melatonin group developed heart failure, compared to 2.7% among those who didn\u2019t take melatonin.",
      "They were more than three times as likely to be hospitalized for the condition (19% versus 6.6%), and nearly twice as likely to die during the study period, compared to people who didn\u2019t take melatonin regularly.",
      "It\u2019s unclear, however, whether the data captured outcomes of all people in the U.S. who take melatonin long term. Researchers identified people as chronic users of melatonin based on medical records only \u2014 that is, if they\u2019d been prescribed the supplement. In the U.S., the supplement is available over the counter and isn\u2019t often reflected in medical records.",
      "\u201cI caution people against drawing concrete conclusions based on this study alone,\u201d said Dr. Nishant Shah, a preventive cardiologist at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, who wasn\u2019t involved with the study. \u201cBut now that we have this observation, this is prime time to figure out whether there\u2019s actually a direct association of harm with sleep agents. That would be practice-changing.\u201d",
      "Nnadi\u2019s research is scheduled to be presented in New Orleans at an upcoming meeting of the American Heart Association. It has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.",
      "Heart failure occurs when the heart can\u2019t pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the body\u2019s organs for them to function properly. Nearly 7 million Americans have the condition, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "While the study found that long-term melatonin use was an indicator of potential heart problems \u2014 and not causing the problems itself \u2014 experts agreed more research is needed into the supplements\u2019 possible side effects.",
      "\u201cWe have patients using all kinds of supplements without understanding the risks,\u201d said Dr. Martha Gulati, a preventive cardiologist and the incoming director of the Davis Women\u2019s Heart Center at Houston Methodist DeBakey Heart and Vascular Institute in Texas. \u201cIf there is harm from a supplement, it means the cost could be far more than simply expensive urine.\u201d Gulati was not involved with the new study.",
      "Melatonin is a hormone made naturally by the body that helps regulate sleep and wake cycles. Synthetic versions, sold widely over the counter as dietary supplements, are marketed to help people fall asleep faster or overcome jet lag. Because supplements aren\u2019t regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, doses and purity can vary widely among brands.",
      "Use of the supplement has increased in recent years. A 2022 Sleep Foundation survey found that up to 27% of U.S. adults take melatonin, as well as 4% of kids. The new study didn\u2019t include children.",
      "People taking melatonin for sleep for more than a year should talk with their doctor, experts said.",
      "\u201cPeople should be aware that it should not be taken chronically without a proper indication,\u201d Marie-Pierre St-Onge, director of the Center of Excellence for Sleep & Circadian Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York, said in a press release. St-Onge was not involved with the new research."

      "The candidates for governor in New Jersey and Virginia crisscrossed their states in the final weekend of the 2025 campaign season, ahead of the first big elections since President Donald Trump\u2019s victory in 2024.",
      "The races will be the early tests for major questions facing both political parties after 2024, from how to navigate the high cost of living to how to appeal to increasingly swingy Latino voters, as well as which side is energized going into the 2026 midterms. Republicans face a familiar challenge of turning out Trump\u2019s coalition when he is not on the ballot, while Democrats are looking for a boost after a demoralizing election last year.",
      "In Virginia, former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger has consistently led her Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, in polling and fundraising throughout the entire campaign. A more competitive race has formed in New Jersey, according to recent polling, where Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill is facing Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state legislator.",
      "Both Sherrill and Spanberger were elected to Congress in the party\u2019s 2018 midterm blue wave during Trump\u2019s first term, and they lived together while serving in the House. The former roommates are now looking to lead their party\u2019s electoral pushback against Trump following his return to the White House.",
      "\u201cIn 2025, it really feels like the important fight is at the state level in these governor\u2019s offices, because with the president having the presidency, the GOP having the Senate and the House, and even co-opting the Supreme Court, the last bastion feels like governors races and governors standing in the breach,\u201d Sherrill told NBC News in a Friday interview.",
      "While Democrats have brought some high profile surrogates to their states, Republicans have largely campaigned on their own. Trump has not campaigned in person either state, despite endorsing Ciattarelli. (Trump has not endorsed Earle-Sears.)",
      "But the president is holding two telephone rallies Monday night for candidates in New Jersey and Virginia.",
      "Both Spanberger and Sherrill had some help from former President Barack Obama at rallies on Saturday. Obama appeared with Sherrill in Newark, the state\u2019s largest city, amid some concerns about Black voter turnout. In Virginia, Obama rallied supporters in Norfolk and encouraged them to send a message to the rest of the country.",
      "\u201cLord knows we need that light. We need that inspiration.\u201d Obama said at both rallies. \u201cBecause, let\u2019s face it, our country and our politics are in a pretty dark place right now.\u201d",
      "Obama told voters in both states they have the opportunity to \u201cset a glorious example for this nation.\u201d",
      "Other prominent Democrats \u2014 including potential future presidential contenders \u2014 hit the campaign trail in both states in the final days.",
      "In New Jersey, the state\u2019s two Democratic senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, campaigned for Sherrill, along with Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy.",
      "Their weekend events followed other top Democrats' forays into the state, including former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin. Many of the same names crossed through Virginia as well.",
      "In Virginia, Spanberger continued her closing statewide bus tour \u2014 which had kicked off on Oct. 25 \u2014 making stops on Saturday in Norfolk, alongside Obama, and on Sunday in the Washington, D.C., suburbs. On Monday, she\u2019s scheduled to hold a trio of final-day events in the region of her old Richmond-area congressional district.",
      "Her closing message has centered on her campaign-long focus on economic and affordability issues, as well as a sharp rejection of Trump\u2019s policies and the chaos she said they\u2019ve created in Virginia\u2019s economy.",
      "\u201cWith the political turmoil coming out of Washington right now, this election is an opportunity,\u201d she said during her Norfolk speech.",
      "\u201cIn Virginia, we need a governor who will recognize that Virginians are struggling to afford the rising costs in health care, housing and energy,\u201d she added.",
      "Polls in Virginia have consistently shown Spanberger leading. Early voting kicked off in the commonwealth more than six weeks ago, and as of Saturday, more than 1.43 million people had already voted \u2014 nearly 44% of total turnout in the 2021 governor\u2019s race.",
      "While Republicans did not see the same quantity of high-profile surrogates on the trail in the final days, Earle-Sears had support from popular Gov. Glenn Youngkin.",
      "Earle-Sears held campaign events on Saturday in Abingdon, a heavily Republican area in southwest Virginia, and in Loudoun County. Youngkin, the term-limited Republican governor, appeared at those events, alongside the rest of the Republican ticket \u2014 John Reid, the lieutenant governor nominee, and Jason Miyares, the incumbent attorney general.",
      "The same lineup appeared at Earle-Sears campaign events on Sunday in Prince George and Hanover, near Richmond. Earle-Sears was slated to hold more events Monday in Roanoke and in Virginia Beach and Manassas, where Republican National Committee chair Joe Gruters was also scheduled to join.",
      "In recent days, Earle-Sears has put a focus on attacking Spanberger over years-old violent texts from Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones, as well as efforts by legislative Democrats to redraw Virginia\u2019s congressional maps.",
      "But over the weekend, Earle-Sears revisited a message that had been a focus earlier in her campaign: emphasizing the accomplishments of Youngkin\u2019s administration and telling voters that electing her would mark a continuation of his record, including growing the private sector of the economy.",
      "\u201cThis election is about our future,\u201d Earle-Sears said in Abingdon. \u201cWe\u2019ve had four glorious years where we\u2019ve been making jobs left and right \u2026 We\u2019ve already had so many successes, but there\u2019s more that can happen.\u201d",
      "Ciattarelli also embarked on a bus tour to rally his supporters in New Jersey over the weekend. Asked after he cast his ballot on Friday if any big names would join him on the trail, he told reporters, \u201cJack Ciattarelli.\u201d",
      "This is Ciattarelli\u2019s third run for governor after losing the 2017 GOP primary and becoming the GOP nominee in 2021, when he lost a surprisingly close, 3-point race to Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. Ciattarelli said Friday that this year feels different.",
      "\u201cThe issues I was talking about in \u201821 were percolating. Today, they\u2019re at a complete boil. We\u2019ve got an affordability crisis, a public safety crisis, a public education crisis, a housing crisis, including over-development,\u201d Ciattarelli said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot less indifference this time around,\u201d Ciattarelli later added. \u201cBack in \u201821 I had too many people inside New Jersey, including Republicans, and people around the country who didn\u2019t think I had a shot in hell. They now know differently because of our performance in 21.\u201d",
      "Public polls have shown a competitive campaign in New Jersey, although the state of the race has varied depending on the survey. On Thursday alone, five independent polls came out showing Sherrill ranging from a 9-point advantage to a negligible 1-point edge.",
      "Both Ciattarelli and Sherrill have also made their closing pitches on the airwaves in ads highlighting the state\u2019s high cost of living \u2014 part of more than $100 million in ads in the race, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Since the June primary, Democrats have spent nearly $64 million on ads through Election Day, while Republicans have spent more than $42 million.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll serve you as governor to drive your costs down,\u201d Sherrill says in her closing TV ad. \u201cOn day one, I\u2019m declaring a state of emergency on utility costs to lower your family\u2019s bills. And when I\u2019m governor, no sales tax increases, period. And I\u2019ll fight for your family just as hard as I fight for mine.\u201d",
      "Ciattarelli used one of his closing spots to cast himself as the \u201cchange\u201d candidate, tying Sherrill to Murphy, the two-term Democratic governor.",
      "\u201cWe need someone who\u2019s honest with a real plan, someone who gets it,\u201d Ciattarelli says in the ad. \u201cAs governor, I\u2019ll fight every day for people who work hard and play by the rules because that\u2019s what you deserve. Together, I know we can fix New Jersey. It\u2019s time.\u201d",
      "In Virginia, Earle-Sears\u2019 closing ads have largely focused on attacking Spanberger, highlighting Jones\u2019 texts and her positions on the rights of transgender people, as well as tying her to national Democrats like Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s weak, she\u2019s wrong, we can\u2019t trust her,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says.",
      "Spanberger, for her part, has used her closing ad to revisit her personal story, talking about her record of public service, including as a CIA officer."

    "summary": "In an interview with NBC News, Maine Senate candidate Graham Platner bashed \"establishment politics\" and said he's still more electable than Democratic rival Janet Mills.",
    "story": [
      "PORTLAND, Maine \u2014 In the last three weeks, Graham Platner has faced enough damaging revelations to potentially sink just about any candidate. The Democratic Senate hopeful has apologized for past online posts making offensive comments, covered up a tattoo on his chest that has a Nazi association and lost top staff.",
      "Yet Platner is still standing.",
      "The 41-year-old oyster farmer and combat veteran spoke to a packed crowd at the State Theatre here on Sunday, counted at 745 attendees by his campaign, about his vision for \u201cbuilding power.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is amusing for me to watch the campaign described in the media as collapsing or falling apart \u2014 when internally, we frankly have not felt this strong since the beginning,\u201d Platner told NBC News after the event. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t sunk my campaign. In fact it seems, in many ways, it\u2019s strengthened us.\u201d",
      "He said that's because he has addressed his past head-on and not run from it.",
      "\u201cI want to talk about my evolution as a human being,\" he said. \"A lot of Americans also want to have hope that you can change and that you can evolve, and that we can have a society that gives grace and forgiveness to people. Because if we can\u2019t, if we think that people are just ossified into who they are right now, and can never be something different, then what\u2019s the point?\u201d",
      "The Maine Senate race is shaping up to be one of the key fights of the 2026 midterms, with Platner trying to take advantage of the restlessness in the Democratic Party. A progressive populist who has the support of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Platner is running on a platform of universal health care, housing affordability and ending U.S. involvement in foreign wars.",
      "In a wide-ranging interview, Platner addressed the scandals that have engulfed his campaign and said he\u2019s \u201cvery proud of who I am today\u201d after the \u201carcs and valleys\u201d of his life. He inveighed against \u201cestablishment politics,\u201d dished on his tense relationship with national Democratic leaders, made the case that he\u2019s more \u201celectable\u201d than Democratic Gov. Janet Mills and explained why he went from voting for Republican Sen. Susan Collins years ago to viewing her as an empty vessel today.",
      "Platner also said he isn\u2019t lamenting his staff departures, which include his political director and finance director.",
      "\u201cWe find ourselves now in a significantly stronger position, team-wise,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile we lost some people, we\u2019ve kept almost everybody, and people that have stayed are galvanized and committed.\u201d",
      "\ufeffA dozen rally attendees \u2014 including some who supported Collins in the past \u2014 said they don\u2019t consider Platner\u2019s past comments disqualifying. Some voters said it gave them pause and they\u2019re undecided; others said they accept his explanations and plan to vote for him in the primary.",
      "\u201cIt gave me pause, but I read his responses and I\u2019m still intrigued to hear more about him,\u201d said Emily Bukowski-Thall, of Portland, Maine.",
      "Her husband, Michael Bukowski, added, \u201cIf you look at the controversies surrounding the current president, this is nothing.\u201d",
      "Platner responded to the pitch from Mills and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., that the two-term governor is a battle-tested and safe option to unseat Collins.",
      "\u201cI think my \u2018lack of experience\u2019 is a positive,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want establishment politicians. People don\u2019t want to see the same playbook run over and over and over again \u2014 a playbook which, by the way, has failed to unseat Susan Collins time after time. I firmly believe that the real risk is running an establishment candidate that is not trying something new.\u201d",
      "In response, Mills campaign spokesperson Scott Ogden said in a statement, \u201cGovernor Mills is the only Democrat in this race who has stood up to Donald Trump, who has won two statewide elections, and who has delivered real results for working Maine families \u2014 including expanding health care to more than 100,000 Maine people, fully funding education, guaranteeing free school meals, delivering free community college, protecting abortion rights, and fighting climate change.\u201d",
      "While some attendees at Sunday\u2019s rally said the 77-year-old Mills is too old for their taste, Platner said that isn\u2019t his concern: \u201cThis is not about age. It is about how old your ideas are.\u201d",
      "Platner said he has received no outreach from Schumer or Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., the chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, or from DSCC staff.",
      "\u201cWe have made it very clear that I\u2019m very open to those discussions. But no, no one has reached out,\u201d he said, while adding that he would welcome the support of the deep-pocketed DSCC in a general election. \u201cWe have been very clear that we are not trying to have a friction-filled relationship, though that has been rebuffed on multiple occasions... The ball is in their court.\u201d",
      "NBC News reached out to the DSCC for comment.",
      "Platner said he has \u201cvoted for Susan Collins at least once, possibly twice\u201d but \u201cit was a long time ago\u201d \u2014 as the 72-year-old incumbent closes in on 30 years in the Senate.",
      "\u201cI also believed back then that she was a moderate. As time has gone by, I don\u2019t believe that. I think that\u2019s a charade, and it\u2019s worn thin,\u201d he said. \u201cI see Collins as, frankly, just another self-interested, establishment politician who uses this kind of myth of their moderation to stay in power, but doesn\u2019t really do anything with their power. She\u2019s the chair of the Appropriations Committee. I was told for years that when she got the gavel, there was going to be a boon of riches for the state of Maine. That is not materializing.\u201d",
      "\ufeffCollins spokesperson Blake Kernen noted that she has been ranked multiple times by the Lugar Center and Georgetown\u2019s McCourt School of Public Policy as the most bipartisan U.S. senator. In addition, Collins\u2019 Senate website highlights that she has secured more than $1 billion in congressionally directed spending for projects in Maine over the last three fiscal years.",
      "Elizabeth Lardie Thompson, an attendee of the rally from Bath, Maine, said she felt \u201cvery betrayed\u201d by Collins after voting for her. She pointed to Collins\u2019 support of conservative Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and \u201cnot listening\u201d to her constituents on health care.",
      "\u201cI think she\u2019s beholden to her party much more than she\u2019s beholden to her state,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI really don\u2019t care; red, blue, whatever, but I do have a problem with how Collins has handled herself recently.\u201d",
      "Cathay Getchell from Scarborough, Maine, also previously voted for Collins, but she said that she is concerned about the senator\u2019s age and alignment with the \u201cestablishment\u201d of the Republican Party.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s been there too long and we need a change,\u201d Getchell said outside of the rally.",
      "Collins has picked her moments to break with the GOP, like in opposing President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d to extend tax breaks and cut Medicaid spending. But she also gives the GOP a valuable vote to ensure the Senate remains controlled by Trump\u2019s allies. As she seeks another six-year term in this blue-leaning state, Collins is expected to run another local campaign and tout the money she has brought home to Maine.",
      "\u201cHer primary role at this point is to function as cover for the Republicans to maintain a majority of the Senate,\u201d Platner said. \u201cI think that her votes on Brett Kavanaugh and her votes on RFK Jr. show that she is not interested in actually holding up the moderate side of the moderate bargain, and that we deserve better.\u201d",
      "A few weeks ago Collins slammed Platner\u2019s since-deleted Reddit posts from 2020 and 2021 after they were reported by CNN, calling them \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201creally offensive.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was appalled when I read those comments,\u201d she told Maine reporters. \u201cFirst of all, as someone who comes from rural Maine, for him to have described white people living in rural Maine as racist and stupid. Just the opposite is the case.\u201d",
      "Asked to respond, Platner said he \u201cdid not denigrate white, rural older voters.\u201d",
      "\u201cI did get in a fight with somebody and say that some rural white voters were stupid and racist,\u201d he said, adding that anybody who reads those posts will see that he defends them more than he criticizes them. \u201cI myself am a rural white voter in eastern Maine. These are my neighbors and my friends. I actually rise to their defense often and continue to do so.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be flippant about it, but I was getting in arguments on the Internet \u2026 at a part in my life when I was looking for interaction and engagement, at a time where I was feeling quite isolated and alone and very disillusioned at that point,\u201d he added. \u201cI do not hold those feelings.\u201d",
      "In one of his posts, Platner wrote, \u201cI got older and became a communist.\u201d He said he has never considered himself to be a communist and that the comment was merely \u201cInternet shitposting \u2014 and also \u2026 if you read it\u2019s very clear that I\u2019m joking.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe in Medicare for all. I believe in expanding the rights of workers to organize. I believe in taxing the ultra-rich. I believe in a fairer economic system,\u201d he said. \u201cI also know that because I believe in those things, people will refer to me as that no matter what\u2026 That\u2019s the joke.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Pennsylvania voters on Tuesday will decide in an unusually contentious election whether three Democratic justices should remain on the state Supreme Court for another 10-year term, a vote that could result in a deadlocked bench for years if they are removed.",
      "One of those three justices, David Wecht, warned what such a scenario would mean for the critical battleground state.",
      "\u201cIt would be disastrous. It\u2019s extremely hard to work with a shorthanded court,\u201d Wecht told NBC News in an interview on Friday. \u201cI have experienced the six-member court, and a six-member court resulted in a lot of deadlocks and a lot of stalemates and a lot of increased work for the remaining six. That was just when we were one seat down with the court. If the Court were to be three seats down, there would be a lot of 2-to-2 ties.\u201d",
      "Wecht, along with Justices Christine Donohue and Kevin Dougherty, are the three members of Democrats\u2019 5-2 majority on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court who are up a retention election on Tuesday.",
      "Judicial retention elections, which happen after a decade on the bench in Pennsylvania, are yes-or-no votes that are typically sleepy downballot contests.",
      "Few Pennsylvania justices have lost their jobs in this way. But with Democrats\u2019 majority at stake ahead of the 2026 and 2028 elections, this year\u2019s retention vote has drawn outsize money and attention. If all three justices were to lose and the Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro can\u2019t agree on temporary appointments, Pennsylvania\u2019s high court could be deadlocked 2-2 through the end of 2027.",
      "\u201cYou would have a four-member court for two full calendar years, because there\u2019s no way, there\u2019s no way that this Senate is going to confirm a single nominee that Gov. Shapiro sends them,\u201d Wecht said.",
      "A deadlocked state Supreme Court court would defer to lower courts, and even if it did decide a case, it likely wouldn\u2019t set new precedent for the state, according to Wecht, who said four members are required to set a precedent. Unanimous decisions are very rare on the state\u2019s top court, which typically tackles difficult questions of law.",
      "\u201cIf you have a 3-1 result in Smith v. Jones \u2014 it applies to Smith and Jones. It governs the case between Smith and Jones, but it\u2019s not a precedent for any other case,\u201d he said. \u201cPrecedent is the whole reason for our court. We\u2019re not just deciding Smith versus Jones, we\u2019re deciding a question of law that applies for now and in the future throughout Pennsylvania for everybody.\u201d",
      "The retention elections have drawn major ad spending and attention. Former President Barack Obama and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro have publicly supported the three Democratic justices. On Sunday night, President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social urging Pennsylvanians to \"Vote 'NO, NO, NO' on Liberal Justices Donohue, Dougherty, and Wecht.'\"",
      "\"Attention Pennsylvania: On November 4th, you can bring back the Rule of Law, and stand up for the Constitution,\" Trump wrote.",
      "One conservative group\u2019s mailer, which Wecht has vocally criticized, claimed the \u201cliberal Supreme Court gerrymandered our congressional districts to help Democrats win,\u201d even though the court had ruled in 2018 that a GOP-drawn map was unconstitutional.",
      "Wecht said the reaction to that ruling has contributed to the divisiveness of this election.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a small child and you take away from the small child a prize plaything or toy, that small child is going to wail and scream and cause a ruckus. That\u2019s exactly what happened,\u201d Wecht said. \u201cI think has been the poison that is infected the approach of some of the same partisans and their descendants who are now assailing us now in what\u2019s supposed to be a nonpartisan election.\u201d"

      "The share of registered voters with positive views of capitalism has dropped under 50% for the first time in seven years of NBC News polling on the issue \u2014 a shift that comes as some democratic socialists, like New York mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani, gain prominence in the Democratic Party.",
      "Overall, 44% of registered voters say they have a positive view of capitalism, while 28% view it negatively. That\u2019s a dip from how the economic system had been viewed in previous polls, which showed slim majorities viewing capitalism positively.",
      "There\u2019s a stark partisan difference in views on capitalism, a trend that also plays out in various demographics more likely to identify with either party. Two-thirds of Republicans view capitalism positively, compared to 44% of independents and 25% of Democrats. Just 12% of Republicans view capitalism negatively, compared to 28% of independents and 45% of Democrats.",
      "Notably, 39% of Democrats viewed capitalism positively in September 2024, while 34% viewed it negatively then \u2014 a 5-point net-positive rating, compared to a 20-point net-negative rating among Democrats now.",
      "Voters under the age of 35 also swung heavily toward more negative views of capitalism over the last year, while Hispanic voters also swung in the same direction and are now effectively split on the economic system.",
      "Meanwhile, views of socialism have stayed more stable. Now, 49% of registered voters view it negatively \u2014 a slight decline from past measurements, which bounced between 50% and 55%. And 18% view socialism positively, right in line with how voters have felt each time the question has been asked since 2018.",
      "Under the hood, the trends look similar to the movement on capitalism, just in reverse.",
      "Last September, 34% of Democrats viewed socialism positively and 29% viewed it negatively. Now, a similar 35% of Democrats view socialism positively, but 20% view it negatively.",
      "While Hispanic voters soured a bit on capitalism in the poll, their views on socialism didn\u2019t move in the same way. Hispanic voters viewed socialism negatively by a 29-point margin in 2024. Now, it\u2019s a 24-point margin.",
      "Views on capitalism and socialism, particularly among Democrats, are evolving as Mamdani and other self-described democratic socialists like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have become increasingly powerful in their party, barnstorming the country and commanding a vocal constituency.",
      "Mamdani, having come up in politics as a democratic socialist and still leaning into that identity, could be on the precipice of winning arguably the largest office in the movement\u2019s history.",
      "\u201cI call myself a democratic socialist, in many ways inspired by the words of Dr. King from decades ago. \u2018Call it democracy, or call it democratic socialism, there has to be a better distribution of wealth for all of God\u2019s children in this country,\u2019\u201d Mamdani told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this summer.",
      "Mamdani\u2019s top opponent, Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic governor of New York, has used that affiliation as a cudgel. Before and after Mamdani defeated him in the June Democratic primary, Cuomo has called Mamdani a socialist, not a Democrat, and warned that his policies will bankrupt the city.",
      "\u201cI am the Democrat. He is a socialist. New York cannot survive as a socialist economy,\u201d Cuomo told Fox News last week.",
      "Though Mamdani is running for a municipal post, the campaign\u2019s national prominence in the nation\u2019s largest city means that about two-thirds of registered voters nationally already feel they know enough about him to register an opinion on him.",
      "Overall, 22% of registered voters view Mamdani positively, while 32% view him negatively and 14% have a neutral view. Another 32% either aren\u2019t sure or don\u2019t know enough to rate him.",
      "Virtually every Republican who knows enough about Mamdani to rate him views him negatively, while Mamdani fares much better among Democrats: 44% view him positively and 10% view him negatively. Among independents, 16% view him positively and 25% view him negatively.",
      "The NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from Oct. 24-28 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points."

    "story": [
      "Rapper RBX accused streaming giant Spotify of turning a blind eye to fraud he alleges boosted the streams of songs performed by superstar Drake, according to a federal class action lawsuit filed Sunday.",
      "The suit names as plaintiffs RBX as an individual and \"on behalf of other members of the general public similarly situated.\" The plaintiff alleges that from January 2022 through September 2025, Drake\u2019s songs have benefited from \u201cbillions of fraudulent streams\u201d generated by fake users, or bots, on Spotify, according to the suit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.",
      "\"The more users (including fake users) Spotify has, the more advertisements it can sell, the more profits the company can report, all of which serves to increase the purported value delivered to shareholders\u201d the suit says.",
      "\u201cThis mass-scale fraudulent streaming causes massive financial harm to legitimate artists, songwriters, producers and other rightsholders whose proportional share is decreased as a result of fraudulent stream inflation on Spotify\u2019s platform,\u201d it adds.",
      "The lawsuit does not allege that Drake did anything criminal. Representatives for Drake and Spotify did not immediately respond to requests for comment early Monday.",
      "Spotify pays artists from a revenue pool, according to its website. It calculates royalty payments from that pool based on an artist\u2019s share of the total number of monthly streams. An artist inflating their streams may take a bigger proportion of the pie than they are actually owed, leaving less payout for other artists.",
      "The lawsuit alleges Spotify failed to prevent bots fraudulently inflating streams for Drake, whose legal name is Aubrey Drake Graham. The rapper is one of the most-streamed artists on the platform, with nearly 81 million monthly listeners.",
      "Spotify recently implemented measures intended to curb \u201cthird party services that guarantee streams.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit doesn\u2019t state how much in damages the plaintiffs seek, but says estimates show rights holders were defrauded out of \u201chundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d",
      "The suit also cites data analysis that the plaintiffs say reveals streams of Drake songs \u201caccumulated far higher total streams\u201d than other artists with \"far more\" listeners than Drake. The suit does not include an appendix showing the analysis, doesn\u2019t say who conducted it, and NBC News could not independently verify the findings.",
      "RBX, also known as Eric Dwayne Collins, achieved fame decades ago. The artist performed for rap labels Death Row Records and Aftermath Entertainment, alongside artists including Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre.",
      "Other artists have complained about Spotify and its business model. Shirley Manson, the lead singer of alternative group Garbage, told a concert audience in mid-October that the average musician makes little from Spotify.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re sleeping in their vans. They\u2019re holding down numerous jobs. They\u2019re playing their guts out every night. The fact that they are not even able to sell a record and it\u2019s taken from them by rich motherf\u2014--s on streaming platforms,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re all f\u2014ing getting paid, except for the musician.\u201d",
      "Shares of Luxembourg-based Spotify have surged this year, putting its U.S. stock market value well above $100 billion.",
      "While Drake isn\u2019t a defendant in the suit filed by RBX, it comes while the \u201cHotline Bling\u201d rapper contends with a variety of other legal issues. He\u2019s currently facing a lawsuit over his involvement with an online, crypto-powered casino as well as appealing the dismissal of his defamation case against his label, UMG."

    "story": [
      "Judd Apatow says that if it wasn't for one iconic director, then \"Anchorman\" probably wouldn't be what it is today.",
      "The legendary comedian explained how it happened on the Nov. 2 episode of \u201cSunday Sitdown.\" He said the first draft of \"Anchorman,\" written by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay, told an entirely different story.",
      "He said the plot was about a group of anchorpeople who survive a plane crash on their way to an anchor convention.",
      "\"So they crash into a mountain, and it becomes about them trying to survive, and slowly they wonder if they need to eat each other,\" he laughed. \"And they brought me in at some point and they wrote a new script, which was what became 'Anchorman.'\"",
      "Once they started pitching the new script, Apatow said some people had their doubts about whether Ferrell could play the lead.",
      "It wasn't until Steven Spielberg stepped in that Ferrell was able to secure his role as legendary anchor Ron Burgundy.",
      "At the time, Ferrell was getting a lot of attention for his role as Frank in \"Old School.\" Apatow recalled the comedic frat movie and said it was \"hysterical.\"",
      "\"But DreamWorks had just put us in turnaround, which means they weren\u2019t going to make it,\" he said of \"Anchorman.\"",
      "\"And then one day in a meeting, Steven Spielberg said, 'Old School\u2019s a big hit. What else do we have with Will Ferrell? We should do something else with him.' And they were like, 'Well, we just put it in turnaround.' And he\u2019s like, 'Well, get it back,'\" Apatow said.",
      "Thanks to that decision, \"Anchorman\" was put in production, and in 2004, it hit theaters.",
      "\u201c(Spielberg) was the reason Adam and Will were allowed to make 'Anchorman,\u2019\u201d Apatow said.",
      "Along with Ferrell, the movie featured then-rising comedians like Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Christina Applegate and Steve Carell.",
      "Apatow said Carell specifically always had the movie's staff in tears.",
      "\"If you were on the set of 'Anchorman,' and you were just watching the shoot, there was no one there who wasn\u2019t like, 'Steve Carell is the funniest guy ever,'\" he said.",
      "\"So just one day I\u2019m like, 'Do you have any ideas for yourself as a lead?' And then one day he told me about a sketch he worked on once about a guy who is at a poker game, and they were all talking dirty about sex, and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s lying and hasn\u2019t had sex. And I thought, 'Sadly, I understand that,'\" Apatow laughed. \"I know how to develop that.\"",
      "That movie turned into Carell's breakout film \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin.\"",
      "When asked what advice he would give to people who are trying to get into comedy, Apatow turns to his new book, \"Comedy Nerd: A Lifelong Obsession in Stories and Pictures.\"",
      "\"Part of how I built the book is that I put all the failures in there also. So all the pilots that weren\u2019t picked up, everything that was a bomb. And I talk about how that happened. How did things fall apart? What\u2019s it like when they work? What\u2019s it like when they don\u2019t work?\" he said.",
      "\"So you have to really be strong, and find your voice, and not give up,\" he added. \"I always say, if you give up, it\u2019s not going to work. So, the key is not quitting.\""

      "\"Ironically, this week has been the busiest week since leaving the villa,\" Nic tells TODAY.com. \"I have a marathon to train for, so of course the week of is going to be the busiest.\"",

Not as a costume, but as a statement,\" she said. \"When her husband was assassinated, she refused to change out of her blood-stained clothes, saying, \u2018I want them to see what they\u2019ve done.\u2019 The image of the delicate pink suit splattered with blood is one of the most haunting juxtapositions in modern history.\"",
      "\"Beauty and horror. Poise and devastation. Her decision not to change clothes, even after being encouraged to, was an act of extraordinary bravery,\" Fox continued. \"It was performance, protest, and mourning all at once. A woman weaponizing image and grace to expose brutality. It\u2019s about trauma, power, and how femininity itself is a form of resistance. Long live Jackie O \u2665\ufe0f.\"",

      "The National Archives has kept the pink suit preserved in a climate-controlled vault outside of Washington, per The New York Times.",
      "The suit won't be available for public viewing until the year 2103 as to not \"dishonor the memory of Mrs. Kennedy or President Kennedy, or cause any grief or suffering to members of their family,\" according to a deed of the suit from when it was gifted to the National Archives."

      "My last name is Italian, and I had always wanted to go to Italy, and I\u2019m grateful it happened right after we hugged it out. Visually, the woman that I saw in Italy was a woman hugging everything about where she comes from and who she is. (Someone) who never lost her essence, but really worked on the woman that she wants to be and who she wants to be for the world and her industry and her craft. I\u2019m grateful to see that visually. I needed to see it. And in a place like Italy, in Lake Como, the first thing that I thought was, \"If God wakes up in the morning and opens the window of his bedroom, this is the view.\"",
      "And then we recorded everything in Italy, aesthetically with this woman that you see vulnerability and innocence, but then you also see her strength and her resilience.",
      "The album opens up with a mantra that I wrote with my life coach that repeats, \"I am, I am.\" It\u2019s just one minute. I want people to start the days like that. It's how I start my days.",
      "The interlude was my best friend. I asked him, \u201cIf you could describe the warrior of light, how would you describe her?\u201d",
      "And then it closes with a song that I wrote to my inner child. It begins with my mom and my grandmother singing. So it\u2019s very, very intentional, just a big ball of love.",
      "I think every song has something like \u201cLuna de Miel\u201d (with Rawayana), to me, is the wedding song of the album. \u201cLa de Dios\u201d is the moment to connect with the purest part of your heart, your inner child, and also to connect with God. It\u2019s a reminder in a world that right now is in a lot of chaos.",
      "\u201cAleluya!\u201d tells you, love without fear. \u201cAlma\u201d tells you, look at everything that you\u2019ve gone through. You\u2019ve always had everything and if you lose whatever you have, you\u2019re losing nothing.",
      "\u201cAm\u00e9n Beb\u00e9,\u201d you have a partner and you build something together, a best friend, a boyfriend, a dog, celebrate life. There\u2019s a little bit of everything. I\u2019m just grateful that I have an album that I think you can listen from beginning to end, and it\u2019s gonna be an experience.",
      "I\u2019m excited, happy. This is my first US tour. We\u2019re going to be presenting the album. We\u2019re preparing a very intimate show, which is how I like it. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s gonna be way too long and people are gonna tell me, \u201cYou guys have to leave.\u201d And we\u2019re all gonna be like, \u201cNo!\u201d",
      "I\u2019m excited to see my warriors of light. They\u2019re everything to me. We feed each other and we exchange energy. We elevate each other, and I\u2019m bringing now a work that I put all my heart and soul (into), and I can\u2019t wait for you guys to listen to it."

      "The film tells the story of an evening party hosted by Hedda (played by Tessa Thompson) and her husband George Tesman that quickly turns to chaos.",
      "Hedda, confronted by her former lover, causes an evening of destruction and mayhem for her party guests, before shocking the audience with a cliffhanger ending.",
      "\"The film endings that have really stuck with me are the ones that provoke me to ask more questions, as opposed to give me answers completely,\" Thompson tells TODAY.com.",
      "Here's what happens in the movie, now streaming on Prime Video.",
      "Warning: Spoilers for the movie 'Hedda' ahead.",
      "What happens in \u2018Hedda\u2019?",
      "After getting married, Hedda and George buy a glamorous estate in the English countryside. The couple hosts an evening dinner party to show off and celebrate their new home.",
      "George is an academic and hopes to be hired as a new professor at the local university. Many of the guests of the party are writers and intellectuals who George hopes to impress in order to get the  position. George's main competitor for the job is Eileen Lovborg (Nina Hoss), a female scholar who studies and writes about sexual pleasure, and is also Hedda's former lover.",
      "Eileen arrives at the party with her new lover, Tabitha, and Hedda becomes obsessed with creating chaos. When she is able to get Eileen alone, Hedda confesses that she is still in love with Eileen. Eileen says that she wants to move on with Tabitha, and explains the importance of her new manuscript, which encompasses her life's work.",

      "How is this adaptation of \u2018Hedda\u2019 different from the original play?",
      "In the original play, Eileen is a man named Eilert. Eilert is also  George's academic rival, but he writes about the history and future of civilization in the play.",
      "\"Eilert becoming Eileen was really about wanting to have another woman in the story, another foil to Hedda,\" DaCosta tells TODAY.com. \u201cI really wanted to explore another way that a woman could attempt to find agency and to attain power.\"",
      "The change in Eilert's gender, and the ensuing queer relationship, adds a new perspective to the story.",
      "\"For me it added so much depth to the characters and to their struggles. It added higher stakes for the search that they are on to understand how to attain freedom,\" DaCosta says.",
      "The film is also set in 1950s England, whereas the play is set in Norway in the late 19th century.",
      "How does \u2018Hedda\u2019 end?",
      "Hedda hides in the study with Eileen's stolen manuscript, and begins to burn it in the fire. George walks in and asks Hedda to stop, saying that she is ruining Eileen's life work.",
      "When Eileen believes her manuscript is gone forever and Tabitha has left her, Hedda gives Eileen one of her prized guns so that she can end her own life.",
      "Eileen holds the gun to her chin, debating whether or not to end her own life, but ultimately decides to live. However, when she steps into the foyer, she accidentally shoots herself in the stomach.",
      "Hedda attempts to hide the weapon when she encounters Judge Brack, her friend and former love interest. Brack blocks her and forces himself onto her, before Hedda escapes and begins to run outside. Brack catches up to Hedda and pushes her onto the ground, restraining her in a chokehold. Suddenly, they hear voices coming from towards the house.",
      "Brack releases Hedda and runs off into the trees. Hedda gets up and walks towards the lake, where she fills her pockets with several large rocks and other heavy objects. Hedda begins to walk into the lake, her full pockets weighing her down.",
      "When only her head is left above the water, someone yells from inside the house, calling after Hedda to say that Eileen is still alive. Hedda grins, and then the credits begin to roll.",
      "\"(Hedda) is between life and death potentially, and then she hears this name,\" DaCosta says. \"It makes her pause, and that pause is long enough for that smile.\"",
      "Hedda dies in Ibsen's play but the movie's ending is more open-ended.",
      "Will there be a sequel?",
      "DaCosta and Thompson hope so!",
      "\"We have had people pitch us a bunch of sequels\" DaCosta said. \"I won't say what happens next, but I have thoughts.\""

      "Showcasing more than 5,300 objects from the young king\u2019s tomb, including his iconic death mask and glittering royal regalia, the new section of the vast museum here on the outskirts of Cairo is expected to draw millions of visitors every year.",
      "The galleries, displaying mostly pieces never seen by the public, were officially opened in an elaborate and long-awaited grand opening ceremony on Saturday in front of delegates from more than 70 countries.",
      "On a behind-the-scenes visit to the museum\u2019s Conservation Center earlier this month, general director Hussein Kamal told NBC News that it will be the first time since Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered over a century ago that all the items are stored in one place.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d he said, adding that he was particularly excited by the exhibition featuring King Tut\u2019s armor. The piece made from textiles and leather was \u201cunique throughout ancient Egyptian civilization,\u201d he said.",
      "Kamal said the items, previously held in a storeroom, were painstakingly restored since 2017 by some of the center\u2019s 150 conservators.",
      "\u201cWe tried to reshape it from the original,\u201d he said, adding that it was a challenge because they did not have anything to compare it to and had to depend on \u201cinvestigation and analysis to know the original structure of the armor.\u201d",
      "Believed to have become pharaoh when he was 8 or 9 years old, in around 1334 B.C., Tutankhamun ruled until his death 10 years later. He is believed to have suffered from numerous illnesses and disabilities, including circulatory problems, malaria, bone disease and a club foot.",
      "Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered in November 1922 in the Valley of the Kings by the British archaeologist Howard Carter, undisturbed by grave robbers and almost completely intact, nearly 400 miles south of Egypt\u2019s most famous archeological treasures in Giza.",
      "Now the artifacts recovered from that tomb will sit in the largest museum in the world dedicated to a single civilization \u2014 the Grand Egyptian Museum's grounds cover 117 acres, or the equivalent of 80 football fields, just over a mile north of the Great Pyramids of Giza outside Cairo.",
      "The collection also includes the 4,000-year-old funerary boat, also known as the Cheops ship, of Pharaoh Khufu.",
      "At Saturday's grand opening, attended by a number of European and Arab leaders, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi sought to give the event an international scale, calling on attendees to \"make this museum a platform for dialogue, a destination for knowledge, a forum for humanity, and a beacon for all who love life and believe in the value of humankind.\"",
      "With the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx as their backdrop, actors dressed in ancient Egyptian garb paid tribute to thousands of years of history, as an orchestra played fanfares. Hundreds of drones created a light show in the sky, depicting figures including Tutankhamun and ancient Egyptian gods Isis and Osiris.",
      "While the museum will officially open Tuesday, limited tours have been available since 2023, and the public is allowed access to most of its main galleries since October.",
      "Hassan Allam, CEO of the museum's management company, said daily visitor numbers would surge from 6,000 to 15,000 this week as the doors are opened on the \"out of this world\" Tutankhamun Gallery.",
      "He said running the museum had been a \"challenging and yet wonderful experience,\" describing it as a \"great privilege\" to \"play a small role in Egypt's history, maintaining it, managing it, and hosting Egyptology lovers from across the world.\"",
      "Alongside the Tutankhamun exhibition, the museum holds artifacts from the prehistoric era, dating from 700,000 B.C., to the Roman era of the fourth century A.D., arranged around themes of kingship, society and beliefs.",
      "Statues, sarcophagi and stelae also offer a glimpse into the life of Egypt\u2019s ancient elite and how they prepared themselves for the afterlife.",
      "At the museum\u2019s center sits the six-story Grand Staircase with a view of the pyramids and an atrium containing monuments, pharaonic statues and sarcophagi.",
      "The opening ceremony marks the culmination of a project first announced in 1992. Construction officially began in 2005 and has been hit by repeated delays due to the Arab Spring in the early 2010s and the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Ahmed Ezz, the chairman of Ezz Steel, which provided all of the steel rebar needed for the project, said in an interview this week that the museum not only reflects his country\u2019s past but is \u201calso part of an architectural renaissance of Egypt.\u201d",
      "After a \u201cdifficult decade,\u201d Ezz said he hoped the museum would show that his country was \u201cgoing on a more positive trajectory.\u201d"

      "Trump pressed Xi for a crackdown on fentanyl at a meeting in South Korea on Thursday, the last stop of his three-country Asian tour. The president said he would reduce his fentanyl tariff on China to 10% from 20%, effective immediately, after Xi agreed to intensify China\u2019s efforts to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for the deadly opioid.",
      "American officials say the Chinese government hasn\u2019t done enough to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for fentanyl, which are then processed into the highly addictive opioid in Mexican labs and smuggled across the border to the United States. Though deaths appear to be declining in the U.S., fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have killed hundreds of thousands of Americans in recent years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "China has previously defended its anti-fentanyl efforts and says unrelenting American demand for the drug is to blame for the crisis.",
      "But a State Department report to Congress last month accused the ruling Chinese Communist Party of continuing to \u201csubsidize and otherwise incentivize China-based companies to export synthetic drug precursors, including through tax rebates, monetary grants and awards, and official site visits.\u201d It accused companies controlled by the Communist Party of being \u201ccomplicit in this illicit trade.\u201d",
      "Under pressure from Trump, China made fentanyl a controlled substance in 2019, banning its use outside of medical prescriptions. That slowed the influx of Chinese fentanyl into the U.S., but the \u201cprolific export of chemical precursors and other illicit narcotics remains,\u201d the State Department report said.",
      "Chinese officials rejected that narrative. \u201cChina expresses sympathy for the American people suffering from the fentanyl crisis,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters in Beijing on Wednesday.",
      "But he added that \u201cChina is the country most resolute in drug control, with the most comprehensive policies and the best track record. It is also one of the countries with the largest number of controlled substances and the strictest regulations in the world.\u201d",

      "He derided the \"many statements in the U.S. claiming that the fentanyl crisis originates from China,\" saying that is impossible \"given how strict our controls are.\"",
      "As well as the visit to Humanwell, NBC News gained exclusive access to the National Narcotics Intelligence Center in Beijing, which had been sanctioned by Washington in 2020 but saw those measures lifted three years later during the Biden administration as the two countries agreed to resume cooperation on fentanyl.",
      "There, Chinese security officials said the two sides are again exchanging information on how smugglers alter their tactics.",
      "Fentanyl precursors are \"indeed one of our main concerns because drug synthesis techniques and methods are constantly evolving,\" lab director Hua Zhendong told NBC News.",
      "\"We have not found such processing plants domestically,\" he said, so \"most of the relevant information comes from technical exchanges with U.S. counterparts.\"",
      "Hua said the latest precursor chemicals identified by the U.S. \u201care added to our monitoring list so we can strengthen our attention to these substances.\"",
      "He said that banning all fentanyl products outside medical use in 2019 had \"effectively curbed illegal production and trafficking.\"",
      "U.S. officials say that's not the case. As Washington and Beijing seek common ground on the issue, experts say halting the illicit flow of fentanyl components is easier said than done.",
      "\u201cI think there is an assumption here that if the Chinese really wanted to shut off these precursors, they could do it,\u201d said Michael Swaine, a senior research fellow in the East Asia Program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a Washington-based think tank, speaking ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting.",
      "The problem, he said, is that there is no \u201cset number\u201d of precursors to fentanyl.",
      "\u201cYou don't have a clear list of specific items that you would be able to easily interdict,\u201d Swaine said. \u201cAnd a lot of them, of course, are very dual-use items.\u201d",
      "So while there might be a \u201csymbolic effort\u201d to deal with the fentanyl issue after the Trump-Xi meeting, he said, \u201cI don't think that this is going to go completely away.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa, which made landfall in both Jamaica and Cuba in the last two days, followed what has unfortunately become a familiar pattern for major storms in a warming world.",
      "The most catastrophic storms \u2014 those with the most intense winds and soaking rains \u2014 were once rare, but they are becoming more likely because of climate change. And similarities are emerging among these powerful hurricanes\u2019 behavior and timing, too.",
      "Before Melissa hit Jamaica as a Category 5 monster, it churned over especially warm waters \u2014 as did other hurricanes over the past decade. This allowed it to strengthen at blistering pace, becoming the most powerful of this year\u2019s Atlantic season and tying the record for strongest landfall ever in the Atlantic.",
      "Then the storm slowed to a crawl, giving it more time to dump rain on Jamaica, another hallmark of hurricanes on a warming planet. Melissa\u2019s timing, too, was notable: It formed late in the season \u2014 hurricane activity has typically been thought to peak in early September \u2014 as ocean heat lingered into the fall.",
      "Taken together, this behavior makes Melissa a kind of poster child for the new normal of hurricanes, experts said.",
      "\u201cThese storms aren\u2019t the same storms as a couple decades ago,\u201d said Shel Winkley, a meteorologist at the nonprofit research group Climate Central.",
      "It\u2019s a shift with life-or-death consequences \u2014 one that forecasters and officials in storm-prone areas are now watching closely.",
      "Intensifying in a hurry",
      "One of Melissa\u2019s most eye-opening characteristics is how remarkably fast it intensified. In just 18 hours, it exploded from a tropical storm into a Category 4 Sunday, before reaching Category 5 strength early Monday.",
      "Climate change is increasing the risk of this \u201crapid intensification\u201d pattern, which the National Hurricane Center defines as an increase in sustained wind speeds of at least 35 mph over 24 hours.",
      "In Melissa\u2019s case, Winkley said, unusually warm sea-surface temperatures in the Caribbean and high levels of moisture in the atmosphere caused an \u201cextreme rapid intensification.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten really good at forecasting and understanding when hurricanes are going to make a big boost in intensity, but with Melissa, it even exceeded the best forecast that we can make for it in terms of wind speed,\u201d he said.",
      "Winkley added that the storm passed over Caribbean waters that were 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than usual \u2014 conditions that climate change made up to 700 times more likely.",
      "Two-and-a-half degrees Fahrenheit may not sound like a lot when it comes to a giant hurricane, but small temperature differences can really make a big impact,\u201d Winkley said.",
      "Many other recent storms have undergone rapid intensification. Last year, Hurricane Milton\u2019s wind speed increased by 90 mph in roughly 25 hours, and in 2022 Hurricane Ian went through two rounds of rapid intensification before making landfall in Florida. The list goes on: Hurricanes Idalia in 2023, Ida in 2021 and Harvey in 2017 all underwent rapid intensification, too.",
      "Fewer hurricanes, higher impact",
      "In the past 35 years, the number of hurricanes and tropical cyclones that form annually has been decreasing.",
      "\u201cWe find that the number of hurricanes globally, including typhoons, has gone down significantly since 1990,\u201d said Phil Klotzbach, an atmospheric scientist who studies hurricanes at Colorado State University.",
      "But that overall decrease is largely due to a drop in cyclone activity in the Pacific, Klotzbach said; Atlantic hurricane activity has risen, primarily as a result of a decades-long trend toward La Ni\u00f1a, a seasonal circulation pattern that tends to weaken the high-altitude winds that discourage hurricane formation.",
      "\u201cLa Ni\u00f1a is good for the Atlantic if you like hurricanes,\u201d Klotzbach said.",
      "When hurricanes do develop, they\u2019re more likely to turn into major storms as the seas warm.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase of those reaching Category 4 and 5,\u201d Klotzbach said.",
      "Melissa was the third Category 5 hurricane this year \u2014 the first time in two decades that more than two storms of such power have formed in the same season.",
      "Zachary Handlos, an atmospheric scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said that although warmer seas in the future will be more conducive to hurricanes, a warmer atmosphere will force changes to the high-altitude winds that can prevent or destroy hurricanes. These winds could strengthen in some locations and weaken in others, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a very straightforward answer.\u201d",
      "How these trends will play out remains an active area of research and scientific dispute.",
      "A longer hurricane season",
      "It\u2019s not lost on experts that the strongest hurricane of the season hit just days before Halloween.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re pretty late into the season at this point. Things should be starting to wind down,\u201d said Derrick Herndon, a researcher in the Tropical Cyclone Research Group at the University of Wisconsin.",
      "The Caribbean has always been a hotspot for powerful, late-season hurricanes, but they\u2019re becoming even more likely, Klotzbach said \u2014 he recently submitted research showing the trend for peer review. At the same time, hurricane data in the era of satellite observations (from 1971 to 2022) suggests that hurricane season is beginning earlier in the year, too.",
      "The fall hurricane pattern has been fueled by the long-term trend toward the La Ni\u00f1a pattern, Klotzbach added, which itself is likely the result of a combination of climate change and natural variability.",
      "La Ni\u00f1a weakens high-altitude winds at a time when Caribbean waters are still hot, setting the stage for storms in late October and early November, he said: \u201cIt loads the dice toward these robust hurricanes.\u201d",
      "Hurricane Melissa was exacerbated by warmer-than-usual waters off Jamaica\u2019s southern coast.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to get a really intense hurricane in the Atlantic, it\u2019s going to probably be in this part of the world,\u201d Herndon said.",
      "In the past, such a storm would typically have churned up cold water from below the surface and stifled its own growth, according to Andy Hazelton, a hurricane modeler and associate scientist with the University of Miami\u2019s Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies. But this year, ocean heat is elevated both at the surface and as deep as 200 feet below, he said, so Melissa simply churned up more heat and energy.",
      "Storms are stalling",
      "Just before or after landfall, hurricanes are now more likely to stall and dump immense amounts of rain, according to a study published last year. Other research suggests their forward speed has gotten slower overall, though this remains a topic of debate.",
      "Hurricane Melissa followed the pattern, stalling off the coast of Jamaica as it continued to build intensity. On Tuesday morning, the day of its first landfall, the storm was moving at just around 2 mph. Forecasters expected up to 30 inches of rainfall in parts of Jamaica, which is more than a third of its annual average.",
      "Scientists have not reached a consensus about why some storms are moving more slowly, but some have theorized that it\u2019s because climate change has weakened atmospheric circulation patterns.",
      "Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was a dramatic example of the consequences of such stalling: When it parked over Houston, the storm dropped about 5 feet of rain in some locations. The pattern is particularly problematic because a warmer atmosphere can absorb and deliver more rainfall.",
      "\u201cFor every 1 degree Fahrenheit of warming, the atmosphere can hold onto 4% more moisture,\u201d Winkley said. \u201cWarmer oceans not only boost the intensity of hurricanes, but it allows for more evaporation, so it\u2019s putting more of that rain-making moisture into the atmosphere for these hurricanes to absorb and then unleash.\""

      "Hamas returned the bodies of three hostages to Israel on Sunday, with the International Committee of the Red Cross once again serving as an intermediary, officials said.",
      "Though their identities have not yet been confirmed, Hamas described them as three Israeli soldiers. The office of the Israeli prime minister confirmed bodies were returned and would be taken to the Ministry of Health\u2019s National Center for Forensic Medicine for identification.",
      "\u201cAll the families of the fallen abductees have been informed, and our hearts go out to them at this difficult time,\u201d the office said. \u201cThe effort to return our abductees continues continuously and will not stop until the last abductee is returned.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces urged the public to \u201cact with sensitivity and wait for the official identification.\u201d",
      "The transfer was facilitated by the Red Cross but its team was not involved in recovering the bodies, the humanitarian organization confirmed Sunday.",
      "\"Israeli forensic authorities are responsible for taking all possible measures to further identify the remains of the deceased,\" it said.",
      "Last week, Hamas returned three bodies believed to be those of hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said the bodies did not belong to any of the remaining captives.",
      "The militant group has returned 17 deceased hostages since the ceasefire began on Oct. 10, but the bodies of 11 hostages are believed to still be in Gaza. Israeli officials have pushed Hamas on the speed of the releases, but the group has blamed widespread devastation and the Israeli military presence for complicating the process.",
      "This is among one of the many tensions straining the fragile ceasefire brokered by the U.S. last month. Israel and Hamas have accused each other of breaking the negotiated deal, leading to a round of renewed Israeli strikes last week.",
      "Dr. Khalil Al-Daqran, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza, told NBC News that more than 104 people had been killed in the attacks, including more than 40 children and 20 women.",
      "Israel\u2019s military alleged that the strikes came after Hamas militants attacked its soldiers in Rafah, a southern area of Gaza currently under Israeli control. NBC News could not independently verify the claim. Hamas has denied any involvement in an attack on soldiers."

      "But what\u2019s known as the International Stabilization Force (ISF) is far from a reality, and so far it lacks a detailed mission, confirmed participants and sources of funding. So as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire frays \u2014 Israel carried out airstrikes in Gaza on Tuesday after, it said, Hamas fighters attacked its forces \u2014 several experts questioned its viability in interviews with NBC News.",
      "A key question is who would provide the soldiers required for the force.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re able to take care of it \u2014 very substantial nations,\u201d President Donald Trump said about the force and its future participants aboard Air Force One on Saturday. \u201cAnd we have Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, the three, and then you have many behind them. ...

      "Daniel B. Shapiro, who was the U.S. ambassador to Israel from 2011 to 2017, said that as an idea, the ISF was essential.",

      "NBC News has reached out to embassies of the countries Trump and Rubio most recently mentioned as possible participants \u2014 Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Turkey, Indonesia and Azerbaijan \u2014 and none replied to questions about the ISF.",
      "Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto did say in a speech at the United Nations in September that his country was ready to deploy troops to Gaza.",
      "According to Rubio, one complication is that many of the countries that have said they are willing to send troops, money or both would require a United Nations resolution or an international agreement to authorize their involvement. Israel has long been deeply critical of the role the U.N. plays in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, accusing it of bias and of perpetuating the conflict by maintaining Palestinians in a permanent refugee status.",
      "Hamas, which hasn\u2019t commented on the ISF plans, is also a wild card.",
      "Even in the \u201cbest case scenario,\u201d it would most likely take months to establish any kind of international stabilization force in the enclave, especially if Hamas doesn\u2019t agree to lay down its weapons, said Shapiro, who is a fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council think tank, pointing to a key stipulation of Trump\u2019s plan and a long-standing demand from Israel.",
      "Natan Sachs, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute think tank, said, \u201cIf a security force was charged with disarming [Hamas] and dislodging them as the Trump plan detailed, there is no question to my mind that they would resist that and resist that with force.\u201d",

      "LONDON \u2014 A knife attack on a train that left 11 people injured on Saturday night was not a terrorist incident, police said, as a British national was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.",
      "Of the nine people initially reported to have life-threatening injuries, several cases have since been downgraded and five people have been discharged. One person, a member of London North Eastern Railway (LNER) staff who tried to stop the suspect, remains in life-threatening condition, police said in a Sunday evening update.",
      "\"Detectives have reviewed the CCTV from the train and it is clear his actions were nothing short of heroic and undoubtedly saved many people\u2019s lives,\" police said.",
      "There is \"nothing to suggest that this is a terrorist incident,\u201d Superintendent John Loveless said on Sunday, noting that the suspect, a 32-year-old man, was born in the United Kingdom and remains in custody for questioning. The man is from Peterborough and boarded the train at the Peterborough station, police said.",
      "The identity of the suspect has not yet been released.",
      "Another suspect, a 35-year-old man, was initially arrested after it was reported to officers that he was involved in the incident, police said on Sunday evening. He was released \"with no further action\" after police confirmed that he was not involved in the attack.",

      "Police are working \u201cto establish at pace the full circumstances and the motivations that have led to this incident,\u201d Loveless said.",

      "British Defense Secretary John Healey told NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News earlier Sunday that the nation\u2019s threat level is unchanged at \u201csubstantial,\u201d which means a future terror attack is considered likely.",

    "story": [
      "Two years ago, Derek and DeAnna Huffman were desperate to leave Humble, a suburb of Houston. Their three daughters, they believed, were being brainwashed by public school and mainstream media to support LGBTQ rights. American culture in general no longer offered white people the same opportunities as other races, they said.",
      "The couple yearned to live in a place that shared their \"Christian values\" and where they \"weren't going to be discriminated against\" as white, politically-conservative Christians.",
      "So in March, the Huffmans became the first family to move to a community planned for fellow English-speakers some 30 miles west of Moscow, a project they had been following online run by long-term American expat and former Kremlin-sponsored RT host Tim Kirby. The family is among a small but growing number of Americans who have moved to Russia because the United States, in their opinion, has become too \u201cwoke.\"",
      "The Russian government has welcomed these culture war refugees. In 2024, President Vladimir Putin issued an executive order offering temporary residence to people wanting to move to the country because they rejected \"destructive neoliberal ideological attitudes\" of their home countries.",
      "Around 1,500 of these \u201cideological immigrants,\u201d as they\u2019ve been dubbed by the Russian media, including 127 Americans, have applied for temporary residence in Russia, according to the Main Directorate for Migration Affairs.",
      "\"President Putin is an amazing leader and he\u2019s done great things for Russia,\u201d Derek Huffman, 45, said in a video on his family\u2019s YouTube channel on March 9. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like you see on the news.\u201d The social media platform X \u201cis the only place where you get real information\" about America's own problems, Derek says.",
      "The family initially found a community of Russians and westerners on social media who encouraged their move, with donations from some of their 15,000 YouTube subscribers providing financial support after their arrival in Russia. But when Derek Huffman voluntarily joined the Russian army in May, the family became a lightning rod for broader online scrutiny.",
      "Derek Huffman said he joined the Russian army to expedite the family\u2019s applications for Russian citizenship, as well as to show support for their new homeland.",
      "\u201cAbove and beyond the citizenship, the money, a big part of it for me is about the respect and earning our place here in Russia,\u201d he said on the Huffmans\u2019 YouTube channel on May 26.",
      "But in a follow-up video posted in June, which was subsequently deleted, DeAnna Huffman, 42, told viewers that her husband had been \u201cthrown to the wolves.\u201d NBC News viewed a re-upload of the video.",
      "The couple had hoped Derek Huffman would put previous welding experience to use in the repair battalion and \u201cactually be utilized for his skills,\u201d she said in the video. Instead, she said, he was sent to the front line and struggled to understand his training, which was in Russian.",
      "Pro-Ukrainian commentators, keen to publicize hardship for pro-Russian figures, said on social media that Derek Huffman had been killed. A post on X claiming to have access to drone footage of his death has more than 2 million views. NBC News did not find video to substantiate the claim, and DeAnna Huffman denied the reports.",
      "Derek reappeared in several videos on the family\u2019s YouTube channel uploaded on October 25, celebrating his daughter\u2019s birthday and signing forms to receive his Russian passport.",
      "In one filmed in the family\u2019s neighborhood, he said he was back \u201con vacation\u201d after being deployed for six months, and praised his wife for keeping the family going while he was gone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that I\u2019m still alive and doing what I can to survive, and be of service to Russia. I\u2019m so thankful to all the Russian people who have reached out and helped my family while I\u2019ve been gone,\u201d he said.",
      "Another family, the Hares, also moved from Abilene, Texas, to Russia to shield their three sons from what they say are harmful elements of American culture.",
      "\u201cIt was the promise of a country that would not promote the LGBT agenda. We liked the fact that LGBT is basically outlawed here in official ways,\u201d Leo Hare, 62, told NBC News via a video call from the family\u2019s new home in Ivanovo, Russia.",
      "Russia has strict laws against the \u201cpromotion of nontraditional sexual relationships,\u201d which have in practice banned public displays of LGBTQ identity, including wearing or posting the rainbow flag on social media.",
      "His wife Chantelle Hare, 53, says in a video on the family's own YouTube channel that when they lived the U.S., she and her husband preferred to get their news from Alex Jones and Mike Adams, who are far-right commentators and conspiracy theorists. They felt particularly disillusioned with American politics after the 2020 election, and don\u2019t believe Donald Trump\u2019s return to power will change the country enough to convince them to return.",
      "\u201cWhen we left, it was final. We don\u2019t plan to come back. There will not be anything to come back to,\u201d Chantelle Hare said.",
      "The Hares have endured their share of hardship trying to build a new life in Russia.",
      "They say their initial plan to rent an apartment in Moscow fell through just as they boarded the plane from Texas, and the family spent a bitterly cold winter caring for chickens, horses and rabbits on a farm 70 miles south of Moscow in exchange for free board. At one point, they even had to bring the goats and their newborns inside their cabin to keep the animals from dying.",
      "Leo Hare thought their troubles were over when their landlord\u2019s son offered a generous interest rate for investing their $50,000 nest egg in what he described as a car import business. But they only saw one payment before he stopped sending them money and refused to return their money, Leo Hare said.",
      "The couple went to the police and the local court to file complaints about their lost money and with their concerns that they had been swindled, but say they have received no help from law enforcement officials. NBC News contacted Domodedovo police for comment but did not receive a reply.",
      "The Hares\u2019 sons, 17, 15, and 12, have had difficulty adapting to life in Russia, and the two older boys want to return to America, according to their father. They feel isolated and are disappointed that school is not an option since Russia requires students to pass a language test to study in public schools.",
      "Leo and Chantelle, who ran a carpet cleaning business and a mobile snack business back in the U.S., are now working as English tutors. They have found an apartment in Ivanovo, northeast of Moscow, and \u201care living really comfortably now.\u201d They are currently homeschooling their children. Leo Hare said it probably \u201cwould have been a dealbreaker\u201d if they knew about the school restrictions.",
      "The Hares have not met the Huffmans.",
      "Leo Hare says he never considered joining the army because of his age and safety concerns, and says that Derek Huffman \u201cassumed a little too much\u201d about life in the Russian military.",
      "\"We assumed a lot, too,\" he admitted. \"But we do have a faith in Christ and He is leading us, even though we\u2019ve made mistakes.\""

      "The ad, which Ford ran on TV during the World Series, used genuine but rearranged lines from a speech Reagan gave in 1987 while president.",
      "The ad starts with Reagan saying, \u201cWhen someone says, \u2018Let\u2019s impose tariffs on foreign imports,\u2019 it looks like they\u2019re doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs, and sometimes for a short while it works, but only for a short time.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer,\u201d he continues in the ad. \u201cThen the worst happens: Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down, and millions of people lose their jobs.\u201d",
      "Reagan was a staunch free trade advocate. The purpose of the speech was to explain why \u2014 despite his strong dislike of tariffs \u2014 he had imposed retaliatory import duties on certain Japanese products."

      "Andrew Mountbatten Windsor: No longer a prince, but is he no longer a threat to the British monarchy?",
      "King Charles III's move to banish his brother was largely welcomed Friday by the British media, politicians and royal observers as a necessary, if overdue, intervention.",
      "It\u2019s the fourth attempt by Buckingham Palace to shield itself from the scandal over Andrew's ties to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and the king will be hoping it is the last.",
      "Andrew, who just two weeks ago announced he would relinquish the use of his Duke of York title, has now been formally stripped of it and all his other royal titles, and effectively evicted from the 30-room mansion where he has lived for more than 20 years. It marks a dramatic culmination of a saga that has proved so damaging for the institution as it navigates waning popularity, family feuds and health crises.",
      "\"The king realized that it wasn't enough for him to just say that he would no longer use his title Duke of York, but more action had to be taken,\" NBC News royal contributor Emily Nash said. \"He understood that this was really getting to a point where it was doing very serious damage to the royal family.\"",
      "Nash pointed to just how rare a step Charles has taken \u2014 the last prince to be stripped of his title was punished for fighting for  Germany in World War 1.",
      "Andrew first stepped back from royal duties in 2019 after his disastrous BBC interview in which he cited an inability to sweat that he said contradicted allegations against him, and in 2022, Queen Elizabeth II stripped him of his royal and military patronages.",
      "The move two weeks ago appeared designed to head off fallout from a renewed wave of revelations. But instead they appeared to open the floodgates.",
      "The token rent of \"one peppercorn\u201d that Andrew has reportedly paid on his sprawling Royal Lodge home since funding its renovation two decades ago drew outrage not just from the press, but also in Parliament, as the scandal threatened to break long-standing norms that helped shield the monarchy from public scrutiny.",
      "On Monday, Charles was heckled by a protester who shouted about whether he had \u201casked the police to cover up\u201d for his brother, and how long he had known about Andrew and Epstein.",
      "Then came the statement from Buckingham Palace. \"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,\" it read.",
      "The measures taken by the king received approving coverage Friday in much of the tabloid media, and were welcomed \"warmly\" by a government minister, as well as the leaders of the opposition Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties.",
      "\u201cThe monarchy can see that the PR war has been lost until now, and to win it, they need to show distaste for what Andrew has done and show solidarity with the victims,\u201d said royal historian Andrew Lownie, author of a recent biography of Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson.",
      "Lownie said he believed there may even be grounds for a criminal investigation.",
      "The publication of late Epstein survivor Virginia Roberts Giuffre\u2019s posthumous memoir, which added new detail to her allegations that Andrew had sex with her on at least three occasions, had intensified the pressure on the royals.",
      "Giuffre, with whom Andrew settled a suit in 2022 for an undisclosed amount after she accused him of sexually assaulting her when she was 17 years old, committed suicide in April. Andrew has repeatedly denied having met her and previously denied that a photograph of the two of them is real.",
      "In his statement two weeks ago, Andrew cited \u201cthe continued accusations about me\u201d as a distraction. \u201cAs I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me,\u201d he said.",
      "Charles' expression of solidarity with Epstein's victims, \"stood in total contrast,\" to this, said Craig Prescott, who teaches law at Royal Holloway, University of London, and specializes in the constitutional and political role of the monarchy.",
      "\"That difference speaks volumes,\" he said. \"This is the most drastic move the king could have made.\"",
      "Charles\u2019 order comes with immediate effect and Andrew will be forced to leave Royal Lodge as soon as is practicable. He will move to a property on the royal family\u2019s private estate 140 miles away in Sandringham, though it is understood that Ferguson will not be joining him.",
      "Buckingham Palace said the king\u2019s decision was made with the support of the wider family, including his son and heir, Prince William \u2014 who is widely viewed as supporting a firmer stance on Andrew as he looks ahead to his own reign.",
      "But not everyone is satisfied by Andrew being cast out from the royal family.",
      "\"Being told that you have to live in your own house and being called by your name is not a punishment,\" said Graham Smith, the chief executive of the anti-monarchy campaign group, Republic.",
      "Smith called for a proper investigation into Andrew's ties with Epstein and the role the rest of the family may have played in the scandal.",
      "He added that Republic was pursuing a private prosecution, which could culminate in the public prosecutor taking over the case if there's deemed to be enough merit.",
      "Lownie said Charles may have decided to kick Andrew out now because, \u201cthey\u2019re worried new revelations might come out about his relationship with Epstein.\u201d",
      "But, he added, \u201cThe king has done what he can.\u201d"

      "Britain's Prince Andrew will have his royal titles formally removed and will move out of his home in Windsor, Buckingham Palace said Thursday, as the royal faces growing pressure over his ties to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Buckingham Palace said in a statement that King Charles had \"initiated a formal process to remove the Style, Titles and Honours\" of his younger brother.",
      "\"Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor,\" the palace said, an escalation from measures announced two weeks ago, when it said that Andrew would stop using some of his titles, including the Duke of York.",
      "The palace said that the \"censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,\" adding: \"Their Majesties [King Charles and Queen Camilla] wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.\"",
      "The palace also said that a formal notice had been served for Andrew to leave his home at the Royal Lodge, close to Windsor Castle.",
      "It comes after revelations that Andrew was paying a rent of \"one peppercorn (if demanded) per annum\" on the 30-room mansion owned by the Crown Estate, despite having stepped back from public duties six years ago. The arrangement was revealed in a Freedom of Information Act request by The Times newspaper last week.",
      "The palace said: \"His lease on Royal Lodge has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation.\"",
      "Andrew will move to a property on the royal family's private Sandringham estate, and his daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, will retain their titles, according to the palace.",
      "The Royal Lodge was the home of Elizabeth, King George VI's consort and the mother of Queen Elizabeth II, from 1952 until she died in 2002.",
      "Legal documents published by The Times, not verified by NBC News, indicated that Andrew paid 1 million pounds for the lease when he moved into the property in 2004, also paying 7.5 million pounds for refurbishment works. The palace and Andrew did not previously comment on the reports.",
      "In a statement two weeks ago announcing he would give up his Duke of York title, Andrew cited \u201cthe continued accusations about me\u201d that \u201cdistract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me,\u201d Andrew said.",
      "The storm has only intensified since, with the publication of late Epstein survivor Virginia Roberts Giuffre\u2019s posthumous memoir, detailing allegations against Andrew, last Monday.",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, wrote that she had sex with the prince on three occasions, including an \u201corgy\u201d involving \u201ceight other young girls\u201d who \u201cappeared to be under the age of 18 and didn\u2019t really speak English.\u201d",
      "Andrew reached a legal settlement with Giuffre for an undisclosed amount in February 2022 after she filed a civil case against him in a New York court accusing him of sexually assaulting her when she was 17 years old. He has repeatedly denied having met her and previously denied that a photograph of the two of them is real.",
      "\"Today, an ordinary American girl from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage,\" Giuffre's family said in a statement Thursday after the statement from Buckingham Palace was released. \"Virginia Roberts Giuffre, our sister, a child when she was sexually assaulted by Andrew, never stopped fighting for accountability for what had happened to her and to countless other survivors like her. Today, she declares victory.\""

      "On his three-country tour of Asia, President Donald Trump received a warm welcome from foreign leaders and showcased a diplomatic style rooted in personal rapport and dealmaking, culminating in the trade truce he reached Thursday with Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "Trump appeared to relish his reception from leaders of Asian allies and partners who sought every possible opportunity to flatter and delight him even as their countries are reeling from the impact of his tariffs and other policies.",
      "Putting his arms literally and figuratively around Japan\u2019s newly elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Trump in Tokyo promised a \u201cnew golden age\u201d of U.S.-Japan relations and accepted a gift of cherry blossom trees and a putter that belonged to his friend, the late former Japanese leader Shinzo Abe.",
      "Takaichi was the second Asian leader on this trip to say she would nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize he so highly covets, after Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, whose ceasefire agreement with Thailand was brokered in part by Trump.",
      "In Gyeongju, Trump received a large golden crown, a replica of the crown of the ancient Korean kingdom of Silla, from South Korean President Lee Jae Myung. Trump and Lee were pictured in a gift shop at the Gyeongju National Museum, where items on display included a red \u201cUSA\u201d hat, Trump-branded sneakers and a shirt bearing the president\u2019s mug shot.",
      "A fighter jet escort and traditional dancers greeted Trump as he arrived Sunday in Malaysia, the first stop on his trip. After joining Trump in his motorcade, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim cracked a joke about a shared commonality, a reminder of some of the challenges faced by the American president before his election last November.",
      "\u201cI was in prison, but you almost got there,\u201d Ibrahim quipped.",
      "Even Xi, before sitting down with Trump in South Korea for their first meeting since Trump returned to office, told the president that China\u2019s development \u201cgoes hand in hand with your vision to make America great again.\u201d",
      "Trump said the meeting with Xi, which lasted about an hour and 40 minutes, was \u201camazing,\u201d rating it a \u201c12\u201d on a scale of zero to 10.",
      "The warm embrace of Trump during the trip marked a contrast to the months of tense negotiations that preceded it. The administration had pushed ahead with a series of punishing tariffs as part of a broader effort to reset trade relationships.",
      "Rates for key U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, now at 15%, are below those imposed on other countries but still high by historical standards, and have greatly strained ties.",
      "\u201cThe agreement that was signed between the Japanese government and the American government on tariffs is so unbelievably one-sided,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus. \u201cAnd the American side has sort of been trumpeting that fact.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, a South Korean mayor flew to Washington to protest Trump\u2019s tariffs outside the White House, saying 50% levies on steel in particular were pushing his steelmaking hub of Pohang to the brink of collapse.",
      "Pohang is only about 30 minutes from Gyeongju, where Trump met with South Korean officials Wednesday to finalize a trade deal with the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy. Trump said that a trade deal had been \u201cpretty much finalized,\u201d the details of which were later confirmed by a senior South Korean official.",
      "The U.S.-South Korea trade deal comes less than two months after more than 300 South Korean workers were escorted in chains from a Hyundai plant in Georgia during a raid by U.S. immigration officials, a shocking sight that humiliated Koreans.",
      "The image aired continuously on news programs in South Korea, which only weeks earlier had pledged $350 billion in U.S. investment. The workers later returned home without charges to cheers and protests, and a conciliatory message from Trump, who said he wanted foreign companies \u201cto bring their people of expertise\u201d into the country and didn\u2019t want to \u201cfrighten off\u201d investment.",
      "Leaders this week signaled that they were ready to move past the friction. Takaichi signed framework agreements with the U.S. to secure a supply of rare earths and on nuclear power reactors, and even told Trump that she is considering a purchase of Ford F-150s for government work even though they are widely considered too big for Japanese streets. Trump responded by offering her \u201canything you want.\u201d",
      "Addressing business executives in Gyeongju, Trump reflected on the differences between corporate dealmaking and heads-of-state diplomacy. He said he never believed in the idea of a win-win deal, but has since learned to search for balance.",
      "\u201cIt really is a little bit different than you\u2019re doing a business deal, and you want to just rip their hearts out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut when you have nations, it\u2019s a little bit different. You\u2019ve got to all balance out a little bit.\u201d",
      "The president, who has long touted his negotiating acumen from the business world, spent the week emphasizing stronger partnerships and better balance in U.S. trade relationships.",
      "He said after meeting with Xi that he was lowering fentanyl-related tariffs to 10% from 20% in exchange for greater efforts by China to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for the deadly opioid. The two leaders also reached an agreement to delay Chinese export curbs on strategically crucial rare earth materials.",
      "Trump \u201cseems to have an affinity for President Xi, and I think that he seems to think of Xi not as an avatar of imperial ambition, but rather as the head of an impressive rival business company,\u201d said Ali Wyne, an adviser on U.S.-China relations at the International Crisis Group.",
      "Trump mused over how fast it had all come together.",
      "\u201cCan you believe it? One year ago, I was campaigning to win. Can you imagine that?\u201d Trump said in South Korea this week. \u201cHere I am president. We\u2019ve done so many different things, economically, militarily, peace-wise. You know \u2014 peace through strength.\u201d"

      "Trump said he was lowering fentanyl tariffs on China to 10% from 20%, effective immediately. He said that would bring the total effective tariff rate on Chinese imports to 47% from 57%.",
      "Trump said he trusts Xi will \u201cwork very hard\u201d to stop the illicit flow of fentanyl precursors, the chemicals used to make the deadly opioid, from China to other countries. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see a big difference,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. officials say China has not done enough to stop the illegal export of the precursor ingredients, which are processed into fentanyl in Mexican labs and then smuggled into the United States.",
      "China has rejected the accusations, calling its anti-fentanyl efforts the \u201cmost relentless\u201d in the world.",
      "Rare earth materials",
      "A key issue in U.S.-China trade negotiations has been rare earth materials, which are crucial for making magnets that go in everything from turbines to electric vehicles.",
      "China, which has a near-monopoly on the global supply, rattled automakers around the world when it imposed strict export controls on the materials, saying it was trying to snuff out their military use, and it has since used them as a powerful bargaining chip in trade talks.",
      "Trump said Xi had agreed to a one-year reprieve on the curbs that is likely to be \u201croutinely extended.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll of the rare earth has been settled, and that\u2019s for the world,\u201d he said. A White House official standing alongside him said Trump and Xi had come to \u201can understanding\u201d and that China is \u201cnot going to impose the rare earth controls that they proposed.\u201d",
      "Analysts say even though the United States is pushing to reduce its reliance on China for the materials \u2014 with Trump signing critical minerals agreements with Thailand, Malaysia and Japan on this trip \u2014 it will be a while before that happens.",
      "\u201cBuilding new mines and, especially, expanding processing capacity \u2014 which is the real bottleneck \u2014 requires years of sustained effort and substantial investment,\u201d Patrik Andersson, an analyst at the Swedish National China Centre at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, told NBC News.",
      "Soybeans",
      "Trump said China, which resumed purchases of U.S. soybeans ahead of the meeting after having boycotted them for months, would purchase \u201clarge, tremendous amounts of soybeans and other farm products.\u201d",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said China would buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans from the United States between now and January as part of an agreement to purchase 25 million metric tons annually for three years.",
      "The halt in purchases from China, the biggest market for U.S. soybeans, has been a major pain point for American farmers, who have been pressing the Trump administration to resolve the issue.",
      "China had not purchased any U.S. soybeans since May, sourcing instead from South American countries such as Argentina and Brazil.",
      "\"Our great soybean farmers, who the Chinese used as political pawns, that\u2019s off the table, and they should prosper in the years to come,\u201d Bessent said in an interview on Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cMornings with Maria.\u201d",
      "Ukraine",
      "Trump has long vowed to broker an end to the war in Ukraine, but after having faced resistance from Russia, he has turned to the Kremlin\u2019s close partners for help: India and China.",
      "The United States and China will \u201cwork together\u201d on ending the war between Russia and Ukraine, Trump said, adding, \u201cUkraine came up very strongly; we talked about it for a long time.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re both going to work together to see if we can get something done,\u201d he said.",
      "Taiwan and Nvidia",
      "Asked about Taiwan, Trump told reporters that he and Xi didn\u2019t talk about the Beijing-claimed island democracy during their meeting. \u201cTaiwan never came up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was not discussed, actually.\u201d",
      "When it came to the American artificial intelligence giant Nvidia, which on Wednesday became the first company to be worth $5 trillion, Trump said there was no discussion as to whether the United States would further relax its export curbs to allow the export of Nvidia\u2019s latest chips, called Blackwell.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about Blackwell chips,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The United States allows limited exports of the older H20 GPU chips, which are a modified version specially designed for the Chinese market.",
      "TikTok",
      "Trump did not address the proposed TikTok deal between the United States and China after the meeting, but it appears China approved it during Trump\u2019s Asia trip.",
      "Under a U.S. law that was passed last year based on national security concerns, the popular Chinese-owned app must sell its U.S. operations to a U.S. owner.",
      "Earlier in the week, Bessent said a TikTok deal might be finalized during the meeting between Trump and Xi. After the meeting, Bessent told Fox Business Network that China had approved a deal during talks in Kuala Lumpur and that other finalizations for the deal would occur over the next weeks and months.",
      "After the meeting, the spokesperson for China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said in a statement that the country agreed \u201cto work with the U.S. to properly resolve issues related to TikTok,\u201d according to a translation."

      "GYEONGJU, South Korea \u2014 President Donald Trump said Thursday after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping that he was lowering tariffs in exchange for a crackdown on fentanyl and that he would visit China in April.",
      "Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on his way back to Washington, Trump said he would reduce his fentanyl tariff on China to 10% from 20%, effective immediately, after Xi agreed to intensify China\u2019s efforts to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for the deadly opioid.",
      "He said his meeting with Xi was \u201camazing,\u201d rating it a \u201c12\u201d on a scale of one to 10, and said that with few major obstacles remaining, a sweeping trade deal would soon be ready.",
      "Trump said he would visit China in April, and that Xi would visit the United States \u201csome time after that,\u201d either at Mar-a-Lago or in Washington.",
      "Xi told Trump that the U.S. and China should maintain \u201ccommunication at all levels\u201d to avoid a \u201cvicious cycle of retaliation.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrade should remain the ballast and propeller of China-U.S. relations, not a stumbling block or source of conflict,\u201d Xi said according to a readout released by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "The meeting in South Korea between the two leaders, their first since Trump returned to the White House, lasted about an hour and 40 minutes and was the climax of Trump\u2019s three-country Asia tour.",
      "Some issues were not addressed at all, Trump said, including the status of Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "Ahead of the meeting, some White House aides had worried that Trump might shift long-standing U.S. policy on the island in exchange for concessions from China, NBC News reported earlier this week.",
      "Before the meeting, Trump called Xi a longtime friend and \u201ctough negotiator.\u201d His Chinese counterpart acknowledged \u201cfrictions\u201d between the world\u2019s two biggest economies, saying that \u201cgiven our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye.\u201d",
      "Other tariffs remain, a White House official said.",
      "Earlier in the week, Bessent said a TikTok deal may be finalized during the meeting between Trump and Xi. Trump didn't mention a deal on the popular Chinese-owned app, whose U.S. operations are required to be sold to a U.S. owner under a law that was passed last year based on national security concerns. But Bessent told Fox Business Network after the meeting that China had approved a deal during talks in Kuala Lumpur, and that other finalizations for the deal would occur over the next weeks and months.",
      "After the meeting, the spokesperson for China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that the country agreed \u201cto work with the US to properly resolve issues related to TikTok,\u201d according to a translation.",
      "Both Trump and Xi wanted the optics and tactical aspect of this meeting to go well, a person familiar with the planning said beforehand.",
      "Still, Trump is continuing a long-standing practice of meeting with allies before Beijing, which former Assistant Secretary of State Dave Stilwell said indicates that the U.S. is not going to trade its alliance commitments for a deal with China.",
      "During Trump\u2019s five-day trip to Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, he signed agreements with all three countries, as well as Thailand and Cambodia; made new foreign investment announcements; and proclaimed that tariff leverage can drive warring parties to stand down.",
      "Reflecting on his approach, Trump said going against the grain can sometimes deliver results.",
      "\u201cOftentimes you\u2019ll go the opposite way of almost everybody, and you\u2019ll be the one that\u2019s right, and the others will be the one that\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said in Gyeongju, South Korea, offering a peek into his thinking. \u201cThat\u2019s where you have your greatest successes.\u201d",
      "Miles Yu, a former State Department adviser on China, said the U.S. and Beijing are \u201csizing each other out\u201d with trade now a key battleground issue. Washington is pushing for concrete steps on fentanyl, market access and more, he said, while China \u201cstonewalls and foot-drags\u201d and offers only broad \u201cframeworks.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the root cause of the five rounds of futile negotiations so far with China without a breakthrough,\u201d Yu said, adding that the administration is trying to shift China\u2019s approach by rallying its neighbors, a strategy that he said \u201cmay or may not work.\u201d",
      "After talks with Chinese counterparts in Malaysia last weekend, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said negotiators had shaped a framework for Trump and Xi to consider that spanned tariffs, trade, fentanyl, rare earths and \u201csubstantial\u201d purchases of U.S. agricultural products.",
      "He credited Trump\u2019s threat of an additional 100% tariff with creating leverage and said he believed that the framework would avoid that outcome and open space for tackling other issues.",
      "Xi said Thursday that the framework agreed to in Malaysia had \u201cprovided the necessary conditions for our meeting today.\u201d",
      "Dan Caldwell, a former senior adviser to U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, said Trump deserved credit for pursuing a pragmatic China policy that maintained what he said was strategic ambiguity while taking steps to restore important military capabilities to deter Chinese aggression.",
      "\u201cA lot of folks wanted to assume that he was going to be reflexively hawkish on China,\u201d Caldwell said of Trump. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t been the case.\u201d",
      "But Caldwell cautioned against expecting a breakthrough in Busan. \u201cI don\u2019t think the overall push hinges on one meeting,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cIdeally, these go well, but the whole thing does not hinge on just one set of talks.\u201d",
      "In other words, the goal was to make enough progress to get to the next date between the two leaders.",
      "Analysts in the region, too, saw limited room for a sweeping agreement this week.",
      "\u201cSome sort of consensus and agreements are very possible,\u201d said Zeng Jinghan, a professor of international relations at the City University of Hong Kong, given that both sides want \u201ca little bit of de-escalation.\u201d",
      "But Trump and Xi were unlikely to reach a comprehensive deal that settles the long-term structural differences between their countries, he said.",
      "The hope instead is for \u201cless aggressive\u201d rhetoric, Zeng said, with both Beijing and Washington likely to come back and declare the meeting a success."

      "Five new suspects have been arrested in connection with the Louvre heist in Paris, officials said Thursday, though the jewels themselves remain missing.",
      "Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau gave the update to the French radio station RTL. She said that the arrests were made Wednesday in a series of police operations in Paris and surrounding areas.",
      "Beccuau did not provide details on their identities but said that one had been tracked using DNA from the scene, leading authorities to suspect that they were part of the four-person team of thieves that carried out the stunning heist.",
      "\u201cThe searches that were conducted during the night didn\u2019t allow us to find the loot,\u201d Beccuau added.",
      "Two others suspected of breaking into the Galerie D\u2019Apollon, both former delivery drivers, have \u201cpartially confessed\u201d to their roles in the crime, Beccuau said a day earlier.",
      "They include an Algerian national, 34, who was unemployed at the time of his arrest but had previously worked as a delivery driver. The second suspect, 39, is a taxi driver and a former delivery driver.",
      "One was arrested trying to board an aircraft to Algeria on Saturday night with a one-way ticket. Both were known to the police for past offenses, Beccuau said.",
      "Paris was rocked by the daylight theft 11 days ago, in which the thieves used a furniture elevator to break into the Louvre, the world\u2019s most famous museum, and steal jewels worth an estimated $102 million that were once worn by French royalty.",
      "French authorities have acknowledged major gaps in the Louvre\u2019s security, with unions blaming staff cuts and funding shortfalls."
