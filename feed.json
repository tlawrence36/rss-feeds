      "TOKYO -- A frog holding a taro-leaf umbrella. A parade of frolicking animals. An Ukiyo-e style Mount Fuji. Giant waves. A Japanese artist who goes by the name Lito carves these delicate designs on fallen leaves, giving life back to them.",
      "The world of Lito\u2019s delicate art, which he began in 2020 and posts on social media almost daily, has won fans from around the world. The leaf art has also given him solace after earlier struggles with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and a purpose in life \u2014 the joy of making people happy with his art.",
      "He enjoys working at night. From a pile of leaves treated with a wrinkle-free chemical, he picks one and places it on a cutting board.",
      "First, he outlines the design on the leaf with a pen in his right hand. Then he takes a design knife in his left hand and starts cutting the leaf carefully. Slowly, the leaf begins to take the shape of a frog carrying an umbrella \u2014 a simple design he demonstrated in a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "More complex, highly intensive work on a single leaf can take more than eight hours to complete.",
      "His leaf-cutting works include titles such as \u201cScrolls of Frolicking Animals,\u201d \u201cLeaf Aquarium,\u201d and \u201cThirty-six Views of Mt. Fuji: The Great Wave off Kanagawa.\u201d Each piece includes his own twists, and often uses animals.",
      "\u201cI would rather finish it in one go when I am focused,\u201d Lito, 38, said. He didn't want to disclose his real name for personal reasons.",
      "Since his childhood, Lito says he has had high levels of concentration and patience. But he had trouble fitting into what was considered the norm at school or at work, despite all his efforts. He struggled to interpret others' feelings and to avoid confrontations.",
      "After years of difficulty, he went to a hospital at age 30 and was told he has ADHD, a diagnosis that he felt explained why he has always done things differently.",
      "He saw no point in forcing himself to do things the same way as other people, and began to adjust his life.",
      "In early 2020, Lito came across the art of leaf cutting. He saw it as the perfect use of his patience and concentration.",
      "Word of his skills has spread across social media, and he has published books on his leaf-cutting work. He holds a near monthly solo exhibition in various places in Japan.",
      "\u201cIf I can make people happy by doing what I am doing, I want to do more. That\u2019s my driving force for what's next,\u201d Lito says."

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 13:38:18 -0500",

    "story": [
      "\"Moana 2\" brought in a tidal wave of moviegoers over Thanksgiving Day weekend.",
      "NEW YORK -- Christmas came early at the box office this year.",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d brought in a tidal wave of moviegoers over the Thanksgiving Day weekend, setting records with $221 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. That, combined with \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II,\u201d made for an unprecedented weekend in cinemas and a confluence of blockbusters more like what\u2019s often found in late December.",
      "Expectations were high for Walt Disney Co.\u2019s \u201cMoana 2,\u201d but the film \u2014 originally planned as a series for Disney+ before it was redirected to the big screen \u2014 blew predictions out of the water. Its five-day opening set a new record for Thanksgiving moviegoing. (The previous best was $125 million for \u201cFrozen 2\u201d in its second week of release in 2019.) \u201cMoana 2\u201d added $165.3 million internationally; with $386 million worldwide, it's the second-best global launch of the year.",
      "At the same time, the sensation of \u201cWicked\u201d showed no signs of slowing down. The Universal Pictures musical brought in $117.5 million over the five-day weekend, pushing its two-week global total to $359.2 million. Not accounting for inflation, \u201cWicked\u201d is now the highest grossing Broadway adaptation over \u201cGrease.\u201d (That 1978 film grossed $190 million, but factoring in inflation would put it past $900 million.)",
      "\u201cGladiator II,\u201d meanwhile, also held well, dipping 44% from its opening weekend. Ridley Scott\u2019s sequel to his Oscar-winning best picture original collected $44 million in its second weekend. While its steep price tag of $250 million will make profitability challenging, \u201cGladiator II\u201d has swiftly gathered $320 million worldwide.",
      "Those three films drove the overall box office to a record $420 million in overall Thanksgiving weekend ticket sales, according to Comscore \u2014 more than $100 million more than ever before. For an industry that has been battered in recent years by the pandemic, work stoppages and the upheaval caused by streaming, it was a triumphant weekend that showed the still-potent power of Hollywood\u2019s blockbuster machine. Before \u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cMoana 2\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d arrived in theaters, ticket sales were running about 25% behind pre-pandemic levels.",
      "Michael O\u2019Leary, president and chief executive of the National Association of Theatre Owners, said the weekend showed what\u2019s possible when \u201call the pieces of the puzzle come together\u201d in compelling big-budget movies with marketing muscle.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very optimistic that this weekend is the start of what we believe is a full-on charge into the future,\u201d he said. \"The remaining quarter of this year looks very promising and then on into 2025 and 2026. We\u2019re hoping next year is the first kind of normal year this industry has had in a long time.\u201d",
      "Like the last time such anticipated movies collided on the release calendar \u2014 2023's much-ballyhooed \u201cBarbenheimer\" \u2014 the movie industry again could see evidence of a rising moviegoing tide lifting all blockbusters. In recent years, studios have typically tried to space out most of their biggest releases. Earlier this fall, \u201cVenom: The Last Dance,\" for example, was the No. 1 film for three straight weeks, despite not being particularly successful.",
      "\u201cFor a long, long time in Hollywood, there\u2019s been a belief that you don\u2019t put big blockbuster movies up against each other,\u201d said O'Leary. \u201cBut the truth of the matter is that competition is good. It\u2019s good for the movies. It\u2019s good for the studios. It\u2019s good for the theater owners. But it\u2019s particularly good for the moviegoing public.\u201d",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d was the nexus of a strategy shift for Disney. When it first began development, it was fashioned as a series for streaming. But when Bob Iger returned as chief executive, he reconsidered the balance between theatrical and streaming. The original \u201cMoana,\" after all, was the most streamed movie on Disney+ in 2023, with the added benefit of $680 million in box office in 2016. Only in February this year did Iger announce the release of \u201cMoana 2,\" with Auli\u2019i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson returning as the voices of Moana and Maui.",
      "\u201cIt just shows you that the big screen and small screen are not adversarial. They can be complementary and additive,\u201d says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cWhoever made that decision to go big screen globally with \u2018Moana 2,' that was one of the greatest decisions ever.\u201d",
      "And it helped lead a resurgence for Walt Disney Co., whose last two animated November releases \u2014 \u201cStrange World\u201d and \u201cWish\u201d \u2014 fizzled in theaters. \u201cMoana 2\u201d may become the third $1 billion-grossing movie for the studio in 2024, along with \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine.\u201d Though reviews for \u201cMoana 2\" have only been 65% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes, audiences gave it an \u201cA-\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d is also part of a major rebound for family moviegoing. According to David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment, family moviegoing in 2024 is going to account for approximately $6.8 billion in ticket sales, roughly the sums of 2022 and 2023, combined.",
      "After such large debuts, \u201cMoana 2\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d are likely to continue to drive moviegoing through December. The only question will be if this year's Christmas movies \u2014 historically a much bigger holiday period for theaters \u2014 can come anywhere near the Thanksgiving lineup. Among the movies aiming for that holiday corridor are Disney's \u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d Paramount's \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\" and Searchlight's \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as a young Bob Dylan.",
      "Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:",

      "His wide-ranging career spanned some of Woody Allen\u2019s best films.",
      "NEW YORK -- The Oscar-winning screenwriter Marshall Brickman, whose wide-ranging career spanned some of Woody Allen 's best films, the Broadway musical \u201cJersey Boys\u201d and a number of Johnny Carson's most beloved sketches, has died. He was 85.",
      "Brickman died Friday in Manhattan, his daughter Sophie Brickman told The New York Times. No cause of death was cited.",
      "Brickman was best known for his extensive collaboration with Allen, beginning with the 1973 film \u201cSleeper.\u201d Together, they co-wrote \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d (1977), \u201cManhattan\" (1979) and \u201cManhattan Murder Mystery\" (1993). The loosely structured script for \u201cAnnie Hall,\u201d in particular, has been hailed as one of the wittiest comedies. It won Brickman and Allen an Oscar for best original screenplay.",
      "In his acceptance speech (Allen skipped the ceremony), Brickman referenced one of the film's many oft-quoted lines, saying: \"I've been out here a week, and I still have guilt when I make a right turn on a red light.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the film is worth anything,\u201d Brickman told Vanity Fair in 2017, \u201cit gives a very particular specific image of what it was like to be alive in New York at that time in that particular social-economic stratum.\u201d",
      "Brickman and Allen had met in the early 1960s, when Allen was breaking through as a stand-up comedian. Brickman was brought on to write jokes for him. At the time, he had been playing banjo for the folk group the Tarriers. In one of the many twists of Brickman's career, it was an album he and his college roommate Eric Weissberg recorded that later made the soundtrack to 1972's \u201cDeliverance,\u201d including \u201cDueling Banjos.\u201d",
      "Brickman, born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was the son of Jewish socialists Abram (who fled Poland during WWII) and Pauline (Wolin) Brickman, who was from New York. They later moved to the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, where Brickman grew up. His start in show business, after graduating from the University of Wisconsin with degrees in science and music, came with the Tarriers. He replaced Alan Arkin in the group.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons I was asked to join was because they needed somebody to front the group and talk while everybody was tuning up,\u201d Brickman told the Writers Guild in 2011. \u201cAnd so I started to develop little jokes and routines and stuff like that.\u201d",
      "By the late \u201860s, Brickman was head writer for Carson\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show.\" There, one of his most enduring contributions were the Carnac the Magnificent sketches, during which Carson played a \u201cmystic from the East\u201d who could divine answers to unseen questions. Brickman\u2019s other TV stints included \u201cCandid Camera,\u201d \u201cThe Dick Cavett Show\u201d and \u201cThe Muppet Show.\u201d",
      "When Brickman and Allen began writing together, they found a natural chemistry, with Brickman playing a supporting role to Allen's semi-autobiographical material.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t write scenes together. I think that\u2019s the death for any collaboration,\u201d Brickman told the Writers Guild. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any such thing really as an equal collaboration. I think that in any collaboration, one person, one personality, one point of view has to dominate.\"",
      "Brickman wrote and directed the 1980 film \u201cSimon,\u201d starring Arkin as a psychology professor brainwashed into believing he's from outer space. He also directed 1983's \u201cLovesick,\" with Alec Guinness as the ghost of Sigmund Freud, and 1986's \u201cThe Manhattan Project,\u201d about a high schooler who builds a nuclear weapon for a school project.",
      "With Rick Elice penning the music, Brickman wrote the Broadway musical \u201cJersey Boys,\u201d about the 1960s rock group The Four Seasons. It ran on Broadway for 12 years beginning in 2005. He and Elice also wrote the 2010 musical \u201cThe Addams Family.\u201d",
      "Brickman is survived by his wife, Nina, daughters Sophie and Jessica, and five grandchildren.",

      "\u201cFirst Reformed\u201d fans flocked to the sold-out denim hat featured in Paul Schrader's 2017 film about a pastor's descent into despair over the environment. The J. Hannah gold locket inspired by Sofia Coppola's \u201cPriscilla\u201d (2023) is still on the market for $1,480.",
      "One catalyst in the trend\u2019s rise can be traced to 2018, when the clothing brand Online Ceramics and A24 joined forces. The brand, founded by artists Elijah Funk and Alix Ross, began with the idea of making bootleg T-shirts inspired by the Grateful Dead. Ross recounted two serendipitous moments in the company\u2019s history: One was watching Pete Davidson wearing a \u201cGood Time\u201d T-shirt on \u201cThe Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon\u201d in 2018.",
      "\u201cI was really jealous that we didn\u2019t make that,\u201d Ross recalled of Davidson\u2019s shirt, adorned with a poster image of Robert Pattinson and co-director Benny Safdie.",
      "The other was knowing, after just seeing the trailer, that Online Ceramics had to make \u201cHereditary\u201d T-shirts \u2014 with or without A24\u2019s permission. Thanks to a mutual friend, they managed to get in touch with the studio just before the film\u2019s release and got A24's stamp of approval.",
      "Hopeful online shoppers today will be disappointed as they scroll through dozens of Online Ceramics x A24 items, inspired by films like \u201cMaXXXine,\u201d \u201cMidsommar\u201d and \u201cLove Lies Bleeding,\u201d only to find each one sold out.",
      "Watching movies \u2014 following a pandemic and the rise of streaming \u2014 has become less of a collective experience in recent years. For many fans, repping their favorite films in public is a way to combat that.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so fun knowing that everyone loves the movie so much to go stand in line for multiple hours. I got here three hours before it even opened and there\u2019s probably, like, 30 people in front of me,\u201d said Sabrina Bratt. \u201cPhysical keepsakes are just so cute and fun.\u201d",
      "For studios, the benefit is multifaceted. Not only is it an additional revenue source in a time of slowed production in Hollywood, it also is a way to engage with the fans that help keep their films in the zeitgeist long after they leave the theater.",
      "\u201cPeople, and particularly younger people, they want to be a part of something. And wearing a shirt for a movie is no different to wearing a shirt for the band that you just went to see. There\u2019s a cachet to it. There\u2019s a value to it. It\u2019s a sign of who I am,\u201d said Neon Chief Marketing Officer Christian Parkes.",
      "Alex Ng is the co-founder and creative director of the Los Angeles-based brand Brain Dead, which also owns a movie theater on Fairfax Avenue. As the film industry continues to evolve out of necessity, Ng contends this intersection of fashion and film will play an increasingly important role in Hollywood.",
      "\u201cWhat people want is like a token or a souvenir. They go to Disneyland and they get a Mickey, right? So, if you go to an arthouse cinema, there\u2019s not a lot of things or souvenirs you could take away from a film that you love,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to connect those pieces. And I think that\u2019s the new era that we\u2019re seeing as a movie-going experience.\u201d",
      "As the demand has grown for merchandise, studios and brands have sought to take advantage for films old and new.",
      "Searchlight Pictures recently released a handful of products to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Alexander Payne\u2019s buddy comedy for oenophiles, \u201cSideways,\u201d including tees, hats and, of course, wine keys.",
      "Brain Dead has done a handful of movie collaborations with studios like A24, Focus Features and, more recently, MUBI and Jordan Peele\u2019s Monkeypaw Productions.",
      "Some products are odes to cult classics, like \u201cBeing John Malkovich\u201d and \u201cThe Big Lebowski,\u201d while others commemorate newer releases. Within days of announcing a limited-edition, long-sleeve shirt for \u201cThe Substance\u201d \u2014 complete with a 30-day trial for MUBI \u2014 Brain Dead had sold out of the product online.",
      "Although Ng bristles at the idea of \u201chype,\u201d arguing it suggests something\u2019s popularity isn\u2019t sincere, he appreciates the ways in which demand for movie merchandise has grown: \u201cI think when we can speak to someone who loves films in that, that\u2019s really cool to me.\u201d",
      "Ross, too, is ambivalent about how popular merch has become.",
      "\u201cI cringe at seeing how many movie companies are trying to rip off what we did,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s just kind of like, \u2018Damn.\u2019 Like I can\u2019t believe it got to this point.\u201d"

      "One art critic compared the new Harry Kane bronze statue to a bulging-jawed comic strip character",
      "LONDON -- One art critic compared the new Harry Kane bronze statue to a bulging-jawed comic strip character.",
      "In Miami, observers say the Dwyane Wade sculpture looks more like actor Laurence Fishburne than the former basketball star. Of course, the infamous Cristiano Ronaldo bust in 2017 gave the chiseled soccer star a chubby face and goofy smile.",
      "A statue of Mohamed Salah in 2018 depicted the Liverpool star with a disproportionately large head. In 2011, a terracotta warrior statue of Andy Murray at a Shanghai tennis tournament drew chuckles, including from the star himself: \u201cI thought I was better looking than that.\"",
      "It wasn't always this way. In classical times, sculptors \u201chad absolutely no interest in depicting people accurately,\u201d explained Lucy Branch, a London-based sculptural conservator.",
      "\u201cWhat they ended up doing quite often, they recycled sculptures so when another athlete became more prominent, they just changed the name on the plaque,\u201d said Branch, host of the \u201cSculpture Vulture\u201d podcast.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this idea now, in this era, that commemorative sculpture should be like portraiture \u2014 it should look exactly like the person they are commemorating. But actually that's a really new idea in sculpture.\"",
      "To avoid pitfalls, here are some tips from sculptors:",
      "London-based sculptor Hywel Pratley studied countless images of Queen Elizabeth II to create a memorial statue in the East Midlands town of Oakham.",
      "\u201cA good portrait sculpture is evidence of 1,000 decisions after 10,000 observations,\u201d Pratley said.",
      "In addition, Yorkshire county sculptor Steve Winterburn recommends getting close with a subject's family and friends to help find characteristics.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want it looking like a Madame Tussauds,\u201d said Winterburn, who created a statue of five Rugby League greats at Wembley Stadium. \u201cIt still needs a bit of art in it, a bit of soul. That\u2019s what makes art really sing.\u201d",
      "The Ronaldo bust depicted the Portugal star smiling crookedly. Likewise, the Salah sculpture features the Egyptian smiling while celebrating a goal. In Miami, Wade's mouth is open in the statue representing the moment the player famously jumped onto a courtside table and yelled \u201cThis is my house.\u201d",
      "It's probably best avoided.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to do teeth looking good in sculpture,\u201d Pratley said.",
      "Start \"by understanding the profile\" before moving on to determine widths from the front view, Pratley said.",
      "\u201cGet the profile right and you will have won half the battle, because then you can have something at least that you can trust,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re lost, you can say, \u2018well I knew where I was then,\u2019 \u2014 and you will get lost as a sculptor in the forms.",
      "\"There\u2019s so many to understand. It\u2019s not two dimensions, it\u2019s three. There\u2019s an exponential opportunity for everything to go wrong. If you\u2019ve got the profile, then you can go forward with more confidence.\u201d",
      "Winterburn tries to make the eyes \u201ccome alive\u201d in his work.",
      "\"The eye is the soul of the person that carries it,\" he said. \u201cIf you look at a lot of public work, I\u2019m not being funny, they\u2019re dead. There\u2019s nothing in them, they\u2019re just featureless, soulless. With a painting, if in doubt, fade it out. With sculpture, there is nowhere to hide.\"",
      "For Pratley, especially when he is working with a live model, \u201cI\u2019m often struck by how the absolute essence of somebody is somewhere between the nostrils and the mouth. The flicker of muscles and the subtle movement of muscles around the mouth is so much you \u2014 it\u2019s so much that person.\u201d",
      "Commemorative sculpture historically has been on plinths, Branch notes.",
      "\u201cPart of the reason for that is because we put our heroes on a pedestal,\" she said. \"The problem is, the lower to the ground the sculpture is, the more scrutiny it\u2019s going to get and the less it can get away with not looking quite right.\u201d",
      "The Kane sculpture features the England captain seated.",
      "\u201cBeing so low, people get to look at it incredibly closely,\u201d Branch said. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to get sculpture to be more with the people, but then that comes with its own problems.\u201d",
      "In the UK, local councils \u2014 like a city council in the US \u2014 might propose a project, fund it and select the sculptor, sometimes with little input from the public and limited vetting of artists.",
      "Branch says there's a better way: Vote on it.",
      "That's what happened for the Emmeline Pankhurst statue in Manchester. A selection committee used an online platform to get public input and Hazel Reeves' proposal to honor the suffragette won.",
      "\u201cIt is a really good balance and check for whether people on the committees have chosen the right sculptor or the right composition for that person who is being commemorated,\u201d Branch said. \u201c(The public) may not necessarily be highly educated about sculpture, but they always tend to know whether the artist has hit the nail on the head.\u201d",

      "Five years after a catastrophic fire reduced Notre Dame Cathedral to a smoldering shell, journalists entered the Gothic masterpiece for a first glimpse of its fully restored interiors during a visit with French President Emmanuel Macron",
      "PARIS -- Five years after a catastrophic fire reduced Notre Dame Cathedral to a smoldering shell, journalists got a first glimpse of the Gothic masterpiece's fully restored interiors during a visit with French President Emmanuel Macron. The transformation is nothing short of breathtaking: light dances across brilliant stone, gilded accents gleam anew, and the iconic monument's majesty is reborn. From Dec. 8, visitors will once again marvel at the cathedral\u2019s blend of history and craftsmanship.",
      "Here\u2019s a reporter\u2019s-eye view:",
      "The nave, once darkened by soot and rubble, now radiates a celestial brilliance. Visitors can see the true color of the cathedral\u2019s walls: a pale Lutetian limestone \u2014 named after the Roman word for Paris, Lutecia \u2014 that glows under sunlight streaming through restored stained-glass windows. The newfound blond hues highlight the soaring Gothic columns and ribbed vaults, creating a bright and uplifting atmosphere. Restorers say it's the first time in centuries the true stone has been exposed in this way.",
      "The polished checkerboard marble floor, glistening underfoot, is so smooth it seems you could glide across it \u2014 communicating with the gilded, golden grille partition of the choir area.",
      "Overhead, incandescent chandeliers hang majestically from each vaulted arch, stretching from west to east, casting a warm, golden light throughout the nave.",
      "The meticulous restoration process involved cleaning over 42,000 square meters of stone \u2014 an area equivalent to roughly six soccer fields \u2014 using innovative latex peels to strip away centuries of grime without causing damage. Conservators uncovered mason marks etched by medieval builders \u2014 intimate traces of the artisans who shaped Notre Dame in the 12th and 13th centuries.",
      "This gleaming transformation is a stark contrast to the wreckage of 2019, when the nave was strewn with charred debris.",
      "The altar in the cathedral\u2019s chancel carries a poignant symbol of the fire\u2019s devastation. Nicolas Coustou\u2019s Piet\u00e0, part of the V\u0153u de Louis XIII ensemble, survived largely unscathed, but molten lead from the blaze fused into the hand of Christ. Restorers chose to preserve this as a subtle, yet powerful, reminder of the tragedy.",
      "Surrounding the altar, the intricate marquetry floor, long hidden under layers of dirt, has been pieced together from fragments recovered after the fire.",
      "Nearby, the polished Cross of Glory, which famously \u2014 literally \u2014 glowed amid the flames, now stands restored to its full brilliance. Framed by the radiant blonde stonework of the nave, the cross serves as a centerpiece of the cathedral\u2019s rebirth.",
      "The grand organ, among the largest and most storied in France, has undergone an intricate revival. Spared from the flames but coated in lead dust, its 8,000 pipes, ranging in size from that of a pen to over 10 meters (33 feet) tall, were painstakingly disassembled, cleaned, and retuned. Over two years, this work was performed with precision in the cathedral\u2019s silent, cavernous interior, where harmonization was achieved entirely by ear.",
      "Now, the organ\u2019s grandeur is unmistakable. Its towering wooden case, marked with carvings left by past craftsmen, gleams under sunlight streaming through restored clerestory windows. Even in silence, it commands awe.",
      "The 29 chapels circling the nave and choir burst with color and detail previously dulled by dirt and neglect. Restorers revealed intricate murals, gilded stars on ceilings, and vibrant motifs originally created under Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s direction. Each chapel tells a unique story through its designs and themes.",
      "The Chapel of Saint Marcel stands out as a masterpiece, its mural of the saint\u2019s relics vividly restored. Visitors are captivated by its radiant colors, producing an effect likened to the Sistine Chapel in Rome \u2014 a visual firework display. In other chapels, traces of 19th-century painters\u2019 color tests, hidden in nooks, provide glimpses into their artistic process.",
      "The transept crossing, where the original spire collapsed, presented one of the restoration\u2019s most formidable challenges. Above, soaring new vaults of Lutetian limestone replicate the medieval originals with remarkable precision.",
      "Beneath the crossing, archaeologists uncovered a trove of history: fragments of Notre Dame\u2019s medieval jub\u00e9, or choir screen, buried in the rubble. These intricately carved stones, some still bearing faint traces of polychrome paint, provide a rare glimpse into the cathedral\u2019s vibrant 13th-century decorative history.",
      "The newly restored roof draw gazes skyward, where medieval timber techniques have been faithfully recreated. Known as \u201cthe forest,\u201d the intricate wooden framework remains hidden beneath the roofline, but glimpses into the rafters reveal the precision of both ancient and modern craftsmanship.",
      "Outside, the spire rises 96 meters, faithfully replicating Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s 19th-century design. Clad in oak and lead, it stands crowned by a gilded rooster containing relics of St. Denis, St. Genevieve, and a fragment of the Crown of Thorns, alongside a scroll listing contributors to the restoration.",
      "The spire also honors the late General Jean-Louis Georgelin, who oversaw the project until his death in 2023. His name is now etched at its base.",
      "There\u2019s more than meets the eye in this restoration. Notre Dame now features unseen state-of-the-art fire prevention systems to guard against future disasters. Thermal cameras monitor the roof, and a fine misting system, designed to extinguish flames at their source, is seamlessly integrated into the structure. Fireproof barriers divide the roof into compartments, preventing flames from spreading.",
      "Reinforced water supply lines can deliver 600 cubic meters (21,188 cubic feet) of water per hour, ensuring the cathedral is better protected than ever before.",

      "Director Garret Price marries interviews with yacht rock artists, current musicians who are fans and the creators of the parody web series who coined the genre's name in 2005.",
      "\u201cThis music is the soundtrack to our lives, whether we want it or not.

      "\u201cI had this film basically done except for the Steely Dan music syncs and it was sitting idle for months and was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know how to tell this story unless I get this music.\u2019 Lo and behold, we finally hear from Donald Fagen,\u201d says Price. \u201cWe have this moment that I don\u2019t even know if I could beat if I had a sit-down interview with him.\u201d",
      "Giving context are musician-comedian Fred Armisen, musician-author Questlove, musicians Thundercat, Brian Robert Jones and Brenda Russell, producer Prince Paul and rock critics and session players.",
      "Questlove opens the door to a less restricted definition of yacht rock, adding artists like Al Jarreau, the Pointer Sisters and George Benson, arguing that the genre isn\u2019t limited to white artists.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with a completely arbitrary genre like this that got made up completely, that\u2019s kind of the beauty of it \u2014 the debates of what is or isn\u2019t,\u201d says Price.",
      "Yacht rock enjoyed a brief window on the charts in the late 1970s and the documentary argues that MTV largely contributed to its demise. Yacht rockers weren't able or willing to transition into a visual space.",
      "Once that window closed, yacht rock became derided \u2014 mocked in everything from \u201c30 Rock\u201d to \u201cFamily Guy.\u201d In \u201cThe 40-Year-Old Virgin,\u201d a character tortures her electronics store co-workers by playing McDonald on a constant loop.",
      "\u201cI feel like these artists have always been kind of punchlines in pop culture,\u201d says Price. \u201cI went in saying, \u2018I want to make a fun film but not make fun of anybody.\u2019\u201d",
      "The label \u201cyacht rock\u201d came much later thanks to a comedy series of short films by J.D. Ryznar and Steve Huey, who currently lead The Yacht or Nyacht Podcast. They were hoping to win a contest with their short films and the name took off.",
      "\u201cThis is kind of a private in-joke that sort of went global all of a sudden,\u201d says Huey. \u201cThe underlying intent is we love this music. We poke some fun at it, but we also want people to hear it for what it is, which is really, really good, solid, well-crafted music.\u201d",
      "Ryznar says the label was inspired by the cover and name of \u201cFull Sail\u201d \u2014 an album from Loggins and Jim Messina \u2014 Cross' hit single \u201cSailing\u201d and the captain-hat wearing half of Captain & Tennille.",
      "\"We just noticed this '70s motif and it seemed to describe the music that was so well-produced so perfectly,\" Ryznar says. \u201cIt\u2019s not called yacht rock because it sounds good on a boat, though it does. It\u2019s called yacht rock because it\u2019s well crafted, like the finest yacht.\u201d",
      "Price, an editor on \u201cDaisey Jones & The Six\u201d who also directed the dark \u201cWoodstock 99: Peace, Love, and Rage,\u201d says his latest work arrives at a great time in the year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect post-Thanksgiving film to watch with your family after what may be a more contentious Thanksgiving this year than others,\u201d says Price. \u201cWe can all just chill out, vibe out, listen to this smooth, polished music and just smile.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is coming back to the White House, but don't expect another \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d or much fire and fury in book publishing in general",
      "NEW YORK -- As she anticipates her estranged uncle's return to the White House, Mary Trump isn't expecting any future book to catch on like such first-term tell-alls as Michael Wolff's million-selling \u201cFire and Fury\u201d or her own blockbuster, \u201cToo Much and Never Enough.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat else is there to learn?\u201d she says. \u201cAnd for people who don't know, the books have been written. It's all really out in the open now.\u201d",
      "For publishers, Donald Trump's presidential years were a time of extraordinary sales in political books, helped in part by Trump's legal threats and angered tweets. According to Circana, which tracks around 85% of the hardcover and paperback market, the genre's sales nearly doubled from 2015 to 2020, from around 5 million copies to around 10 million.",
      "Besides books by Wolff and Trump, other bestsellers included former FBI Director James Comey's \u201cA Higher Loyalty,\u201d former national security adviser John Bolton's \u201cThe Room Where it Happened\u201d and Bob Woodward's \u201cFear.\u201d Meanwhile, sales for dystopian fiction also jumped, led by Margaret Atwood's \u201cA Handmaid's Tale,\u201d which was adapted into an award-winning Hulu series.",
      "But interest has dropped back to 2015 levels since Trump left office, according to Circana, and publishers doubt it will again peak so highly. Readers not only showed little interest in books by or about President Joe Biden and his family \u2014 they even seemed less excited about Trump-related releases. Mary Trump's \u201cWho Could Ever Love You\u201d and Woodward's \u201cWar\u201d were both popular this fall, but neither has matched the sales of their books written during the first Trump administration.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been there many times, with all those books,\u201d HarperCollins publisher Jonathan Burnham says of the various Trump tell-alls. He added that he still sees a market for at least some Trump books \u2014 perhaps analyzing the recent election \u2014 because \u201cthere's a general, serious smart audience, not politically aligned in a hard way,\u201d one that would welcome \u201can intelligent voice.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like the reboot of any hit TV show,\u201d says Eric Nelson, publisher and vice president of Broadside Books, a conservative imprint of HarperCollins that's released books by Jared Kushner, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Trump Cabinet nominees Pete Hegseth and Sen. Marco Rubio. \u201cYou\u2019re not hoping for ratings like last time, just better ratings than the boring show it\u2019s replacing.\u201d",
      "In the days following Trump's victory, \u201cThe Handmaid's Tale\u201d and George Orwell's \u201c1984\u201d returned to bestseller lists, along with more contemporary works such as Timothy Snyder's \u201cOn Tyranny,\" a 2017 bestseller that expanded upon a Facebook post Snyder wrote soon after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. Books appealing to pro-Trump readers also surged, including those written by Cabinet picks \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \u201cThe Real Anthony Fauci\u201d and Hegseth's \u201cThe War on Warriors\u201d \u2014 and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance's \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d his 2016 memoir that's sold hundreds of thousands of copies since Trump selected him as his running mate.",
      "First lady Melania Trump's memoir, \u201cMelania,\u201d came out in October and has been high on Amazon.com bestseller lists for weeks, even as critics found it contained little newsworthy information. According to Circana, it has sold more than 200,000 copies, a figure that does not include books sold directly through her website.",
      "\u201cThe Melania book has done extraordinarily well, better than we thought,\u201d says Barnes & Noble CEO James Daunt. \u201cAfter Election Day, we sold everything we had of it.\u201d",
      "Conservative books have sold steadily over the years, and several publishers \u2014 most recently Hachette Book Group \u2014 have imprints dedicated to those readers. Publishers expect at least some critical books to reach bestseller lists \u2014 if only because of the tradition of the publishing market favoring the party out of power. But the nature of what those books would look like is uncertain. Perhaps a onetime insider will have a falling out with Trump and write a memoir, like Bolton or former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, or maybe some of his planned initiatives, whether mass deportation or the prosecution of his political foes, will lead to investigative works.",
      "A new \u201cFire and Fury\u201d is doubtful, with the originally only possible because Wolff enjoyed extraordinary access, spending months around Trump and his White House staff. Members of the president-elect's current team have already issued a statement saying they have refused to speak with Wolff, calling the author a \u201cknown peddler of fake news who routinely concocts situations, conversations, and conclusions that never happened.\u201d",
      "A publicist for Wolff said he was declining comment.",
      "Woodward, who interviewed Trump at length for the 2020 bestseller \u201cRage,\u201d told The Associated Press that he had written so much about Trump and other presidents that he wasn't sure what he'd take on next. He doesn't rule out another Trump book, but that will depend in part on the president-elect, how \u201cout of control he gets,\u201d Woodward said, and how far he is able to go.",
      "\u201cHe wants to be the imperial president, where he gets to decide everything and no one's going to get in his way,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cHe's run into some brick walls in the past and there may be more brick walls. I don't know what will happen. I'll be watching and doing some reporting, but I'm still undecided.\u201d",
      "___",
      "1. \u201cToo Much and Never Enough,\u201d by Mary Trump: 1,248,212 copies",

      "Thirty years after his death in a high-speed crash viewed by millions around the world, Formula One champion Ayrton Senna\u2019s high-octane life is also about to play out in front of a global audience",
      "SAO PAULO -- Thirty years after his death in a high-speed crash viewed by millions around the world, Formula One champion Ayrton Senna's high-octane life is also about to play out in front of a global audience.",
      "The legendary Brazilian driver \u2014 who was killed when his car hit a concrete wall at the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994 \u2014 is the subject of a six-episode Netflix series that debuts on Nov. 29 and follows him from his early go-kart days to that fatal Sunday afternoon at the Imola track in Italy.",
      "Even three decades after that accident, few F1 figures evoke as much emotion and passion among fans and fellow drivers as Senna, who won three championship titles before his death at the age of 34.",
      "Senna\u2019s complex personality \u2014 he was a saint to his millions of Brazilian fans and a sinner to some critics who deemed his driving style too aggressive \u2014 comes to life through Brazilian actor Gabriel Leone, who embraced the challenge of portraying such a popular figure.",
      "\u201cHe was much more than an F1 driver for us, he became an icon, much beyond his technique and his driving,\u201d Leone told The Associated Press in an interview in Sao Paulo. \u201cHe had this humanity, this honesty. The things he said, his values, it all made him closer to people.\u201d",
      "Senna's life and career had no shortage of made-for-TV moments.",
      "This was a driver who once won a race with his car stuck in sixth gear in front of thousands of raucous fans at the Interlagos track. And who went from fifth position to first in one lap at the 1993 European Grand Prix. And who jumped out of his car during a training session to save the life of a French driver who had crashed.",
      "On the track, his rivalry with French driver Alain Prost was one of the most intense that F1 has ever seen. Off the track, he had some high-profile relationships as well and dated several models, including Elle Macpherson.",
      "\u201cFor me as an actor, the more complex the character is, the better. It is more interesting to build him and live him. And this is quite a character, the biggest hero in Brazil, not only in sport,\u201d Leone said. \u201cAyrton was transcendent, he was more than an F1 driver. That\u2019s a guy who is the hero of great drivers in history, like (Michael) Schumacher and (Lewis) Hamilton.\u201d",
      "Senna won the drivers\u2019 championship in 1988, 1990 and 1991 with the McLaren team and moved to Williams in the year he died as the favorite to lift the title again.",
      "For Leone, though, it was also important to portray him as a person who understood his role as a national hero, who advocated for the poor and proudly waved a Brazilian flag from his cockpit during every victory lap.",
      "\u201cHe was not distant, he was close,\" said Leone, who attended a red carpet premiere in Sao Paulo on Tuesday with several other cast members and director Vicente Amorim. \"That\u2019s for Brazilians and non-Brazilians. It was like this, and it still is like this.\u201d",
      "To many international fans, Senna was simply an exceptional talent who was born to be a driver. Even former rival Martin Brundle, now a TV pundit, once likened Senna's ability to find grip on some corners to a dance seemingly innate to a Brazilian.",
      "\u201cIt is a different kind of samba that I could not do,\u201d Brundle has said.",
      "The Netflix series, however, shows some of the hard work and attention to detail that went into Senna becoming a wet-weather master.",
      "The streaming giant \u2014 which reportedly invested more than $170 million in its production \u2014 also takes a bit of liberty with the truth when it comes to building up the animosity between Senna and one of his other real-life antagonists, Jean-Marie Balestre, the French former president of F1's governing body FIA.",
      "Balestre is often accused by fans of aiding his countryman Prost in his rivalry with Senna, including at the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix by stopping the race early before the Brazilian driver could overtake his French rival in the heavy rain. And at the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix, when Senna was disqualified in a decision that handed the championship title to Prost.",
      "The Netflix series goes a step further by making Balestre (played by Arnaud Viard) the man responsible for Senna also losing a go-kart title as a youngster, long before he even entered F1.",
      "\u201cIf that was true it would be news to every reporter covering Senna\u2019s story over the last decades,\u201d said Ernesto Rodrigues, who wrote a biography on the three-time F1 champion. \u201cYes, Senna had Balestre working against him many times. But Balestre was an autocrat with other drivers, too. It wasn\u2019t exclusive.\u201d",
      "Prost, played by Matt Mella, goes from being a racing foe to a friend after his retirement in the series just like in real life. The friction between the two as McLaren teammates and then in the title-deciding races in the 1989 and 1990 seasons create some of the best moments of the series for racing fans.",
      "Three of the women in Senna\u2019s life also appear in the series.",
      "Scenes with L\u00edlian de Vasconcellos Souza, who married Senna in 1981 and divorced him the next year, help show how the Brazilian was driven to go into F1 early in his career. Xuxa Meneghel, a wildly popular TV host, is featured for a full episode as the driver\u2019s most important girlfriend. Adriane Galisteu, who was the champion\u2019s girlfriend when he died, appears for less than three minutes.",
      "Senna's importance to today's F1 drivers was on full display at the Brazilian Grand Prix this month, when Hamilton \u2014 the British seven-time F1 champion \u2014 drove one of Senna's old cars around the track as part of the tributes marking the 30th anniversary of his death.",
      "\u201cThis is the greatest honor of my life,\u201d Hamilton said on Nov. 3. \u201cI hope I made Senna proud.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Police in Boulder, Colorado, are refuting assertions that there is viable evidence and leads about the 1996 killing of JonBenet Ramsey that they are not pursuing",
      "DENVER -- Amid renewed interest in the killing of JonBenet Ramsey triggered in part by a new Netflix documentary, police in Boulder, Colorado, refuted assertions this week that there is viable evidence and leads about the 1996 killing of the 6-year-old girl that they are not pursuing.",
      "JonBenet Ramsey, who competed in beauty pageants, was found dead in the basement of her family\u2019s home in the college town of Boulder the day after Christmas in 1996. Her body was found several hours after her mother called 911 to say her daughter was missing and a ransom note had been left behind. The details of the crime and video footage of JonBenet competing in pageants propelled the case into one of the highest-profile mysteries in the United States.",
      "The police comments came as part of their annual update on the investigation, a month before the 28th anniversary of JonBenet\u2019s killing. Police said they released it a little earlier because of the increased attention on the case, apparently referring to the three-part Netflix series \u201cCold Case: Who Killed JonBenet Ramsey.\u201d",
      "In a video statement, Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn said the department welcomes news coverage and documentaries about the killing of JonBenet, who would have been 34 this year, as a way to generate possible new leads. He said the department is committed to solving the case but needs to be careful about what it shares about the investigation to protect a possible future prosecution.",
      "\u201cWhat I can tell you though, is we have thoroughly investigated multiple people as suspects throughout the years and we continue to be open-minded about what occurred as we investigate the tips that come into detectives,\" he said.",
      "The Netflix documentary focuses on the mistakes made by police and the \u201cmedia circus\u201d surrounding the case.",
      "JonBenet was bludgeoned and strangled. Her death was ruled a homicide, but nobody was ever prosecuted.",
      "Police were widely criticized for mishandling the early investigation into her death amid speculation that her family was responsible. However, a prosecutor cleared her parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, and brother Burke in 2008 based on new DNA evidence from JonBenet's clothing that pointed to the involvement of an \u201cunexplained third party\u201d in her slaying.",
      "The announcement by former district attorney Mary Lacy came two years after Patsy Ramsey died of cancer. Lacy called the Ramseys \u201cvictims of this crime.\u201d",
      "John Ramsey has continued to speak out for the case to be solved. In 2022, he supported an online petition asking Colorado\u2019s governor to intervene in the investigation by putting an outside agency in charge of DNA testing in the case. In the Netflix documentary, he said he has been advocating for several items that have not been prepared for DNA testing to be tested and for other items to be retested. He said the results should be put through a genealogy database.",
      "In recent years, investigators have identified suspects in unsolved cases by comparing DNA profiles from crime scenes and to DNA testing results shared online by people researching their family trees.",
      "In 2021, police said in their annual update that DNA hadn\u2019t been ruled out to help solve the case, and in 2022 noted that some evidence could be \u201cconsumed\u201d if DNA testing is done on it.",
      "Last year, police said they convened a panel of outside experts to review the investigation to give recommendations and determine if updated technologies or forensic testing might produce new leads. In the latest update, Redfearn said that review had ended but that police continue to work through and evaluate a \u201clengthy list of recommendations\u201d from the panel.",

      "The warm Polynesian spirit and open-sea sense of adventure is back in \u201cMoana 2,\u201d but little of the original\u2019s humor or catchy songs finds its way into this heartfelt but lackluster sequel set three years after the original, writes Associated Press Film...",
      "The warm Polynesian spirit and open-sea sense of adventure is back in \u201cMoana 2,\u201d but little of the original\u2019s humor or catchy songs finds its way into this heartfelt but lackluster sequel set three years after the original.",
      "\u201cMoana 2,\u201d which opens in theaters Wednesday, was originally put into development as a streaming series before it was rerouted the big screen. Curiously, though, it\u2019s not scale or spectacle lacking here. Directors David Derrick Jr., Jason Hand and Dana Ledoux Miller have made an often dazzlingly animated film that is, visually, a step up from 2016\u2019s \u201cMoana.\u201d",
      "But in a story that brings in a literal boatload of new characters, it\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that \u201cMoana 2\u201d got caught in the crosswinds \u2014 too blown between shifting studio imperatives to really find its own way.",
      "That\u2019s a shame because the original \u201cMoana\u201d is about the lightest, most joyful animated movie Disney has made in a decade \u2013 with the possible exception of \u201cEncanto,\u201d which likewise bounced to the buoyant rhythms of songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda. (Miranda is crucially absent in \u201cMoana 2,\u201d though \u201cHamilton\u201d director Thomas Kail is currently developing a live-action \u201cMoana.\u201d)",
      "Photorealistic remakes have been the more dominant providence of the Magic Kingdom in recent years, a trend that\u2019s made more whimsical, imagination-filled animations like \u201cMoana\u201d all the more exceptional. Here was a movie that somehow balanced Pacific Island cultural authenticity with the cartoony delights of a demigod turned accidental shark and Jemaine Clement as a singing, flaunting giant crab. Talk about win win.",
      "Such inventiveness is harder to come by in the perfectly earnest but not especially inspired \u201cMoana.\u201d It opens with a visibly grown Moana (Auli\u2019i Cravalho, returning) engaged in a search for evidence of Pacific Islanders beyond her home island. She is by now a mythic figure, herself, to her people, idolized by youngsters for her courage and for being \u201csuper-besties\u201d with the demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson, also back).",
      "When Moana turns up an artifact with evidence of a two-peaked island, Motufetu, fabled as the once binding center of their ancestors, she sets out to find the cursed island and reunite the disparate people of Oceania. This time, though, Moana is sailing with a more crowded boat.",
      "Some of the old sidekicks \u2014 the rooster Heihei (with noises courtesy of Alan Tudyk) and the pig Pua \u2014 are back. But Moana decides she needs human help this time, and brings along a crew featuring the uber Maui fan Moni (Hual\u0101lai Chung), the engineer Loto (Rose Matefeo) and the curmudgeonly older farmer Kele (David Fane).",
      "Each of these characters has one generic note to play, and while you could see the need to add in more personalities for a series (Moana also now has a cute little sister, voiced by Khaleesi Lambert-Tsuda), they are effectively dead weight in \u201cMoana 2.\u201d",
      "To me, the iconic image of these films is Moana as a solo adventurer, leaning against the wind in her camakau and setting an unknown course. Sure, Maui is inevitably her buddy-comedy partner in adventure, but Moana and her canoe should permit passengers no more than John Wayne did on his horse.",
      "After an encounter with the coconut brigade of the Kakamora, Moana and Maui eventually reunite via a giant clam, where Maui has been trapped by Matangai (Awhimai Fraser, having fun), a mysterious, bat-adorned figure who\u2019s a kind of villain for the movie. She\u2019s more interesting than some recent Disney antagonists and gets probably the best song (\u201cGet Lost\u201d) in a movie that mightily misses Miranda\u2019s touch. (The songs are by Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear.)",
      "That scene and the climactic one, with a sea of tornadoes spinning across stormy waters, are vividly drawn \u2014 enough, surely, to delight younger moviegoers. Coming fast on the heels of \u201cWicked,\u201d one of the most salient selling points of \u201cMoana 2\u201d may be its comparatively nimble running time. At 100 minutes, it\u2019s a full hour shorter than \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "Ironically, \u201cMoana 2\u201d \u2014 beefed up from a would-be series \u2014 has brevity in its favor. But the hopes for \u201cMoana 2\u201d should go beyond mere placeholder. Only a few times does the banter between Moana and Maui really remind you of the fun that characterized the original. In one such moment, Moana corrects Maui after he calls her \u2014 perhaps confusing Moana for many other Disney protagonists \u2014 a princess. His comeback? \u201cWell, a lot of people think you are.\u201d",
      "\u201cMoana 2,\u201d a Walt Disney Co. release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for action/peril. Running time: 100 minutes. Two stars out of four."

      "Female racing pioneer Mary McGee has died at the age of 87",
      "GARDNERVILLE, Nev. -- Mary McGee, a female racing pioneer and subject profiled in an Oscar-contending documentary \u201cMotorcycle Mary,\u201d has died, her family said. She was 87.",
      "\u201cMcGee\u2019s unparalleled achievements in off-road racing and motorcycle racing have inspired generations of athletes that followed in her footsteps,\u201d her family said in a statement.",
      "The family said McGee died of complications from a stroke at her home in Gardnerville, Nevada, on Wednesday, the day before the release of the short documentary \u201cMotorcycle Mary\u201d on ESPN\u2019s YouTube channel. Seven-time Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton was an executive producer on the film, which became available globally on Thursday. Its premiere was at the Tribeca Festival in June.",
      "\u201cMary embodied resilience, grace, and optimism,\u201d McGee\u2019s family wrote on social media. \u201cShe was a historic athlete and a motorsports pioneer who embraced life\u2019s challenges, cared deeply for others, and made time to brighten the lives of those around her. While we are deeply saddened by this loss, we are comforted knowing that her light will continue to shine in everyone she touched.\u201d",
      "McGee had an accomplished racing resume, first in auto racing and later in motorcycle racing. She became the first person \u2014 man or woman \u2014 to complete the grueling Baja 500 off-road race in Mexico solo, which she did in 1975.",
      "The film about her was directed by Haley Watson. Two-time Oscar winner Ben Proudfoot also was an executive producer.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m deeply saddened by this news, but I am comforted to know that Mary was surrounded by friends and family at the time of her passing,\" Watson said. \u201cIn early 2022, I was researching stories when I came across Mary\u2019s. That discovery marked the tipping point into uncovering a much larger and truly incredible career in motorsports and life journey.\u201d",
      "Shortly after her family announced her death, Hamilton paid tribute on his Instagram account: \u201cI\u2019m deeply saddened to hear that Mary McGee, the first woman to road race motorcycles in the U.S and the first person to solo the Baja 500 has passed on,\" Hamilton wrote. \u201cMy condolences to her family and everyone who she\u2019s inspired. Her legacy will live on as a trailblazer in the world of motorsports and beyond.\u201d",
      "Born in Juneau, Alaska, during World War II, McGee and her older brother were sent to Iowa to live with their grandparents. Her brother became a race car driver and encouraged his sister to take up the sport, even though it was almost unprecedented for women at that time.",
      "Racing team owner Vasek Polak persuaded McGee to drive a Porsche Spyder, and she won races. Polak later persuaded her to try motorcycle racing and she also excelled.",
      "Steve McQueen, the late actor and racing enthusiast, was the one who persuaded McGee to take part in the Baja 500.",
      "McGee was the first woman to race motocross in the United States, the first to compete in an international motocross competition and the first to receive sponsorships from major brands.",
      "She was one of the most influential women in the history of motorsports and known for her mentorship of other women in racing.",
      "McGee was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2018.",

    "summary": "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional care homes, worried about abandonment and quality issues",
    "story": [
      "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional care homes, worried about abandonment and quality issues",
      "HONG KONG -- Every Wednesday, retiree Zhang Zhili travels an hour by bus to an education center, drawn by the pulsing rhythms of the African drum she plays there in a classroom filled with fellow retirees whose hands move in unison, every beat lifting her spirits.",
      "Zhang, 71, has found joy and new friends at the \u201celderly university\u201d in Beijing. Besides African drums, the former primary school teacher joins social dance classes, paying about 2,000 yuan ($280) for two courses this semester. Seeing herself standing tall in dance class boosts her confidence. After class, she hangs out with her friends.",
      "\u201cWhen we get old, what do we need?\" she said. \u201cTo love ourselves.\u201d",
      "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional nursing homes, afraid of abandonment by their families and quality issues. That's driving a boom in universities, home care services, and communities catering to older adults. Though some providers struggle to turn a profit, they persist because they see promise in the growing market.",
      "China has a rapidly aging population. Last year, about 297 million people were aged 60 or above, over one-fifth of the population. By 2035, this number is forecast to exceed 400 million, or over 30% of all Chinese.",
      "That's fueling growth in services and products aimed at older adults in what Beijing calls the silver economy, which is projected to balloon from about 7 trillion yuan (about $982 billion) currently to approximately 30 trillion yuan (about $4.2 trillion) in 2035, raising its share in the economy from about 6% to roughly 10%, Hu Zuquan, a researcher at the State Information Center, a public institution affiliated with China's main planning agency, told state media.",
      "Du Peng, dean of the school of population and health at Beijing's Renmin University, said the government is expanding basic care services to all older people who need them, moving beyond its traditional focus on those without family support. Last year, officials compiled a list of basic care services they aim to make available nationwide, including providing ability assessments for those over 65 and care training subsidies for family members of those who are disabled.",
      "Filial piety runs deep in China and most older people prefer aging at home with family after they retire, typically when they're 50 to 60 years old, one of the youngest retirement ages among the world\u2019s major economies. Many help care for their grandchildren, and for some, nursing homes are seen as a kind of abandonment, except in cases of serious disability.",
      "In January, Beijing issued new guidelines calling for expanding home care services and meal deliveries and more clothing, food and tech products tailored for older adults. They include enriching their lives through education.",
      "Home-based services offer a more affordable alternative to nursing homes, alleviating accommodation costs, Du said. Most older Chinese are relatively healthy, and these able people perhaps need richer cultural lives rather than disability care, he said.",
      "Cai Guixia, 60, said she has found fulfillment in African drumming and modeling classes. She thinks she would feel \u201cforsaken\u201d in a conventional nursing home, preferring to hire a domestic helper.",
      "Liu Xiuqin, an owner of two care homes, saw business opportunities in meeting those needs.",
      "She invested more than 800,000 yuan (about $112,000) to open a school in Beijing. Cai and Zhang are among its 150 students attending classes in dance, singing, yoga and modeling training for about 1,000 yuan ($140) per course each semester. Outside the classroom, her team organizes gatherings where students can socialize.",
      "Liu expects to break even in another year and is prepared for the wait. She believes in the market's future, given that the generation born in the 1960s and later values quality of life and health more than their parents did.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about making quick money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt requires persistence.\u201d",
      "Turning a profit is proving challenging for some silver economy businesses.",
      "In the southern city of Guangzhou, Wu Tang co-founded a school last year after his geotechnical investigation and surveying business was hit by the downturn in China\u2019s property market. His school offers courses to help people achieve some of their childhood dreams, but he has yet to cover his costs. He also faces competition from cheaper government-run courses.",
      "And there's Cui Yang, who runs a care station in Beijing, sending helpers zigzagging across the district to provide 30 yuan ($4.20) haircuts at home; accompanying people on hospital visits for 50 yuan ($7) per hour and other services. Even with government subsidies including free rent, Cui is losing money. Without the subsidies, the business would fail, she said.",
      "The struggles aren\u2019t limited to small operators.",
      "Wu Wenjing heads the home care department of a healthcare subsidiary of state-owned financial conglomerate China Everbright Group in southwest China's Chongqing. It has been in the red for 13 straight years, spending 5 million yuan (about $702,000) annually and still losing 1 million (about $140,000) a year, she said.",
      "Wu's business employs 70 workers who visit homes as caregivers, rehabilitation therapists and psychotherapists. The industry is competitive and it has a high turnover rate given the difficulties of working alone in clients\u2019 homes. Wu hopes to break even in five years, and is delighted about the government's efforts to grow the silver economy.",
      "\"The spring of China\u2019s elderly care business has finally come,\u201d she said.",
      "Various companies are looking to grab a slice of this government-backed market. Property developers like Vanke Co. and Sino-Ocean Group and insurance companies such as Taikang Insurance Group have built high-end communities for older adults with amenities such as movie-screening and mahjong rooms and dining services.",
      "China's also working to tackle the problem of dementia, providing cognitive screening tests and training staff who work in memory clinics or as social workers. Several Chinese pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working on drugs targeting Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia.",
      "Some vacant schools and kindergartens -- casualties of the country\u2019s declining birthrate -- are meanwhile being transformed into care facilities for older people.",
      "Government efforts to back the silver economy are paying off: official data showed the country had 410,000 care facilities by June, double the number in 2019.",
      "Still, questions remain about the spending power of many older Chinese.",
      "A 2021 national survey co-conducted by China's Civil Affairs Ministry found older adults had a median annual income of 11,400 yuan ($1,574). In rural areas it was less than half of that. More than one in 10 older Chinese are living in poverty, with living standards much lower in rural areas and western China, according to data from surveys conducted by Peking University.",
      "China's silver economy is still in its infancy, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis Corporate and Investment Banking.",
      "If they lack enough insurance to cover medical and other expenses, many older Chinese must set aside funds for such costs, limiting their spending capacity, he said, and it takes time to build industries producing senior-focused products and people trained to provide such services. Tax incentives and investments in training a skilled workforce would help, he said.",
      "\u201cThere are prospects here, but it seems there's still much that needs to be done,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "A handful of Massachusetts lawmakers are hoping to persuade their colleagues to support a proposal that would make the state the first to adopt a ban meant to eliminate the use of tobacco products over time",
      "BOSTON -- A handful of Massachusetts lawmakers are hoping to persuade their colleagues to support a proposal that would make the state the first to adopt a ban meant to eliminate the use of tobacco products over time.",
      "Other locations have weighed similar \u201cgenerational tobacco bans,\u201d which phase out the use of tobacco products based not just on a person's age but on birth year.",
      "Under a Massachusetts law signed in 2018, the age to buy any tobacco product \u2014 including cigarettes, cigars and e-cigarettes \u2014 was raised to 21. Massachusetts also has banned the sale of all flavored tobacco products in an effort to reduce youth interest in nicotine.",
      "The new proposal, which lawmakers plan to file next year, would expand the effort to curb smoking by gradually ending all sales of nicotine and tobacco products. If the bill is approved, young people not old enough to legally purchase nicotine and tobacco would never be lawfully able to purchase them in Massachusetts, thereby creating no more new users.",
      "It would not apply to marijuana, and the cutoff date would be adjusted when passed to ensure everyone age 21 and above at that time would not be affected.",
      "Brookline, a town of about 63,000 neighboring Boston, was the first municipality in the country to adopt such a ban in 2020. Instead of raising the age for purchasing cigarettes, the bylaw blocks the sale of tobacco to anyone born on or after Jan. 1, 2000. The rule went into effect in 2021.",
      "That would mean at some point in the future no one would be allowed to buy any tobacco products in the town. The measure was challenged, but the state's highest court weighed in earlier this year, upholding the ban.",
      "Other Massachusetts cities and towns already have approved similar tobacco bans, including Malden, Melrose, Reading, Stoneham, Wakefield, and Winchester.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Jason Lewis, one of the backers of the statewide proposal, said the bill would \"save countless lives and create a healthier world for the next generation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe all know the devastating health effects of nicotine and tobacco products, especially on our youth,\" he said.",
      "Nicotine and tobacco products are addictive and can increase the risk of lung cancer, heart disease, stroke and other illnesses.",
      "Nearly 9 out of 10 adults who smoke cigarettes daily first tried smoking by age 18, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which also found that in 2024 about 2 in 5 students who had ever used a tobacco product currently used them.",
      "Peter Brennan, executive director of the New England Convenience Store and Energy Marketers Association, said the proposal would undercut small mom and pop shops that rely on cigarettes for a significant portion of their sales.",
      "It also would put stores located near neighboring states that allow the sale of cigarettes to all adults at a competitive disadvantage.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible idea,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re really just taking away adults\u2019 right to purchase a legal, age-restricted product.\u201d",
      "Taking certain rights away from some adults and not others is likely unconstitutional, he said, adding that other prohibition efforts haven\u2019t worked, like past bans on alcohol, marijuana and gambling.",
      "It's unclear how much support the proposal has in the Legislature.",
      "Massachusetts has taken other steps in recent decades to curb smoking, including raising taxes on cigarettes. Those taxes would presumably be reduced and ultimately eliminated by an incremental statewide smoking ban.",
      "Any reduction in cigarette tax revenue would be more than offset by reduced healthcare costs and other savings, Lewis said.",
      "In 2022, 10.4% of adults in Massachusetts reported smoking cigarettes, according to the state Department of Public Health.",
      "Some California lawmakers have pushed to ban all tobacco sales, filing legislation last year to make it illegal to sell cigarettes and other products to anyone born after Jan. 1, 2007.",
      "In 2022, New Zealand became the first nation to pass a law intended to impose a lifetime ban on young people buying cigarettes by mandating that tobacco can\u2019t ever be sold to anybody born on or after Jan. 1, 2009. The law was later axed.",
      "In the U.K., Prime Minister Rishi Sunak proposed raising the legal age that people in England can buy cigarettes by one year, every year until it is eventually illegal for the whole population. The proposal failed to win approval earlier this year."

      "MILWAUKEE -- The Aurora Health Care Mobile Medical Clinic team waited patiently at a table in the main hallway of the Milwaukee Public Library\u2019s sprawling downtown branch, a blood pressure cuff and mental health questionnaire at the ready as they called out to patrons who paused: \u201cDo you have any questions about your health?\u201d",
      "On this Tuesday afternoon, one man did. His joints were bothering him, he told Carolyn McCarthy, the team\u2019s nurse practitioner. And he knew his bones need calcium to stay strong, so he stopped taking his blood pressure medication, a calcium channel blocker.",
      "McCarthy talked with him at length in simple and specific terms about how the medication worked on his cells, why it was important to take and how it doesn\u2019t affect calcium storage in his bones.",
      "\u201cHopefully, he walked away a little bit more informed,\u201d McCarthy said.",
      "The mobile clinic is one of several health programs offered by libraries around across the U.S. \u2014 from tiny rural town libraries to large urban systems. They offer fitness classes, food pantries, cooking classes, conversations about loneliness and mental health, and even blood pressure monitors that can be checked out just like books.",
      "The public health programs leverage libraries' reputation as sources of reliable information and their ability to reach people beyond formal health care settings. No money, insurance, language skills or ID required, no limits on age. All are welcome.",
      "Libraries are \u201cthe last true public institution,\u201d said Jaime Placht, a health and well-being specialist at the Kansas City Public Library system in Kansas City, Missouri. The system has a full-time social work team. \u201cThe library is a public health space.\u201d",
      "The Kansas City Public Library, along with Milwaukee and several others, is part of the American Heart Association's Libraries with Heart program. Several Kansas City branches have blood pressure stations \u2014 which Placht said have been used 13,000 times \u2014 as well as a take-home blood pressure kits that have been checked out nearly 100 times. The program started there about a year ago.",
      "\u201cWe have patrons that say, \u2018Because I used the blood pressure monitor at the library, I went and saw my physician for the first time in a long time,\u2019\u201d Placht said.",
      "There is no local public health office in Jarrell, Texas, a small town between Austin and Waco. But there is a nonprofit library that can connect patrons to mental health help. It's one of nine rural libraries in central Texas that receives funding from the St. David\u2019s Foundation, the philanthropic arm of one of the state\u2019s largest health systems.",
      "Jarrell Community Library and Resource Center is a place for brave conversations. When a senior card game group turned to a discussion of the best crematorium in town, the library brought in local experts to teach about end-of-life planning, library director Susan Gregurek said.

      "Cucumbers shipped to the U.S. and Canada, and organic eggs sold in 25 Costco stores in five southern U.S. states, were recalled this week for potential salmonella contamination.",
      "The cucumber outbreak sickened 68 people, including 18 who were hospitalized, in 19 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. No one has died. Produce grown in Sonora, Mexico, by Agrotato S.A. may be the culprit, the agency said.",
      "A recall announced Thursday by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was tied to the outbreak. SunFed Produce, based in Arizona, recalled cucumbers sold between Oct. 12 and Nov. 26, the FDA said.",
      "The recall happened after SunFed was told by the FDA that there were associated illnesses reported between Oct. 12 and Nov. 15. People who bought cucumbers during the window should check with the store where they purchased them to see if the produce is part of the recall.",
      "The egg recall involved nearly 11,000 cartons of 24-count organic eggs sold under Costco's Kirkland Signature brand that landed on shelves in Alabama, North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee starting Nov. 22, according to the company\u2019s announcement posted Wednesday on the FDA website.",

      "Missouri's Republican attorney general says he still considers it illegal to provide abortions after fetal viability, despite a newly approved state abortion rights amendment",
      "COLUMBIA, Mo. -- Missouri's Republican attorney general has pledged to enforce some laws restricting abortion despite a new constitutional amendment widely expected to undo the state's near-total ban on the procedure.",
      "In an opinion requested by incoming GOP governor Mike Kehoe, Attorney General Andrew Bailey wrote that his office will continue enforcing a ban on abortion after fetal viability.",
      "There is an exception carved out in the amendment for cases in which a health care provider deems an abortion necessary to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnder the express terms of the amendment, the government may still protect innocent life after viability,\u201d Bailey wrote. \u201cThe statutes thus remain generally enforceable after viability.\u201d",
      "Bailey said his office also will continue to honor a Missouri law requiring parental permission for minors to receive abortions.",
      "Bailey's opinion comes after voters approved a ballot measure this month that enshrines abortion rights in the state constitution while allowing lawmakers to restrict or ban it after fetal viability.",
      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Though there\u2019s no defined time frame, doctors say it is sometime after the 21st week of pregnancy.",
      "The measure\u2019s passage was one of seven victories for abortion rights advocates this past election, while Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota defeated similar constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.",
      "Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again it 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "The Missouri amendment, which is to take effect Dec. 5, does not specifically override any state laws. Instead the measure leaves it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional.",
      "Planned Parenthood affiliates that operate in Missouri sued the day after the election to invalidate the state\u2019s abortion ban and several laws that regulate the care. That lawsuit is still pending.",
      "Allowing restrictions on abortions after viability was a sticking point for some abortion rights supporters in Missouri.",
      "Advocates had worried that failing to include such limits would sink their chances of passing abortion protections. But others cautioned against giving the Republican-controlled Legislature the power to enact regulations that could effectively end access."

      "LONDON -- British lawmakers gave initial approval on Friday to a bill to help terminally ill adults end their lives in England and Wales, following an impassioned debate that saw people sharing personal stories of loss and suffering.",
      "Members of Parliament approved the assisted dying bill by a 330-275 vote, signaling their approval in principle for the bill, which will undergo further scrutiny before it goes to a final vote.",
      "Friday's vote came after hours of debate \u2014 emotional at times \u2014 that touched on issues of ethics, faith and law. There was no braying and shouting that often marks debates in the House of Commons and speeches were considered respectfully and heard in silence.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, we\u2019re not talking about a choice between life or death, we are talking about giving dying people a choice about how to die,\u201d the bill\u2019s main sponsor, Kim Leadbeater, said as she presented the bill to a packed chamber.",
      "Supporters said the law would provide dignity to the dying and prevent suffering, while protecting the vulnerable.",
      "Opponents said the disabled and elderly were at risk of being coerced, directly or indirectly, to end their lives to save money or relieve the burden on family members. Others called for the improvement of palliative care to ease suffering as an alternative.",
      "The proposed bill would allow adults over the age of 18 who are expected to have fewer than six months to live to request and be provided help to end their life, subject to several safeguards.",
      "They would have to be capable of taking the fatal drugs themselves, and two independent doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision. The bill will not apply to Scotland or Northern Ireland.",
      "Backers of the bill told heart-wrenching stories about constituents and family members who suffered in the final months of their lives and dying people who committed suicide in secret because it is currently a crime for anyone to provide assistance.",
      "Danny Kruger, who led the argument against the bill, cautioned lawmakers not to back a \u201cstate suicide service.\" He argued that no amount of safeguards will stop many vulnerable people feeling the pressure to make a request to end their lives.",
      "Kruger voiced his disappointment at the outcome but said there's a chance lawmakers will reject the bill when it comes back for a vote in the next few months. Some of those voting in favor said they only did so to examine the details further and could potentially vote against it in the future.",
      "\u201cI still think we can stop it,\u201d he said.",
      "Although the bill was proposed by Leadbeater, a member of the ruling center-left Labour Party, it was an open vote with alliances formed across the political divide.",
      "The government is widely expected to come up in the next few months with assessments on how assisted dying will be funded and how it would impact the U.K.'s state-funded National Health Service, hospice care and the legal system.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer did not show his hand ahead of the vote, but backed the change. Others in his Cabinet, including Health Secretary Wes Streeting and the Justice Minister Shabana Mahmood, voted against. There were similar divisions across other political parties.",
      "Long-time British campaigner Esther Rantzen, who is terminally ill with lung cancer and played a leading role in advocating the need for a vote on assisted dying, voiced her joy at the \u201cwonderful\u201d outcome and said it will give people an \u201cequal choice.\u201d",
      "When diagnosed with her terminal illness, Rantzen said she would travel to Switzerland to bring an end to her life, where the law allows assisted dying for non-residents.",
      "Hundreds of people on both sides of the issue gathered outside Parliament on a cold but bright day as the debate continued for nearly five hours.",
      "Opponents held signs saying, \u201cKill the bill, not the ill,\u201d and, referring to the National Health Service, \u201cNHS It's cradle to grave. Not 'til old, inconvenient or expensive!\u201d",
      "The group Dignity in Dying, many wearing pink winter hats, led supporters as they clutched signs saying \u201cGiving me choice over my death,\u201d and \u201cYou can't cure death. Please make it fear free.\u201d",
      "Backers of the measure erupted in cheers when the result was announced and hugged each other.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a relief, it\u2019s history, finally we are getting towards having a society that shows love and compassion above the need to just keep people alive,\" said Joshua Cook, 33, who has Huntington\u2019s disease, an incurable neurodegenerative disease.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves health care practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances.",

      "The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on the constitutionality of Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors",
      "WASHINGTON -- Advocates for transgender rights are turning to a conservative-dominated Supreme Court after a presidential election in which Donald Trump and his allies promised to roll back protections for transgender people.",
      "The justices on Wednesday are taking up the issue of gender-affirming care for transgender minors, which has been banned by Tennessee and 25 other Republican-led states.",
      "The fight over whether transgender adolescents can access puberty blockers and hormonal treatments is part of a broader effort to regulate the lives of transgender people, including which sports competitions they can join and which bathrooms they can use.",
      "Trump backed a national ban on such care as part of his 2024 campaign in which he demeaned and mocked transgender people.",
      "In its waning days, the Biden administration, along with families of transgender adolescents, will appeal to the justices to strike down the Tennessee ban as unlawful sex discrimination and protect the constitutional rights of vulnerable Americans.",
      "\u201cThe stakes are high, of course, for transgender adolescents, but also for the parents who are watching their children suffer, who are just trying to do right by their kids,\u201d Chase Strangio, who represents the families at the Supreme Court, said in an interview. Strangio, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, will be the first openly transgender person to argue before the high court.",
      "A lawyer for Tennessee will argue that the \u201clife-altering gender-transition procedures\u201d are risky and unproven and that it\u2019s the state\u2019s role to protect children.",
      "Trump nominated three justices in his first term who pushed the court in a more conservative direction that included the decision in 2022 overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which had protected abortion rights for nearly 50 years.",
      "Yet one of Trump's appointees, Justice Neil Gorsuch, also authored a ruling in 2020 that protected LGBTQ people from discrimination in the workplace under federal civil rights law.",
      "The administration and transgender families both rely on that decision to bolster their arguments.",
      "After Trump takes office on Jan. 20, 2025, it's possible the new administration could weigh in on the case, which is not expected to be decided until the spring.",
      "There are about 300,000 people between age 13 and 17, and 1.3 million adults who identify as transgender in the United States, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. The Williams Institute is a think tank that researches sexual orientation and gender identity demographics to inform laws and public policy decisions.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have adopted a ban similar to the one in Tennessee, and those laws mostly are in effect, despite legal challenges. The Tennessee case is the first time the nation\u2019s top court will consider the constitutionality of the bans.",
      "Sivan Kotler-Berkowitz, a 20-year-old college student in Massachusetts who is transgender, said his life would have been very different if he were just a few years younger and living in one of the states.",
      "\u201cThese bans are denying people the opportunity to live and excel,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThere are thousands of transgender youth across the country that are thriving just like me because we\u2019ve had the love and understanding of our families and because we\u2019ve had access to proper care.\u201d",
      "The bans in Tennessee and elsewhere have put families in the position of deciding whether to travel for ongoing health care, go without or wait until their children turn 18.",
      "Erin Friday, a leader of Our Duty, an international group that supports the bans on gender-affirming care for minors, said the case is going to be as important as Roe v. Wade. She said upholding the Tennessee law would bolster the cases for the laws restricting sports participation and bathroom use.",
      "Among the arguments advanced by defenders of the state laws is that many children who initially say they are transgender eventually change their mind. Friday said her daughter was 11 when she said she was transgender, which Friday attributed to the child having been \u201cindoctrinated\u201d at school. But after receiving psychiatric treatment, her daughter changed her mind, Friday said. If laws like Tennessee\u2019s are struck down, \u201cmore children would be irreversibly harmed and live a life of deep regret,\u201d Friday said in a Supreme Court filing.",
      "Guidelines from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health that were revised in 2022 say evidence of regret about transitioning is scant but also that patients should be told about the possibility during psychological counseling.",
      "Some doctors who work with transgender minors said a state should not come between doctors, their patients and parents. \u201cFrom a medical standpoint, I think it\u2019s really frightening and dangerous to think that legislators could pass a law that basically judges or controls what people could do with a medication based on a diagnosis,\u201d Dr. Susan Lacy of Memphis, Tennessee, who joined with the families in suing the state, said in an interview.",
      "Michelle Quist Ryder, CEO of the American Psychological Foundation, said the laws, if left in place, are damaging for the physical and mental health of transgender people and their supporters. Gender dysphoria \u2014 the unease a person may have when their assigned sex and gender identity don\u2019t match \u2014 has been linked to depression and suicidal thoughts.",
      "\u201cThe more we lessen the sense of safety in this community, trans youth will look out and say, \u2018Who else is going to come after me?\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "There are prominent names in some of the 83 briefs, an unusually high number, filed on both sides of the case. Actors Elliot Page and Nicole Maines, and Sarah McBride of Delaware, who in November became the first openly transgender person to win election to Congress, have joined more than five dozen people in urging the court to strike down the Tennessee law.",

      "A twice-yearly shot that prevents HIV infections will be available at low cost in 120 poor countries",
      "MEXICO CITY -- It\u2019s been called the closest the world has ever come to a vaccine against the AIDS virus.",
      "The twice-yearly shot was 100% effective in preventing HIV infections in a study of women, and results published Wednesday show it worked nearly as well in men.",
      "Drugmaker Gilead said it will allow cheap, generic versions to be sold in 120 poor countries with high HIV rates \u2014 mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. But it has excluded nearly all of Latin America, where rates are far lower but increasing, sparking concern the world is missing a critical opportunity to stop the disease.",
      "\u201cThis is so far superior to any other prevention method we have, that it\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d said Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS. She credited Gilead for developing the drug, but said the world\u2019s ability to stop AIDS hinges on its use in at-risk countries.",
      "In a report issued to mark World AIDS Day on Sunday, UNAIDS said that the number of AIDS death last year \u2014 an estimated 630,000 \u2014 was at its lowest since peaking in 2004, suggesting the world is now at \u201ca historic crossroads\u201d and has a chance to end the epidemic.",
      "The drug called lenacapavir is already sold under the brand name Sunlenca to treat HIV infections in the U.S., Canada, Europe and elsewhere. The company plans to seek authorization soon for Sunlenca to be used for HIV prevention.",
      "While there are other ways to guard against infection, like condoms, daily pills, vaginal rings and bi-monthly shots, experts say the Gilead twice-yearly shots would be particularly useful for marginalized people often fearful of seeking care, including gay men, sex workers and young women.",
      "\u201cIt would be a miracle for these groups because it means they just have to show up twice a year at a clinic and then they\u2019re protected,\u201d said UNAIDS\u2019 Byanyima.",
      "Such was the case for Luis Ruvalcaba, a 32-year-old man in Guadalajara, Mexico, who participated in the latest published study. He said he was afraid to ask for the daily prevention pills provided by the government, fearing he would be discriminated against as a gay man. Because he took part in the study, he'll continue to receive the shots for at least another year.",
      "\u201cIn Latin American countries, there is still a lot of stigma, patients are ashamed to ask for the pills,\u201d said Dr. Alma Minerva P\u00e9rez, who recruited and enrolled a dozen study volunteers at a private research center in Guadalajara.",
      "How widely available the shots will be in Mexico through the country's health care system isn't yet known. Health officials declined to comment on any plans to buy Sunlenca for its citizens; daily pills to prevent HIV were made freely available via the country\u2019s public health system in 2021.",
      "\"If the possibility of using generics has opened, I have faith that Mexico can join,\u201d said P\u00e9rez.",
      "Byanyima said other countries besides Mexico that took part in the research were also excluded from the generics deal, including Brazil, Peru and Argentina. \u201cTo now deny them that drug is unconscionable.\u201d she said.",
      "In a statement, Gilead said it has \u201can ongoing commitment to helping enable access to HIV prevention and treatment options where the need is the greatest.\u201d Among the 120 countries eligible for generic version are 18 mostly African countries that comprise 70% of the world\u2019s HIV burden.",
      "The drugmaker said it is also working on establishing \u201cfast, efficient pathways to reach all people who need or want lenacapavir for HIV prevention.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, 15 advocacy groups in Peru, Argentina, Ecuador, Chile, Guatemala and Colombia wrote to Gilead, asking for generic Sunlenca to be made available in Latin America, citing the \u201calarming\u201d inequity in access to new HIV prevention tools while infection rates were rising.",
      "While countries including Norway, France, Spain and the U.S. have paid more than $40,000 per year for Sunlenca, experts have calculated it could be produced for as little as $40 per treatment once generic production expands to cover 10 million people.",
      "Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Global Health Institute at Duke University, said it will be enormously useful to have Sunlenca available in the hardest-hit countries in Africa and Asia. But he said the rising HIV rates among groups including gay men and transgender populations constituted \u201ca public health emergency\u201d in Latin America.",
      "Hannya Danielle Torres, a 30-year-old trans woman and artist who was in the Sunlenca study in Mexico, said she hoped the government would find a way to provide the shots. \u201cMexico may have some of the richest people in the world but it also has some of the most vulnerable people living in extreme poverty and violence,\u201d Torres said.",
      "Another drugmaker, Viiv Healthcare, also left out most of Latin America when it allowed generics of its HIV prevention shot in about 90 countries. Sold as Apretude, the bi-monthly shots are about 80% to 90% effective in preventing HIV. They cost about $1,500 a year in middle-income countries, beyond what most can afford to pay.",
      "Asia Russell, executive director of the advocacy group Health Gap, said that with more than 1 million new HIV infections globally every year, established prevention methods are not enough. She urged countries like Brazil and Mexico to issue \u201ccompulsory licenses,\u201d a mechanism where countries suspend patents in a health crisis.",
      "It\u2019s a strategy some countries embraced for previous HIV treatments, including in the late 1990s and 2000s when AIDS drugs were first discovered. More recently, Colombia issued its first-ever compulsory license for the key HIV treatment Tivicay in April, without permission from its drugmaker, Viiv.",
      "Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, an AIDS expert at South Africa's University of KwaZulu-Natal, said he had never seen a drug that appeared to be as effective as Sunlenca in preventing HIV.",

      "On the morning of a recent trip to Beirut for her treatment, the family heard a rocket roar and its deafening impact as they left their home. Israeli airstrikes have also hit vehicles along the Damascus-Beirut highway, which Carol and her mother have to cross.",
      "The bombardment hasn\u2019t let up even as hopes grew in recent days that a ceasefire might soon be agreed.",
      "More than war, Hamra fears that Carol will miss chemotherapy.",
      "\u201cHer situation is very tricky \u2014 her cancer can spread to her head,\u201d Hamra said, her eyes filling with tears. Her daughter, diagnosed first with cancer of the lymph nodes and later leukemia, has completed a third of her treatment, with many months still ahead.",
      "While Carol's family remains in their home, many in Lebanon have been displaced by an intensified Israeli bombardment that began in late September. Tens of thousands fled their homes in southern and eastern Lebanon, as well as Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs \u2014 among them were families with children battling cancer.",
      "The Children\u2019s Cancer Center of Lebanon quickly identified each patient\u2019s location to ensure treatments remained uninterrupted, sometimes facilitating them at hospitals closer to the families' new locations, said Zeina El Chami, the center\u2019s fundraising and events executive.",
      "During the first days of the escalation, the center admitted some patients for emergency care and kept them there as it was unsafe to send them home, said Dolly Noun, a pediatric hematologist and oncologist.",
      "\u201cThey had no place to go,\u201d she added. \"We\u2019ve had patients getting admitted for panic attacks. It has not been easy.\u201d",
      "The war has not only deepened the struggles of young patients.",
      "\u201cMany physicians have had to relocate,\u201d Noun said. \u201cI know physicians, who work here, who haven\u2019t seen their parents in like six weeks because the roads are very dangerous.\u201d",
      "Since 2019, Lebanon has been battered by cascading crises \u2014 economic collapse, the devastating Beirut port explosion in 2020, and now a relentless war \u2014 leaving institutions like the cancer center struggling to secure the funds needed to save lives.",
      "\u201cCancer waits for no one,\u201d Chami said. The crises have affected the center\u2019s ability to hold fundraising events in recent years, leaving it in urgent need of donations, she added.",
      "The facility is currently treating more than 400 patients aged from few days to 18 years old, Chami said. It treats around 60% of children with cancer in Lebanon.",
      "For Carol, the war is sometimes a topic of conversation with her friends at the cancer center. Her mother hears her recount hearing the booms and how the house shook.",
      "For others, the moments with their friends in the center's playroom provide a brief escape from the grim reality outside.",
      "Eight-year-old Mohammad Mousawi darts around the playroom, giggling as he hides objects and books for his playmate to find. Too absorbed by the game, he barely answers questions, before the nurse calls him for his weekly chemotherapy treatment.",
      "His family lived in Ghobeiry, a neighborhood in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. Their house was marked for destruction in an Israeli evacuation warning weeks ago, his mother said.",
      "\u201cBut till now, they haven\u2019t struck it,\u201d said his mother, Suzan Mousawi. \u201cThey have hit (buildings) around it \u2014 two behind it and two in front of it.\u201d",
      "The family has relocated three times. They first moved to the mountains, but the bitter cold weakened Mohammad\u2019s already fragile immune system.",
      "Now they\u2019ve settled in Ain el-Rummaneh, not far from their home in the southern Beirut suburbs known as Dahiyeh, which has come under significant bombardment. As the Israeli military widened the radius of its bombardment, some buildings hit were less than 500 meters (yards) from their current home.",
      "The Mousawis have lived their entire lives in Dahiyeh, Suzan Mousawi said, until the war uprooted them. Her parents\u2019 home was bombed. \u201cAll our memories are gone,\u201d she said.",
      "Mohammad has 15 weeks of treatment left, and his family is praying it will be successful. But the war has stolen some of their dreams.",
      "\u201cWhen Mohammad fell ill, we bought a house,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t big, but it was something. I bought him an electric scooter and set up a pool, telling myself we\u2019d take him there once he finishes treatment.\u201d",
      "She fears the house, bought with every penny she had saved, could be lost at any moment.",
      "For some families, this kind of conflict is not new. Asinat Al Lahham, a 9-year-old patient of the cancer center, is a refugee whose family fled Syria.",
      "\u201cWe escaped one war to another,\u201d Asinat\u2019s mother, Fatima, added.",
      "As her father, Aouni, drove home from her chemotherapy treatment weeks ago, an airstrike happened. He cranked up the music in the car, trying to drown out the deafening sound of the attack.",
      "Asinat sat in the back seat, clutching her favorite toy. \u201cI wanted to distract her, to make her hear less of it,\u201d he said.",
      "In the medical ward on a recent day, Asinat sat in a chair hooked to an IV drip, negotiating with her doctor. \u201cJust two or three small pinches,\u201d she pleaded, asking for flavoring for her instant noodles that she is not supposed to have.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel safe \u2026 nowhere is safe \u2026 not Lebanon, not Syria, not Palestine,\u201d Asinat said. \u201cThe sonic booms are scary, but the noodles make it better,\u201d she added with a mischievous grin.",
      "The family has no choice but to stay in Lebanon. Returning to Syria, where their home is gone, would mean giving up Asinat\u2019s treatment.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t leave here,\u201d her mother said. \u201cThis war, her illness \u2026 it\u2019s like there\u2019s no escape.\u201d"

      "LONDON -- British lawmakers are expected to vote Friday on a law proposed to help terminally ill adults end their lives.",
      "The contentious bill would allow adults expected to have fewer than six months to live to request and be provided with help to end their life, subject to safeguards and protections.",
      "Members of Parliament (MPs), who have been holding emotional meetings with constituents and searching their souls, are due to debate the issue that crosses political lines.",
      "Supporters say the law would provide dignity to the dying and prevent unnecessary suffering. Opponents say it would put vulnerable people at risk, fearing that some would be coerced to end their lives and that some elderly or disabled people may opt for death so they don't become a burden.",
      "A vote in favor of the bill would send it to another round of hearings. A vote against it would kill it.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s in the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill and the next steps:",
      "The House of Commons hasn't debated an assisted dying bill since 2015 when a similar measure failed.",
      "Debate is scheduled for five hours and more than 150 members have reportedly signed up to speak. It is expected to be followed by a close vote.",
      "Although the current bill was proposed by a member of the ruling center-left Labour Party, it is an open vote with no pressure from the government on supporting it.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has previously supported assisted dying, said the government will remain neutral and he wouldn't reveal how he would vote. Some members of his cabinet have said they will support the bill, while others are against it.",
      "Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, along with three former Conservative prime ministers \u2014 Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, and Theresa May \u2014 have publicly opposed the bill, though they are no longer in the House of Commons and can't vote. Former Tory Prime Minister David Cameron supports it.",
      "If the bill passes the first stage in the House of Commons, it will face further scrutiny and votes in both Houses of Parliament.",
      "If ultimately approved, any new law is unlikely to come into effect within the next two to three years, supporters say.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, only those over 18 years old in England and Wales and who are expected to die within six months can request assisted dying. They must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and will be required to make two separate declarations about their wish to die.",
      "Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater, who proposed the bill, said the law has robust safeguards built in and contains \u201cthree layers of scrutiny\u201d \u2014 two independent doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision.",
      "Anyone found guilty of pressuring, coercing or dishonestly getting someone to make a declaration that they wish to die will face up to 14 years in prison.",
      "Assisted suicide is currently banned in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Someone who helps a person end their life can be prosecuted and face up to 14 years in prison.",
      "The patient must self-administer the life-ending medication. No doctor or anyone else can give the medication.",
      "No health professional is under any obligation to provide assistance to the patient.",
      "Doctors who do take part would have to be satisfied the person making their declaration to die has done so voluntarily. They also must ensure the person is making an informed choice.",
      "One argument supporting the bill is that wealthy individuals can travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to go there to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones to die.",
      "Esther Rantzen, 84, a broadcaster dying of lung cancer, has urged passage of the bill so others don\u2019t have to do what she plans to do by traveling to Switzerland to legally end her life. She urged all 650 MPs to attend the hearing.",
      "\u201cThis is such a vital life and death issue, one that we the public care desperately about,\u201d Rantzen said in a public letter. \u201cIt is only right that as many MPs as possible listen to the arguments for and against, and make up your own minds, according to your own conscience, your personal thoughts and feelings.\u201d",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves healthcare practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances."

      "President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to lead the National Institutes of Health",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has chosen health economist Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a critic of pandemic lockdowns and vaccine mandates, to lead the National Institutes of Health, the nation's leading medical research agency.",
      "Trump, in a statement Tuesday evening, said Bhattacharya, a 56-year-old physician and professor at Stanford University School of Medicine, will work in cooperation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, \"to direct the Nation\u2019s Medical Research, and to make important discoveries that will improve Health, and save lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cTogether, Jay and RFK Jr. will restore the NIH to a Gold Standard of Medical Research as they examine the underlying causes of, and solutions to, America\u2019s biggest Health challenges, including our Crisis of Chronic Illness and Disease,\" he wrote.",
      "The decision to choose Bhattacharya for the post is yet another reminder of the ongoing impact of the COVID pandemic on the politics on public health.",
      "Bhattacharya was one of three authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 open letter maintaining that lockdowns were causing irreparable harm.",
      "The document \u2014 which came before the availability of COVID-19 vaccines and during the first Trump administration \u2014 promoted \u201cherd immunity,\u201d the idea that people at low risk should live normally while building up immunity to COVID-19 through infection. Protection should focus instead on people at higher risk, the document said.",
      "\u201cI think the lockdowns were the single biggest public health mistake,\u201d Bhattacharya said in March 2021 during a panel discussion convened by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "The Great Barrington Declaration was embraced by some in the first Trump administration, even as it was widely denounced by disease experts. Then- NIH director Dr. Francis Collins called it dangerous and \u201cnot mainstream science.\u201d",
      "His nomination would need to be approved by the Senate.",
      "Trump on Tuesday also announced that Jim O\u2019Neill, a former HHS official and Silicon Valley investor, will serve as deputy secretary of the sprawling agency. Trump said O\u2019Neill \u201cwill oversee all operations and improve Management, Transparency, and Accountability to, Make America Healthy Again,\u201d the president-elect announced.",
      "O\u2019Neill is a longtime associate of billionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel, one of Trump's leading backers from the tech industry. Thiel and O'Neill co-founded Mithril Capital Management, a venture fund that invests in medical technology and other startup companies. O\u2019Neill previously served in HHS under George W. Bush and was considered to head the Food and Drug Administration during Trump's first term. He has expressed disdain for federal regulation, including FDA's approach to regulating emerging drugs and other technologies.",
      "O\u2019Neill also worked on some of Thiel\u2019s signature projects, often reflecting his libertarian philosophy.",
      "He served on the board of a Thiel-funded nonprofit that aimed to develop man-made islands that would float outside U.S. territory, allowing them to experiment with new forms of government. He also helped form and run the Thiel Fellowship, which awards $100,000 to young entrepreneurs who want to leave school to pursue a business or scientific venture.",
      "O\u2019Neill is the only one of Trump\u2019s health picks so far who brings previous experience working inside the HHS bureaucracy. Trump\u2019s previous choices to lead public health agencies \u2014 including Kennedy, Dr. Mehmet Oz for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator and Dr. Marty Makary for FDA commissioner \u2014 have all been Washington outsiders who are vowing to shake up the agencies.",
      "Bhattacharya, who faced restrictions on social media platforms because of his views, was also a plaintiff in Murthy v. Missouri, a Supreme Court case contending that federal officials improperly suppressed conservative views on social media as part of their efforts to combat misinformation. The Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration in that case.",
      "After Elon Musk acquired Twitter in 2022, he invited Bhattacharya to the company's headquarters to learn more about how his views had been restricted on the platform, which Musk renamed X. More recently, Bhattacharya has posted on X about scientists leaving the site and joining the alternative site Bluesky, mocking Bluesky as \"their own little echo chamber.\u201d",
      "Bhattacharya has argued that vaccine mandates that barred unvaccinated people from activities and workplaces undermined Americans' trust in the public health system.",
      "He is a former research fellow at the Hoover Institution and an economist at the RAND Corporation.",
      "The National Institutes of Health falls under HHS, which Trump has nominated Kennedy to oversee. The NIH's $48 billion budget funds medical research on vaccines, cancer and other diseases through competitive grants to researchers at institutions across the nation. The agency also conducts its own research with thousands of scientists working at NIH labs in Bethesda, Maryland.",
      "Among advances that were supported by NIH money are a medication for opioid addiction, a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, many new cancer drugs and the speedy development of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of obese Americans would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning",
      "WASHINGTON -- Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning.",
      "The costly proposal from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services immediately sets the stage for a showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the agency, could block the measure.",
      "While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labeled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade.",
      "\u201cIt's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,\u201d U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. \u201cIt's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.\u201d",
      "The rule would not be finalized until January, days after Trump takes office. A bipartisan coalition of congressional members has lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity. While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag.",
      "Under the proposal, only those who are considered obese \u2014 someone who has a body mass index of 30 or higher \u2014 would qualify for coverage. Some people may already get coverage of the drugs through Medicare or Medicaid, if they have diabetes or are at risk for stroke or heart disease.",
      "Becerra estimated that an additional 3.5 million people on Medicare and 4 million on Medicaid could qualify for coverage of the drugs. But research suggests far more people might qualify, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating roughly 28 million people on Medicaid are considered obese.",
      "Medicare has been barred from offering the drugs under a decades-old law that prohibits the government-backed insurance program from covering weight-loss products. The rule proposed by the Biden administration, however, would recognize obesity as a disease that can be treated with the help of the drugs.",
      "The anti-obesity drug market has expanded significantly in recent years, with the Food and Drug Administration approving a new class of weekly injectables like Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy and Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound to treat obesity.",
      "People can lose as much as 15% to 25% of their body weight on the drugs, which imitate the hormones that regulate appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.",
      "The cost of the drugs has largely limited them to the wealthy, including celebrities who boast of their benefits. A monthly supply of Wegovy rings up at $1,300 and Zepbound will put you out $1,000. Shortages of the drugs have also limited the supplies.",
      "Kennedy, who as Trump's nominee for HHS secretary is subject to Senate confirmation, has railed against the drugs' popularity. In speeches and on social media, he's said the U.S. should not cover the drugs through Medicaid or Medicare. Instead, he supports a broad expansion of coverage for healthier foods and gym memberships.",
      "\u201cFor half the price of Ozempic, we could purchase regeneratively raised, organic food for every American, three meals a day and a gym membership, for every obese American,\u201d Kennedy said to a group of federal lawmakers during a roundtable earlier this year. Ozempic is a diabetes drug that can stimulate weight loss."

Both groups had similar high rates of overall survival and low rates of organ rejection.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for the nation's top health job, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has vowed to allow wider distribution of raw milk across America. But the detection of bird flu virus in unpasteurized milk sold in California stores underscores what health experts say are the known and potential risks.",
      "\u201cYou have to assume that raw milk, unpasteurized milk, has potential infectious agents that can cause serious illness in the people who drink it,\" said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher who has investigated foodborne illness outbreaks.",
      "Raw Farm LLC, of Fresno, California, voluntarily recalled one lot of \u201ccream top\u201d whole raw milk after Santa Clara County health officials found the bird flu virus in a sample last week. State health officials said the county has been testing raw milk sold in stores as \u201ca second line of consumer protection.\u201d",
      "No illnesses have been traced to Raw Farm products, which have a lot code of 20241109 and a best-by date of Nov. 27. But officials with California's health department warned consumers not to drink the milk and said retailers should remove it from their shelves. On Tuesday, Los Angeles County health officials warned that \u201cmany retailers\u201d there may have sold recalled raw milk contaminated with the virus.",
      "Here's what else you need to know about raw milk and bird flu:",
      "It\u2019s not a surprise that the virus was found in raw milk sold in stores, Osterholm said.",
      "Bird flu, also known as Type A H5N1 influenza, was first confirmed in U.S. dairy cattle in March and has been spreading widely. In California, more than 435 dairy herds have seen infections \u2014 more than all other U.S. states combined. And high levels of the virus have been found in the milk of infected cows.",
      "About 20% of samples of pasteurized milk sold in stores were found to contain viral remnants of the virus, according to tests conducted earlier this year by government scientists. Pasteurization, or heat treatment, kills the bird flu virus and also bacteria such as E. coli, listeria and salmonella, which are known to make people sick.",
      "Officials with California's Department of Food and Agriculture have been conducting weekly tests of raw milk in bulk tanks from the state's dairies. Additional tests conducted at Raw Farm sites in California were negative for the virus, but officials said they would begin testing for bird flu twice a week.",
      "Few tests of unpasteurized milk products from stores have been conducted, so it's possible that other raw dairy products may contain the virus, Osterholm said.",
      "\u201cIt is still really unclear how much testing is going on,\u201d said Osterholm. \u201cWe're flying blind.\u201d",
      "To date, there's no evidence that people have been infected with the bird flu virus by drinking raw milk. At least 55 people in the U.S. are known to have been infected by the virus this year, but nearly all were dairy or poultry workers who developed mild illness after close contact with infected animals.",
      "Tests have shown that mice fed raw milk contaminated with bird flu became very sick and barn cats on farms that drank milk from infected cows suffered brain damage and died, noted Nicole Martin, a microbiologist and associate director of the Milk Quality Improvement Program at Cornell University,",
      "\u201cI don't think we know yet whether people can contract H5N1 from consumption of raw milk, but we have enough evidence that would suggest that folks need to be a little more cautious right now,\u201d Martin said.",
      "Nearly 4.4% of U.S. adults, or about 11 million people, report that they drink raw milk at least once each year. About 1% of adults say they consume raw milk each week, according to a 2022 FDA study.",
      "Proponents of raw milk cite perceived health benefits and better taste as key reasons for consumption. Raw Farm advertises its products as \u201cunprocessed and complete\u201d with vitamins, minerals, enzymes and beneficial bacteria.",
      "Fans include Kennedy, who has said he only drinks raw milk. Kennedy has criticized agriculture departments for cracking down on raw milk and promised that the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \u201c aggressive suppression \u201d of unpasteurized milk would end under Trump.",
      "Mark McAfee, owner of Raw Farm, has appeared several times on podcasts hosted by Nicole Shanahan, Kennedy's former running mate. Both Kennedy and Shanahan are customers, McAfee told the Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThey want that same level of differentiating, wonderful, tested, gorgeous, safe, delicious raw milk for everybody,\" McAfee said.",
      "Health officials have warned for years that raw milk can cause illnesses that range from mild to life-threatening. Between 1998 and 2018, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention documented more than 200 illness outbreaks traced to raw milk, which sickened more than 2,600 people and hospitalized more than 225.",
      "Before the U.S. adopted safety standards in 1924 under what was called the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance, about 25% of foodborne illnesses were related to dairy consumption, according to the Center for Dairy Research. Now, dairy products account for about 1% of such illnesses.",

    "summary": "Nebraska has moved closer to allowing medical marijuana",
    "story": [
      "Nebraska has moved closer to allowing medical marijuana",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Three weeks after Nebraska voters overwhelmingly approved medical marijuana the state moved a step closer to allowing it Tuesday when a judge ruled that the petitions that put the question on the ballot were valid.",
      "The decision by Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong was a victory for advocates of medical marijuana, but opponents are likely to appeal it to the state Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cTo prevail in this action, the plaintiff and Secretary had to show that more than 3,463 signatures on the Legalization Petition and 3,357 signatures on the Regulatory Petition are invalid. The Plaintiff and Secretary are well short,\u201d Strong wrote. Fewer than 1,000 signatures on each petition were shown to be invalid.",
      "A spokesperson for the Nebraska attorney general said the office\u2019s lawyers were reviewing the ruling and considering whether to file an appeal.",
      "Medical marijuana supporters didn't immediately respond to calls or emails seeking comment Tuesday after the ruling was released.",
      "More than two-thirds of Nebraska voters supported legalization at the polls Nov. 5. The results are scheduled to be certified Dec. 2.",
      "Secretary of State Bob Evnen and Attorney General Mike Hilgers argued that problems with the way thousands of signatures were gathered meant the ballot initiatives shouldn\u2019t have been put to voters. One person who circulated petitions in Grand Island was criminally charged with falsifying at least 164 signatures. Evnen, Hilgers and former state Sen. John Kuehn also raised questions about whether other signatures were properly notarized.",
      "Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana argued in court that even if some of the signatures gathered were flawed, the group still had well over the 86,499 needed. The Secretary of State's office certified nearly 90,000 signatures on both the petition to allow marijuana for medical use and the one to set up a commission to regulate it.",
      "The judge agreed that the state wasn't able to show any widespread fraud. Instead the ruling pointed primarily to the one petition circulator who was charged and raised questions about whether some other signatures were properly notarized.",
      "Strong said she reviewed thousands of messages that top two organizers of the petition campaign exchanged that filled more than 800 pages and only found one mention of notarizing petitions outside of the petition circulator's presence.",
      "This year marked the third time Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana tried to get the issue on the ballot and the first time it made it there.",
      "In 2020, the group came close after meeting signature requirements. But opponents sued, arguing that advocates violated state rules requiring ballot measures to focus on a single question. Instead, the measure posed two separate questions: whether residents should have the right to use marijuana for medical purposes, and whether private companies should be allowed to grow and sell it.",
      "The state Supreme Court prevented the questions from going to voters.",
      "In 2022, organizers failed to collect enough signatures in time to get the question on the November ballot.",
      "Voters in North Dakota, South Dakota and Florida all rejected measures to legalize recreational marijuana use this year. But dozens of states have previously legalized it for either medical or recreational use, most recently in Ohio last year. In May, the federal government also began a process to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug."

      "WASHINGTON -- Millions of obese Americans would get access to popular weekly injectables that would help them shed pounds quickly if a $ 35 billion proposal  from the Biden administration is blessed by President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "The rule, unveiled Tuesday by the Health and Human Services Department, would require Medicare and Medicaid to cover weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound for a large segment of Americans who are obese.",
      "But it's unclear if the proposal, which would not go into effect until after Trump takes office, will have support from his new administration \u2014 including from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an opponent of the drugs whom the president-elect has tapped to serve as head of HHS.",
      "Here's what to know about the drugs and the Biden administration's proposal:",
      "The weight-loss drugs, also called anti-obesity medications or GLP-1s, mimic the hormone known as glucagon-like peptide 1, which regulates appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.",
      "The drugs include Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy and Ozempic as well as Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound and Mounjaro.",
      "In clinical trials, most participants taking Wegovy or Mounjaro to treat obesity lost an average of 15% to 22% of their body weight \u2014 up to 50 pounds or more in many cases. But a slice of \u201cnonresponders\u201d did not lose significant body weight.",
      "Private health insurers have limited coverage of the drugs. Medicare has been barred from covering them under a law that says the program cannot pay for weight-loss products. Coverage through Medicaid, meanwhile, has varied from state to state.",
      "That's meant the drugs \u2014 which can cost upwards of $1,000 monthly \u2014 have been largely unaffordable for many.",
      "The rule announced Tuesday affects Medicaid, which provides health care coverage for roughly 70 million of the nation\u2019s poorest people, and Medicare, the health insurance program for about 67 million older Americans.",
      "Under the proposal, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, would reinterpret the federal law, to consider the drugs as a treatment for obesity diseases.",
      "The nation's top health agency estimates as many as 3.5 million people on Medicare and 4 million on Medicaid could qualify for coverage of the drugs. But research suggests far more people might qualify, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating roughly 28 million people on Medicaid are considered obese.",
      "And the proposal would cost a lot of money \u2014 at least $35 billion over the next decade.",
      "The drugs are popular \u2014 with a majority of Americans telling health firm KFF in a poll earlier this year that Medicare should cover the drugs. A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, too, has lobbied for coverage of the drugs.",
      "But support is mixed in Trump\u2019s inner circle.",
      "Kennedy has railed against the idea of Medicare or Medicaid covering the drugs. Instead, he's told Congress that they should expand coverage of healthier foods and gym memberships through the government-sponsored health care programs.",
      "Meanwhile Dr. Mehmet Oz, who is poised to take the helm of CMS, has said the drugs can be a helpful tool. In a video posted to Instagram last year, Oz praised some of the benefits of the drugs, but said the long-term effects should be further studied.",
      "\u201cI think these new generation of medications offer us a huge opportunity,\u201d Oz said.",
      "Trump or Kennedy could ultimately ignore Biden's proposal and not implement it.",
      "Some lawmakers praised the move on Tuesday, while others expressed skepticism.",
      "Rep. Brad Wenstrup, a Republican who sponsored a bill to have Medicare cover the weight-loss drugs, has argued that covering the drugs and other obesity treatments could save taxpayers in the long run.",
      "\u201cI am encouraged to see the Administration support our efforts to help make Americans healthier by allowing Medicare coverage of new, physician prescribed and FDA approved anti-obesity medications,\" Wenstrup said in a statement.",
      "He called for the Congress to pass a law that would help pay for dietitians, nutritionists and behavioral therapy to treat obesity.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, however, warned that unless the government required drugmakers to lower the price of the medications Medicare premiums would \u201cskyrocket\" under the plan.",
      "It's good for more Americans to have access to these drugs, which have proven effective, but Dr. David Ludwig, a nutrition and obesity expert at Harvard University, hopes that it doesn't become the primary way obesity is treated in America.",
      "He worries that not enough investment is being made to figure out what is driving climbing obesity rates across the U.S., and the role that healthy foods and exercise might play in solving that epidemic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s appropriate to treat the problems that we now face with drugs, but let\u2019s not stop there,\u201d Ludwig said. \u201cLet\u2019s identify what\u2019s causing the problem, and ultimately rely on these drugs \u2014 which have side effects \u2014 less and less over time.\u201d",
      "Dr. Andrew Kraftson, who treats obese patients at the University of Michigan, is happy that more of his patients might be able to afford these drugs, which he has prescribed for patients and has had successful results. But he, too, would like to see more research and guidance from the government on prescribing the medications.",
      "Kraftson also worries about some of the side effects for elderly patients. The drugs, he points out, can lead to muscle loss, which is a bigger problem for older Americans who are at risk of falling, for example.",
      "\u201cI'm advocating for their thoughtful use,\u201d Kraftson said. \"Because if you have a senior and you just write a prescription and the visit takes five minutes, is that an appropriate level of care? Have we defined that well?",

Being exposed to strongly held beliefs that run counter to one\u2019s own values can lead to people feeling mistreated or unsafe. This month's U.S. presidential election heightened those tensions.",
      "\u201cThere was a lot of anxiety during this election, and in times of anxiety you need to create psychological safety in people,\u201d said Ron Gutman, an adjunct professor of leadership at Stanford University and the co-founder and co-CEO of health technology company Intrivo. \u201cYou need to create trust in people, to bring back the trust in each other.\u201d",
      "Here are some tips from business leaders, psychologists and communication experts on how to navigate political conflicts in the workplace.",
      "To cultivate a more peaceful working environment, executives, managers and employees can practice humility. That means seeing ourselves as equal and not superior to our colleagues and subordinates, and recognizing that no one has all the right answers.",
      "When we listen to others thoughtfully and relinquish a reflexive belief in our own infallibility, it allows us to remain open to new ideas and perspectives, said Inclusivv CEO Jenn Graham, whose organization creates structured dialogues around social and political issues for corporate clients.",
      "\u201cWe can say something like, \u2018I haven\u2019t heard of that or thought of that before. Thank you for sharing,\u2019\u201d Graham said. \u201cAnd that simple act of \u2018thank you for sharing,\u2019 with gratitude and humility combined, creates a reciprocity for that brave space, for that psychological safety. And that\u2019s what we need to foster more than ever.\u201d",
      "To cultivate a humble mindset, think about why you might be wrong, and consider that the opposite of what you believe might be true, said Jake Telkamp, an assistant professor at Augusta University in Georgia. \u201cWe are really good at seeking out information that supports our beliefs, and then we scrutinize evidence that challenges our beliefs,\u201d he said.",
      "In some situations, a more guarded approach is warranted. If political talk feels like a personal attack, you may need to find allies who can help you process what you\u2019re hearing and feeling.",
      "For example, when a comedian opened a campaign rally for President-elect Donald Trump last month by referring to Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage,\u201d many people were deeply upset, said psychologist Alfiee Breland-Noble, founder of The AAKOMA Project, a nonprofit organization focused on empowering youth and young adults of color and people who face sexism and homophobia.",
      "The same was true after Black teenagers and adults received text messages this month telling them they were \u201cselected to pick cotton,\u201d she said.",

      "People feel like their lives are on the line, and are asking, \u201cWhere do I go with this struggle that I\u2019m having? Because people who look like me nationally, we all feel like we\u2019re under attack,\u201d she said.",
      "Breland-Noble encourages employees who feel marginalized by political discourse to identify colleagues to confide in, to check workplace policies for any rules on unacceptable speech and behavior, and to consider speaking with a trusted supervisor about what they\u2019re experiencing.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot that we can learn from how people have over time managed having a marginalized identity and being in the workplace because you have a plethora of people around you who are dealing with this stuff literally every day,\u201d Breland-Noble said.",
      "Also check your employer\u2019s social media policy. In many states, workers can be fired for posting political beliefs online, said Brad Kelley, a shareholder who represents employers at the law firm Littler.",
      "When attempting to resolve discord, one way to foster a peaceful resolution is to seek common ground.",
      "In the structured conversations she leads, Graham encourages participants to begin by listening to and acknowledging what the other person is saying. Repeat it back. Honor their emotions. Then you can share your perspective, and in the process you may find similarities, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking for common ground, you\u2019re ideally looking for a shared value,\" Graham said. It could be as simple as recognizing \u201cwe both have a need for and a desire for (fill in the) blank.\u201d",
      "Most people want a happier, healthier, more prosperous country, but the disagreement often lies in how to best get there, Telkamp said. Acknowledging shared goals can help de-escalate tension.",
      "\u201cPeople on the left and the right are disliking, distrusting, and generally they think people on the other side are unintelligent and immoral,\u201d Telkamp said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in how we can kind of get off the ledge a little bit and come back to a better understanding of each other.\u201d",
      "One way managers can try to bridge divides is to create rituals for employees to share what\u2019s important to them, Gutman said. This can help build a baseline of trust within an organization.",
      "Every Friday at Intrivo, the staff gathers for an hour and one person presents on a topic they\u2019re passionate about. It could be a hobby, an idea, a family experience or a skill. Political topics are fine as long as no one is putting anyone down, he said.",
      "\u201cIt can be super technical or super silly,\u201d Gutman said. The conversations build trust, and a sense of safety and community, he said.",
      "In circumstances where a discussion is getting heated, sometimes the best way to handle it is to remove ourselves from the conflict or to keep our views to ourselves.",
      "Leaders may want to consider abstaining from sharing their political views, which may alienate some workers, Telkamp said. \u201cThat\u2019s not about silencing your beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about keeping the workplace focused on the work.\u201d",

      "In this cemetery, where they are supposedly buried, all the graves are anonymous and the exact location of the remains is unknown, as is the number of victims. The true scale and circumstances of the killings remain unclear as Senegal commemorates the 80th anniversary of the massacre on Sunday, threatening to reignite smoldering tensions between France and the former colony.",
      "\u201cI have been fighting to get answers for over 80 years,\u201d says Biram Senghor. \u201c(French President Emmanuel) Macron cannot do what the other French presidents before him did; France has to repent.\u201d",
      "The West Africans were members of the unit called \u201cTirailleurs S\u00e9n\u00e9galais,\u201d a corps of colonial infantry in the French Army that fought in both World Wars. According to historians, there were disputes over unpaid wages in the days before the massacre and on Dec. 1, French troops turned on the unarmed African soldiers and shot them dead.",
      "For decades, French authorities tried to minimize what had happened in Thiaroye. Reports by the French military shortly after the massacre determined that 35 West African soldiers were killed in response to a \u201cmutiny.\u201d Other reports by the French army mention 70 deaths.",
      "But today, many French and Senegalese historians agree the true death toll is likely in the hundreds, with some speaking of almost 400 African soldiers killed, based on estimates of the number of riflemen present at the camp on the day of the massacre.",
      "On Thursday, Macron officially recognized the events of Thiaroye as a massacre for the first time in a letter to Senegal\u2019s President Diomaye Faye, which was seen by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cFrance must recognize that on that day, the confrontation between soldiers and riflemen who demanded their full legitimate wages be paid, triggered a chain of events that resulted in a massacre,\u201d read Macron\u2019s letter.",

      "He points to the fact that no weapons were mentioned during the trial of the African riflemen accused of mutiny and the absence of any injuries among the French soldiers as evidence that no confrontation took place.",
      "In his letter to the Senegalese president, Macron did not mention the number of soldiers killed.",
      "The controversies and unknowns about the massacre are in part due to a lack of transparency by French authorities regarding the military reports and testimonies.",
      "In 2014, French President Francois Hollande handed over the European nation\u2019s archives on Thiaroye to Macky Sall, then-president of Senegal.",
      "But historians say that key documents, including ones indicating the site of the mass graves and the number of West African soldiers present at the camp on the day of the massacre, are still missing. It is unclear if France holds such archives or if they even exist.",

      "Additionally, very little was done by the Senegalese authorities under former president Sall to allow historians to delve into the historical documents.",
      "\u201cThe archives remained inaccessible until this year, for obscure reasons,\u201d says Mourre.",
      "Mamadou Diouf, a Senegalese historian who heads the commemoration committee for the Thiaroye massacre this year, says Sall did not show much interest in the subject to avoid diplomatic tensions with France.",
      "But Senegal\u2019s President Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who was elected in March in part on a promise of redefining Senegal\u2019s relationship with the former colonizer, has vowed to regain control of the historical narrative on Thiaroye.",
      "His administration has organized major commemorations of the massacre from Dec. 1 to April 2025 across the country.",
      "\u201cThe authorities' goal behind the major commemorations is to make Thiaroye part of Senegal\u2019s national story,\u201d says Babacar Ndiaye, political analyst at the Wathi think tank, which focuses on political and economic issues in West Africa.",
      "\u201cIt will be talked about a lot on television, in the press and most importantly on social media,\u201d he adds. \u201cThis will reach a younger audience who might know little about the events of Thiaroye.\u201d",
      "The 80th anniversary of the massacre comes as France\u2019s influence is declining in the region, with Paris losing its sway in its former West African colonies.",
      "French troops have been ousted in recent years from Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso after years of fighting Islamic extremists alongside regional troops. Earlier this week, Chad, one of the last countries in the region where France had maintained a large military presence, ended a military cooperation agreement with Paris.",
      "France still has around 350 troops in Senegal, mainly in a supportive role. Asked about their continued presence, Faye suggested it is not something the Senegalese would want.",
      "\u201cHistorically, France enslaved, colonized and stayed here,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, I think that when you reverse the roles a little, you will have a hard time conceiving that another army \u2014 of China, Russia, Senegal, or any other country \u2014 could have a military base in France.\u201d",
      "At the ceremony held at the military cemetery in Thiaroye on Sunday, Faye announced the construction of a memorial in honor of the riflemen, the creation of a research center where archives on the massacre will be kept, and streets named after the event. History lessons on the massacre will also be added to the school curriculum and Dec. 1 will officially become \u201cnational day of the tirailleur.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we are doing here is part of our duty of remembrance and to reveal the truth of the facts, to discharge a moral debt towards the riflemen and their families,\u201d said during his speech in front of an audience that included France\u2019s Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, as well as Gambia, Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, Gabon and the Comoros heads of state. Macron was not present at the ceremony.",
      "\u201cWe are not opening a door to arouse resentment, maintain anger or hatred,\u201d Faye said.",
      "But once more, Senegal and the former colonizer's account of the massacre differed.",
      "While the French foreign minister described the events of Thiaroye as a \u201ccry of anger\u201d from the riflemen that France \u201crepressed in a bloodshed,\u201d the Senegalese president said they were \u201ca premeditated act.\u201d",

      "Bangladesh\u2019s High Court acquitted former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia\u2019s son, Tarique Rahman, and overturned a verdict against him iover a deadly 2004 grenade attack on a political rally",
      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Bangladesh\u2019s High Court on Sunday acquitted former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia\u2019s son, Tarique Rahman, and overturned a verdict against him over a deadly 2004 grenade attack on a political rally.",
      "The ruling comes at a critical time as the South Asian country suffers political tension after long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country to India in August following a mass uprising that left hundreds dead. Rahman serves as the acting chairperson of Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party while in self-exile in London, and he could become Bangladesh's next leader if his party is voted into power.",
      "Rahman and 48 others were found guilty in 2018 in the attack targeting a rally held by supporters of Sheikh Hasina, who led the opposition at the time, leaving two dozen people dead and wounding about 300 others. A court sentenced 19 of them to death while Rahman got life in prison, with Zia's party accusing the ruling of being politically motivated.",
      "A two-member judge panel scrapped Sunday the entire 2018 ruling for all 49 men, following an appeal lodged by the defendants. Shishir Monir, a defense lawyer, told reporters the court declared the trial and verdict \u201cillegal\u201d.",
      "\u201cAs a result, all defendants have been acquitted,\u201d he said.",
      "Zia, who ruled the country as prime minister between 2001-2006, and Hasina are the country's most powerful politicians and long-time rivals.",
      "Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus has been chosen as the country\u2019s interim leader since Hasina's escape, but authorities have been struggling to enforce order amid mob justice, chaos and claims of systematic targeting of minority groups, particularly Hindus, which Yunus said are \"exaggerated.\"",
      "Hasina\u2019s Awami League party blasted the court ruling in a Facebook post on Sunday, saying it wasn't \u201cYunus\u2019 Kangaroo court\" and that the people of Bangladesh would be the ones trying those responsible for the attacks.",
      "Zia's party welcomed Sunday's ruling.",
      "The attorney general\u2019s office can appeal the ruling in the country's Supreme Court.",
      "The Yunus-led government has not declared any timeframe for the next election, but Rahman and his party want the new election sometime soon. Meanwhile, Jamaat-e-Islami party, which shared power with Zia\u2019s party in 2001-2006 with important portfolios in the Cabinet, said it wants to allow the Yunus-led government to stay in power to bring in reforms in various sectors before a new election.",
      "Hasina faces charges of crimes against humanity for deaths during the summer's student-led uprising. The interim government has sought help from Interpol to arrest Hasina. It is not clear if India will respond to any request from Bangladesh for Hasina\u2019s extradition under a mutual treaty."

      "The top United Nations court will take up the largest case in its history on Monday",
      "THE HAGUE -- The top United Nations court will take up the largest case in its history on Monday, when it opens two weeks of hearings into what countries worldwide are legally required to do to combat climate change and help vulnerable nations fight its devastating impact.",
      "After years of lobbying by island nations who fear they could simply disappear under rising sea waters, the U.N. General Assembly asked the International Court of Justice last year for an opinion on \u201cthe obligations of States in respect of climate change.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe want the court to confirm that the conduct that has wrecked the climate is unlawful,\u201d Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh, who is leading the legal team for the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, told The Associated Press.",
      "In the decade up to 2023, sea levels have risen by a global average of around 4.3 centimeters (1.7 inches), with parts of the Pacific rising higher still. The world has also warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels.",
      "Vanuatu is one of a group of small states pushing for international legal intervention in the climate crisis.",
      "\u201cWe live on the front lines of climate change impact. We are witnesses to the destruction of our lands, our livelihoods, our culture and our human rights,\u201d Vanuatu\u2019s climate change envoy Ralph Regenvanu told reporters ahead of the hearing.",
      "Any decision by the court would be non-binding advice and unable to directly force wealthy nations into action to help struggling countries. Yet it would be more than just a powerful symbol since it could serve as the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits.",
      "On Sunday, ahead of the hearing, advocacy groups will bring together environmental organizations from around the world. Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change \u2014 who first developed the idea of requesting an advisory opinion \u2014 together with World Youth for Climate Justice plan an afternoon of speeches, music and discussions.",
      "From Monday, the Hague-based court will hear from 99 countries and more than a dozen intergovernmental organizations over two weeks. It\u2019s the largest lineup in the institution\u2019s nearly 80-year history.",
      "Last month at the United Nations\u2019 annual climate meeting, countries cobbled together an agreement on how rich countries can support poor countries in the face of climate disasters. Wealthy countries have agreed to pool together at least $300 billion a year by 2035 but the total is short of the $1.3 trillion that experts, and threatened nations, said is needed.",
      "\u201cFor our generation and for the Pacific Islands, the climate crisis is an existential threat. It is a matter of survival, and the world\u2019s biggest economies are not taking this crisis seriously. We need the ICJ to protect the rights of people at the front lines,\u201d Vishal Prasad, of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, told reporters in a briefing.",
      "Fifteen judges from around the world will seek to answer two questions: What are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? And what are the legal consequences for governments where their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment?",
      "The second question makes particular reference to \u201csmall island developing States\u201d likely to be hardest hit by climate change and to \u201cmembers of \u201cthe present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change.\u201d",
      "The judges were even briefed on the science behind rising global temperatures by the U.N.\u2019s climate change body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ahead of the hearings.",
      "The case at the ICJ follows a number of rulings around the world ordering governments to do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "In May, a U.N. tribunal on maritime law said that carbon emissions qualify as marine pollution and countries must take steps to adapt to and mitigate their adverse effects.",
      "That ruling came a month after Europe\u2019s highest human rights court said that countries must better protect their people from the consequences of climate change, in a landmark judgment that could have implications across the continent.",
      "The ICJ\u2019s host country of The Netherlands made history when a court ruled in 2015 that protection from the potentially devastating effects of climate change is a human right and that the government has a duty to protect its citizens. The judgment was upheld in 2019 by the Dutch Supreme Court.",

      "Results from Ireland's election suggest the two dominant center-right parties look likely to form a new government",
      "DUBLIN -- Ireland\u2019s two long-dominant center-right parties looked likely to form a new government as results came in Sunday from a fractured national election, though with a reduced vote share and complex coalition negotiations ahead.",
      "In an exception to the global anti-incumbent mood, outgoing governing parties Fianna Fail and Fine Gael took the two largest shares of the vote, narrowly ahead of left-of-center opposition Sinn Fein.",
      "Under Ireland's system of proportional representation, vote share does not translate neatly into seats in parliament. With about two-thirds of results declared, Fianna Fail was on course to be the biggest party in the 174-seat D\u00e1il, the lower house of parliament, with Fine Gael and Sinn Fein battling for second place.",
      "It's certain that no party will have enough seats to govern on its own, and the most likely outcome is a coalition between Fianna Fail, led by Miche\u00e1l Martin, and Fine Gael under outgoing Prime Minister Simon Harris. In that case either Harris or Martin \u2014 or possibly both, if they strike a job-sharing deal \u2014 will become Ireland's next premier, known as the taoiseach.",
      "Sinn Fein, which aims to reunify the Republic of Ireland with the U.K. territory of Northern Ireland, lacks a clear path to power because the other two parties say they won\u2019t work with it, partly because of its historic ties with the Irish Republican Army during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland.",
      "Ireland uses a complex system of proportional representation in which each of the country\u2019s 43 constituencies elects several lawmakers and voters rank candidates in order of preference. As a result, it can take days for full results to be known.",
      "\u201cThe people of Ireland have now spoken,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe now have to work out exactly what they have said, and that is going to take a little bit of time.\u201d",
      "The cost of living \u2014 especially Ireland\u2019s acute housing crisis \u2014 was a dominant topic in the three-week campaign, alongside immigration, which has become an emotive and challenging issue in a country of 5.4 million people long defined by emigration.",
      "The results of Friday's election mean Ireland has partly bucked the global trend of incumbents being rejected by disgruntled voters after years of pandemic, international instability and cost-of-living pressures.",
      "The next government, like the last, will likely be led by two parties that have dominated Irish politics for the past century. Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have similar policies, but are longtime rivals with origins on opposing sides of Ireland\u2019s 1920s civil war. After the 2020 election ended in a virtual dead heat, they formed a coalition, propped up by the Green Party.",
      "The Greens had a devastating result, losing all but one of their 12 seats. This time, the winning parties may turn to left-leaning Labour or the Social Democrats, or to independent lawmakers, for support.",
      "For all the focus on migration, anti-immigration independents made few breakthroughs. Ireland does not have a significant far-right party to capitalize on the issue.",
      "Reelected Fine Gael lawmaker Paschal Donohoe said the main theme of the election was \u201cthe center holding.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, the new government will face huge pressure to ease rising homelessness, driven by soaring rents and property prices, and to better absorb a growing number of asylum-seekers. The big parties' share of the vote continues to decline, and voter disaffection expressed itself in support for small parties and independent candidates.",
      "One of the more unorthodox independents was reputed organized crime boss Gerry \u201cthe Monk\u201d Hutch, who saw a groundswell of support after he was bailed on money-laundering charges in Spain in November in order to run for election.",
      "Hutch, who last year was acquitted of killing a gangland rival, came within a whisker of winning a seat in Dublin.",

      "Bukele\u2019s party controls El Salvador\u2019s Congress by a wide margin and his political opposition has been devastated, so a formal proposal to end the ban is unlikely to meet much resistance.",
      "In 2017, El Salvador banned all metals mining above ground and below. A broad coalition of sectors, including the Catholic church, supported the prohibition in order to protect the small country\u2019s water resources from contamination.",
      "At that point, exploration had revealed deposits of gold and silver, but there was no large-scale metal mining. It\u2019s unclear what its gold reserves could be.",

      "The vast majority of Japan\u2019s public supports changing the law to allow her to remain a royal and become emperor, but conservatives in the governing party insist on keeping male-only succession. Japan\u2019s rapidly dwindling imperial family has only 16 members, including four men.",
      "Aiko was to mark her birthday with her parents at the imperial palace in Tokyo. The IHA also released several photos of Aiko, including one of her standing by a persimmon tree at a palace garden. Another showed her holding pieces of traditional hand-crafted washi paper that she made at a workshop during her first solo official trip in October to the National Sports Festival in Japan\u2019s southwestern prefecture of Saga.",
      "The 1947 Imperial House Law, which largely preserves conservative prewar family values, allows only males to take the throne and forces female royals who marry outside the family to give up their status. With only one young male member, that puts the survival of the 2,000-year-old monarchy in jeopardy.",
      "The youngest male member of the imperial family, Prince Hisahito \u2014 Aiko's 18-year-old cousin \u2014 is currently the last heir apparent, posing a major problem for the system.",
      "The government is looking for a way to keep the succession stable without relying on women, such as allowing the family to adopt new male members from former noble families that lost their status after World War II.",
      "Aiko's own views on the topic are unknown. She's only had one full news conference, when she reached adulthood.",
      "Last month, the United Nations women\u2019s rights committee in Geneva issued a report that called for the Japanese government to allow a female emperor, among other issues hindering gender equality in the country.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi dismissed the report \u201cregrettable\u201d and \u201cinappropriate.\u201d He said the imperial succession is a matter of fundamental national identity and that it is not covered by constitutional basic rights.",
      "Crown Prince Akishino, Aiko's uncle, was asked about the succession debate at a news conference marking his 59th birthday Saturday, and replied that members of the royal family are \u201cliving humans\u201d and that the palace officials who support their daily lives should know how it affects them.",
      "At her work at the Japanese Red Cross Society, Aiko is assigned to volunteer training program, the IHA said. On weekends, it said, the princess enjoys taking walks with her parents and playing volleyball, tennis and badminton with palace officials.",

      "The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike in the village of Yaroun, nor did the Hezbollah militant group. Israel continues to call on displaced Lebanese not to return to dozens of southern villages in this current stage of the ceasefire. It also continues to impose a daily curfew for people moving across the Litani River between 5 pm and 7 am.",
      "Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati and the Lebanese military have been critical of Israeli strikes and overflights since the ceasefire went into effect, accusing Israel of violating the agreement. The military said it had filed complaints, but no clear military action has been taken by Hezbollah in response, meaning that the tense cessation of hostilities has not yet broken down.",
      "When Israel has issued statements about these strikes, it says they were done to thwart possible Hezbollah attacks.",
      "The United States military announced Friday that Major General Jasper Jeffers alongside senior U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein will co-chair a new U.S.-led monitoring committee that includes France, the UN peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon known as UNIFIL, Lebanon, and Israel. Hochstein led over a year of shuttle diplomacy to broker the ceasefire deal, and his role will be temporary until a permanent civilian co-chair is appointed.",
      "Lebanon meanwhile is trying to pick up the pieces and return to some level of normal life after the war that decimated large swaths of its south and east, displacing an estimated 1.2 million people. The Lebanese military said it detonated unexploded munitions left over from Israeli strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon. Elsewhere, the Lebanese Civil Defense said it removed five bodies from under the rubble in two southern Lebanese towns over the past 24 hours.",
      "The first phase of the ceasefire is a 60-day cessation of hostilities where Hezbollah militants are supposed to withdraw from southern Lebanon north of the Litani River and Israeli troops withdraw from southern Lebanon into northern Israel. Lebanese troops are to deploy in large numbers in the south, effectively being the only armed force in control of the south alongside UNIFIL peacekeepers.",
      "But challenges still remain at this current stage. Many families who want to bury their dead deep in southern Lebanon are unable to do so at this point.",
      "The Lebanese Health Ministry and military allocated a plot of land in the coastal city of Tyre for those people to be temporarily laid to rest. Dr. Wissam Ghazal of the Health Ministry in Tyre said almost 200 bodies have been temporarily buried in that plot of land, until the situation near the border calms down.",

      "Adani, 62, is one of Asia\u2019s richest men and perceived as close to Prime Minister Narendra Mo di. He was thrust into the spotlight on Nov. 20 when U.S. prosecutors in New York charged him and seven of his associates with securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and wire fraud, as well as duping investors by concealing that his company\u2019s huge solar energy project on the subcontinent was being facilitated by bribes.",
      "They were accused of allegedly paying or planning to pay about $265 million in bribes to government officials to help secure contracts and financing amounting to billions of dollars.",

      "More than 100 countries want the treaty to limit production as well as tackle cleanup and recycling, and many have said that is essential to address chemicals of concern. But for some plastic-producing and oil and gas countries, that crosses a red line.",
      "For any proposal to make it into the treaty, every nation must agree to it. Some countries sought to change the process so decisions could be made with a vote if consensus couldn\u2019t be reached and the process was paralyzed. India, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait and others opposed changing it, arguing consensus is vital to an inclusive, effective treaty.",
      "On Sunday, the last scheduled day of talks, the treaty draft still had multiple options for several key sections. Some delegates and environmental organizations said it had become too watered down, including negotiators from Africa who said they would rather leave Busan without a treaty than with a weak one.",
      "Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tons of new plastic. Plastic production could climb about 70% by 2040 without policy changes.",
      "In Ghana, communities, bodies of water, drains and farmlands are choked with plastics, and dumping sites full of plastics are always on fire, said Sam Adu-Kumi, the country\u2019s lead negotiator.",
      "\u201cWe want a treaty that will be able to solve it,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cOtherwise we will go without it and come and fight another time.\u201d",
      "At Sunday night\u2019s meeting, Luis Vayas Valdivieso, the committee chair from Ecuador, said that while they made progress in Busan, their work is far from complete and they must be pragmatic. He said countries were the furthest apart on proposals about problematic plastics and chemicals of concern, plastic production and financing the treaty, as well as the treaty principles.",
      "Valdivieso said the meeting should be suspended and resume at a later date. Many countries then reflected on what they must see in the treaty moving forward.",
      "Rwanda\u2019s lead negotiator, Juliet Kabera, said she spoke on behalf of 85 countries in insisting that the treaty be ambitious throughout, fit for purpose and not built to fail, for the benefit of current and future generations. She asked everyone who supported the statement to \u201cstand up for ambition.\u201d Country delegates and many in the audience stood, clapping.",
      "Panama\u2019s delegation, which led an effort to include plastic production in the treaty, said they would return stronger, louder and more determined.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s negotiator said chemicals and plastic production are not within the scope of the treaty. Speaking on behalf of the Arab group, he said if the world addresses plastic pollution, there should be no problem producing plastic. Kuwait\u2019s negotiator echoed that, saying the objective is to end plastic pollution, not plastic itself, and stretching the mandate beyond its original intent erodes trust and goodwill.",
      "In March 2022, 175 nations agreed to make the first legally binding treaty on plastics pollution, including in the oceans, by the end of 2024. The resolution states that nations will develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution based on a comprehensive approach that addresses the full life cycle of plastic.",
      "Stewart Harris, a spokesperson for the International Council of Chemical Associations, said it was an incredibly ambitious timeline. He said the ICCA is hopeful governments can reach an agreement with just a little more time.",
      "Most of the negotiations in Busan took place behind closed doors. Environmental groups, indigenous leaders and others who traveled to Busan to help shape the treaty said it should\u2019ve been transparent and they felt silenced.",
      "\u201cThe voices of the impacted communities, science and health leaders are silent in the process, and to a large degree, this is why the negotiation process is failing,\u201d said Bjorn Beeler, international coordinator for the International Pollutants Elimination Network. \u201cBusan proved that the process is broken and just hobbling along.",
      "South Korea\u2019s foreign affairs minister Cho Tae-yul said that though they didn\u2019t get a treaty in Busan as many had hoped, their efforts brought the world closer to a unified solution to ending global plastic pollution.",

      "TORONTO -- Canada's ambassador to the United States said Sunday that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was successful in getting President-elect Donald Trump and key Cabinet nominees to understand that lumping Canada in with Mexico over the flow of drugs and migrants into the U.S. is unfair.",
      "Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador in Washington, told The Associated Press in an interview that Trudeau's dinner with Trump on Friday was a very important step in trying to get Trump to back away from threatened tariffs on all products from the major American trading partner.",
      "Hillman was at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and sat at an adjacent table to Trudeau and Trump.",
      "Trump threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if they don\u2019t stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders. He said in a social media post last Monday he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders.",
      "Hillman said Trudeau asked to see Trump in person in a phone call Monday and Trump invited him to dinner on Friday.",
      "At the dinner, Hillman said the case was made to Trump that there is no comparison between the Canada-U.S. border and Mexico-U.S. border.",
      "\u201cThe message that our border is so vastly different than the Mexican border was really understood,\u201d Hillman said.",
      "Hillman said the bulk of Friday night's dinner centered around Trump's border concerns. The ambassador said a priority of Trudeau's was to point out the degree of difference.",
      "Hillman said there really is no comparison, noting there is essentially zero trafficking of fentanyl from Canada to the United States. She said there are seizures but authorities say those are personal use seizures and not criminal trafficking. She said that 99.8% of the fentanyl seized by U.S. authorities in the U.S. comes from Mexico.",
      "\u201cAlso with respect to individuals, illegal individuals crossing illegally, Canada last year was less than one percent, 0.6 percent were of total interceptions from Canada,\u201d Hillman said.",
      "U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian border between October 2023 and September 2024 \u2014 and Hillman said the migrant numbers are coming down since the summer.",
      "\u201cThe facts are hard to deny,\u201d Hillman said.",
      "But Hillman said Canada is ready to make new investments in border security and there are plans for more helicopters, drones and law enforcement officers.",
      "She also noted an agreement between Canada and the United States that allows for migrants caught crossing illegally into the United States to be sent back to Canada. She said that was talked about. She said Mexico and the U.S. do not have a similar agreement.",
      "At the dinner that lasted three hours, Hillman said America's trade deficit with Canada was also raised. Hillman said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year but noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. are energy exports and prices have been high.",
      "\u201cTrade balances are something that he focuses so it\u2019s important to engage in that conversation but to put it into context,\" Hillman said.",
      "\u201cWe are one tenth the size of the United States so a balanced trade deal would mean per capita we are buying 10 times more from the U.S. than they are buying from us. If that\u2019s his metric we will certainly engage on that.\"",
      "Joining Trump and Trudeau at dinner were Howard Lutnick, Trump\u2019s nominee for commerce secretary, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Interior Department, Mike Waltz, Trump\u2019s choice to be his national security adviser, and the three men\u2019s wives.",
      "Also at the dinner were David McCormick, just elected U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, and his wife, Dina Powell, a former deputy national security adviser under Trump, as well as Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, whose responsibilities include border security, and Katie Telford, Trudeau\u2019s chief of staff.",
      "Hillman said Canadian and incoming Trump administration officials will work on Trump's concerns in the coming weeks. Trump called the talks \u201cproductive\u201d on Sunday in a social media post but signaled no retreat from his tariff pledge.",
      "Hillman said Trump and Trudeau \"get along well\" and the dinner was also a chance to socialize. She said Trump used his iPad to play music and she said Trump told Trudeau he's a big fan of Canadian singer Celine Dion.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it could have been better to be frank. Okay, I\u2019ll take that back, I\u2019ll change that. If he obviously said there would be no tariffs that would have been better but there was no realistic expectation of that,\u201d Hillman said.",
      "Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day.",
      "About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada.",
      "Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.",
      "Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 77% of Canada\u2019s exports go to the U.S."

      "International negotiations on a plastic pollution accord are drawing to a close.",
      "BUSAN, South Korea -- Negotiations on a treaty to end plastic pollution are drawing to a close Sunday as nations continue debating whether part of that should be putting limits on plastic production.",
      "Negotiators spent all of Saturday trying to reach agreement behind closed doors, but the latest draft of the treaty, released Sunday afternoon, leaves the question to be settled in open session. It includes multiple options for several key sections.",
      "For the most contentious of those \u2014 the proposal to limit production \u2014 that includes a compromise that would set a target at a later conference and an option to drop the idea altogether.",
      "Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tons of new plastic. Plastic production could climb about 70% by 2040 without policy changes.",
      "The draft's options also include possible language to ban some plastic products that are single-use or contain toxic chemicals, as well as less stringent options. It would also require parties to the treaty to improve the design of plastic products so they don't release microplastics and can be recycled.",
      "Countries could adopt these provisions or make changes when they meet later Sunday.",
      "Delegates from some countries say the new draft is too weak. Sam Adu-Kumi, lead negotiator for Ghana, said the draft is full of voluntary measures that won't end plastic pollution but the world needs a treaty that imposes obligations on all parties.",
      "No treaty at all would be better than a weak one, Adu-Kumi added. Ghana's communities, bodies of water, drains and farmlands are choked with plastics, and dumping sites full of plastics are always on fire, he said.",
      "\u201cWe are here for a legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cSo if we are here and we are getting a treaty that does not address the issues head on, then where are we heading towards? We are not getting anything that will solve the issue. We want a treaty that will be able to solve it. Otherwise we will go without it and come and fight another time.\u201d",
      "At a news conference earlier in the day, Panama and Fiji said that if other nations won't join them in standing up for the ambition this treaty requires, they should \u201cget out\" of their way. They were joined by representatives from Mexico, France, Rwanda and the European Union, who together said they would do everything possible in the final hours to push a treaty forward that will solve the crisis.",
      "\u201cWe are already doing waste management efforts back home,\u201d said Sivendra Michael, Fiji's secretary for the environment and climate change. \u201cThis treaty has to be bigger than all of us. It\u2019s about saving this planet. It\u2019s about saving humanity. And so that\u2019s why we are here, still having hope, pushing. And we will push right until the end, until the time we\u2019re supposed to leave Busan.\u201d",
      "A growing number of countries said in Busan that they want to address the total amount of plastic produced on Earth. A senior member of the U.S. delegation told The Associated Press on Saturday that the country supports having an article in the treaty that limits the world's supply of plastic.",
      "But for some plastic-producing and oil and gas countries, that crosses a red line. They want a treaty that focuses on better management of plastic waste and recycling. Currently, for any proposal to make it into the treaty, every nation must agree to it. India, Saudi Arabia and others have insisted that should remain the case.",
      "Some countries have sought to change the process so decisions can be made with a vote if consensus can't be reached, both during the negotiations and at future meetings about the treaty. But the draft doesn't include that as an option.",
      "That's a huge omission because consensus decision-making has paralyzed the talks, said Erin Simon, an expert on plastics and packaging at the World Wildlife Fund.",
      "\u201cNot having a threat of a vote means each country has a veto card,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have no incentive to come up with a plan and we've seen that time and time again in these negotiations.\u201d",
      "Rwanda's lead negotiator, Juliet Kabera, said there is still time to find common ground, but her country will only accept a treaty that has the strength, ambition and accountability to solve the crisis.",

      "Voters in Iceland have joined a global trend and punished incumbents in the country's parliamentary election",
      "REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- Voters in Iceland joined a global trend of punishing incumbents in a parliamentary election, with a center-left party winning the largest share of votes in the North Atlantic island nation.",
      "With all the votes tallied on Sunday, the Social Democratic Alliance had won 15 seats in the 63-seat parliament, the Althingi \u2014 more than doubling its total \u2014 and secured almost 21% of votes, according to national broadcaster RUV. The conservative Independence Party, which led the outgoing government, had 14 seats and a 19.4% vote share, and the centrist Liberal Reform Party 11 seats and about 16% of votes.",
      "Three other parties also won seats. Social Democrat leader Kristr\u00fan Mj\u00f6ll Frostad\u00f3ttir, 36, will likely try to seek coalition partners to command a parliamentary majority.",
      "Icelanders voted Saturday after disagreements over immigration, energy policy and the economy forced Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson to pull the plug on his coalition government and call an early election.",
      "Counting was delayed in some areas by snowstorms that blocked roads and slowed delivery of ballot boxes to count centers.",
      "Since the 2008 financial crisis devastated the economy and ushered in a new era of political instability, Iceland has been governed by multi-party coalitions of various hues.",
      "Like many Western countries, Iceland has been buffeted by the rising cost of living and immigration pressures, and voters are taking it out on incumbent governments. Benediktsson\u2019s Independence Party and its coalition partners in the outgoing government, the Progressive Party and the Left Greens, all saw their vote share and seat count decline, with the Left Greens losing all eight of its parliamentary seats.",
      "Iceland, a volcanic island nation tucked below the Arctic Circle with a population of less than 400,000, is proud of its democratic traditions. The Althingi, founded in 930 by Viking settlers, is arguably the world's oldest legislature.",
      "Election turnout was high by international standards, with 80% of registered voters casting ballots."

    "story": [
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d brought in a tidal wave of moviegoers over the Thanksgiving Day weekend with $221 million in ticket sales",
      "NEW YORK -- Christmas came early at the box office this year.",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d brought in a tidal wave of moviegoers over the Thanksgiving Day weekend, setting records with $221 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. That, combined with \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II,\u201d made for an unprecedented weekend in cinemas and a confluence of blockbusters more like what\u2019s often found in late December.",
      "Expectations were high for Walt Disney Co.\u2019s \u201cMoana 2,\u201d but the film \u2014 originally planned as a series for Disney+ before it was redirected to the big screen \u2014 blew predictions out of the water. Its five-day opening set a new record for Thanksgiving moviegoing. (The previous best was $125 million for \u201cFrozen 2\u201d in its second week of release in 2019.) \u201cMoana 2\u201d added $165.3 million internationally; with $386 million worldwide, it's the second-best global launch of the year.",
      "At the same time, the sensation of \u201cWicked\u201d showed no signs of slowing down. The Universal Pictures musical brought in $117.5 million over the five-day weekend, pushing its two-week global total to $359.2 million. Not accounting for inflation, \u201cWicked\u201d is now the highest grossing Broadway adaptation over \u201cGrease.\u201d (That 1978 film grossed $190 million, but factoring in inflation would put it past $900 million.)",
      "\u201cGladiator II,\u201d meanwhile, also held well, dipping 44% from its opening weekend. Ridley Scott\u2019s sequel to his Oscar-winning best picture original collected $44 million in its second weekend. While its steep price tag of $250 million will make profitability challenging, \u201cGladiator II\u201d has swiftly gathered $320 million worldwide.",
      "Those three films drove the overall box office to a record $420 million in overall Thanksgiving weekend ticket sales, according to Comscore \u2014 more than $100 million more than ever before. For an industry that has been battered in recent years by the pandemic, work stoppages and the upheaval caused by streaming, it was a triumphant weekend that showed the still-potent power of Hollywood\u2019s blockbuster machine. Before \u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cMoana 2\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d arrived in theaters, ticket sales were running about 25% behind pre-pandemic levels.",
      "Michael O\u2019Leary, president and chief executive of the National Association of Theatre Owners, said the weekend showed what\u2019s possible when \u201call the pieces of the puzzle come together\u201d in compelling big-budget movies with marketing muscle.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very optimistic that this weekend is the start of what we believe is a full-on charge into the future,\u201d he said. \"The remaining quarter of this year looks very promising and then on into 2025 and 2026. We\u2019re hoping next year is the first kind of normal year this industry has had in a long time.\u201d",
      "Like the last time such anticipated movies collided on the release calendar \u2014 2023's much-ballyhooed \u201cBarbenheimer\" \u2014 the movie industry again could see evidence of a rising moviegoing tide lifting all blockbusters. In recent years, studios have typically tried to space out most of their biggest releases. Earlier this fall, \u201cVenom: The Last Dance,\" for example, was the No. 1 film for three straight weeks, despite not being particularly successful.",
      "\u201cFor a long, long time in Hollywood, there\u2019s been a belief that you don\u2019t put big blockbuster movies up against each other,\u201d said O'Leary. \u201cBut the truth of the matter is that competition is good. It\u2019s good for the movies. It\u2019s good for the studios. It\u2019s good for the theater owners. But it\u2019s particularly good for the moviegoing public.\u201d",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d was the nexus of a strategy shift for Disney. When it first began development, it was fashioned as a series for streaming. But when Bob Iger returned as chief executive, he reconsidered the balance between theatrical and streaming. The original \u201cMoana,\" after all, was the most streamed movie on Disney+ in 2023, with the added benefit of $680 million in box office in 2016. Only in February this year did Iger announce the release of \u201cMoana 2,\" with Auli\u2019i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson returning as the voices of Moana and Maui.",
      "\u201cIt just shows you that the big screen and small screen are not adversarial. They can be complementary and additive,\u201d says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cWhoever made that decision to go big screen globally with \u2018Moana 2,' that was one of the greatest decisions ever.\u201d",
      "And it helped lead a resurgence for Walt Disney Co., whose last two animated November releases \u2014 \u201cStrange World\u201d and \u201cWish\u201d \u2014 fizzled in theaters. \u201cMoana 2\u201d may become the third $1 billion-grossing movie for the studio in 2024, along with \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine.\u201d Though reviews for \u201cMoana 2\" have only been 65% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes, audiences gave it an \u201cA-\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d is also part of a major rebound for family moviegoing. According to David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment, family moviegoing in 2024 is going to account for approximately $6.8 billion in ticket sales, roughly the sums of 2022 and 2023, combined.",
      "After such large debuts, \u201cMoana 2\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d are likely to continue to drive moviegoing through December. The only question will be if this year's Christmas movies \u2014 historically a much bigger holiday period for theaters \u2014 can come anywhere near the Thanksgiving lineup. Among the movies aiming for that holiday corridor are Disney's \u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d Paramount's \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\" and Searchlight's \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as a young Bob Dylan.",
      "Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:",
      "1. \"Moana 2,\" $135 million.",
      "2. \u201cWicked,\u201d $80 million.",

      "THE HAGUE -- The top United Nations court will take up the largest case in its history on Monday, when it opens two weeks of hearings into what countries worldwide are legally required to do to combat climate change and help vulnerable nations fight its devastating impact.",
      "After years of lobbying by island nations who fear they could simply disappear under rising sea waters, the U.N. General Assembly asked the International Court of Justice last year for an opinion on \u201cthe obligations of States in respect of climate change.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe want the court to confirm that the conduct that has wrecked the climate is unlawful,\u201d Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh, who is leading the legal team for the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, told The Associated Press.",
      "In the decade up to 2023, sea levels have risen by a global average of around 4.3 centimeters (1.7 inches), with parts of the Pacific rising higher still. The world has also warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels.",
      "Vanuatu is one of a group of small states pushing for international legal intervention in the climate crisis.",
      "\u201cWe live on the front lines of climate change impact. We are witnesses to the destruction of our lands, our livelihoods, our culture and our human rights,\u201d Vanuatu\u2019s climate change envoy Ralph Regenvanu told reporters ahead of the hearing.",
      "Any decision by the court would be non-binding advice and unable to directly force wealthy nations into action to help struggling countries. Yet it would be more than just a powerful symbol since it could serve as the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits.",
      "On Sunday, ahead of the hearing, advocacy groups will bring together environmental organizations from around the world. Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change \u2014 who first developed the idea of requesting an advisory opinion \u2014 together with World Youth for Climate Justice plan an afternoon of speeches, music and discussions.",

      "Last month at the United Nations\u2019 annual climate meeting, countries cobbled together an agreement on how rich countries can support poor countries in the face of climate disasters. Wealthy countries have agreed to pool together at least $300 billion a year by 2035 but the total is short of the $1.3 trillion that experts, and threatened nations, said is needed.",
      "\u201cFor our generation and for the Pacific Islands, the climate crisis is an existential threat. It is a matter of survival, and the world\u2019s biggest economies are not taking this crisis seriously. We need the ICJ to protect the rights of people at the front lines,\u201d Vishal Prasad, of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, told reporters in a briefing.",
      "Fifteen judges from around the world will seek to answer two questions: What are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? And what are the legal consequences for governments where their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment?",
      "The second question makes particular reference to \u201csmall island developing States\u201d likely to be hardest hit by climate change and to \u201cmembers of \u201cthe present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change.\u201d",
      "The judges were even briefed on the science behind rising global temperatures by the U.N.\u2019s climate change body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ahead of the hearings.",
      "The case at the ICJ follows a number of rulings around the world ordering governments to do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "In May, a U.N. tribunal on maritime law said that carbon emissions qualify as marine pollution and countries must take steps to adapt to and mitigate their adverse effects.",
      "That ruling came a month after Europe\u2019s highest human rights court said that countries must better protect their people from the consequences of climate change, in a landmark judgment that could have implications across the continent.",
      "The ICJ\u2019s host country of The Netherlands made history when a court ruled in 2015 that protection from the potentially devastating effects of climate change is a human right and that the government has a duty to protect its citizens. The judgment was upheld in 2019 by the Dutch Supreme Court."

      "TORONTO -- Canada's ambassador to the United States said Sunday that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was successful in getting President-elect Donald Trump and key Cabinet nominees to understand that lumping Canada in with Mexico over the flow of drugs and migrants into the U.S. is unfair.",
      "Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador in Washington, told The Associated Press in an interview that Trudeau's dinner with Trump on Friday was a very important step in trying to get Trump to back away from threatened tariffs on all products from the major American trading partner.",
      "Hillman was at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and sat at an adjacent table to Trudeau and Trump.",
      "Trump threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if they don\u2019t stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders. He said in a social media post last Monday he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders.",
      "Hillman said Trudeau asked to see Trump in person in a phone call Monday and Trump invited him to dinner on Friday.",
      "At the dinner, Hillman said the case was made to Trump that there is no comparison between the Canada-U.S. border and Mexico-U.S. border.",
      "\u201cThe message that our border is so vastly different than the Mexican border was really understood,\u201d Hillman said.",
      "Hillman said the bulk of Friday night's dinner centered around Trump's border concerns. The ambassador said a priority of Trudeau's was to point out the degree of difference.",
      "Hillman said there really is no comparison, noting there is essentially zero trafficking of fentanyl from Canada to the United States. She said there are seizures but authorities say those are personal use seizures and not criminal trafficking. She said that 99.8% of the fentanyl seized by U.S. authorities in the U.S. comes from Mexico.",
      "\u201cAlso with respect to individuals, illegal individuals crossing illegally, Canada last year was less than one percent, 0.6 percent were of total interceptions from Canada,\u201d Hillman said.",
      "U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian border between October 2023 and September 2024 \u2014 and Hillman said the migrant numbers are coming down since the summer.",
      "\u201cThe facts are hard to deny,\u201d Hillman said.",
      "But Hillman said Canada is ready to make new investments in border security and there are plans for more helicopters, drones and law enforcement officers.",
      "She also noted an agreement between Canada and the United States that allows for migrants caught crossing illegally into the United States to be sent back to Canada. She said that was talked about. She said Mexico and the U.S. do not have a similar agreement.",
      "At the dinner that lasted three hours, Hillman said America's trade deficit with Canada was also raised. Hillman said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year but noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. are energy exports and prices have been high.",
      "\u201cTrade balances are something that he focuses so it\u2019s important to engage in that conversation but to put it into context,\" Hillman said.",
      "\u201cWe are one tenth the size of the United States so a balanced trade deal would mean per capita we are buying 10 times more from the U.S. than they are buying from us. If that\u2019s his metric we will certainly engage on that.\"",
      "Joining Trump and Trudeau at dinner were Howard Lutnick, Trump\u2019s nominee for commerce secretary, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Interior Department, Mike Waltz, Trump\u2019s choice to be his national security adviser, and the three men\u2019s wives.",
      "Also at the dinner were David McCormick, just elected U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, and his wife, Dina Powell, a former deputy national security adviser under Trump, as well as Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, whose responsibilities include border security, and Katie Telford, Trudeau\u2019s chief of staff.",
      "Hillman said Canadian and incoming Trump administration officials will work on Trump's concerns in the coming weeks. Trump called the talks \u201cproductive\u201d on Sunday in a social media post but signaled no retreat from his tariff pledge.",
      "Hillman said Trump and Trudeau \"get along well\" and the dinner was also a chance to socialize. She said Trump used his iPad to play music and she said Trump told Trudeau he's a big fan of Canadian singer Celine Dion.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it could have been better to be frank. Okay, I\u2019ll take that back, I\u2019ll change that. If he obviously said there would be no tariffs that would have been better but there was no realistic expectation of that,\u201d Hillman said.",
      "Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day.",
      "About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada.",
      "Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.",
      "Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 77% of Canada\u2019s exports go to the U.S."

      "As head of PSA Peugeot, Tavares took control of the Netherlands-based company in January 2021 \u2014 when it merged with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, creating an automotive giant that is the parent to several well-known brands today. Beyond Jeep, Citro\u00ebn and Ram, Stellantis\u2019 portfolio includes Dodge, Chrysler, Fiat, Peugeot, Maserati and Opel.",
      "Stellantis' North American operations had been the company\u2019s main source of profits for some time, but struggles piled up this year \u2014 with the company citing larger market changes and rising competition.",
      "For its third quarter, Stellantis posted 27% plunge in net revenues, as gaps in launching new products and action to reduce inventories also slashed global shipments of new vehicles by 20%.",
      "The carmaker reported net revenues of 33 billion euros (nearly $36 billion ) in the three-month period ending Sept. 30, down from 45 billion euros in the same period last year. All regions except South America reported double-digit dips in revenues \u2014 led by North America, which plunged 42% to 12.4 billion euros. Europe revenues dropped 12% to 12.5 billion euros.",
      "In recent months, Tavares had been under fire from U.S. dealers and the United Auto Workers union after the release of dismal financial performance reports. He also oversaw cost-cutting efforts that included delaying factory openings and laying off union workers \u2014 adding to further strain with the UAW, which filed several grievances against Stellantis and threatened to strike in recent months.",
      "Beyond the U.S., Stellantis has faced pressure in Italy \u2014 where lawmakers questioned the former chief executive over the company's production plans in October, with the far-right government accusing the company of relocating assembly plants to low-cost countries. Tens of thousands of autoworkers in the country also held a one-day walkout, calling for more employment certainty and protections.",
      "In efforts to revive sales, Stellantis previously made a number of leadership changes in October, which included new heads of operations in North America and Europe. At the time, the company expected Tavares to step down in early 2026, closer to the end of his five-year contract.",
      "The company confirmed in September that it was searching for a CEO to eventually succeed Tavares, but maintained that those efforts were part of standard leadership transition plans.",
      "In a statement Sunday, Stellantis\u2019 senior independent director Henri de Castries said that Stellantis' success is \u201crooted in a perfect alignment\u201d between shareholders, the company's board and the CEO \u2014 but noted that \u201cdifferent views\u201d had emerged in recent weeks, resulting in the decision to approve Tavares' resignation.",
      "Elkann, the chairperson of Stellantis' board, thanked Tavares for \u201chis years of dedicated service and the role he has played in the creation of Stellantis\u201d in an additional statement. He added that he looks forward to appointing a new CEO.",
      "Stellantis did not comment further beyond Sunday's announcement."

      "BUSAN, South Korea -- Negotiations on a treaty to end plastic pollution have concluded in Busan, South Korea without reaching an agreement.",
      "This was supposed to be the fifth and final round to produce the first legally binding treaty on plastics pollution, including in the oceans, by the end of 2024.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the talks:",
      "After a week of talks and with time running out early Monday, negotiators agreed to meet again next year. They don\u2019t yet have firm plans.",
      "This has been the largest session with more than 3,300 participants at the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution, including delegates from over 170 countries and representatives of nearly 450 organizations.",
      "\u201cWe have tested the resilience of our planet to its limit,\u201d INC Executive Secretary Jyoti Mathur-Filipp said as the meeting closed. \u201cNow is the time for us to push our own limits and honor the trust placed in us.\u201d",
      "The most contentious issue of the talks has been whether there will be a limit on the amount of plastic that companies are allowed to produce. Panama proposed text for the treaty to address plastic production and support for it quickly grew to over 100 countries.",
      "It was a compromise to build consensus because it did not include a numerical target or production cap. Instead, it proposed that countries would adopt a global target at a later conference of the parties meeting.",
      "Juan Carlos Monterrey, the head of Panama\u2019s delegation, said Monday that the nations standing up for a strong treaty may have been delayed, but they will not be stopped.",
      "Their ambition prevailed at these negotiations because they banded together, said Ana Rocha, who leads international plastic policy work at the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives.",
      "\u201cThis one was a moment that these countries were able to stand and say, \u2018No, we are not going to take it this way. We are going to fight,\u2019\u201d she said after the meeting adjourned.",
      "Most of the negotiations in Busan took place behind closed doors, leaving few opportunities for any observers to help shape the treaty.",
      "The International Indigenous Peoples Forum on Plastics said as the session closed that they were profoundly disappointed with how the process unfolded, and condemned the draft of the global treaty for excluding Indigenous voices and failing to uphold their rights.",
      "U.N. Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen said she has not heard a single delegate say they would not want this treaty.",
      "\u201cWe may close this session today but the world will still be watching tomorrow,\u201d she said in her closing remarks. \u201cAnd the plastic pollution will still be arriving on our shores, and so our work will continue.\u201d",

      "NEW DELHI -- Indian tycoon Gautam Adani said his conglomerate is committed to \u201cworld-class regulatory compliance\u201d after being indicted in the U.S. on fraud charges and an alleged bribery scheme worth millions of dollars, his first remarks since the accusations surfaced.",
      "Adani, 62, is one of Asia\u2019s richest men and perceived as close to Prime Minister Narendra Mo di. He was thrust into the spotlight on Nov. 20 when U.S. prosecutors in New York charged him and seven of his associates with securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and wire fraud, as well as duping investors by concealing that his company\u2019s huge solar energy project on the subcontinent was being facilitated by bribes.",
      "They were accused of allegedly paying or planning to pay about $265 million in bribes to government officials to help secure contracts and financing amounting to billions of dollars.",
      "\u201cThis is not the first time we have faced such challenges. What I can tell you is that every attack makes us stronger. And every obstacle becomes a stepping stone for a more resilient Adani Group,\u201d Adani said late Saturday at an awards ceremony in the northern Indian city of Jaipur.",
      "The businessman said roadblocks his group faces are \u201cthe price of pioneering.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe more bold your dreams, the more the world will scrutinize you,\u201d he said. \u201cIn today\u2019s world negativity spreads faster than facts. And as we work through the legal process, I want to reconfirm our absolute commitment to world-class regulatory compliance.\u201d",
      "The Adani Group, in a statement last week, said the allegations by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against directors of Adani Green were baseless.",
      "Adani\u2019s imprint across India\u2019s economy runs deep. His group is the country\u2019s largest operator of coal mines and largest infrastructure developer, operating several ports and airports, and employing tens of thousands of people. Despite his fossil fuel roots, Adani has ambitions to become the world\u2019s largest player in renewable energy by 2030.",
      "Analysts say a key factor in his meteoric rise over the years has been his knack for aligning his group\u2019s priorities with those of the Modi government. His critics accuse him of crony capitalism and gaining preferential treatment from the state which has facilitated him winning governmental contracts. The group has repeatedly denied the accusation.",
      "The controversy has already affected Adani\u2019s interests overseas.",
      "Kenya\u2019s president on Nov. 21 canceled multimillion-dollar deals with the Adani Group for airport modernization and energy projects.",
      "A Sri Lankan government spokesperson said earlier this week that it is reviewing projects to be implemented by the Adani Group in Sri Lanka. The group was set to invest over $440 million under a 20-year agreement to develop 484 megawatts of wind power in the northeastern regions of Sri Lanka and develop a terminal in the Colombo port.",
      "Bangladesh\u2019s interim government is also reviewing an agreement under which the Adani Group supplies electricity to Bangladesh from a power project in India."

    "story": [
      "Ultra low-cost online retailers Temu and Shein are giving Western retailers a run for their money this holiday shopping season",
      "Shopping on Temu can feel like playing an arcade game. Instead of using a joystick-controlled claw to grab a toy, visitors to the online marketplace maneuver their computer mouses or cellphone screens to browse colorful gadgets, accessories and trinkets with prices that look too good to refuse.",
      "A pop-up spinning wheel offers the chance to win a coupon. Rotating captions warn that a less than $2 camouflage print balaclava and a $1.23 skeleton hand back scratcher are \u201cAlmost sold out.\u201d A flame symbol indicates a $9.69 plush cat print hoodie is selling fast. A timed-down selection of discounted items adds to the sense of urgency.",
      "Welcome to the new online world of impulse buying, a place of guilty pleasures where the selection is vast, every day is Cyber Monday, and an instant dopamine hit that will have faded by the time your package arrives is always just a click away.",
      "By all accounts, we\u2019re living in an accelerating age for consumerism, one that Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein, its fierce rival, supercharged with social media savvy and an interminable assortment of cheap goods, most shipped directly from merchants in China based on real-time demand.",
      "The business models of the two platforms, coupled with avalanches of digital or influencer advertising, have enabled them to give Western retailers a run for their money this holiday shopping season.",
      "Software company Salesforce said it expects roughly one in five online purchases in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada to be made through four online marketplaces based or founded in Asia: Shein, Temu, TikTok Shop - the e-commerce arm of video-sharing platform TikTok - and AliExpress.",
      "Analysts with Salesforce said they are expected to pull in roughly $160 billion in global sales outside of China. Most of the sales will go to Temu and Shein, a privately held company which is thought to lead the worldwide fast fashion market in revenue.",
      "Lisa Xiaoli Neville, a nonprofit manager who lives in Los Angeles, is sold on Shein. The bedroom of her home is stocked with jeans, shoes, press-on nails and other items from the ultra-fast fashion retailer, all of which she amassed after getting on the platform to purchase a $2 pair of earrings she saw in a Facebook ad.",
      "Neville, 46, estimates she spends at least $75 a month on products from Shein. A $2 eggshell opener, a portable apple peeler and an apple corer - both costing less than $5 - are among the quirky, single-use kitchen tools taking up drawer space. She acknowledges she doesn\u2019t need them because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t even cook like that.\u201d Plus, she\u2019s allergic to apples.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t eat apples. It will kill me,\u201d Neville said, laughing. \u201cBut I still want the coring thing.\u201d",
      "Shein, now based in Singapore, uses some of the same web design features as Temu\u2019s, such as pop-up coupons and ads, to persuade shoppers to keep clicking, but it appears a bit more restrained in its approach.",
      "Shein primarily targets young women through partnerships with social media influencers. Searching the company's name on video platforms turns up creators promoting Shein's Black Friday sales event and displaying the dozens of of trendy clothes and accessories they got for comparatively little money.",
      "But the Shein-focused content also includes videos of TikTokers saying they're embarrassed to admit they shopped there and critics lashing out at fans for not taking into account the environmental harms or potential labor abuses associated with products that are churned out and shipped worldwide at a speedy pace.",
      "Neville has already picked out holiday gifts for family and friends from the site. Most of the products in her online cart cost under $10, including graphic T-shirts she intends to buy for her son and jeans and loafers for her daughter. All told, she plans to spend about $200 on gifts, significantly less than $500 she used to shell out at other stores in prior years.",
      "\u201cThe visuals just make you want to spend more money,\u201d she said, referring to the clothes on Shein's site. \u201cThey're very cheap and everything is just so cute.\u201d",
      "Unlike Shein, Temu's appeal cuts across age groups and gender. The platform is the world\u2019s second most-visited online shopping site, software company Similarweb reported in September. Customers go there looking for practical items like doormats and silly products like a whiskey flask shaped like a vintage cellphone from the 1990s.",
      "Temu advertised Black Friday bargains for some items at upwards of 70% off the recommended retail price. Making a purchase can quickly result in receiving dozens of emails offering free giveaways. The caveat: customers have to buy more products.",
      "Ellen Flowers, 36, a lifestyle blogger who lives in Dallas, recently decided to pair a $3,500 dining table with $25 dining chairs from Temu to save money. She's also purchased clothes from Temu. The quality or fit wasn't always always great, so Flowers donated some unwanted pieces to thrift stores to avoid paying return shipping fees that would cost almost as much as the clothes.",
      "Flowers planned to buy stocking stuffers on Temu as well as baubles for an ornament-swapping party in early December. She also wanted to buy necklaces and bracelets for an activity at her 5-year-old niece's upcoming birthday party.",
      "\u201cI love buying my nieces presents,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cSince they\u2019re young, they don\u2019t need the Louis Vuitton handbag. I can give them a cute handbag from Temu. Then they\u2019ll lose interest in a month and I\u2019ll buy them another one.\u201d",
      "Despite their rise, Temu and Shein have proven particularly ripe for pushback. Last year, a coalition of unnamed brands and organizations launched a campaign to oppose Shein in Washington. U.S. lawmakers also have raised the possibility that Temu is allowing goods made with forced labor to enter the country.",
      "More recently, the Biden administration put forward rules that would crack down on a trade rule known as the de minimis exception, which has allowed a lot of cheap products to come into the U.S. duty-free. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to slap high tariffs on goods from China, a move that would likely raise prices and across the retail world.",
      "Both Shein and Temu have set up warehouses in the U.S. to speed up delivery times and help them better compete with Amazon, which is trying to erode their price advantage through a new storefront that also ships products directly from China.",
      "Meanwhile, Temu is onboarding Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that would allow the company to not be as exposed to changes around the de minimus trade rule, said Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse.",
      "The change comes as both Shein and Temu are attempting to expand beyond the bargain-hungry shoppers who popularized their platforms. Temu is allowing sellers to ship products to customers from local U.S. warehouses and says the move will allow it to sell larger items like furniture as it expands its selection of big-ticket items.",
      "Meanwhile, American children's clothing retailer The Children\u2019s Place signed a deal last month to distribute its products through Shein\u2019s platform. Last year, Shein went into business with women's fashion retailer Forever 21. It has been working to recruit other brands and reportedly has hopes of getting listed on the London Stock Exchange."

      "The new law also establishes fundamental rights for sex workers including the right to refuse clients, choose their practices and stop an act at any moment.",
      "The move follows the country\u2019s 2022 decision to decriminalize sex work.",
      "Under the new regulations, sex workers will have access to health insurance, paid leave, maternity benefits, unemployment support and pensions.

      "\u201cThis is an incredible step forward,\u201d said Isabelle Jaramillo, coordinator of Espace P, an advocacy group involved in drafting the legislation. \u201cIt means their profession can finally be recognized as legitimate by the Belgian state.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom the employer\u2019s perspective, this will also be a revolution. They\u2019ll have to apply for a state authorization to hire sex workers,\u201d Jaramillo said.",
      "\u201cUnder the previous legislation, hiring someone for sex work automatically made you a pimp, even if the arrangement was consensual,\u201d said Jaramillo. \u201cNow, They\u2019ll have to apply for state authorization to hire employees.\u201d",
      "Employers must now obtain authorization, adhere to strict safety protocols, and meet background requirements, including no prior convictions for sexual assault or human trafficking. They must provide clean linens, condoms, and hygiene products, and install emergency buttons in workspaces.",

      "The cucumber outbreak sickened 68 people, including 18 who were hospitalized, in 19 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. No one has died. Produce grown in Sonora, Mexico, by Agrotato S.A. may be the culprit, the agency said.",

      "The S&P 500 rose 0.6% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4%. Both indexes closed out November with their best monthly performances of the year. The Nasdaq added 0.8%. Friday was an abbreviated trading day, with stocks closing at 1 p.m. ET and the bond market an hour later.",

    "summary": "It was an alarming, even sickening, suggestion: Farmers in Zimbabwe hit hard by drought should farm maggots to feed their animals and boost their household incomes",
    "story": [
      "It was an alarming, even sickening, suggestion: Farmers in Zimbabwe hit hard by drought should farm maggots to feed their animals and boost their household incomes",
      "NYANGAMBE, Zimbabwe -- At first, the suggestion to try farming maggots spooked Mari Choumumba and other farmers in Nyangambe, a region in southeastern Zimbabwe where drought wiped out the staple crop of corn.",
      "After multiple cholera outbreaks in the southern African nation resulting from extreme weather and poor sanitation, flies were largely seen as something to exterminate, not breed.",
      "\u201cWe were alarmed,\u201d Choumumba said, recalling a community meeting where experts from the government and the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, broached the idea.",
      "People had flocked to the gathering in hope of news about food aid. But many stepped back when told it was about training on farming maggots for animal feed and garden manure.",
      "\u201cPeople were like, \u2018What? These are flies, flies bring cholera\u2019,\u201d Choumumba said.",
      "A year later, the 54-year-old walks with a smile to a smelly cement pit covered by wire mesh where she feeds rotting waste to maggots \u2014 her new meal ticket.",
      "After harvesting the insects about once a month, Choumumba turns them into protein-rich feed for her free-range chickens that she eats and sells.",
      "Up to 80% of chicken production costs were gobbled up by feed for rural farmers before they took up maggot farming. Many couldn\u2019t afford the $35 charged by stores for a 50-kilogram (about 110-pound) bag of poultry feed, said Francis Makura, a specialist with a USAID program aimed at broadening revenue streams for farmers affected by climate change.",
      "But maggot farming reduces production costs by about 40%, he said.",
      "The maggots are offspring of the black soldier fly, which originates in tropical South America. Unlike the house fly, it is not known to spread disease.",
      "Their life cycle lasts just weeks, and they lay between 500 and 900 eggs. The larvae devour decaying organic items \u2014 from rotting fruit and vegetables to kitchen scraps and animal manure \u2014 and turn them into a rich protein source for livestock.",
      "\u201cIt is even better than the crude protein we get from soya,\u201d said Robert Musundire, a professor specializing in agricultural science and entomology at Chinhoyi University of Technology in Zimbabwe, which breeds the insects and helps farmers with breeding skills.",
      "Donors and governments have pushed for more black soldier fly maggot farming in Africa because of its low labor and production costs and huge benefits to agriculture, the continent\u2019s mainstay that is under pressure from climate change and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "In Uganda, the maggots helped plug a fertilizer crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. In Nigeria and Kenya, they are becoming a commercial success.",
      "In Zimbabwe, the government and partners piloted it among farmers struggling with securing soya meal for their animals. A World Bank-led project later used it as a recovery effort for communities affected by a devastating 2019 cyclone.",
      "Now it is becoming a lifesaver for some communities in the country of 15 million people where repeated droughts make it difficult to grow corn. It's not clear how many people across the country are involved in maggot-farming projects.",
      "At first, \u201ca mere 5%\u201d of farmers that Musundire, the professor, approached agreed to venture into maggot farming. Now that\u2019s up to \u201cabout 50%,\u201d he said, after people understood the protein benefits and the lack of disease transmission.",
      "The \u201cyuck factor\u201d was an issue. But necessity triumphed, he said.",
      "With the drought decimating crops and big livestock such as cattle \u2014 a traditional symbol of wealth and status and a source of labor \u2014 small livestock like chickens are helping communities recover more quickly.",
      "\u201cThey can fairly raise a decent livelihood out of the resources they have within a short period of time,\u201d Musundire said.",
      "It also helps the environment. Zimbabwe produces about 1.6 million tons of waste annually, 90% of which can be recycled or composted, according to the country\u2019s Environmental Management Agency. Experts say feeding it to maggots can help reduce greenhouse emissions in a country where garbage collection is erratic.",
      "At a plot near the university, Musundire and his students run a maggot breeding center in the city of 100,000 people. The project collects over 35 metric tons a month in food waste from the university\u2019s canteens as well as vegetable markets, supermarkets, abattoirs, food processing companies and beer brewers.",
      "\u201cFood waste is living, it respires and it contributes to the generation of greenhouse gases,\u201d Musundire said.",
      "According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, food loss \u2014 which occurs in the stages before reaching the consumer \u2014 and food waste after sale account for 8% to 10% of greenhouse gas emissions globally, or about five times that of the aviation sector.",
      "The university project converts about 20-30 metric tons of the waste into livestock protein or garden manure in about two weeks.",
      "Choumambo said people often sneer as she goes around her own community collecting banana peels and other waste that people toss out at the market and bus station.",
      "\u201cI tell them we have good use for it, it is food for our maggots,\u201d she said. She still has to contend with \u201cignorant\u201d people who accuse maggot farmers of \u201cbreeding cholera.\u201d",
      "But she cares little about that as her farm begins to thrive.",
      "From bare survival, it is becoming a profitable venture. She can harvest up to 15 kilograms (about 33 pounds) of maggots in 21 days, turning out 375 kilograms (826.7 pounds) of chicken feed after mixing it with drought-tolerant crops such as millets, cowpeas and sunflower and a bit of salt.",
      "Choumambo sells some of the feed to fellow villagers at a fraction of the cost charged by stores for traditional animal feed. She also sells eggs and free-range chickens, a delicacy in Zimbabwe, to restaurants. She's one of 14 women in her village taking up the project.",
      "\u201cI never imagined keeping and surviving on maggots,\u201d she said, taking turns with a neighbor to mix rotting vegetables, corn meal and other waste in a tank using a shovel.",
      "\u201cMany people would puke at the sight and the stench. But this is the sweet smell of food for the maggots, and for us, the farmers.\u201d",

      "Inflation has come down a long way from the peak of 10.6% in October 2022 as the ECB quickly raised rates to cool off price rises. It then started cutting them in June as worries about growth came into sharper focus.",

Higher rates make buying things on credit \u2014 whether a car, a house or a new factory \u2014 more expensive and thus reduce demand for goods and take pressure off prices. However, higher rates can also dampen growth.",

      "Over 200 police, marines and inspectors raided a building known as \u201cMexico Mart\u201d in the city\u2019s colonial center Thursday and seized around 90,000 counterfeit products that masqueraded as name-brand goods. They seized a total of over 262,000 products that had no receipts, import documents or, in some cases, even labels.",
      "It is not clear if the counterfeits \u2014 which included imitations of Marvel, Sanr\u00edo, Disney and Nintendo products \u2014 were part of the 262,000 product count, or were counted separately. Officials said it took seven hours to seize all the merchandise.",
      "The entire facade of the building is labelled in Chinese characters, as are most of the stores inside. Authorities said the goods were from China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Vietnam.",
      "The timing of the raid was noteworthy, given that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25% import duties on Mexican products, and some U.S. politicians have worried that Mexico was serving as a conduit for Chinese goods to flood the American market.",
      "There was no evidence that any of the goods were intended for re-export to the United States; they appeared destined for Mexican street vendors who flood the downtown area around Christmas.",
      "But it was also clear that authorities had known for a long time what went on in the complex, which resembles a shopping center for wholesalers or bulk buyers. Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said three raids had been carried out previously at the same address.",

      "NEW YORK -- Retailers used giveaways and big discounts to reward U.S. shoppers who ventured out for Black Friday even as earlier offers, the prospect of better bargains in the days ahead and the ease of e-commerce drained much of the excitement from the holiday shopping season's much-hyped kickoff.",
      "Frequent deals throughout the month and more awaiting on Cyber Monday gave consumers less of a reason to squabble over store shelves while trying to get their hands on TVs or toys. But shopping malls and merchants big and small used the day after Thanksgiving to entice customers into physical stores at a time when many prefer to browse and buy online.",
      "Some Target shoppers lined up as early as 11:30 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day to get their hands on an exclusive book devoted to Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour and a bonus edition of her \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology\u201d album. Although both will be available purchase online starting Saturday, many locations sold out their supply of the products, the discount retailer said.",
      "At a Target in Southfield, Michigan, a few miles north of Detroit, Marge Evans, 32, used her cellphone to take and send photos of shirts, sweaters and other apparel with Black Friday markdowns.

      "\u201cI\u2019ll see what things are looking like the first week in January,\u201d the 32-year-old massage therapist said. \u201cReally, after the holidays are over is when the real deals come through. They get rid of everything.\u201d",
      "Industry analysts observed Black Friday shoppers displaying the same choosy, deal-driven behavior many U.S. consumers exhibited all year while adjusting prices after the period of inflation that started toward the end of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "At many stores, the huge crowds of Black Fridays past never returned after the pandemic. A Walmart in Germantown, Maryland, had only half of the parking spots filled on Friday morning. Some shoppers were returning items or buying groceries.",
      "Bharatharaj Moruejsan, a 35-year-old software engineer, decided to check out Walmart's offers because he was jet-lagged after returning from a month-long family vacation to India. He scored an iPad for his 1-year-old daughter for $250, 32% off its original $370 price tag.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a good deal,\u201d Moruejsan said.",
      "After visiting stores and shopping centers on Long Island, Marshal Cohen, chief retail adviser at market research firm Circana, said that apart from people lining up for Target's Taylor Swift merchandise, the number of shoppers appeared typical.",
      "\u201cThe spreading out of the holidays has created the lack of need and lack of urgency,\u201d said Cohen, who had a 20-person team monitoring crowds nationwide. \u201cThis is going to be a long, slow tedious process\u201d of getting shoppers to buy, he said.",

      "Retailers that offered at least 40% off drove shoppers\u2019 attention, according to Brown. For example, Forever 21 had 50% to 70% discounts and had lines to the stores, while H&M, which offered 30% discounts, was relatively quiet.",

      "Across the board, Black Friday weekend discounts should peak at 30% on Cyber Monday and then retreat to around 15%, according to Adobe\u2019s research.",
      "Analysts forecast a solid holiday shopping season overall in the U.S., though perhaps not as robust as last year. Retailers were even more under the gun to get shoppers in to buy early and in bulk since there are five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year.",
      "Shoppers at Lakeside Shopping Center in Metairie, Louisiana, were treated to a glass of champagne and a $50 gift receipt.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The owner of an oil field in Los Angeles County is suing the state of California over a law that will require it to stop production and plug its wells or face costly fines.",
      "Inglewood Oil Field owner Sentinel Peak argues in the lawsuit, filed this week, that the law, which was signed in September by Gov. Gavin Newsom, is unconstitutional, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.",
      "It is was one of several laws aiming to reduce pollution by giving local governments more authority to restrict oil and gas operations by shutting down so-called idle wells, which are not in use but have not been properly sealed and closed, and fining companies for operating low-producing oil wells in the Inglewood field.",
      "The 1,000-acre area southwest of downtown Los Angeles has approximately 820 unplugged wells, including 420 that are actively pumping. Roughly 80% of the operating wells are considered low-producing, meaning they yield less than 15 barrels of oil or 60,000 cubic feet of gas per day, the newspaper reported.",
      "Attorneys for Sentinel Peak argue that the law \u201crepresents an illegal attempt to coerce an individual company to stop operation of its legal business,\u201d according to court documents. They allege that mandatory fines, in particular, violate federal and state laws forbidding excessive fines.",
      "The suit calls the penalties \u201cgrossly\u201d disproportionate, with \u201cno apparent upper limit\u201d or \u201crelationship to any actual harm.\u201d",
      "The California Department of Conservation\u2019s Geological Energy Management Division, the state oil and gas regulator, declined to comment on the lawsuit.",

      "\u201cOur community has stood strong for decades to close this dangerous low-producing oil field, and we will stand strong in court to protect those frontline communities who have long deserved the right to live a full and healthy life,\u201d Bryan told the Times. \u201cThe people of California spoke through their legislature that dangerous oil wells have no business right next to the community.\u201d"

      "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional care homes, worried about abandonment and quality issues",
      "HONG KONG -- Every Wednesday, retiree Zhang Zhili travels an hour by bus to an education center, drawn by the pulsing rhythms of the African drum she plays there in a classroom filled with fellow retirees whose hands move in unison, every beat lifting her spirits.",
      "Zhang, 71, has found joy and new friends at the \u201celderly university\u201d in Beijing. Besides African drums, the former primary school teacher joins social dance classes, paying about 2,000 yuan ($280) for two courses this semester. Seeing herself standing tall in dance class boosts her confidence. After class, she hangs out with her friends.",
      "\u201cWhen we get old, what do we need?\" she said. \u201cTo love ourselves.\u201d",
      "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional nursing homes, afraid of abandonment by their families and quality issues. That's driving a boom in universities, home care services, and communities catering to older adults. Though some providers struggle to turn a profit, they persist because they see promise in the growing market.",
      "China has a rapidly aging population. Last year, about 297 million people were aged 60 or above, over one-fifth of the population. By 2035, this number is forecast to exceed 400 million, or over 30% of all Chinese.",
      "That's fueling growth in services and products aimed at older adults in what Beijing calls the silver economy, which is projected to balloon from about 7 trillion yuan (about $982 billion) currently to approximately 30 trillion yuan (about $4.2 trillion) in 2035, raising its share in the economy from about 6% to roughly 10%, Hu Zuquan, a researcher at the State Information Center, a public institution affiliated with China's main planning agency, told state media.",
      "Du Peng, dean of the school of population and health at Beijing's Renmin University, said the government is expanding basic care services to all older people who need them, moving beyond its traditional focus on those without family support. Last year, officials compiled a list of basic care services they aim to make available nationwide, including providing ability assessments for those over 65 and care training subsidies for family members of those who are disabled.",
      "Filial piety runs deep in China and most older people prefer aging at home with family after they retire, typically when they're 50 to 60 years old, one of the youngest retirement ages among the world\u2019s major economies. Many help care for their grandchildren, and for some, nursing homes are seen as a kind of abandonment, except in cases of serious disability.",
      "In January, Beijing issued new guidelines calling for expanding home care services and meal deliveries and more clothing, food and tech products tailored for older adults. They include enriching their lives through education.",
      "Home-based services offer a more affordable alternative to nursing homes, alleviating accommodation costs, Du said. Most older Chinese are relatively healthy, and these able people perhaps need richer cultural lives rather than disability care, he said.",
      "Cai Guixia, 60, said she has found fulfillment in African drumming and modeling classes. She thinks she would feel \u201cforsaken\u201d in a conventional nursing home, preferring to hire a domestic helper.",
      "Liu Xiuqin, an owner of two care homes, saw business opportunities in meeting those needs.",
      "She invested more than 800,000 yuan (about $112,000) to open a school in Beijing. Cai and Zhang are among its 150 students attending classes in dance, singing, yoga and modeling training for about 1,000 yuan ($140) per course each semester. Outside the classroom, her team organizes gatherings where students can socialize.",
      "Liu expects to break even in another year and is prepared for the wait. She believes in the market's future, given that the generation born in the 1960s and later values quality of life and health more than their parents did.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about making quick money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt requires persistence.\u201d",
      "Turning a profit is proving challenging for some silver economy businesses.",
      "In the southern city of Guangzhou, Wu Tang co-founded a school last year after his geotechnical investigation and surveying business was hit by the downturn in China\u2019s property market. His school offers courses to help people achieve some of their childhood dreams, but he has yet to cover his costs. He also faces competition from cheaper government-run courses.",
      "And there's Cui Yang, who runs a care station in Beijing, sending helpers zigzagging across the district to provide 30 yuan ($4.20) haircuts at home; accompanying people on hospital visits for 50 yuan ($7) per hour and other services. Even with government subsidies including free rent, Cui is losing money. Without the subsidies, the business would fail, she said.",
      "The struggles aren\u2019t limited to small operators.",
      "Wu Wenjing heads the home care department of a healthcare subsidiary of state-owned financial conglomerate China Everbright Group in southwest China's Chongqing. It has been in the red for 13 straight years, spending 5 million yuan (about $702,000) annually and still losing 1 million (about $140,000) a year, she said.",
      "Wu's business employs 70 workers who visit homes as caregivers, rehabilitation therapists and psychotherapists. The industry is competitive and it has a high turnover rate given the difficulties of working alone in clients\u2019 homes. Wu hopes to break even in five years, and is delighted about the government's efforts to grow the silver economy.",
      "\"The spring of China\u2019s elderly care business has finally come,\u201d she said.",
      "Various companies are looking to grab a slice of this government-backed market. Property developers like Vanke Co. and Sino-Ocean Group and insurance companies such as Taikang Insurance Group have built high-end communities for older adults with amenities such as movie-screening and mahjong rooms and dining services.",
      "China's also working to tackle the problem of dementia, providing cognitive screening tests and training staff who work in memory clinics or as social workers. Several Chinese pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working on drugs targeting Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia.",
      "Some vacant schools and kindergartens -- casualties of the country\u2019s declining birthrate -- are meanwhile being transformed into care facilities for older people.",
      "Government efforts to back the silver economy are paying off: official data showed the country had 410,000 care facilities by June, double the number in 2019.",
      "Still, questions remain about the spending power of many older Chinese.",
      "A 2021 national survey co-conducted by China's Civil Affairs Ministry found older adults had a median annual income of 11,400 yuan ($1,574). In rural areas it was less than half of that. More than one in 10 older Chinese are living in poverty, with living standards much lower in rural areas and western China, according to data from surveys conducted by Peking University.",
      "China's silver economy is still in its infancy, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis Corporate and Investment Banking.",
      "If they lack enough insurance to cover medical and other expenses, many older Chinese must set aside funds for such costs, limiting their spending capacity, he said, and it takes time to build industries producing senior-focused products and people trained to provide such services. Tax incentives and investments in training a skilled workforce would help, he said.",
      "\u201cThere are prospects here, but it seems there's still much that needs to be done,\u201d he said.",

      "Italy\u2019s most powerful trade unions called the eight-hour strike and mobilized marches in cities across the country to target Premier Giorgia Meloni\u2019s latest budget that they say penalizes schools, health care and other services. They also are pressing for a more equitable distribution of profits from private companies to workers.",
      "\u201cThese protests don\u2019t just speak to the government,\u2019\u2019 Maurizio Landini, head of the powerful CGIL conglomerate, told reporters in Bologna. \u201cThey speak also to entrepreneurs, managers and businesses, who in these years have made profits like never before.\u201d",
      "The strike forced ITA airlines to cancel dozens of domestic and international flights, and hit schools, hospitals and local transport. Unions called for an eight-hour strike but Transport Minister Matteo Salvini imposed an injunction limiting the strike in the transport sector to four hours.",
      "It was the first general strike since last November. Unions faced possible sanctions for involving the health care and justice sectors, which have staged strikes recently. The Italian railway, which also has been the target of recent labor actions, was exempted.",
      "Italy\u2019s health care sector has been suffering staffing shortages that has forced the hiring of nurses from abroad, with care in the poorer south particularly lagging that in the more prosperous north.",
      "\u201cThere are many people who go abroad because the salaries are too low,\u2019\u2019 said Anna Salsa, a member of the UIL health care union, at the demonstration in Rome. \u201cWe are forced to do double shifts to give the minimal levels of essential care.\u201d",
      "Protesters also cited persistent increases in the cost of basic necessities. Despite indications that inflation is cooling, the Codacons consumer protection lobby said that grocery costs for a family of four have risen by 238 euro ($251) a year in 2024 compared with last year, forcing many families to reduce their consumption.",
      "While starting salaries in Italy are aligned with the rest of Europe, pay increases do not keep pace, said Maurizio Del Conte, a labor law expert at Milan\u2019s Bocconi University. As a result, Italy\u2019s gross median salary of 35,000 euros (nearly $37,000) a year is at the low end of European averages, well behind its G7 partners in France and Germany.",
      "He noted that such protests are historically more influential when engaging center-left governments, which are friendly to unions, rather than conservative governments, such as Meloni's far-right-led government.",

      "REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- Icelanders voted to elect a new parliament Saturday after disagreements over immigration, energy policy and the economy forced Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson to pull the plug on his coalition government and call an early election.",
      "All polling stations managed to open despite fierce weather in the sub-Arctic nation that left roads in many areas blocked by snow. Ballot-counting began after polls closed at 10 p.m. local time (2200GMT), with results expected early Sunday.",
      "This is Iceland\u2019s sixth general election since the 2008 financial crisis devastated the economy of the North Atlantic island nation and ushered in a new era of political instability.",
      "Opinion polls suggested the country could be in for another upheaval, with support for the three governing parties plunging. Benediktsson, who was named prime minister in April following the resignation of his predecessor, struggled to hold together the unlikely coalition of his conservative Independence Party with the centrist Progressive Party and the Left-Green Movement.",
      "\u201cMy expectation is like, something new (is) going to happen, hopefully,\" said H\u00f6r\u00f0ur Gu\u00f0j\u00f3nsson, voting in the capital, Reykjavik. \u201cWe always have had these old parties taking care of things. I hope we see the light now to come in with a younger people, new ideas.\u201d",
      "Iceland, a nation of about 400,000 people, is proud of its democratic traditions, describing itself as arguably the world\u2019s oldest parliamentary democracy. The island\u2019s parliament, the Althingi, was founded in 930 by the Norsemen who settled the country.",
      "Voters are choosing 63 members of the Althingi in an election that will allocate seats both by regional constituencies and proportional representation. Parties need at least 5% of the vote to win seats in parliament. Eight parties were represented in the outgoing parliament, and 10 parties are contesting this election.",

      "A windswept island near the Arctic Circle, Iceland normally holds elections during the warmer months of the year. But Benediktsson decided on Oct. 13 that his coalition couldn\u2019t last any longer, and he asked President Halla T\u00f3masd\u00f3ttir to dissolve the Althingi.",
      "\u201cThe weakness of this society is that we have no very strong party and we have no very strong leader of any party,\u2019\u2019 said Vilhj\u00e1lmur Bjarnason a former member of parliament. \u201cWe have no charming person with a vision \u2026 That is very difficult for us.\u201d",
      "Despite the electoral headwinds, Benediktsson expressed confidence that his Independence Party could emerge on top.",
      "\u201cIt was an uphill battle for my party, initially, but as we moved on into the election campaign, I think things started to turn our way and I feel that this will be a very exciting election day,\u201d he said.",
      "The splintering of Iceland's political landscape came after the 2008 financial crisis, which prompted years of economic upheaval after the country's debt-swollen banks collapsed.",
      "The crisis led to anger and distrust of the parties that had traditionally traded power back and forth, and prompted the creation of new parties ranging from the environment focused Left-Green Alliance to the Pirate Party, which advocates direct democracy and individual freedoms.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the consequences of the economic crash,\u2019\u2019 said Eva H. \u00d6nnud\u00f3ttir, a professor of political science at the University of Iceland. \u201cIt\u2019s just the changed landscape. Parties, especially the old parties, have maybe kind of been hoping that we would go back to how things were before, but that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d",
      "Like many Western countries, Iceland has been buffeted by the rising cost of living and immigration pressures.",
      "Inflation peaked at an annual rate of 10.2% in February 2023, fueled by the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. While inflation slowed to 5.1% in October, that is still high compared with neighboring countries. The U.S. inflation rate stood at 2.6% last month, while the European Union\u2019s rate was 2.3%.",
      "Iceland is also struggling to accommodate a rising number of asylum-seekers, creating tensions within the small, traditionally homogenous country. The number of immigrants seeking protection in Iceland jumped to more than 4,000 in each of the past three years, compared with a previous average of less than 1,000.",
      "Repeated eruptions of a volcano in the southwestern part of the country have displaced thousands of people and strained public finances. One year after the first eruption forced the evacuation of the town of Grindavik, many residents still don\u2019t have secure housing, leading to complaints that the government has been slow to respond.",
      "But it also added to a shortage of affordable housing exacerbated by Iceland\u2019s tourism boom. Young people are struggling to get a foot on the housing ladder at a time when short-term vacation rentals have reduced the housing stock available for locals, \u00d6nnud\u00f3ttir said.",

      "A twice-yearly shot that prevents HIV infections will be available at low cost in 120 poor countries",
      "MEXICO CITY -- It\u2019s been called the closest the world has ever come to a vaccine against the AIDS virus.",
      "The twice-yearly shot was 100% effective in preventing HIV infections in a study of women, and results published Wednesday show it worked nearly as well in men.",
      "Drugmaker Gilead said it will allow cheap, generic versions to be sold in 120 poor countries with high HIV rates \u2014 mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. But it has excluded nearly all of Latin America, where rates are far lower but increasing, sparking concern the world is missing a critical opportunity to stop the disease.",
      "\u201cThis is so far superior to any other prevention method we have, that it\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d said Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS. She credited Gilead for developing the drug, but said the world\u2019s ability to stop AIDS hinges on its use in at-risk countries.",
      "In a report issued to mark World AIDS Day on Sunday, UNAIDS said that the number of AIDS death last year \u2014 an estimated 630,000 \u2014 was at its lowest since peaking in 2004, suggesting the world is now at \u201ca historic crossroads\u201d and has a chance to end the epidemic.",
      "The drug called lenacapavir is already sold under the brand name Sunlenca to treat HIV infections in the U.S., Canada, Europe and elsewhere. The company plans to seek authorization soon for Sunlenca to be used for HIV prevention.",
      "While there are other ways to guard against infection, like condoms, daily pills, vaginal rings and bi-monthly shots, experts say the Gilead twice-yearly shots would be particularly useful for marginalized people often fearful of seeking care, including gay men, sex workers and young women.",
      "\u201cIt would be a miracle for these groups because it means they just have to show up twice a year at a clinic and then they\u2019re protected,\u201d said UNAIDS\u2019 Byanyima.",
      "Such was the case for Luis Ruvalcaba, a 32-year-old man in Guadalajara, Mexico, who participated in the latest published study. He said he was afraid to ask for the daily prevention pills provided by the government, fearing he would be discriminated against as a gay man. Because he took part in the study, he'll continue to receive the shots for at least another year.",
      "\u201cIn Latin American countries, there is still a lot of stigma, patients are ashamed to ask for the pills,\u201d said Dr. Alma Minerva P\u00e9rez, who recruited and enrolled a dozen study volunteers at a private research center in Guadalajara.",
      "How widely available the shots will be in Mexico through the country's health care system isn't yet known. Health officials declined to comment on any plans to buy Sunlenca for its citizens; daily pills to prevent HIV were made freely available via the country\u2019s public health system in 2021.",
      "\"If the possibility of using generics has opened, I have faith that Mexico can join,\u201d said P\u00e9rez.",
      "Byanyima said other countries besides Mexico that took part in the research were also excluded from the generics deal, including Brazil, Peru and Argentina. \u201cTo now deny them that drug is unconscionable.\u201d she said.",
      "In a statement, Gilead said it has \u201can ongoing commitment to helping enable access to HIV prevention and treatment options where the need is the greatest.\u201d Among the 120 countries eligible for generic version are 18 mostly African countries that comprise 70% of the world\u2019s HIV burden.",
      "The drugmaker said it is also working on establishing \u201cfast, efficient pathways to reach all people who need or want lenacapavir for HIV prevention.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, 15 advocacy groups in Peru, Argentina, Ecuador, Chile, Guatemala and Colombia wrote to Gilead, asking for generic Sunlenca to be made available in Latin America, citing the \u201calarming\u201d inequity in access to new HIV prevention tools while infection rates were rising.",
      "While countries including Norway, France, Spain and the U.S. have paid more than $40,000 per year for Sunlenca, experts have calculated it could be produced for as little as $40 per treatment once generic production expands to cover 10 million people.",
      "Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Global Health Institute at Duke University, said it will be enormously useful to have Sunlenca available in the hardest-hit countries in Africa and Asia. But he said the rising HIV rates among groups including gay men and transgender populations constituted \u201ca public health emergency\u201d in Latin America.",
      "Hannya Danielle Torres, a 30-year-old trans woman and artist who was in the Sunlenca study in Mexico, said she hoped the government would find a way to provide the shots. \u201cMexico may have some of the richest people in the world but it also has some of the most vulnerable people living in extreme poverty and violence,\u201d Torres said.",
      "Another drugmaker, Viiv Healthcare, also left out most of Latin America when it allowed generics of its HIV prevention shot in about 90 countries. Sold as Apretude, the bi-monthly shots are about 80% to 90% effective in preventing HIV. They cost about $1,500 a year in middle-income countries, beyond what most can afford to pay.",
      "Asia Russell, executive director of the advocacy group Health Gap, said that with more than 1 million new HIV infections globally every year, established prevention methods are not enough. She urged countries like Brazil and Mexico to issue \u201ccompulsory licenses,\u201d a mechanism where countries suspend patents in a health crisis.",
      "It\u2019s a strategy some countries embraced for previous HIV treatments, including in the late 1990s and 2000s when AIDS drugs were first discovered. More recently, Colombia issued its first-ever compulsory license for the key HIV treatment Tivicay in April, without permission from its drugmaker, Viiv.",
      "Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, an AIDS expert at South Africa's University of KwaZulu-Natal, said he had never seen a drug that appeared to be as effective as Sunlenca in preventing HIV.",

      "GENEVA -- The World Trade Organization chief said Friday she's \u201ceager\u201d to work with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and his trade team, while taking a wait-and-see stance about Trump's plans to impose new tariffs on goods from other countries including China, Mexico and Canada.",
      "WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala made the comments to reporters after member countries handed her a second four-year term, in a vote with no opposition.",
      "The Geneva-based trade body's future is clouded by Trump's looming return to power in January in the U.S., home to the world's single biggest economy, because his pledges to slap unilateral tariffs on foreign goods entering the country could face challenges at the WTO.",
      "\u201cI think that I look very much forward to working with President Trump \u2014 with all the new people who will be appointed,\u201d she said. \"I\u2019m eager for it.\u201d",
      "While Trump before his first term threatened to pull the U.S. out of the WTO, Okonjo-Iweala said there's a \u201cgeneral recognition that the organization needs to be supported\" and pointed to U.S. interests in intellectual property protections and product safety fostered by the trade body.",
      "\u201cThe WTO and its rules underpin 75 to 80% of global goods trade,\u201d she said. Okonjo-Iweala expressed hopes to help strike a deal in the WTO that would phase out $22 billion in \u201charmful subsidies\u201d in the fisheries industry that raise worries about damage to ocean fish stocks.",
      "During his first term, the Trump administration largely bypassed WTO rules by imposing tariffs on steel and other goods from countries including China and even U.S. allies.",
      "On Monday, Trump vowed sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada, as well as China, as soon as he takes office as part of his effort to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs.",
      "Trump said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders.",
      "Such tariffs, if imposed, could face a challenge through the WTO's dispute resolution process, though its body that hears appeals is not operating \u2014 largely because of U.S. unwillingness to let new members be appointed to it.",
      "Okonjo-Iweala, a former Nigerian finance minister who also has U.S. citizenship, took office in 2021 as the first woman and first African to hold the job of WTO chief.",
      "Her second term will officially begin next September.",
      "\u201cUntil we get specifics in terms of what is planned, I think it would be a bit premature to try to pronounce on these issues,\u201d she said, referring to Trump\u2019s plans.",
      "\u201cI think we should wait ... for actual policies,\u201d Okonjo-Iweala said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re very much looking forward to working in a productive fashion.\u201d",
      "The WTO's 166 members take decisions by consensus, meaning that any one country can block them."

      "KILLINGTON, Vt. -- Mikaela Shiffrin suffered a deep puncture wound on the right side of her abdomen and \u201csevere muscle trauma\u201d during her scary crash in a giant slalom race on Saturday but no serious bone, ligament or organ damage.",
      "The five-time overall World Cup champion was sidelined for the Killington Cup slalom race Sunday. There's no timetable for her return to racing, the U.S. Ski Team said in a statement sent out before the start of the slalom, which was won by Swiss skier Camille Rast for her first career World Cup victory.",
      "Shiffrin was leading after the first run of the GS on Saturday as she chased after her 100th World Cup win. With the finish line in sight on her second run, the 29-year-old leaned into the hill, lost an edge and slid into a gate, flipping head over skis. She then slammed into another gate before coming to a stop in the protective fencing.",
      "The banged-up Shiffrin stayed down on the side of the course for quite some time. She asked for a sled to take her down, because she \u201cwas in shock, entirely unable to move and worried about internal organ trauma,\u201d Shiffrin said in a statement.",
      "Transported by ambulance to a medical center, doctors who evaluated her determined she had no ligament damage and that her bones and internal organs \u201clook OK,\" according to the statement from the team. The team added that Shiffrin suffered severe muscle trauma and a puncture wound on the right side of her abdomen. She did not receive stitches because the wound is \"too deep and there is risk of infection,\u201d Shiffrin explained.",
      "Over her 14-year career, Shiffrin has rehabbed from two previous on-hill injuries: a torn medial collateral ligament and bone bruising in her right knee in December 2015 and a sprained MCL and tibiofibular ligament in her left knee after a downhill crash in January 2024. Neither knee injury required surgery, and both times, Shiffrin was back to racing within two months.",
      "Sore from the crash, Shiffrin couldn't attend the slalom race Sunday \u2014 a race she has dominated. Shiffrin has won six of the seven times she competed in the slalom at Killington. She is a fan favorite at the venue after growing up in both New Hampshire and Colorado and sharpening her skills at nearby Burke Mountain Academy.",
      "\u201cShe can\u2019t walk very well right now, so she can\u2019t get to the venue even though she is dying to cheer for her teammates in person,\u201d the statement from the team said. \u201cShe will be cheering loudly from her place in Killington.\u201d",

      "Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence was carted off the field after taking a violent elbow to the facemask from Houston linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair",
      "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Trevor Lawrence walked out of EverBank Stadium with his wife by his side and a smile on his face, a positive sign for the oft-injured Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback.",
      "Lawrence was carted off the field after taking a violent blow to the facemask from Houston linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair, a hit that prompted a sideline-clearing brawl and a secondary scuffle.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a play that really has no business being in our league,\u201d Jaguars coach Doug Pederson said following his team's 23-20 loss Sunday.",
      "Back in the starting lineup after missing two games with a sprained left shoulder, Lawrence scrambled on a second-and-7 play in the second quarter. He initiated a slide before Al-Shaair raised his forearm and unleashed on the defenseless quarterback.",
      "Lawrence clinched both fists after the hit \u2014 movements consistent with what\u2019s referred to as the \u201cfencing response,\u201d which can be common after a traumatic brain injury. He was on the ground for several minutes as teammates came to his defense and mobbed Al-Shaair, whose latest perceived cheap shot could result in a suspension.",
      "\u201cThat was a dumb hit on his part,\u201d Jaguars defensive end Josh Hines-Allen said. \u201cHate to see it. The first thing I thought of was to go get him because it\u2019s your brother, and that\u2019s the quarterback.\u201d",
      "Added tight end Evan Engram: \u201cI saw him sliding and then I saw the hit, and then, honestly, (my emotions) just took over. I just knew it was wrong. It was just a dirty play, and you stick up for your guys.\"",
      "Lawrence eventually was helped to his feet and loaded into the front seat of a cart to be taken off the field. He was not transported to a hospital for tests. He was quickly ruled out with a concussion, though.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate with the hit with Azeez,\" Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said. \"That\u2019s not what we\u2019re coaching. Want to be smart in everything we do and not hurt the team, get a penalty there. Just have to be smarter when a quarterback is going down.",
      "\u201cJust unfortunate play, not representative of who Azeez is. Like, he\u2019s a smart player, really great leader for us.\u201d",
      "Al-Shaair was ejected for \u201can illegal hit on the quarterback, unnecessary, to the neck and head area,\u201d referee Land Clark said in a pool report. Jaguars rookie cornerback Jarrian Jones also was ejected for throwing a punch in the melee.",
      "As Al-Shaair was leaving the field, fans started screaming at him. Jaguars veteran guard Brandon Scherff joined in, prompting another altercation with Al-Shaair. Texans teammate Will Anderson grabbed Al-Shaair and was escorting him off the field when a fan threw a water bottle and hit Anderson in the helmet. The fan was later ejected.",
      "Officials and coaches got the teams under control before play resumed. Al-Shaair was not in the locker room when it opened to reporters after the game.",
      "\u201cI just want to say prayers to Trevor,\" Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud said. \"I really hope and pray he\u2019s OK. Prayers to his family as well. But, yeah, still rocking with Azeez. I don\u2019t think that was his intent, and I pray that Trevor is OK and his family is right there with him.\u201d",
      "Mac Jones replaced Lawrence and rallied the Jaguars in the fourth quarter. Jones completed 20 of 32 passes for 235 yards, with two touchdowns. Pederson declined to speculate on Lawrence's status moving forward, especially with the Jags now formally eliminated in the AFC South.",
      "Lawrence, the top pick in the 2021 draft, missed a game for the first time in his professional career in 2023 because of a sprained right shoulder sustained in Week 16. He also missed significant practice time because of other injuries: a sprained left knee in Week 6, a sprained right ankle in Week 13 and a concussion in Week 15.",
      "\u201cTrevor is a warrior,\" Jones said. \"We\u2019re all praying for him. We definitely have his back. For him to play today was incredible. He\u2019s a tough dude. Really wanted to get the win for him. Obviously fell short. But definitely praying for him. I know we all have his back for sure.\u201d",

      "Becht\u2019s first touchdown pass, a 15-yarder to Jayden Higgins, came after Myles Purchase recovered Avery Johnson\u2019s errant pitch on the game\u2019s first play from scrimmage. Becht\u2019s 9-yard TD pass to Jaylin Noel came after Joey Petersen picked up Keagan Johnson\u2019s fumble. Noel went over 1,000 yards receiving for the season with the catch.",

      "\u201cCongratulations to Matt and his team. They\u2019ll represent the Big 12 well. They don\u2019t make mistakes, and we made them today, and that got us down at halftime.\u201d",
      "Avery Johnson threw touchdown passes of 28 and 65 yards to Jayce Brown in the first half, and his 7-yarder to Oakley pulled K-State within 24-21 late in the third quarter. He threw for 220 yards and ran for 64 on 13 carries, and Brown caught three balls for 106 yards.",
      "The Cyclones made a huge stop earlier in the third after DJ Giddens\u2019s 36-yard run set up K-State inside the 5-yard line. They kept the Wildcats out of the end zone, and then Darien Porter blew through the right side of the line to block Chris Tennant\u2019s 21-yard field-goal try.",
      "The defense recorded a safety when Jacob Ellis chased Avery Johnson into his own end zone. Johnson desperately unloaded the ball and was called for intentional grounding.",
      "Kansas State: The Wildcats failed to play spoiler after finding out their hopes of making the Big 12 championship game were squashed earlier in the day. Two turnovers, having a field goal blocked, surrendering a safety and failing to convert two fourth-and-2s hurt.",

      "Liverpool is in control of the Premier League title race",
      "Liverpool is in control of the Premier League title race. Manchester City is in free fall.",
      "A 2-0 win against City on Sunday moved Liverpool nine points clear at the top of the standings and 11 ahead of Pep Guardiola\u2019s four-time defending champion.",
      "Goals from Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah exposed the gap between the title rivals and emphasized the deepening crisis for Guardiola, whose serial title winners languish fifth in the standings.",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t perfect, but we came close to perfection and that\u2019s the only way you can beat a quality team like City,\u201d Liverpool head coach Arne Slot said.",
      "It\u2019s now seven games without a win for City in all competitions, including six losses during that run.",
      "The latest defeat at Anfield could have been even more emphatic, with Virgil van Dijk hitting the post and Salah missing the target when through on goal in a game which Liverpool totally dominated.",
      "The home crowd mocked Guardiola, chanting he would be fired in the morning. With his team unable to respond, it was left to him to hold up six fingers in reference to the six league titles he has won in seven years during a period of unprecedented domestic dominance.",
      "\u201cMaybe they're right, that I must be sacked (fired) for the results we have, but I didn't expect (that) in Anfield,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s part of the game. I understand completely and accept it. We had incredible, incredible battles together.\u201d",
      "City's dominance looks increasingly likely to come to an end this season, with Guardiola enduring the worst losing streak of his managerial career and Liverpool looking a potential champion after such an impressive start under Slot.",
      "It\u2019s 11 wins from 13 games in the league for Slot, whose team also leads the Champions League standings.",
      "Victory against City came days after beating European champion Real Madrid by the same score line and having already seen off German champion Bayer Leverkusen 4-0.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone including me would have predicted this,\u201d Slot said of his team's start to the campaign.",
      "In contrast, City\u2019s players look bereft of confidence, having thrown away a three-goal lead against Feyenoord in the Champions League on Tuesday, just days after being thrashed 4-0 by Tottenham.",
      "Guardiola\u2019s team could have been behind even before Gakpo\u2019s opener in the 12th minute, following a wonderful threaded cross by Salah. And Liverpool should have wrapped up the game long before Salah eventually converted a penalty in the 78th when City goalkeeper Stefan Ortega brought down Luis Diaz in the box.",
      "Guardiola has now lost four straight league games for the first time as a manager, Premier League stat supplier Opta said. The last time City lost four in a row in the league was 2008, Opta said.",
      "Ruben Amorim got Manchester United fans smiling again after a 4-0 win against Everton.",
      "In his first Premier League game at Old Trafford, the home crowd serenaded United\u2019s players with \u201cole\u201d as they played one of their best performances of the season. It marks a big change from the boos that rang around the stadium toward the end of former manager Erik ten Hag\u2019s reign.",
      "In Amorim\u2019s third game in charge in all competitions since taking over last month, United produced its best performance under him, with Marcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee scoring two goals each.",
      "\u201cIt is a nice result. It is important with a new coach and a new way of playing, we are still learning. We have to back up this performance,\u201d Rashford said.",
      "Amorim is undefeated since taking over last month and United is ninth - four points off the top four.",
      "While performances on the field are pleasing supporters, there were protests off it over increasing ticket prices.",
      "A banner displayed both inside and outside the stadium read: \u201cStop exploiting loyalty\u201d.",
      "It hasn\u2019t taken long for Amorim to get United\u2019s strikers scoring.",
      "Rashford has three goals in three games under the Portuguese, having managed four in 18 before that.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund scored twice in the Europa League win against Bodo Glimt and Zirkzee\u2019s double on Sunday were his first goals since the opening game of the season.",
      "Goals had been hard to come by under Ten Hag, with United only scoring eight in nine games in the league before he was fired.",
      "Rashford began the rout against Everton in the 34th minute and Zirkzee doubled United\u2019s lead five minutes later. Rashford scored again a minute into the second half and Zirkzee\u2019s second came in the 64th after a swift break.",
      "Third-placed Chelsea moved back level on points with second-place Arsenal after inflicting the latest loss on Aston Villa.",

      "Damien Martinez ran for a 2-yard TD on Miami's next possession to tie the game at 35-all. Allen's 3-yard run gave the Orange the lead for good at 42-35.",
      "Restrepo finished with 148 yards receiving on nine catches for the Hurricanes, and Jacolby George had six receptions for 121 yards.",
      "Miami scored touchdowns on its first three possessions and a rout appeared possible. A 40-yard touchdown pass from McCord to Pena midway through the first quarter was wiped out by an illegal formation penalty and seemed to deflate Syracuse.",
      "The Hurricanes dominated the first 15 minutes, outgaining Syracuse 189 yards to 42.",
      "\"We gave them 21 points. There were a lot of self-inflicted wounds,\u201d said Brown, the Orange's first-year coach. \u201cI think we were just tested again, about how tough we were and our will. I think the 21-0 (deficit) showed we won\u2019t quit and that we\u2019ll continue to push.\u201d",
      "The Orange began their rally with two quick touchdowns in the second quarter. Allen took a handoff, bounced off a would-be tackler and maintained his balance for an 8-yard TD, and McCord connected with Meeks in the left corner of the end zone from 9 yards out to make it 21-14 at the half.",
      "The scoring didn't slow down after halftime.",
      "A 25-yard pass to Pena in the right corner of the end zone tied the game briefly at 21 with less than a minute to go in the third, but the Hurricanes countered three minutes later on Mark Fletcher Jr.\u2019s second 2-yard score of the game. McCord and Meeks tied it at 28-all when they hooked up for another 9-yard TD.",
      "Miami must clean up its defense, and given the struggles on that side of the ball, Cristobal will be second-guessed for kicking the short field goal late.",
      "McCord and Syracuse showed tremendous fight and resilience.",
      "Miami awaits a playoff berth or a bowl game. The Orange await their bowl game destination and opponent.",

      "NEW YORK -- In the long and storied history of New York City basketball, nobody wore it quite like Lou Carnesecca.",
      "The excitable St. John\u2019s coach whose outlandish sweaters became an emblem of his team\u2019s rousing Final Four run in 1985, died at 99 on Saturday, just a few weeks shy of his 100th birthday.",
      "The university said it was notified by a family member that Carnesecca died in a hospital, surrounded by loved ones. St. John's said the Hall of Fame coach \u201cendeared himself to generations of New Yorkers with his wit and warmth.\u201d",
      "Carnesecca was a treasured city sports figure in his day, affection for \u201cLittle Looie\u201d never wavering in a bustling town with scant patience for its players, coaches, executives and owners.",
      "He coached St. John\u2019s for 24 seasons over two stints \u2014 making a postseason tournament each year \u2014 and became the face of a university whose campus arena in Queens would eventually carry his name. A statue of him was unveiled before the 2021-22 season. When asked once in a question-and-answer session with the school to describe St. John\u2019s, Carnesecca said: \u201chome.\u201d",
      "It was home where he coached St. John\u2019s to 18 seasons of at least 20 wins, and 18 NCAA Tournament appearances. It was home where he finished with a 526-200 record and had 30-win seasons in 1985 and 1986. And it was home where St. John\u2019s became a charter member of the Big East Conference and a pillar of its success.",
      "He was the coach of the year three times in a league that began play in 1979 and quickly asserted itself as one of the nation\u2019s best. Among his star players during those early Big East years were Chris Mullin, Mark Jackson and Walter Berry.",
      "Carnesecca coached St. John\u2019s to its fifth NIT title in 1989, although by then the tournament had long been a poor cousin to the NCAAs. He entered the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992, the year he retired.",
      "\u201cI never scored a basket,\u201d he said at his induction, forgoing a sweater for a crisp suit. \u201cThe players did everything. Without players, you can\u2019t have a game.\u201d",
      "He was an old-school coach, grounded in fundamentals. And through it all, Carnesecca was a swirling, kinetic presence on the sidelines, arms flailing, legs kicking, shirt tails flying, all 5-foot-6 of him curled in exasperation over a missed shot or agonizing call. But his antics never crossed the line into chair-throwing fury.",
      "Carnesecca was simply consumed by his players, a love for a game in his marrow, a lifetime spent in schoolyards, beat-up gyms and big-time arenas. He loved the \u201csmell of the sweat\u201d and the \u201cfeel of rubber burning\u201d when sneakers met a varnished floor.",
      "He remained the consummate gentleman in a sport populated by outsized egos, fierce recruiting wars and a relentless pursuit of the next contract. Mike Tranghese, a former Big East commissioner, once called him \u201cour soul and our conscience\u201d and \u201cone of the giants of the game.\u201d",
      "Carnesecca guided St. John's to Big East Tournament titles in 1983 and 1986. His teams reached the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament in 1979 and 1991, and spent more than 70 weeks ranked in the top 10 of the AP Top 25. A banner denoting his 526 wins at St. John's hangs from the rafters at Madison Square Garden.",
      "He coached more than 40 NBA draft picks, with Mullin, Jackson and Malik Sealy among 11 who were selected in the first round.",
      "Despite all that, Carnesecca never took himself too famously. He always believed a rough loss should never get in the way of a glass of Chianti and fettuccini with a Bolognese sauce. He held clinics all over the world, making friends, offering toasts wherever he went. He was there with a kind word as well as a wisecrack in his breathy, raspy voice. His family tree may have gone back to Tuscany, but he could hold his own with the best of Borscht Belt comics.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anybody else in coaching like him,\u201d longtime UConn coach Jim Calhoun once told the Hartford Courant. \u201cEven if people hate the Big East nobody hates Looie. If you like basketball, you like Looie. If you like kids, you like Looie.\u201d",
      "Luigi P. Carnesecca was born on Jan. 5, 1925, the son of Italian immigrants. He grew up in Manhattan, in East Harlem, living above the grocery store and deli owned by his father. He took his heritage seriously, rooting for such New York Yankees as Tony Lazzeri and Joe DiMaggio.",
      "After a stretch in the Coast Guard during World War II, he became the coach at his high school \u2014 now the longtime basketball power Archbishop Molloy. In 1958, he took an assistant\u2019s job at St. John\u2019s, his alma mater, where he had played baseball on a team that reached the 1949 College World Series, but not varsity basketball.",
      "He worked for eight seasons under Joe Lapchick, the lessons about humility and hard work from the Hall of Fame coach lasting a lifetime. Carnesecca would later pass along to Mullin some advice he got from Lapchick: \u201cA peacock today, a feather duster tomorrow.\u201d",
      "\u201cI learned more when Coach Lapchick cleared his throat than I could have at any clinic,\u201d Carnesecca said.",
      "He succeeded Lapchick in 1965, the 20-win seasons piling up quickly. But after five years, Carnesecca was not immune to the siren song of the pros. He coached the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association for three years, Rick Barry among his players.",
      "Years later, during a 1982-83 season in which his St. John\u2019s team would finish 28-5, Carnesecca reflected on the pressure of college coaching and his time in the ABA.",
      "\u201cI lost 50 games coaching professionally \u2014 that was pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like getting out of bed. My mother could coach this team.\u201d",
      "His stay in the pros didn\u2019t last long. Carnesecca knew that was not his natural habitat. He said he could give the same halftime speech only so many times. He returned to St. John\u2019s in 1973.",
      "Winning seasons followed in quick succession even though his city was no longer the recruiting magnet of generations past. Top high school players migrated south and west to campuses with gleaming arenas and didn\u2019t need the commercial pull of New York to burnish their brand.",
      "When asked why he didn\u2019t expand his base in his search of players and venture beyond his city\u2019s five boroughs, Carnesecca knew he had plenty of talent in his neighborhood. He took a subway token \u2014 now a relic from bygone generations \u2014 out of his pocket.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s my recruiting budget,\u201d he said.",
      "By the 1984-85 season, Carnesecca and St. John\u2019s captivated New York, a throwback to a time when schools like City College and NYU mattered not only in the Big Apple but across college basketball. The Redmen \u2014 their nickname years later changed to the Red Storm \u2014 played tough, pulsating games at a packed Madison Square Garden against Syracuse teams coached by Jim Boeheim, Villanova teams coached by Rollie Massimino and Georgetown teams coached by John Thompson and led by Patrick Ewing.",
      "It was then the saga of The Sweater took hold. Over the years, Carnesecca would recount his baffling entry into the world of fashion time and again like an embellished family tale.",
      "Essentially, St. John\u2019s was getting ready for a road trip to Pittsburgh in January and Carnesecca was under the weather. The building would be drafty, and his wife thought it would be good if he wore a sweater. He found one that had been given to him by an Italian basketball coach. It was a brown pullover with broad turquoise stripes. It never made it into the pages of GQ.",
      "\u201cIt is ugly, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Carnesecca said.",
      "No matter. Mullin hit a winning shot at the buzzer, and the coach had his lucky charm. He stuck with the sweater. Along the way, St. John\u2019s ended Georgetown\u2019s 29-game winning streak and soared to a No. 1 ranking.",
      "But there were also two lopsided losses to Georgetown during the 16-2 run with the sweater \u2014 one when a grinning Thompson upstaged his popular rival by wearing a duplicate onto the court at a buzzing Madison Square Garden in what became known as \u201cThe Sweater Game,\u201d which drew a massive television audience in February 1985.",
      "His luck exhausted, Carnesecca eventually put the pullover away. He then went with a tan, snowflake number for the NCAA Tournament. St. John\u2019s defeated Southern, Arkansas and Kentucky before a victory over North Carolina State in the West Regional final sent Carnesecca to the Final Four.",
      "\u201cWhen I\u2019m going to my grave,\u201d he said, \u201cthis I\u2019ll remember.\u201d",
      "St. John\u2019s headed to Lexington, Kentucky, along with two Big East compatriots \u2014 Georgetown and Villanova \u2014 and Memphis. St. John\u2019s stuck with Georgetown in the semifinals, down 32-28 at halftime. But the Hoyas pulled away to win 77-59, holding Mullin to eight points.",
      "\u201cI think we tried everything,\u201d Carnesecca said of Georgetown, which then got upset by Villanova in one of the sport\u2019s great championship games.",
      "After he retired, Carnesecca was succeeded by a parade of coaches at St. John\u2019s, Mullin among them. Even into his 90s, some three decades out of coaching, Carnesecca would make his way to The Garden when the Red Storm were there. His gait may have been tentative but his mind and wit nimble, the crowd roaring when the jumbo screen panned in on him. The coach was at home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult to put the ball down, but the time has come,\u201d he said at his retirement when he was 67. \u201cThere are two reasons, really. I still have half of my marbles and I still have a wonderful taste in my mouth about basketball.\u201d",
      "The school said Carnesecca leaves behind his wife of 73 years, Mary, as well as daughter Enes and son-in-law Gerard, a granddaughter, and a niece and nephew in addition to extended family.",

      "West Virginia has fired football coach Neal Brown as the Mountaineers continue to flounder in the Big 12",
      "West Virginia fired coach Neal Brown on Sunday as the Mountaineers continue to flounder in the Big 12, finishing the season 6-6.",
      "Athletic director Wren Baker announced the firing in a statement, wishing Brown and his family \u201cthe very best in their next endeavor.\u201d",
      "Brown had an overall record of 37-35 in his six seasons leading the Mountaineers. His teams never competed for a Big 12 championship or were ranked in the AP Top 25 poll. They lost nine consecutive times to ranked opponents.",
      "Brown is due to receive a $9.5 million buyout for the last three years of his contract.",
      "Baker\u2019s statement didn\u2019t indicate who will coach the Mountaineers in their bowl game. West Virginia will learn its bowl opponent next weekend.",
      "Brown had been fighting to keep his job for quite some time.",
      "In November 2022, following back-to-back losing seasons, Brown was retained on the same day that Baker was hired as West Virginia\u2019s AD. A year ago, Baker issued a similar vote of confidence as his predecessor, then gave Brown a contract extension in March following a 9-4 finish.",
      "But a return to mediocrity and mounting problems were too much for Brown to overcome.",
      "West Virginia\u2019s offensive production suffered significantly despite returning dual-threat quarterback Garrett Greene and running backs Jahiem White and C.J. Donaldson. The defense was one of the worst nationally in passing yards allowed. West Virginia lost four times at home this season and was outscored in the second half in 10 of 12 games.",
      "Brown had the worst six-year stretch under one coach at West Virginia since Gene Corum went 29-30 from 1960-65. Except Brown\u2019s teams showed flashes of brilliance one week, then stumbled the next. The Mountaineers were especially vulnerable on the road, going 13-20 with 11 losses by at least 17 points. Brown also went 1-2 against rival Pittsburgh.",
      "\u201cOur record at the end wasn\u2019t what we\u2019d hoped for,\u201d Brown said after a 52-15 loss at Texas Tech on Saturday. \u201cI thought that over the course of the year, there were times when people were counting us out and our guys bounced back and did some good things.\u201d",

      "Rookie Tarheeb Still returned an interception 61 yards for a touchdown, his second pick of the game and one of four thrown by Atlanta quarterback Kirk Cousins as the Los Angeles Chargers handed the first-place Falcons their third straight loss, 17-13",
      "ATLANTA -- In a game neither team seemed eager to win, the Los Angeles Chargers relied on their defense \u2014 especially rookie cornerback Tarheeb Still \u2014 to hand Kirk Cousins and the Atlanta Falcons their third straight loss.",
      "Still returned an interception 61 yards for a touchdown, his second pick of the game and one of four thrown by Cousins as the Chargers overcame numerous issues to knock off the Falcons 17-13 on Sunday.",
      "The Chargers (8-4) surrendered five sacks to a team that had an NFL-low 10 coming into the game, not to mention fumbled the ball away in their own territory to set up Atlanta\u2019s only TD. There also was a fake punt that didn\u2019t work and a largely listless offense that managed just two first downs in the second half.",
      "Los Angeles coach Jim Harbaugh had no complaints.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re witnessing complementary, winning football.\u201d",
      "Still, a fifth-round pick out of Maryland, made the 36-year-old Cousins looked like a rookie when the Falcons (6-6) faced a fourth-and-5 at the Los Angeles 40 late in the third quarter.",
      "Still read the play all the way, stepping in front of Darnell Mooney and sprinting untouched down the sideline in front of the Falcons' bench for the touchdown that put the Chargers ahead to stay.",
      "Still now has three interceptions in his first season as a pro.",
      "\u201cThe thing that impresses me the most is how locked in he is for a young player,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cI mean, they can get a little drift in their preparation as the season goes on. But he has been locked in.\u201d",
      "Still also had an interception on the first play of the second quarter, a sign of what was to come for Cousins in an awful performance that is sure to raise questions about whether the Falcons should turn to their first-round pick, Michael Penix Jr.",
      "Falcons coach Raheem Morris insisted that a quarterback change is not in the works.",
      "\u201cWe've got no issues with that man,\u201d he said of Cousins. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna be the issue around here. That guy\u2019s carried us. That guy\u2019s got us to the point. We\u2019re 6-6 and first place in the division. We've still got everything in front of us.\u201d",
      "Atlanta's last two possessions both ended with Cousins' interceptions when a touchdown could have pulled the game out \u2014 only the second four-pick game of his long career. The other came when he played for Washington in a 45-14 loss to the New York Giants on Sept. 25, 2014.",
      "There was an ill-advised pass to no one in particular in the back of the end zone that was grabbed by Marcus Maye, who had just joined the Chargers a few days earlier after being claimed on waivers. Cousins put both hands to his helmet in disbelief.",
      "With the Falcons driving into Chargers territory for one last shot, Cousins delivered a throw over the middle that was picked off by Derwin James Jr. at the Los Angeles 24 with 40 seconds remaining.",
      "\u201cI've got to play better,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cI'm so disappointed right now. It hurts. I feel like that was a game we had a chance to win if I played at the standard I expect to.\u201d",
      "The Falcons nearly doubled up the Chargers in total yards, 350-187. Justin Herbert threw for just 147 yards, and the Chargers were limited to 56 yards on the ground without top back J.K. Dobbins.",
      "The only points produced by the Los Angeles offense were three field goals by Cameron Dicker.",
      "\u201cObviously not the way that we want to play,\u201d Herbert said. \u201cWe won because of the defense today. We've got to do a better job as an offense.\u201d",
      "Cousins finished 24 of 39 for 245 yards. Younghoe Koo kicked a pair of field goals, but also missed a 35-yarder after battling hip issues during the week.",
      "Harbaugh could've been facing a lot of questions for calling a fake punt that failed to produce a first down.",
      "But his defense bailed him out.",
      "With the Chargers facing fourth-and-4 at their own 36 early in the fourth quarter, punter JK Scott took the snap but rolled to his right and threw a pass to tight end Stone Smartt.",
      "The Falcons weren't fooled. Kevin King delivered a hit that knocked Smartt out of bounds a yard shy of the first-down marker.",
      "\u201cI thought it was a good time to catch them by surprise,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cThey did a good job defending it. We didn\u2019t exactly run it the way we practiced it and it just came up short. That's on me. Those decisions, they\u2019re good when they\u2019re right.\"",
      "Maye snuffed out Atlanta's drive with his pick in the end zone, so the fake punt didn't hurt the Chargers.",
      "Chargers: Dobbins (knee sprain) was placed on injured reserve Saturday, forcing the Chargers to go with a backfield-by-committee approach that wasn't very effective. ... WR Ladd McConkey went out late in the game with a knee injury after making nine catches for 117 yards.",
      "Falcons: K Riley Patterson was signed by the Falcons as a precaution in case Koo couldn't go, but the newcomer wasn't needed.",

    "story": [
      "A historically poor season has led Purdue athletic director Mike Bobinski to fire coach Ryan Walters after just two seasons at the helm",
      "Purdue hired Ryan Walters to keep a promising program near the top of the Big Ten Conference.",
      "Two years later, the Boilermakers have sunk to unprecedented depths \u2014 and Walters is out of a job.",
      "Athletic director Mike Bobinski fired the first-time head coach on Sunday, following a brutal 1-11 season in which the Boilermakers made all the wrong kinds of history.",
      "They lost their final 11 games to set the school\u2019s single season record, endured the two most lopsided losses in program history, went winless in conference play for only the third time since 1946 and failed to beat an FBS opponent for the first time since 2013 and the second time in college football\u2019s modern era.",
      "It was simply too much to ignore even for a program like Purdue, which rarely fires coaches this quickly and the revenue model changes next year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pivotal time for Purdue, and we must take the steps necessary to best position our football program for success,\u201d Bobinski said in a statement. \u201cWe are determined to provide the university and our incredibly loyal fans football performance that reflects the excellence of Purdue and is worthy of their continued support.\u201d",
      "The move comes a day after the Boilermakers' worst loss in the 126-game rivalry with No. 10 Indiana, 66-0. On the radio broadcast afterward, Walters called it the worst offensive performance he'd ever seen, then told reporters he had a vision for the future.",
      "Walters replaced Jeff Brohm after Purdue\u2019s 2022 Big Ten West Division title run, which ended with a Big Ten championship game loss to the playoff-bound Michigan Wolverines.",
      "But things unraveled quickly for Walters.",
      "The FBS\u2019 sixth-youngest coach lost his first game to Fresno State, started 2-3, then lost four in a row \u2014 three by 17 or more points to start a trend that continued through his second season and ultimately sealed his fate.",
      "While Purdue was projected to finish last in this year\u2019s expanded 18-team Big Ten, few expected such a complete collapse \u2014 even despite a brutal schedule that included four contests against top-five teams.",
      "\u201cThis was a truly difficult decision, as head coach Ryan Walters continued to lead the Boilermakers with integrity, resilience and poise in the face of considerable challenges,\u201d Bobinski said.",
      "It wasn\u2019t just the losses \u2014 it was how they lost.",
      "Purdue gave up 21 points to then-No. 18 Notre Dame in the final 2 1/2 minutes of the first half, a flurry that led to what was then the most lopsided loss in school history, 66-7. Saturday's loss was even worse as the Boilermakers suffered their third shutout, losing for the sixth time by 35 or more points while gaining just 67 total yards.",
      "Even the competitive games went awry. Walters took risky gambles in two overtime games by playing for the win. Both failed, and at Michigan State, their second-half comeback fell short.",
      "The fans who kept showing up for home games grew exasperated by what they saw. Walters insisted Saturday night that he could still fix things.",
      "\u201cI know exactly what this place needs, what holes we need to fill,\" Walters said. \u201cI feel like going into Year 3, being able to attack the holes we need to fill and getting the right people in place to push forward, I feel comfortable in that plan and confident in that plan.\u201d",
      "How bad did things get?",
      "When the student section at a Purdue basketball game started chanting for Walters\u2019 firing, school administrators threatened to remove anyone caught chanting about the football coach\u2019s job status and banning them from future games.",
      "Behind the scenes, there was a perception of chaos, too.",
      "Walters fired offensive coordinator Graham Harrell just 16 games into his tenure, turning over the play-calling duties to Jason Simmons, a longtime Indianapolis prep head coach who was in just his second season coaching at the college level.",
      "When Purdue responded with a 52-6 loss at Wisconsin, Walters, who spent his entire coaching career working with college defenses, started calling the offensive plays in Week 7.",
      "That didn\u2019t work either.",
      "Just keeping players on board became problematic, too.",
      "Starting cornerback Markevious Brown left the team for personal reasons before the Wisconsin game and did not return. Purdue recruits increasingly started decommitting as the losses piled up.",
      "\u201cYeah, we've gotten questions about that,\u201d Walters said when asked if recruits were asking about his future at Purdue.",
      "Naturally, the cries for Walters\u2019 ouster grew into a crescendo. So Bobinski finally ended Walters\u2019 tenure on Sunday. Purdue still owes Walters for three seasons on his original five-year deal, costing the school roughly $9.5 million.",
      "Walters finished his career with a 5-19 mark overall, going 3-15 in league play with no bowl appearances, though he did win both of Purdue\u2019s trophy games in 2023 \u2014 and lost both in 2024.",
      "What\u2019s next for the Boilermakers remains unclear.",
      "\u201cWe will conduct a thorough search process and look forward to bringing aboard a new head coach equipped to restore Purdue football to its proud tradition of success,\u201d Bobinski said.",
      "Walters arrived at Purdue after spending the previous two seasons as defensive coordinator for Illinois coach Bret Bielema.",
      "He attended his father\u2019s alma mater, Colorado, moving from quarterback to safety and immediately began his coaching career when his playing days ended in 2008. His coaching stops included Colorado, Arizona, Oklahoma, North Texas, Memphis and Missouri.",

      "Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares is stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the carmaker that owns brands like Jeep and Ram and Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot",
      "NEW YORK -- Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares is stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the automaker, which owns car brands like Jeep, Citro\u00ebn and Ram, amid an ongoing struggle with slumping sales.",
      "The world\u2019s fourth-largest carmaker announced that its board accepted Tavares' resignation Sunday, effective immediately.",
      "Stellantis noted Sunday that the process to appoint a new, permanent CEO is \u201cwell under way.\u201d In the meantime, the company says a new interim executive committee, led by chairman John Elkann, will be established.",
      "As head of PSA Peugeot, Tavares took control of the Netherlands-based company in January 2021 \u2014 when it merged with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, creating an automotive giant that is the parent to several well-known brands today. Beyond Jeep, Citro\u00ebn and Ram, Stellantis\u2019 portfolio includes Dodge, Chrysler, Fiat, Peugeot, Maserati and Opel.",
      "Stellantis' North American operations had been the company\u2019s main source of profits for some time, but struggles piled up this year \u2014 with the company citing larger market changes and rising competition.",
      "For its third quarter, Stellantis posted 27% plunge in net revenues, as gaps in launching new products and action to reduce inventories also slashed global shipments of new vehicles by 20%.",
      "The carmaker reported net revenues of 33 billion euros (nearly $36 billion ) in the three-month period ending Sept. 30, down from 45 billion euros in the same period last year. All regions except South America reported double-digit dips in revenues \u2014 led by North America, which plunged 42% to 12.4 billion euros. Europe revenues dropped 12% to 12.5 billion euros.",
      "In recent months, Tavares had been under fire from U.S. dealers and the United Auto Workers union after the release of dismal financial performance reports. He also oversaw cost-cutting efforts that included delaying factory openings and laying off union workers \u2014 adding to further strain with the UAW, which filed several grievances against Stellantis and threatened to strike in recent months.",
      "Beyond the U.S., Stellantis has faced pressure in Italy \u2014 where lawmakers questioned the former chief executive over the company's production plans in October, with the far-right government accusing the company of relocating assembly plants to low-cost countries. Tens of thousands of autoworkers in the country also held a one-day walkout, calling for more employment certainty and protections.",
      "In efforts to revive sales, Stellantis previously made a number of leadership changes in October, which included new heads of operations in North America and Europe. At the time, the company expected Tavares to step down in early 2026, closer to the end of his five-year contract.",
      "The company confirmed in September that it was searching for a CEO to eventually succeed Tavares, but maintained that those efforts were part of standard leadership transition plans.",
      "In a statement Sunday, Stellantis\u2019 senior independent director Henri de Castries said that Stellantis' success is \u201crooted in a perfect alignment\u201d between shareholders, the company's board and the CEO \u2014 but noted that \u201cdifferent views\u201d had emerged in recent weeks, resulting in the decision to approve Tavares' resignation.",
      "Elkann, the chairperson of Stellantis' board, thanked Tavares for \u201chis years of dedicated service and the role he has played in the creation of Stellantis\u201d in an additional statement. He added that he looks forward to appointing a new CEO.",
      "Stellantis did not comment further beyond Sunday's announcement."

She acknowledges she doesn\u2019t need them because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t even cook like that.\u201d Plus, she\u2019s allergic to apples.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t eat apples. It will kill me,\u201d Neville said, laughing. \u201cBut I still want the coring thing.\u201d",
      "Shein, now based in Singapore, uses some of the same web design features as Temu\u2019s, such as pop-up coupons and ads, to persuade shoppers to keep clicking, but it appears a bit more restrained in its approach.",
      "Shein primarily targets young women through partnerships with social media influencers. Searching the company's name on video platforms turns up creators promoting Shein's Black Friday sales event and displaying the dozens of of trendy clothes and accessories they got for comparatively little money.",
      "But the Shein-focused content also includes videos of TikTokers saying they're embarrassed to admit they shopped there and critics lashing out at fans for not taking into account the environmental harms or potential labor abuses associated with products that are churned out and shipped worldwide at a speedy pace.",
      "Neville has already picked out holiday gifts for family and friends from the site. Most of the products in her online cart cost under $10, including graphic T-shirts she intends to buy for her son and jeans and loafers for her daughter. All told, she plans to spend about $200 on gifts, significantly less than $500 she used to shell out at other stores in prior years.",
      "\u201cThe visuals just make you want to spend more money,\u201d she said, referring to the clothes on Shein's site. \u201cThey're very cheap and everything is just so cute.\u201d",
      "Unlike Shein, Temu's appeal cuts across age groups and gender. The platform is the world\u2019s second most-visited online shopping site, software company Similarweb reported in September. Customers go there looking for practical items like doormats and silly products like a whiskey flask shaped like a vintage cellphone from the 1990s.",
      "Temu advertised Black Friday bargains for some items at upwards of 70% off the recommended retail price. Making a purchase can quickly result in receiving dozens of emails offering free giveaways. The caveat: customers have to buy more products.",
      "Ellen Flowers, 36, a lifestyle blogger who lives in Dallas, recently decided to pair a $3,500 dining table with $25 dining chairs from Temu to save money. She's also purchased clothes from Temu. The quality or fit wasn't always always great, so Flowers donated some unwanted pieces to thrift stores to avoid paying return shipping fees that would cost almost as much as the clothes.",
      "Flowers planned to buy stocking stuffers on Temu as well as baubles for an ornament-swapping party in early December. She also wanted to buy necklaces and bracelets for an activity at her 5-year-old niece's upcoming birthday party.",
      "\u201cI love buying my nieces presents,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cSince they\u2019re young, they don\u2019t need the Louis Vuitton handbag. I can give them a cute handbag from Temu. Then they\u2019ll lose interest in a month and I\u2019ll buy them another one.\u201d",
      "Despite their rise, Temu and Shein have proven particularly ripe for pushback. Last year, a coalition of unnamed brands and organizations launched a campaign to oppose Shein in Washington. U.S. lawmakers also have raised the possibility that Temu is allowing goods made with forced labor to enter the country.",
      "More recently, the Biden administration put forward rules that would crack down on a trade rule known as the de minimis exception, which has allowed a lot of cheap products to come into the U.S. duty-free. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to slap high tariffs on goods from China, a move that would likely raise prices and across the retail world.",
      "Both Shein and Temu have set up warehouses in the U.S. to speed up delivery times and help them better compete with Amazon, which is trying to erode their price advantage through a new storefront that also ships products directly from China.",
      "Meanwhile, Temu is onboarding Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that would allow the company to not be as exposed to changes around the de minimus trade rule, said Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse.",
      "The change comes as both Shein and Temu are attempting to expand beyond the bargain-hungry shoppers who popularized their platforms. Temu is allowing sellers to ship products to customers from local U.S. warehouses and says the move will allow it to sell larger items like furniture as it expands its selection of big-ticket items.",
      "Meanwhile, American children's clothing retailer The Children\u2019s Place signed a deal last month to distribute its products through Shein\u2019s platform. Last year, Shein went into business with women's fashion retailer Forever 21. It has been working to recruit other brands and reportedly has hopes of getting listed on the London Stock Exchange."

      "OTTAWA, Ontario -- A coalition of Canadian news publishers, including The Canadian Press, Torstar, Globe and Mail, Postmedia and CBC/Radio-Canada, has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI for using news content to train its ChatGPT generative artificial intelligence system.",
      "The outlets said in a joint statement on Friday that OpenAI regularly breaches copyright by scraping large amounts of content from Canadian media.",
      "\u201cOpenAI is capitalizing and profiting from the use of this content, without getting permission or compensating content owners,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The publishers argue that OpenAI practices undermine the hundreds of millions of dollars invested in journalism, and that content is protected by copyright.",
      "\u201cNews media companies welcome technological innovations. However, all participants must follow the law, and any use of intellectual property must be on fair terms,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Generative AI can create text, images, videos and computer code based on a simple prompt, but the systems must first study vast amounts of existing content.",

      "The company said it collaborates \u201cclosely with news publishers, including in the display, attribution and links to their content in ChatGPT search\u201d and offers outlets \u201ceasy ways to opt-out should they so desire.\u201d",
      "This is the first such case in Canada, though numerous lawsuits are underway in the United States, including a case by the New York Times against OpenAI and Microsoft.",

Others include The Wall Street Journal and New York Post publisher News Corp., The Atlantic, Axel Springer in Germany and Prisa Media in Spain, France\u2019s Le Monde newspaper and the London-based Financial Times.",

    "summary": "The U.S. Navy is making progress in deploying its first shipborne hypersonic weapon",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Navy is making progress in deploying its first shipborne hypersonic weapon",
      "The U.S. Navy is transforming a costly flub into a potent weapon with the first shipborne hypersonic weapon, which is being retrofitted aboard the first of its three stealthy destroyers.",
      "The USS Zumwalt is at a Mississippi shipyard where workers have installed missile tubes that replace twin turrets from a gun system that was never activated because it was too expensive. Once the system is complete, the Zumwalt will provide a platform for conducting fast, precision strikes from greater distances, adding to the usefulness of the warship.",
      "\u201cIt was a costly blunder. But the Navy could take victory from the jaws of defeat here, and get some utility out of them by making them into a hypersonic platform,\u201d said Bryan Clark, a defense analyst at the Hudson Institute.",
      "The U.S. has had several types of hypersonic weapons in development for the past two decades, but recent tests by both Russia and China have added pressure to the U.S. military to hasten their production.",
      "Hypersonic weapons travel beyond Mach 5, five times the speed of sound, with added maneuverability making them harder to shoot down.",
      "Last year, The Washington Post reported that among the documents leaked by former Massachusetts Air National Guard member Jack Teixeira was a defense department briefing that confirmed China had recently tested an intermediate-range hypersonic weapon called the DF-27. While the Pentagon had previously acknowledged the weapon's development, it had not recognized its testing.",
      "One of the U.S. programs in development and planned for the Zumwalt is the \u201cConventional Prompt Strike.\" It would launch like a ballistic missile and then release a hypersonic glide vehicle that would travel at speeds seven to eight times faster than the speed of sound before hitting the target. The weapon system is being developed jointly by the Navy and Army. Each of the Zumwalt-class destroyers would be equipped with four missile tubes, each with three of the missiles for a total of 12 hypersonic weapons per ship.",
      "In choosing the Zumwalt, the Navy is attempting to add to the usefulness of a $7.5 billion warship that is considered by critics to be an expensive mistake despite serving as a test platform for multiple innovations.",
      "The Zumwalt was envisioned as providing land-attack capability with an Advanced Gun System with rocket-assisted projectiles to open the way for Marines to charge ashore. But the system featuring 155 mm guns hidden in stealthy turrets was canceled because each of the rocket-assisted projectiles cost between $800,000 and $1 million.",
      "Despite the stain on its reputation, the three Zumwalt-class destroyers remain the Navy\u2019s most advanced surface warship in terms of new technologies. Those innovations include electric propulsion, an angular shape to minimize radar signature, an unconventional wave-piercing hull, automated fire and damage control and a composite deckhouse that hides radar and other sensors.",
      "The Zumwalt arrived at the Huntington Ingalls Industries shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, in August 2023 and was removed from the water for the complex work of integrating the new weapon system. It is due to be undocked this week in preparation for the next round of tests and its return to the fleet, shipyard spokeswoman Kimberly Aguillard said.",
      "A U.S. hypersonic weapon was successfully tested over the summer and development of the missiles is continuing. The Navy wants to begin testing the system aboard the Zumwalt in 2027 or 2028, according to the Navy.",
      "The U.S. weapon system will come at a steep price. It would cost nearly $18 billion to buy 300 of the weapons and maintain them over 20 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Critics say there is too little bang for the buck.",
      "\u201cThis particular missile costs more than a dozen tanks. All it gets you is a precise non-nuclear explosion, some place far far away. Is it really worth the money? The answer is most of the time the missile costs much more than any target you can destroy with it,\u201d said Loren Thompson, a longtime military analyst in Washington, D.C.",
      "But they provide the capability for Navy vessels to strike an enemy from a distance of thousands of kilometers \u2014 outside the range of most enemy weapons \u2014 and there is no effective defense against them, said retired Navy Rear Adm. Ray Spicer, CEO of the U.S. Naval Institute, an independent forum focusing on national security issues, and former commander of an aircraft carrier strike force.",
      "Conventional missiles that cost less aren\u2019t much of a bargain if they are unable to reach their targets, Spicer said, adding the U.S. military really has no choice but to pursue them.",
      "\u201cThe adversary has them. We never want to be outdone,\u201d he said.",
      "The U.S. is accelerating development because hypersonics have been identified as vital to U.S. national security with \u201csurvivable and lethal capabilities,\u201d said James Weber, principal director for hypersonics in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Critical Technologies.",
      "\u201cFielding new capabilities that are based on hypersonic technologies is a priority for the defense department to sustain and strengthen our integrated deterrence, and to build enduring advantages,\u201d he said."

      "LONDON -- British lawmakers gave initial approval on Friday to a bill to help terminally ill adults end their lives in England and Wales, following an impassioned debate that saw people sharing personal stories of loss and suffering.",
      "Members of Parliament approved the assisted dying bill by a 330-275 vote, signaling their approval in principle for the bill, which will undergo further scrutiny before it goes to a final vote.",
      "Friday's vote came after hours of debate \u2014 emotional at times \u2014 that touched on issues of ethics, faith and law. There was no braying and shouting that often marks debates in the House of Commons and speeches were considered respectfully and heard in silence.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, we\u2019re not talking about a choice between life or death, we are talking about giving dying people a choice about how to die,\u201d the bill\u2019s main sponsor, Kim Leadbeater, said as she presented the bill to a packed chamber.",
      "Supporters said the law would provide dignity to the dying and prevent suffering, while protecting the vulnerable.",
      "Opponents said the disabled and elderly were at risk of being coerced, directly or indirectly, to end their lives to save money or relieve the burden on family members. Others called for the improvement of palliative care to ease suffering as an alternative.",
      "The proposed bill would allow adults over the age of 18 who are expected to have fewer than six months to live to request and be provided help to end their life, subject to several safeguards.",
      "They would have to be capable of taking the fatal drugs themselves, and two independent doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision. The bill will not apply to Scotland or Northern Ireland.",
      "Backers of the bill told heart-wrenching stories about constituents and family members who suffered in the final months of their lives and dying people who committed suicide in secret because it is currently a crime for anyone to provide assistance.",
      "Danny Kruger, who led the argument against the bill, cautioned lawmakers not to back a \u201cstate suicide service.\" He argued that no amount of safeguards will stop many vulnerable people feeling the pressure to make a request to end their lives.",
      "Kruger voiced his disappointment at the outcome but said there's a chance lawmakers will reject the bill when it comes back for a vote in the next few months. Some of those voting in favor said they only did so to examine the details further and could potentially vote against it in the future.",
      "\u201cI still think we can stop it,\u201d he said.",
      "Although the bill was proposed by Leadbeater, a member of the ruling center-left Labour Party, it was an open vote with alliances formed across the political divide.",
      "The government is widely expected to come up in the next few months with assessments on how assisted dying will be funded and how it would impact the U.K.'s state-funded National Health Service, hospice care and the legal system.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer did not show his hand ahead of the vote, but backed the change. Others in his Cabinet, including Health Secretary Wes Streeting and the Justice Minister Shabana Mahmood, voted against. There were similar divisions across other political parties.",
      "Long-time British campaigner Esther Rantzen, who is terminally ill with lung cancer and played a leading role in advocating the need for a vote on assisted dying, voiced her joy at the \u201cwonderful\u201d outcome and said it will give people an \u201cequal choice.\u201d",
      "When diagnosed with her terminal illness, Rantzen said she would travel to Switzerland to bring an end to her life, where the law allows assisted dying for non-residents.",
      "Hundreds of people on both sides of the issue gathered outside Parliament on a cold but bright day as the debate continued for nearly five hours.",
      "Opponents held signs saying, \u201cKill the bill, not the ill,\u201d and, referring to the National Health Service, \u201cNHS It's cradle to grave. Not 'til old, inconvenient or expensive!\u201d",
      "The group Dignity in Dying, many wearing pink winter hats, led supporters as they clutched signs saying \u201cGiving me choice over my death,\u201d and \u201cYou can't cure death. Please make it fear free.\u201d",
      "Backers of the measure erupted in cheers when the result was announced and hugged each other.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a relief, it\u2019s history, finally we are getting towards having a society that shows love and compassion above the need to just keep people alive,\" said Joshua Cook, 33, who has Huntington\u2019s disease, an incurable neurodegenerative disease.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",

      "Wayne Holdsworth became an advocate for banning Australian children younger than 16 from social media because his son took his own life after falling victim to an online sextortion scam",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Wayne Holdsworth became an advocate for banning Australian children younger than 16 from social media because his son took his own life after falling victim to an online sextortion scam.",
      "Mac Holdsworth died last year at his Melbourne family home at the age of 17 after a 47-year-old Sydney man who purported to be an 18-year-old woman demanded money for an intimate image the boy had shared.",
      "Since then, the grieving father has taken his tragic story to around 20 schools to warn students of the risks of social media.",
      "\u201cI saw firsthand the damage that social media could do. I saw Mac, my son, get sexually extorted on social media,\u201d Holdsworth said. \u201cHis mental health deteriorated at a rapid rate.\u201d",
      "Online predators began approaching the teenager before his 16th birthday and his father believes such a ban could have saved his life.",
      "Australia's House of Representatives on Wednesday voted for such a ban and the Senate is expected to make it law soon.",
      "Holdsworth said most of the 3,000 students he\u2019s spoken to, from age 12 to 17, agree with a ban on children under the age of 16.",
      "\u201cThey come up to me and they say, \u2018I\u2019m so glad that this is going to be implemented,\u2019\u201d Holdsworth said. \u201cEven the kids see it now that they\u2019re going to be protected from those predators outside that are preying on them.\u201d",
      "He said three girls approached him after a school address on Monday to tell him that they were being subjected to sextortion. One had already handed over 2,500 Australian dollars ($1,600) of her parents\u2019 money to a blackmailer.",
      "Holdsworth said he was the first adult they had confided in.",
      "\u201cThe parent won\u2019t know until the credit card statement comes out,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s prevalent. It happened last night and it\u2019ll happen tonight,\u201d he added.",
      "Holdsworth described the government plan to ban children younger than 16 from social media as \u201cabsolutely essential for the safety of our children.\u201d",
      "But not all parents are convinced that banning young children from social media is the answer.",
      "Critics say the legislation was rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, would not work, would create privacy risks for users of all ages and would take away parents\u2019 authority to decide what\u2019s best for their children.",
      "They also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of positive aspects of social media, drive children to the dark web, make children too young for social media reluctant to report harms they encounter, and take away incentives for platforms to make online spaces safer.",
      "Independent Sydney lawmaker Kylea Tink on Tuesday became the first member of the House of Representatives to speak publicly against the bill, which would make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "\u201cAs a mom of three young adults ... I\u2019m very aware of the negative impacts of social media and the challenges of parenting in this digital world,\u201d Tink told Parliament. \u201cI also recognize, however, that my children are digital natives and are very literate about how these platforms work. For this reason, I encourage everyone involved in this debate to ensure they are listening to the voices of young Australians when it comes to this decision-making process rather than assuming that the grownups in the room know best.\u201d",
      "Tink was among 13 lawmakers who voted against the bill in the House on Wednesday. They were overwhelmed by 102 legislators who voted for it.",
      "The platforms have urged a Senate committee that examined the legislation on Monday to delay a vote until after a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies is completed next June.",
      "The four-hour committee meeting on Monday attracted 15,000 written submissions.",
      "X Corp. told the committee that billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's platform had \u201cserious concerns as to the lawfulness of the bill,\" including its compatibility with the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.",
      "\u201cThere is no evidence that banning young people from social media will work and to make it law in the form proposed is highly problematic,\u201d X said.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the legislation was \u201cinconsistent with what Australian parents have told us that they want, which is a simple and effective way for them to set controls and manage their teens\u2019 online experience.\u201d",
      "Under the bill, parental consent for children to use social media does not override the ban.",
      "Lizzie O\u2019Shea, chair of the Digital Rights Watch charity, which aims to uphold the digital rights of Australians, said she was appalled by the process and limited timeframe the government used to pass such significant and contentious legislation.",
      "She said she was very aware of the serious risks posed by social media platforms, \"but I do not support a ban personally because I understand both the limits of that particular policy and the expert evidence that is coming out from people who work in this space about the problems for young people being excluded from those spaces,\u201d O'Shea said.",
      "Her concerns centered on privacy, negative mental health impacts on excluded children and the possibility that young children would find ways to access social media spaces that would become even less child friendly as a result of the ban.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m profoundly aware of the dangers of large social media platforms running a certain kind of business model that prioritizes data extraction and exploitation of vulnerability over the public interest or the building of community and the protection of democracy,\" she said.",
      "Swinburne University digital media expert Belinda Barnet, who supports the ban, feels she is part of a minority among professionals in the digital field.",
      "\u201cI like it mainly because I think many of the social media platforms as they exist right now are not suitable environments for young children,\u201d she said."

      "Drake has taken legal action against Universal Music Group for the second straight day in his feud with fellow hip-hop superstar Kendrick Lamar",
      "For the second straight day, Drake has taken legal action against Universal Music Group, this time in Texas, over Kendrick Lamar's diss track \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "It follows a similar filing in New York on Monday, in which Drake alleges UMG falsely pumped up the popularity of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d on Spotify and other streaming services.",
      "The two court moves have taken the bitter beef between the two hip-hop superstars to a whole new level, with the parent company of the labels for both men now pulled directly into the fight.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s filing in Bexar County alleges UMG engaged in \u201cirregular and inappropriate business practices\" to get radio airplay for \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d including making illegal payments to San Antonio-based iHeartMedia. The petition, a precursor to a potential lawsuit, seeks depositions from corporate representatives of both companies.",
      "The filing takes aim at UMG for allegedly knowing that \u201cthe song itself, as well as its accompanying album art and music video, attacked the character of another one of UMG\u2019s most prominent artists, Drake, by falsely accusing him of being a sex offender, engaging in pedophilic acts, harboring sex offenders, and committing other criminal sexual acts.\u201d",
      "The filing points out that \"the song calls Drake a \u2018certified pedophile,\u2019 a \u2018predator,\u2019 and someone whose name should \u2018be registered and placed on neighborhood watch.\u2019\"",
      "The petition says Drake could sue UMG for defamation, among other claims.",
      "A UMG representative did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the new filing. In a Monday statement in response to the New York filing, the company said the \u201csuggestion that UMG would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue. We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns.\"",
      "An email to an iHeartMedia representative seeking comment was also not immediately answered.",
      "The New York petition is also a precursor to a potential lawsuit, and alleges UMG fired employees seen as loyal to Drake \u201cin an apparent effort to conceal its schemes.\u201d",
      "The back-to-back legal maneuvers represent a major and possibly unprecedented escalation of a hip-hop feud, especially with the label representing two of the biggest stars in music sitting at the center of it.",
      "Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner who is set to headline the next Super Bowl halftime, were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago.",
      "That changed when Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply earlier this year.",
      "\u201cNot Like Us,\u201d the wildly popular Lamar single released in May, was an especially vicious moment in a flurry of dueling tracks from the two artists."

      "Scientists are using used fossilized feces and vomit from Poland to reconstruct how dinosaurs came to dominate the Earth",
      "NEW YORK -- Using fossilized feces and vomit samples from Poland, scientists have reconstructed how dinosaurs came to dominate the Earth millions of years ago.",
      "Researchers aren't sure whether dinosaurs' rise over the course of 30 million years happened because of luck, skill, climate or some combination. But they came away knowing this: \u201cIt was not a sudden thing,\u201d said study co-author Martin Qvarnstr\u00f6m from Uppsala University.",
      "The new study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, analyzed hundreds of dino droppings to reconstruct who was eating whom 200 million years ago.",
      "The first dinosaurs were go-getters, Qvarnstr\u00f6m said, eating whatever they could \u2014 including insects, fish and plants.",
      "When climate conditions changed, they were quick to adapt. Plant-eating dinosaurs, for example, ate a greater variety of greens than other vegetarians of the time, so it was easier to expand their palates when wetter conditions gave rise to new plant species.",
      "Since the study\u2019s findings were limited to Polish fossils, Qvarnstr\u00f6m said he\u2019d like to see if their ideas hold steady against fossil records from around the world.",
      "It's not uncommon for scientists to study ancient fecal matter to understand creatures of the past, said Emma Dunne, a paleobiologist at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. But fossilized feces can resemble blobs or chunks of rock, and they are not always found near fossils of the animal that made them \u2014 which makes it hard for scientists to know where they came from.",

      "The federal government is about to transition from one that prioritized safeguards for artificial intelligence to one more focused on eliminating red tape",
      "WASHINGTON -- With artificial intelligence at a pivotal moment of development, the federal government is about to transition from one that prioritized AI safeguards to one more focused on eliminating red tape.",
      "That\u2019s a promising prospect for some investors but creates uncertainty about the future of any guardrails on the technology, especially around the use of AI deepfakes in elections and political campaigns.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to rescind President Joe Biden\u2019s sweeping AI executive order, which sought to protect people\u2019s rights and safety without stifling innovation. He hasn\u2019t specified what he would do in its place, but the platform of the Republican National Committee, which he recently reshaped, said AI development should be \u201crooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s an open question whether Congress, soon to be fully controlled by Republicans, will be interested in passing any AI-related legislation. Interviews with a dozen lawmakers and industry experts reveal there is still interest in boosting the technology\u2019s use in national security and cracking down on non-consensual explicit images.",
      "Yet the use of AI in elections and in spreading misinformation is likely to take a backseat as GOP lawmakers turn away from anything they view as potentially suppressing innovation or free speech.",
      "\u201cAI has incredible potential to enhance human productivity and positively benefit our economy,\u201d said Rep. Jay Obernolte, a California Republican widely seen as a leader in the evolving technology. \u201cWe need to strike an appropriate balance between putting in place the framework to prevent the harmful things from happening while at the same time enabling innovation.\u201d",
      "Artificial intelligence interests have been expecting sweeping federal legislation for years. But Congress, gridlocked on nearly every issue, failed to pass any artificial intelligence bill, instead producing only a series of proposals and reports.",
      "Some lawmakers believe there is enough bipartisan interest around some AI-related issues to get a bill passed.",
      "\u201cI find there are Republicans that are very interested in this topic,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, singling out national security as one area of potential agreement. \"I am confident I will be able to work with them as I have in the past.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still unclear how much Republicans want the federal government to intervene in AI development. Few showed interest before this year's election in regulating how the Federal Election Commission or the Federal Communications Commission handled AI-generated content, worrying that it would raise First Amendment issues at the same time that Trump\u2019s campaign and other Republicans were using the technology to create political memes.",
      "The FCC was in the middle of a lengthy process for developing AI-related regulations when Trump won the presidency. That work has since been halted under long-established rules covering a change in administrations.",
      "Trump has expressed both interest and skepticism in artificial intelligence.",
      "During a Fox Business interview earlier this year, he called the technology \u201cvery dangerous\u201d and \u201cso scary\u201d because \u201cthere\u2019s no real solution.\u201d But his campaign and supporters also embraced AI-generated images more than their Democratic opponents. They often used them in social media posts that weren\u2019t meant to mislead, but rather to further entrench Republican political views.",
      "Elon Musk, Trump's close adviser and a founder of several companies that rely on AI, also has shown a mix of concern and excitement about the technology, depending on how it is applied.",
      "Musk used X, the social media platform he owns, to promote AI-generated images and videos throughout the election. Operatives from Americans for Responsible Innovation, a nonprofit focused on artificial intelligence, have publicly been pushing Trump to tap Musk as his top adviser on the technology.",
      "\u201cWe think that Elon has a pretty sophisticated understating of both the opportunities and risks of advanced AI systems,\u201d said Doug Calidas, a top operative from the group.",
      "But Musk advising Trump on artificial intelligence worries others. Peters argued it could undercut the president.",
      "\u201cIt is a concern,\u201d said the Michigan Democrat. \u201cWhenever you have anybody that has a strong financial interest in a particular technology, you should take their advice and counsel with a grain of salt.\u201d",
      "In the run-up to the election, many AI experts expressed concern about an eleventh-hour deepfake \u2014 a lifelike AI image, video or audio clip \u2014 that would sway or confuse voters as they headed to the polls. While those fears were never realized, AI still played a role in the election, said Vivian Schiller, executive director of Aspen Digital, part of the nonpartisan Aspen Institute think tank.",
      "\u201cI would not use the term that I hear a lot of people using, which is it was the dog that didn\u2019t bark,\u201d she said of AI in the 2024 election. \u201cIt was there, just not in the way that we expected.\u201d",
      "Campaigns used AI in algorithms to target messages to voters. AI-generated memes, though not lifelike enough to be mistaken as real, felt true enough to deepen partisan divisions.",
      "A political consultant mimicked Joe Biden\u2019s voice in robocalls that could have dissuaded voters from coming to the polls during New Hampshire's primary if they hadn\u2019t been caught quickly. And foreign actors used AI tools to create and automate fake online profiles and websites that spread disinformation to a U.S. audience.",
      "Even if AI didn\u2019t ultimately influence the election outcome, the technology made political inroads and contributed to an environment where U.S. voters don\u2019t feel confident that what they are seeing is true. That dynamic is part of the reason some in the AI industry want to see regulations that establish guidelines.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and people on his team have said they don\u2019t want to stifle the technology and they do want to support its development, so that is welcome news,\u201d said Craig Albright, the top lobbyist and senior vice president at The Software Alliance, a trade group whose members include OpenAI, Oracle and IBM. \u201cIt is our view that passing national laws to set the rules of the road will be good for developing markets for the technology.\"",
      "AI safety advocates during a recent meeting in San Francisco made similar arguments, according to Suresh Venkatasubramanian, director of the Center for Tech Responsibility at Brown University.",
      "\u201cBy putting literal guardrails, lanes, road rules, we were able to get cars that could roll a lot faster,\u201d said Venkatasubramanian, a former Biden administration official who helped craft White House principles for approaching AI.",
      "Rob Weissman, co-president of the advocacy group Public Citizen, said he's not hopeful about the prospects for federal legislation and is concerned about Trump\u2019s pledge to rescind Biden\u2019s executive order, which created an initial set of national standards for the industry. His group has advocated for federal regulation of generative AI in elections.",
      "\u201cThe safeguards are themselves ways to promote innovation so that we have AI that\u2019s useful and safe and doesn\u2019t exclude people and promotes the technology in ways that serve the public interest,\u201d he said.",

      "The major parties backed the bill that would make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "The legislation passed 102 to 13. If the bill becomes law this week, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restrictions before the penalties are enforced.",
      "Opposition lawmaker Dan Tehan told Parliament the government had agreed to accept amendments in the Senate that would bolster privacy protections. Platforms would not be allowed to compel users to provide government-issued identity documents including passports or driver\u2019s licenses, nor could they demand digital identification through a government system.",
      "\u201cWill it be perfect? No. But is any law perfect? No, it\u2019s not. But if it helps, even if it helps in just the smallest of ways, it will make a huge difference to people\u2019s lives,\u201d Tehan told Parliament.",
      "The bill was introduced to the Senate late Wednesday but it adjourned for the day hours later without putting it to a vote. The legislation will likely be passed on Thursday, the Parliament's final session for the year and potentially the last before elections, which are due within months.",
      "The major parties\u2019 support all but guarantees the legislation will pass in the Senate, where no party holds a majority of seats.",
      "Lawmakers who were not aligned with either the government or the opposition were most critical of the legislation during debate on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Criticisms include that the legislation had been rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, would not work, would create privacy risks for users of all ages and would take away parents\u2019 authority to decide what\u2019s best for their children.",
      "Critics also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of positive aspects of social media, drive children to the dark web, make children too young for social media reluctant to report harms encountered, and take away incentives for platforms to make online spaces safer.",
      "Independent lawmaker Zoe Daniel said the legislation would \u201cmake zero difference to the harms that are inherent to social media.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe true object of this legislation is not to make social media safe by design, but to make parents and voters feel like the government is doing something about it,\u201d Daniel told Parliament.",
      "\u201cThere is a reason why the government parades this legislation as world-leading, that\u2019s because no other country wants to do it,\u201d she added.",
      "The platforms had asked for the vote to be delayed until at least June next year when a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies made its report on how the ban could be enforced.",
      "Melbourne resident Wayne Holdsworth, whose 17-year-old son Mac took his own life last year after falling victim to an online sextortion scam, described the bill as \u201cabsolutely essential for the safety of our children.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the only thing that we need to do to protect them because education is the key, but to provide some immediate support for our children and parents to be able to manage this, it\u2019s a great step,\u201d the 65-year-old online safety campaigner told The Associated Press on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cAnd in my opinion, it\u2019s the greatest time in our country\u2019s history,\u201d he added, referring to the pending legal reform."

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- A social media ban for children under 16 passed the Australian Parliament on Friday in a world-first law.",
      "The law will make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts.",
      "The Senate passed the bill on Thursday 34 votes to 19. The House of Representatives on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved the legislation by 102 votes to 13.",
      "The House on Friday endorsed opposition amendments made in the Senate, making the bill law.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the law supported parents concerned by online harms to their children.",
      "\u201cPlatforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them,\u201d Albanese told reporters.",
      "The platforms have one year to work out how they could implement the ban before penalties are enforced.",
      "Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the legislation had been \u201crushed.\u201d",
      "Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the platforms in Australia, said questions remain about the law\u2019s impact on children, its technical foundations and scope.",
      "\u201cThe social media ban legislation has been released and passed within a week and, as a result, no one can confidently explain how it will work in practice \u2013 the community and platforms are in the dark about what exactly is required of them,\u201d DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said.",
      "The amendments passed on Friday bolster privacy protections. Platforms would not be allowed to compel users to provide government-issued identity documents including passports or driver\u2019s licenses, nor could they demand digital identification through a government system.",
      "Critics of the legislation fear that banning young children from social media will impact the privacy of all users who must establish they are older than 16.",
      "While the major parties support the ban, many child welfare and mental health advocates are concerned about unintended consequences.",
      "Sen. David Shoebridge, from the minority Greens party, said mental health experts agreed that the ban could dangerously isolate many children who used social media to find support.",
      "\u201cThis policy will hurt vulnerable young people the most, especially in regional communities and especially the LGBTQI community, by cutting them off,\u201d Shoebridge told the Senate.",
      "Exemptions will apply for health and education services including YouTube, Messenger Kids, WhatsApp, Kids Helpline and Google Classroom.",
      "Opposition Sen. Maria Kovacic said the bill was not radical but necessary. \u201cThe core focus of this legislation is simple: It demands that social media companies take reasonable steps to identify and remove underage users from their platforms,\u201d Kovacic told the Senate.",
      "\u201cThis is a responsibility these companies should have been fulfilling long ago, but for too long they have shirked these responsibilities in favor of profit,\u201d she added.",
      "Online safety campaigner Sonya Ryan, whose 15-year-old daughter Carly was murdered by a 50-year-old pedophile who pretended to be a teenager online, described the Senate vote as a \u201cmonumental moment in protecting our children from horrendous harms online.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too late for my daughter, Carly, and the many other children who have suffered terribly and those who have lost their lives in Australia, but let us stand together on their behalf and embrace this together,\u201d she said.",
      "Wayne Holdsworth, whose teenage son Mac took his own life after falling victim to an online sextortion scam, had advocated for the age restriction and took pride in its passage.",
      "\u201cI have always been a proud Australian, but for me subsequent to today\u2019s Senate decision, I am bursting with pride,\u201d Holdsworth said.",
      "Christopher Stone, executive director of Suicide Prevention Australia, the governing body for the suicide prevention sector, said the legislation failed to consider positive aspects of social media in supporting young people\u2019s mental health and sense of connection.",
      "\u201cThe government is running blindfolded into a brick wall by rushing this legislation. Young Australians deserve evidence-based policies, not decisions made in haste,\u201d Stone said.",
      "The platforms had complained that the law would be unworkable and had urged the Senate to delay the vote until at least June 2025 when a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies will report on how young children could be excluded.",
      "\u201cNaturally, we respect the laws decided by the Australian Parliament,\" Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms said. \u201cHowever, we are concerned about the process which rushed the legislation through while failing to properly consider the evidence, what industry already does to ensure age-appropriate experiences, and the voices of young people.\u201d",
      "Snapchat said it was also concerned by the law and would cooperate with the government regulator, the eSafety Commissioner.",
      "\"While there are many unanswered questions about how this law will be implemented in practice, we will engage closely with the Government and the eSafety Commissioner during the 12-month implementation period to help develop an approach that balances privacy, safety and practicality. As always, Snap will comply with any applicable laws and regulations in Australia,\u201d Snapchat said in a statement.",
      "Critics argue the government is attempting to convince parents it is protecting their children ahead of a general election due by May. The government hopes that voters will reward it for responding to parents\u2019 concerns about their children\u2019s addiction to social media. Some argue the legislation could cause more harm than it prevents.",
      "Criticisms include that the legislation was rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, is ineffective, poses privacy risks for all users, and undermines the authority of parents to make decisions for their children.",
      "Opponents also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of the positive aspects of social media, drive them to the dark web, discourage children too young for social media to report harm, and reduce incentives for platforms to improve online safety.",

      "Drake has begun legal action against Universal Music Group, alleging the company conspired to falsely pump up the popularity of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "Drake alleged in a court filing Monday that Universal Music Group falsely pumped up the popularity on Spotify and other streaming services of Kendrick Lamar's \u201cNot Like Us,\" a song that viciously attacked Drake amid a bitter feud between the two hip-hop superstars.",
      "The petition in a New York court by the rapper's company Frozen Moments LLC demands the preservation and divulgence of information that might be evidence in a potential lawsuit against UMG, which is the distributor for the record labels of both Drake and Lamar.",
      "In allegations that UMG calls \u201coffensive and untrue,\u201d the filing says the record company \u201claunched a campaign to manipulate and saturate the streaming services and airwaves with a song, \u2018Not Like Us,\u2019 in order to make that song go viral, including by using \u2018bots\u2019 and pay-to-play agreements.\u201d It said the company and Spotify \u201chave a long-standing, symbiotic business relationship\u201d and alleges that UMG offered special licensing rates to Spotify for the song.",
      "The petition also says UMG has fired employees seen as loyal to Drake \"in an apparent effort to conceal its schemes.\"",
      "Universal Music Group said in a statement in response that the \"suggestion that UMG would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue. We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns. No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot Like Us,\u201d the wildly popular Lamar single released in May as part of a flurry of dueling tracks by the two artists, includes the lyrics, \u201cSay, Drake, I hear you like \u2019em young, You better not ever go to cell block one.\u201d It has gotten more than 900 million plays, according to figures listed on Spotify.",
      "Spotify representatives declined immediate comment, but in a statement on a previous case, the company said it \u201cinvests heavily in automated and manual reviews to prevent, detect, and mitigate the impact of artificial streaming on our platform,\u201d and in broader public statements has said it has gone to great lengths to mitigate the effects of bad actors on streaming numbers and royalties.",
      "The feud between Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner who is set to headline the next Super Bowl halftime, is among the biggest in hip-hop in recent years, with two of the genre's biggest stars at its center.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply earlier this year. The move to court, while not yet a lawsuit, still represents a major escalation of the feud and involves some of the biggest business partners of both men."

      "Billionaire businessman Massad Boulos, father of Trump's son-in-law Michael Boulos, will serve as White House senior adviser on Arab and Middle East affairs, Trump announced on his Truth Social media platform. Born in Lebanon, Massad Boulos runs Nigeria-based Boulos Enterprises, which produces and distributes mechanical equipment and motorcycles.",
      "\"Massad is an accomplished lawyer and a highly respected leader in the business world, with extensive experience on the International scene,\" Trump wrote. \"He has been a longtime proponent of Republican and Conservative values, an asset to my Campaign, and was instrumental in building tremendous new coalitions with the Arab American Community.\"",

      "During the final stretch of Trump's victorious presidential campaign, Boulos appeared with him at campaign stops in Dearborn, Michigan, an Arab American stronghold, and was praised by Trump for helping him flip Michigan from a blue to a red state.",
      "\u201cObviously the No. 1 point that is of high priority within the Arab American community is the current war in the Middle East,\" Boulos told The Associated Press in June. \"And the question is, who can bring peace and who is bringing war? And they know the answer to that.\"",
      "In September, Boulos met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, the New York Times reported.

      "The announcement of Boulos being picked as a White House senior adviser came a day after Trump picked billionaire real estate developer Charles Kushner to serve as ambassador to France.

      "Fresh off his gubernatorial victory, Stein pointed to Democrats winning North Carolina's secretary of state and attorney general races.

      "Stein outperformed Harris in North Carolina, winning 55% of the vote to Harris' 48%. In the statehouse, Democrats won enough seats to stave off a Republican supermajority. Stein heavily outraised his opponent and used social media to highlight Robinson's incendiary remarks.",

      "\"I think the fact that I had a track record of delivering for the people of North Carolina as their attorney general helped give them confidence in knowing that I wasn't just speaking words, but that I would work hard every day to deliver,\" Stein said.",

      "Reps. Joe Courtney, Jahana Hayes, Jim Himes and John Larson all said their homes were targeted on Thursday.",
      "\"This morning, I was notified of a bomb threat targeting my home where I was celebrating Thanksgiving with my family,\" Himes said in a statement. \"Thankfully, after a swift and thorough response from the United States Capitol Police, the Greenwich Police Department and the Stamford Police Department, no evidence of a bomb was found.\"",
      "Hayes said in a statement she was notified by local police that it received a threatening email stating a pipe bomb had been placed in her mailbox at home. Police did not find any evidence of a pipe bomb in his mailbox and said there's no place for political violence in the country.",
      "\"State police, U.S. Capitol Police, and the Sergeant at Arms were immediately notified. The Wolcott Police Department and State Police responded and no bomb or explosive materials were discovered and the scene was cleared. At this time the investigation is ongoing. I thank law enforcement for their swift attention to this matter, their actions demonstrate there is no place in our country for political violence.\"",
      "Local outlets in Connecticut reported that Larson and Courtney have received similar threats. ABC News has reached out for comment. A spokesperson for Connecticut Democrat Sen. Chris Murphy said his office also was targeted by a bomb threat.",

Thanks to the swift reaction from law enforcement, no devices were found and Members of Congress and their families were kept safe on the holiday.\"",

      "President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden held an emotional commemoration for World AIDS Day at the White House on Sunday, expressing empathy with families who have lost loved ones and telling them they \u201cfelt a special obligation to use this sacred place to ensure everyone is seen.\u201d",
      "Behind the Bidens, a giant red ribbon hung on the South Portico and the AIDS Memorial Quilt was placed across the South Lawn. The quilt now with 50,000 panels with 110,000 names and weighs 54 tons. This was the first time it has been displayed on the lawn.",
      "\u201cLike the first threads of this quilt\u2026 this movement is fully woven into the fabric and history of America,\u201d Biden said. \u201cShining a light on the memory and the legacy of all the sisters and brothers, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, moms and dads, partners and friends who have lost, we've lost to this terrible disease.\u201d",
      "The president and first lady were emotional throughout the event, with the president appearing to occasionally wipe tears from his face during Jill Biden\u2019s remarks and the first lady choking up as she spoke in front of survivors, their families and advocates.",
      "\u201cAnd though we are strangers, we know untellable truths about one another that we will spend the rest of our lives longing for a face that's gone forever,\u201d Jill Biden said, having to pause for a moment. \u201cAnd that when they left our world, they took a light inside us with them.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs I look at this beautiful quilt with its bright colors, the names in big block letters, renderings of lives and loves, I see it as a mom, and I think of the mothers who stitched their pain into a patchworked panel so the world would remember their child not as a victim of a vicious disease, but as a son who had played in the high school jazz band, as a child, who grew up to proudly serve our nation in uniform, as the daughter whose favorite holiday was Christmas,\u201d she continued.",
      "President Biden is no stranger to grief and often references his own loss during similar events. On Sunday he acknowledged that though the ceremony was a celebration of those lives lost, \u201cthey bring back all the memories.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey're hard. It's not easy. It's important, but it's not easy.\u201d",
      "He said the White House ceremony sends a \u201cclear message\u201d to the world that the U.S. stands united in the fight against the epidemic.",
      "\u201cTogether, we honor the spirit of resilience and the extraordinary strength of people, families and communities affected by HIV/AIDS. Including nearly 40 million people living with HIV around the world today,\u201d he said.",
      "Biden pointed out the \u201cstigma of misinformation\u201d and failures of the U.S. government to act when the epidemic was raging, saying it \u201ccompounded pain and trauma for a community watching a generation of loved ones and friends perish.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was horribly, horribly wrong,\u201d he said.",
      "Biden highlighted the progress that\u2019s been made under his administration in the fight against HIV/AIDS and fighting the stigma of discrimination against the HIV community. He also called attention to Dr. Anthony Fauci, who attended the event, for his leading efforts to advance the fight over his career.",
      "As he prepared to leave for Africa in the evening, Biden credited former President George W. Bush for creating PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which has improved outcomes for people living with HIV on the African continent and saved more than 26 million lives globally.",
      "Biden said he plans to call on Congress to pass a five-year PEPFAR reauthorization to sustain this progress before he leaves office in January.",

      "Pennsylvania Sen.-elect Dave McCormick posted a photo on X Friday night that showed Trump and Trudeau sitting together at a table in the club at Mar-a-Lago. Also included in the photo are Trump's interior secretary pick, Doug Burgum; his secretary of commerce pick, Howard Lutnick; and Trump's pick for national security adviser, Mike Waltz.",
      "\"We discussed many important topics that will require both Countries to work together to address, like the Fentanyl and Drug Crisis that has decimated so many lives as a result of Illegal Immigration, Fair Trade Deals that do not jeopardize American Workers, and the massive Trade Deficit the U.S. has with Canada,\" Trump posted Saturday afternoon on his social media platform Truth Social. \"Prime Minister Trudeau has made a commitment to work with us to end this terrible devastation of U.S. Families. We also spoke about many other important topics like Energy, Trade, and the Arctic.\"",
      "The meeting came after Trump threatened sweeping 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada until both countries stop what he claims is a flow of drugs and illegal immigrants into the United States.",
      "Trudeau told reporters earlier this week after he and Trump spoke on the phone following the tariff threat that they had a \"good call.\" He added that he looks forward to \"lots of great conversations\" with Trump.",
      "The prime minister has cited the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or UMSCA, negotiations as a sign he believes he can work with Trump on trade and avoid a trade war.",
      "USMCA went into effect in 2020 after it was signed by Trump and was designed to provide mostly duty-free trade among the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Trump's tariff threats could put that deal in jeopardy.",
      "The terms of USMCA allow it to be renegotiated after six years, in 2026, but experts have told ABC News that the tariff threat may be an effort to move up that negotiation window.",
      "However, some experts told ABC News' Selina Wang and Karen Travers that the threat is not likely to work in a second Trump term because it is \"the same playbook done the second time around. If you're on the football field and you call the same play twice, it's not going to be as effective the second time.\"",
      "The tariffs also could significantly raise prices for goods after Trump ran his campaign on lowering too-high inflation.",
      "Trudeau spoke with Trump on Monday, Nov. 25, after Trump had announced the day-one tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as on China, the U.S.'s top three trading partners.",
      "\"We talked about some of the challenges that we can work on together,\" he told reporters of the call. \"This is a relationship that we know takes a certain amount of working on, and that's what we'll do.\"",
      "Trudeau's plane landed at Palm Beach International Airport on Friday ahead of an expected dinner at Mar-a-Lago with the president-elect, according to reports.",

    "summary": "Republicans will control the White House and both houses of Congress come January",
    "story": [
      "Republicans will control the White House and both houses of Congress come January",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans will control the White House and both houses of Congress come January. But President-elect Donald Trump's intent to nominate loyalists to fill key Cabinet posts has set up a possible confrontation with the Senate, which has the constitutional responsibility for \u201cadvice and consent\u201d on presidential nominees.",
      "Trump and his Republican allies are talking about going around the Senate and using temporary recess appointments, which last no more than two years.",
      "Invoking that authority could result in a fight that lands at the Supreme Court. Trump might also have to claim another, never-before-used power to force the Senate into a recess, if it won't agree to one.",
      "In its 234 years, the Supreme Court has decided only one case involving recess appointments. In 2014, the justices unanimously ruled that Democratic President Barack Obama's recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board were illegal.",
      "But they disagreed sharply over the reach of the decision. Five justices backed a limited ruling that held the Senate wasn't actually in recess when Obama acted and, in any event, a break had to be at least 10 days before the president could act on his own.",
      "Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the other four justices, would have held that the only recess recognized by the Constitution occurs between the annual sessions of Congress, not breaks taken during a session. That would have ruled out the appointments Trump may be considering after the new Congress begins in January and he is sworn into office.",
      "Just two justices, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, remain from the five-justice bloc that took the view that preserved the president's power to make recess appointments during a session of Congress. Three others, John Roberts, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, joined the Scalia opinion that would have made it virtually impossible for any future president to make recess appointments.",
      "The rest of the court has become more conservative since then, a result of Trump's three high court appointments in his first term. Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett have no record on this issue, which rarely arises in the courts. Nor does Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a 2022 appointee of Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "A more conservative Supreme Court might come out differently today, though it\u2019s by no means certain. Once the court decides a case, the ruling is regarded as precedent that is not lightly discarded. So even some justices who initially dissent from a ruling will go along in later cases on a similar topic.",
      "Scalia, an icon of the right, applied his originalist approach to the Constitution to conclude that there was little doubt what the framers were trying to do.",
      "The whole point of the constitutional provision on recess appointments, adopted in 1787 in the era of horse and buggy, was that the Senate could not quickly be summoned to fill critical vacancies, he wrote.",
      "Reading a summary of his opinion aloud in the courtroom on June 26, 2014, Scalia said the power to make recess appointments \u201cis an anachronism.\u201d",
      "The Senate always can be convened on short notice to consider a president\u2019s nominations, he said.",
      "\u201cThe only remaining practical use for the recess appointment power is the ignoble one of enabling presidents to circumvent the Senate\u2019s role in the appointment process, which is precisely what happened here,\u201d Scalia said.",
      "It's not likely to happen quickly. Only someone who has been affected by an action taken by an official who was given a recess appointment would have the legal right, or standing, to sue. In the NLRB case, Obama made his recess appointments in January 2012.",
      "The board then ruled against Noel Canning, a soft drink bottling company in Yakima, Washington, in a dispute over contract negotiations with a local Teamsters union. The company sued, claiming that the NLRB decision against it was not valid because the board members were not properly appointed and that the board did not have enough members to do business without the improperly appointed officials.",
      "The Supreme Court's ultimate decision came nearly 2 1/2 years later.",
      "Among the most prominent people who were first given recess appointments and later confirmed by the Senate are Chief Justice Earl Warren, Justice William Brennan and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Among those who left office after failing to win a Senate vote is John Bolton, who was given a recess appointment as U.N. ambassador under Republican President George W. Bush.",
      "A separate novel legal issue could arise if Trump were to invoke a constitutional provision that his allies suggested would allow him to force the Senate to adjourn, even if doesn't want to, and enable him to make recess appointments.",
      "Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution includes a clause about congressional adjournments that has never been invoked. Trump's allies read it as giving the chief executive the power step in when the House and Senate can\u2019t agree on when to adjourn. The provision reads that \u201cin case of disagreement between them, with respect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper.\u201d",
      "But some scholars, including conservative ones, argue that the House has no power to force the Senate to adjourn, and vice versa. Congressional adjournments are spelled out in Article I, which requires one chamber to consent when the other wants to take a break of more than three days. Under this view, the president could intervene only when one house objects to the other's adjournment plan.",

      "Republicans swept to power on Election Day and now control the House, the Senate and the White House, with plans for an ambitious 100-day agenda come January",
      "WASHINGTON -- A tax break for millionaires, and almost everyone else.",
      "An end to the COVID-19-era government subsidies that some Americans have used to purchase health insurance.",
      "Limits to food stamps, including for women and children, and other safety net programs. Rollbacks to Biden-era green energy programs. Mass deportations. Government job cuts to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d",
      "Having won the election and sweeping to power, Republicans are planning an ambitious 100-day agenda with President-elect Donald Trump in the White House and GOP lawmakers in a congressional majority to accomplish their policy goals.",
      "Atop the list is the plan to renew some $4 trillion in expiring GOP tax cuts, a signature domestic achievement of Trump's first term and an issue that may define his return to the White House.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re focused on right now is being ready, Day 1,\u201d said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., after meeting recently with GOP colleagues to map out the road ahead.",
      "The policies emerging will revive long-running debates about America's priorities, its gaping income inequities and the proper size and scope of its government, especially in the face of mounting federal deficits now approaching $2 trillion a year.",
      "The discussions will test whether Trump and his Republican allies can achieve the kinds of real-world outcomes wanted, needed or supported when voters gave the party control of Congress and the White House.",
      "\u201cThe past is really prologue here,\u201d said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, recalling the 2017 tax debate.",
      "Trump\u2019s first term became defined by those tax cuts, which were approved by Republicans in Congress and signed into law only after their initial campaign promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d Democratic President Barack Obama's health care law sputtered, failing with the famous thumbs-down vote by then-Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.",
      "The GOP majority in Congress quickly pivoted to tax cuts, assembling and approving the multitrillion-dollar package by year\u2019s end.",
      "In the time since Trump signed those cuts into law, the big benefits have accrued to higher-income households. The top 1 percent \u2014 those making nearly $1 million and above \u2014 received about a $60,000 income tax cut, while those with lower incomes got as little as a few hundred dollars, according to the Tax Policy Center and other groups. Some people ended up paying about the same.",
      "\u201cThe big economic story in the U.S. is soaring income inequality,\u201d said Owens. \u201cAnd that is actually, interestingly, a tax story.\u201d",
      "In preparation for Trump\u2019s return, Republicans in Congress have been meeting privately for months and with the president-elect to go over proposals to extend and enhance those tax breaks, some of which would otherwise expire in 2025.",
      "That means keeping in place various tax brackets and a standardized deduction for individual earners, along with the existing rates for so-called pass-through entities such as law firms, doctors' offices or businesses that take their earnings as individual income.",
      "Typically, the price tag for the tax cuts would be prohibitive. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that keeping the expiring provisions in place would add some $4 trillion to deficits over a decade.",
      "Adding to that, Trump wants to include his own priorities in the tax package, including lowering the corporate rate, now at 21% from the 2017 law, to 15%, and doing away with individual taxes on tips and overtime pay.",
      "But Avik Roy, president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, said blaming the tax cuts for the nation's income inequality is \u201cjust nonsense\u201d because tax filers up and down the income ladder benefited. He instead points to other factors, including the Federal Reserve's historically low interest rates that enable borrowing, including for the wealthy, on the cheap.",
      "\u201cAmericans don\u2019t care if Elon Musk is rich,\u201d Roy said. \u201cWhat they care about is, what are you doing to make their lives better?\u201d",
      "Typically, lawmakers want the cost of a policy change to be offset by budget revenue or reductions elsewhere. But in this case, there's almost no agreed-upon revenue raisers or spending cuts in the annual $6 trillion budget that could cover such a whopping price tag.",
      "Instead, some Republicans have argued that the tax breaks will pay for themselves, with the trickle-down revenue from potential economic growth. Trump\u2019s tariffs floated this past week could provide another source of offsetting revenue.",
      "Some Republicans argue there's precedent for simply extending the tax cuts without offsetting the costs because they are not new changes but existing federal policy.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re just extending current law, we\u2019re not raising taxes or lowering taxes,\" said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, the incoming chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, on Fox News.",
      "He said the criticism that tax cuts would add to the deficit is \u201cridiculous.\u201d There is a difference between taxes and spending, he said, \"and we just have to get that message out to America.\u201d",
      "At the same time, the new Congress will also be considering spending reductions, particularly to food stamps and health care programs, goals long sought by conservatives as part of the annual appropriations process.",
      "One cut is almost certain to fall on the COVID-19-era subsidy that helps defray the cost of health insurance for people who buy their own policies via the Affordable Care Act exchange.",
      "The extra health care subsidies were extended through 2025 in Democratic President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which also includes various green energy tax breaks that Republicans want to roll back.",
      "The House Democratic leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, scoffed at the Republican claim that they've won \u201csome big, massive mandate\u201d \u2014 when in fact, the House Democrats and Republicans essentially fought to a draw in the November election, with the GOP eking out a narrow majority.",
      "\u201cThis notion about some mandate to make massive, far-right extreme policy changes, it doesn't exist \u2014 it doesn't exist,\u201d Jeffries said.",
      "Republicans are planning to use a budgetary process, called reconciliation, that allows majority passage in Congress, essentially along party lines, without the threat of a filibuster in the Senate that can stall out a bill\u2019s advance unless 60 of the 100 senators agree.",
      "It\u2019s the same process Democrats have used when they had the power in Washington to approve the Inflation Reduction Act and Obama's health care law over GOP objections.",
      "Republicans have been here before with Trump and control of Congress, which is no guarantee they will be able to accomplish their goals, particularly in the face of resistance from Democrats.",
      "Still, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who has been working closely with Trump on the agenda, has promised a \u201cbreakneck\u201d pace in the first 100 days \u201cbecause we have a lot to fix.\u201d",

      "He will also announce new deliverables related to global health security, agribusiness, security cooperation and preserving Angola's cultural heritage.",
      "In 2022, the United States pledged to invest $55 billion in Africa over three years, and a senior administration official said 80% of that commitment has already been met.",
      "\"Over the last couple of years, in Angola, through U.S. government investment, there has been an added more telecommunications, more people are getting connected to 3G and now building out 5G networks, as well as building out renewable energy,\" the official said. \"In fact, the U.S. has approved financing through [the Export-Import Bank] of nearly $2.5 billion of renewable energy projects that will be able to take countries from energy deficit to energy exporters to their neighbors.\"",
      "The Biden administration has been trying to counter China's growing influence in Africa and sizable commitments of their own, including $50 billion in support announced in September that would go toward infrastructure and at least 1 million jobs.",
      "The official added that \"we don't think it's a bad thing\" for China to invest in Africa but warned about what could happen in the long run with that support, opposed to \"meaningful\" investments offered by the U.S.",
      "\"If it means that at the end of a few years of investment, the communities that live in the area of the investment have not seen any increase in GDP, that they've not seen benefits of their lives in it, that it has not lifted the lives of the communities, if it means that the government is going to be living under crushing debt for generations to come \u2026 then the government's going to have to make the decision whether that's the alternative they want,\" the official said.",
      "\"What we have heard repeatedly over years is that people want to have more -- people in Africa want to have more alternatives for investment, not less. But if they don't have the alternative, they are forced to go with the with the one investment they have.\"",
      "Biden is squeezing in this trip with less than two months to go before leaving office after promising to visit back in 2022. Senior administration officials said he has wanted to make this trip for a long time. While that was being worked on, over 20 Cabinet-level and senior officials traveled to the continent in the past two years, including Vice President Kamala Harris in March of 2023.",

      "Now, Starr County will play a key role in Trump's mass deportation plans.",
      "Starr County, Texas, voted predominantly Republican this month -- for the first time in 100 years.",
      "Home to some 75,000 residents across about 1,200 square miles, it has a relatively small footprint, in a state where everything is glorified for its bigness.",
      "But it's been making an outsized impression in national politics. Even after its historic flip from blue to red, a century in the making, it's continued to garner headlines.",
      "Last week, Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham offered up 1,402 acres of Starr County to facilitate President-elect Donald Trump's mass deportation plans.",
      "In a letter to Trump dated Nov. 19, Buckingham said she's offering the land, located along the border of Mexico, \"to be used to construct deportation facilities.\"",
      "She has also proposed alternative uses for it, including as a site for detention centers.",
      "\"Now it's essentially farmland, so it's flat, it's easy to build on. We can very easily put a detention center on there -- a holding place as we get these criminals out of our country,\" Buckingham said in a recent interview with Fox News.",
      "The land, which Buckingham declared property of the state in 2023, adds to another parcel previously owned by the Texas General Land Office, bringing the southern border acreage that it controls in Starr County up to 4,000.",
      "ABC News' Mireya Villarreal visited Starr County to ask residents what issues and values most influenced them to vote for Republican candidates this year, instead of upholding their century-long blue streak.",
      "\"The economy is just driving, I think, everybody crazy,\" said Becky Garza, the owner of Texas Cafe in Rio Grande City, the largest city in Starr County.",
      "She explained that she used to complain about buying a box of eggs for $10, and now they're $20.",
      "\"If things don't get better, I might have to either cut staff, cut hours, or I'm going to start with cutting hours and then from there work it, maybe cut down, maybe cut the menu, you know, to keep the place open, you know, because I don't want to lose my my customers,\" Garza said.",
      "And she doesn't think she's the only one who's making those kinds of hard decisions, she told ABC News.",
      "Jaime Escobar, the mayor of neighboring Roma, another city of Starr County, agrees. He suggested that residents are more influenced by the local economy than what's being said in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"We no longer want to be considered just a poor community because we're rich culturally,\" he told ABC News. \"We're proud of our Mexican-American heritage, but we don't -- no longer want to be dependent just on the government.\"",
      "But with D.C. being invited into their backyard, it's bound to bring the topic of migration and deportation to the forefront -- even for those who may not have prioritized the issue during the election cycle.",
      "Asked about how people might respond to a detention facility in nearby Starr County, Escobar said, \"People don't want families to be torn apart. That's the last thing we want.\"",
      "\"But at the same time,\" he added, \"we hope that Trump and his administration do the right thing and focus on the criminal element first, and then see how in the meantime, we'll see how the policies can be implemented in a better way.\"",
      "Buckingham, on the other hand, believes that \"folks who live down on the border feel really abandoned by those open border policies.\"",
      "She told ABC News, \"They feel like it's directly harming their communities, both their safety and their prosperity.\"",
      "In the same interview this week with ABC News, Buckingham also said that she would \"absolutely\" offer up even more of Texas, the way that she did Starr County.",
      "\"I have 13 million acres. If any of them can be of help in this process, we're happy to have that discussion,\" Buckingham said.",
      "Trump has said he would carry out his mass deportation plans -- a top campaign promise -- by declaring a national emergency and using \"military assets\" to deport migrants currently living in the U.S. without legal permission.",
      "He backed up his commitment with the choice of several immigration hard-liners to join his administration, including South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem for secretary of homeland security and former director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Tom Homan as \"border czar.\" Both picks require Senate confirmation.",
      "But with an estimated 11 million people presumed to be living in the U.S. without legal immigration status, the promises have raised questions of both feasibility and cost.",
      "Removing them could cost billions of dollars per year, according to estimates from the American Immigration Council.",
      "And while Republican-friendly areas of Texas might feel compelled to support the effort, other southern border states, like Arizona and California, have already expressed their disinterest.",
      "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs told ABC News Live last week that she would not use state police or the National Guard to help with mass deportation.",
      "\"We will not be participating in misguided efforts that harm our communities,\" she said.",

      "Airlines for America, the leading trade group for big U.S. carriers, dismissed the report as \u201cjust another holiday-travel talking point.\u201d",
      "The group said fees give consumers the choice of paying for the services they want and skipping ones they don\u2019t. It said that after accounting for inflation, average U.S. round-trip travel including fees dropped 14% from 2010 to 2023.",
      "TSA says it\u2019s OK to bring turkey, stuffing and other favorite holiday foods through airport checkpoints, although liquids such as gravy and cranberry sauce can\u2019t exceed 3.4 ounces.",
      "Just because you can carry it on the plane doesn\u2019t mean you should.",
      "\u201cEspecially when it comes to gravy, I wouldn\u2019t want that in my carry-on luggage, and I definitely wouldn\u2019t want it in my checked baggage,\u201d TSA spokesperson Lorie Dankers said.",
      "Thanksgiving brings out infrequent flyers, and they often have questions about what they can bring on the plane. The TSA app and website have lists of items that are banned or restricted.",
      "Drivers should know that Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons will be the worst times to travel by car, but it should be smooth sailing on freeways come Thanksgiving Day, according to transportation analytics company INRIX.",
      "On the return home, the best travel times for motorists are before 1 p.m. on Sunday, and before 8 a.m. or after 7 p.m. on Monday, the company said.",
      "In metropolitan areas like Boston, Los Angeles, New York, Seattle and Washington, \u201ctraffic is expected to be more than double what it typically is on a normal day,\u201d INRIX transportation analyst Bob Pishue said.",

    "summary": "Republicans will control the White House and both houses of Congress come January",
    "story": [
      "Republicans will control the White House and both houses of Congress come January",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans will control the White House and both houses of Congress come January. But President-elect Donald Trump's intent to nominate loyalists to fill key Cabinet posts has set up a possible confrontation with the Senate, which has the constitutional responsibility for \u201cadvice and consent\u201d on presidential nominees.",
      "Trump and his Republican allies are talking about going around the Senate and using temporary recess appointments, which last no more than two years.",
      "Invoking that authority could result in a fight that lands at the Supreme Court. Trump might also have to claim another, never-before-used power to force the Senate into a recess, if it won't agree to one.",
      "In its 234 years, the Supreme Court has decided only one case involving recess appointments. In 2014, the justices unanimously ruled that Democratic President Barack Obama's recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board were illegal.",
      "But they disagreed sharply over the reach of the decision. Five justices backed a limited ruling that held the Senate wasn't actually in recess when Obama acted and, in any event, a break had to be at least 10 days before the president could act on his own.",
      "Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the other four justices, would have held that the only recess recognized by the Constitution occurs between the annual sessions of Congress, not breaks taken during a session. That would have ruled out the appointments Trump may be considering after the new Congress begins in January and he is sworn into office.",
      "Just two justices, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, remain from the five-justice bloc that took the view that preserved the president's power to make recess appointments during a session of Congress. Three others, John Roberts, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, joined the Scalia opinion that would have made it virtually impossible for any future president to make recess appointments.",
      "The rest of the court has become more conservative since then, a result of Trump's three high court appointments in his first term. Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett have no record on this issue, which rarely arises in the courts. Nor does Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a 2022 appointee of Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "A more conservative Supreme Court might come out differently today, though it\u2019s by no means certain. Once the court decides a case, the ruling is regarded as precedent that is not lightly discarded. So even some justices who initially dissent from a ruling will go along in later cases on a similar topic.",
      "Scalia, an icon of the right, applied his originalist approach to the Constitution to conclude that there was little doubt what the framers were trying to do.",
      "The whole point of the constitutional provision on recess appointments, adopted in 1787 in the era of horse and buggy, was that the Senate could not quickly be summoned to fill critical vacancies, he wrote.",
      "Reading a summary of his opinion aloud in the courtroom on June 26, 2014, Scalia said the power to make recess appointments \u201cis an anachronism.\u201d",
      "The Senate always can be convened on short notice to consider a president\u2019s nominations, he said.",
      "\u201cThe only remaining practical use for the recess appointment power is the ignoble one of enabling presidents to circumvent the Senate\u2019s role in the appointment process, which is precisely what happened here,\u201d Scalia said.",
      "It's not likely to happen quickly. Only someone who has been affected by an action taken by an official who was given a recess appointment would have the legal right, or standing, to sue. In the NLRB case, Obama made his recess appointments in January 2012.",
      "The board then ruled against Noel Canning, a soft drink bottling company in Yakima, Washington, in a dispute over contract negotiations with a local Teamsters union. The company sued, claiming that the NLRB decision against it was not valid because the board members were not properly appointed and that the board did not have enough members to do business without the improperly appointed officials.",
      "The Supreme Court's ultimate decision came nearly 2 1/2 years later.",
      "Among the most prominent people who were first given recess appointments and later confirmed by the Senate are Chief Justice Earl Warren, Justice William Brennan and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Among those who left office after failing to win a Senate vote is John Bolton, who was given a recess appointment as U.N. ambassador under Republican President George W. Bush.",
      "A separate novel legal issue could arise if Trump were to invoke a constitutional provision that his allies suggested would allow him to force the Senate to adjourn, even if doesn't want to, and enable him to make recess appointments.",
      "Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution includes a clause about congressional adjournments that has never been invoked. Trump's allies read it as giving the chief executive the power step in when the House and Senate can\u2019t agree on when to adjourn. The provision reads that \u201cin case of disagreement between them, with respect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper.\u201d",
      "But some scholars, including conservative ones, argue that the House has no power to force the Senate to adjourn, and vice versa. Congressional adjournments are spelled out in Article I, which requires one chamber to consent when the other wants to take a break of more than three days. Under this view, the president could intervene only when one house objects to the other's adjournment plan.",

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday named Massad Boulos, a Lebanese American businessman who is the father-in-law of Trump's daughter Tiffany, as a senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs.",
      "Boulos arranged Trump campaign efforts to engage the Arab American community in Michigan, organizing dozens of meetings in areas with large Arab American populations angered by Democratic President Joe Biden's backing of Israel's offensives in Gaza and Lebanon. Trump won the majority Arab American city of Dearborn Heights on his way to sweeping Michigan and other swing states.",
      "\u201cHe has been a longtime proponent of Republican and Conservative values, an asset to my Campaign, and was instrumental in building tremendous new coalitions with the Arab American Community,\u201d Trump said in a post on Truth Social.",
      "Trump and Boulos said the Republican president-elect would bring peace to the Middle East, but neither has publicly offered concrete details on Trump's plans for the region.",
      "Boulos has previously sought office in Lebanon and has long-standing ties to political figures in the country. Other Trump picks for key national security positions are staunch supporters of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a Trump ally.",
      "Mike Huckabee, Trump's pick for ambassador to Israel, has consistently rejected a Palestinian state in territories seized by Israel. He has claimed \u201cthere really isn\u2019t such a thing\u201d as Palestinians, in referring to the descendants of people who lived in Palestine before the establishment of Israel.",
      "Trump's pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, advocated for rebuilding a biblical Jewish temple on the site of Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam\u2019s holiest sites.",

      "Trump won Michigan by just over 10,000 votes in 2016 and Biden retook the state for the Democrats in 2020 by roughly 154,000 votes. Trump carried Michigan in November over Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, with 49.7% of the vote.",
      "\u201cMassad is a dealmaker, and an unwavering supporter of PEACE in the Middle East,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Trump, who has long installed family members and their relatives in key positions, is signaling that he will run his second administration the same way.

      "Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares is stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the carmaker that owns brands like Jeep and Ram and Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot",
      "NEW YORK -- Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares is stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the automaker, which owns car brands like Jeep, Citro\u00ebn and Ram, amid an ongoing struggle with slumping sales.",
      "The world\u2019s fourth-largest carmaker announced that its board accepted Tavares' resignation Sunday, effective immediately.",
      "Stellantis noted Sunday that the process to appoint a new, permanent CEO is \u201cwell under way.\u201d In the meantime, the company says a new interim executive committee, led by chairman John Elkann, will be established.",
      "As head of PSA Peugeot, Tavares took control of the Netherlands-based company in January 2021 \u2014 when it merged with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, creating an automotive giant that is the parent to several well-known brands today. Beyond Jeep, Citro\u00ebn and Ram, Stellantis\u2019 portfolio includes Dodge, Chrysler, Fiat, Peugeot, Maserati and Opel.",
      "Stellantis' North American operations had been the company\u2019s main source of profits for some time, but struggles piled up this year \u2014 with the company citing larger market changes and rising competition.",
      "For its third quarter, Stellantis posted 27% plunge in net revenues, as gaps in launching new products and action to reduce inventories also slashed global shipments of new vehicles by 20%.",
      "The carmaker reported net revenues of 33 billion euros (nearly $36 billion ) in the three-month period ending Sept. 30, down from 45 billion euros in the same period last year. All regions except South America reported double-digit dips in revenues \u2014 led by North America, which plunged 42% to 12.4 billion euros. Europe revenues dropped 12% to 12.5 billion euros.",
      "In recent months, Tavares had been under fire from U.S. dealers and the United Auto Workers union after the release of dismal financial performance reports. He also oversaw cost-cutting efforts that included delaying factory openings and laying off union workers \u2014 adding to further strain with the UAW, which filed several grievances against Stellantis and threatened to strike in recent months.",
      "Beyond the U.S., Stellantis has faced pressure in Italy \u2014 where lawmakers questioned the former chief executive over the company's production plans in October, with the far-right government accusing the company of relocating assembly plants to low-cost countries. Tens of thousands of autoworkers in the country also held a one-day walkout, calling for more employment certainty and protections.",
      "In efforts to revive sales, Stellantis previously made a number of leadership changes in October, which included new heads of operations in North America and Europe. At the time, the company expected Tavares to step down in early 2026, closer to the end of his five-year contract.",
      "The company confirmed in September that it was searching for a CEO to eventually succeed Tavares, but maintained that those efforts were part of standard leadership transition plans.",
      "In a statement Sunday, Stellantis\u2019 senior independent director Henri de Castries said that Stellantis' success is \u201crooted in a perfect alignment\u201d between shareholders, the company's board and the CEO \u2014 but noted that \u201cdifferent views\u201d had emerged in recent weeks, resulting in the decision to approve Tavares' resignation.",
      "Elkann, the chairperson of Stellantis' board, thanked Tavares for \u201chis years of dedicated service and the role he has played in the creation of Stellantis\u201d in an additional statement. He added that he looks forward to appointing a new CEO.",
      "Stellantis did not comment further beyond Sunday's announcement."

    "story": [
      "Ultra low-cost online retailers Temu and Shein are giving Western retailers a run for their money this holiday shopping season",
      "Shopping on Temu can feel like playing an arcade game. Instead of using a joystick-controlled claw to grab a toy, visitors to the online marketplace maneuver their computer mouses or cellphone screens to browse colorful gadgets, accessories and trinkets with prices that look too good to refuse.",
      "A pop-up spinning wheel offers the chance to win a coupon. Rotating captions warn that a less than $2 camouflage print balaclava and a $1.23 skeleton hand back scratcher are \u201cAlmost sold out.\u201d A flame symbol indicates a $9.69 plush cat print hoodie is selling fast. A timed-down selection of discounted items adds to the sense of urgency.",
      "Welcome to the new online world of impulse buying, a place of guilty pleasures where the selection is vast, every day is Cyber Monday, and an instant dopamine hit that will have faded by the time your package arrives is always just a click away.",
      "By all accounts, we\u2019re living in an accelerating age for consumerism, one that Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein, its fierce rival, supercharged with social media savvy and an interminable assortment of cheap goods, most shipped directly from merchants in China based on real-time demand.",
      "The business models of the two platforms, coupled with avalanches of digital or influencer advertising, have enabled them to give Western retailers a run for their money this holiday shopping season.",
      "Software company Salesforce said it expects roughly one in five online purchases in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada to be made through four online marketplaces based or founded in Asia: Shein, Temu, TikTok Shop - the e-commerce arm of video-sharing platform TikTok - and AliExpress.",
      "Analysts with Salesforce said they are expected to pull in roughly $160 billion in global sales outside of China. Most of the sales will go to Temu and Shein, a privately held company which is thought to lead the worldwide fast fashion market in revenue.",
      "Lisa Xiaoli Neville, a nonprofit manager who lives in Los Angeles, is sold on Shein. The bedroom of her home is stocked with jeans, shoes, press-on nails and other items from the ultra-fast fashion retailer, all of which she amassed after getting on the platform to purchase a $2 pair of earrings she saw in a Facebook ad.",
      "Neville, 46, estimates she spends at least $75 a month on products from Shein. A $2 eggshell opener, a portable apple peeler and an apple corer - both costing less than $5 - are among the quirky, single-use kitchen tools taking up drawer space. She acknowledges she doesn\u2019t need them because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t even cook like that.\u201d Plus, she\u2019s allergic to apples.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t eat apples. It will kill me,\u201d Neville said, laughing. \u201cBut I still want the coring thing.\u201d",
      "Shein, now based in Singapore, uses some of the same web design features as Temu\u2019s, such as pop-up coupons and ads, to persuade shoppers to keep clicking, but it appears a bit more restrained in its approach.",
      "Shein primarily targets young women through partnerships with social media influencers. Searching the company's name on video platforms turns up creators promoting Shein's Black Friday sales event and displaying the dozens of of trendy clothes and accessories they got for comparatively little money.",
      "But the Shein-focused content also includes videos of TikTokers saying they're embarrassed to admit they shopped there and critics lashing out at fans for not taking into account the environmental harms or potential labor abuses associated with products that are churned out and shipped worldwide at a speedy pace.",
      "Neville has already picked out holiday gifts for family and friends from the site. Most of the products in her online cart cost under $10, including graphic T-shirts she intends to buy for her son and jeans and loafers for her daughter. All told, she plans to spend about $200 on gifts, significantly less than $500 she used to shell out at other stores in prior years.",
      "\u201cThe visuals just make you want to spend more money,\u201d she said, referring to the clothes on Shein's site. \u201cThey're very cheap and everything is just so cute.\u201d",
      "Unlike Shein, Temu's appeal cuts across age groups and gender. The platform is the world\u2019s second most-visited online shopping site, software company Similarweb reported in September. Customers go there looking for practical items like doormats and silly products like a whiskey flask shaped like a vintage cellphone from the 1990s.",
      "Temu advertised Black Friday bargains for some items at upwards of 70% off the recommended retail price. Making a purchase can quickly result in receiving dozens of emails offering free giveaways. The caveat: customers have to buy more products.",
      "Ellen Flowers, 36, a lifestyle blogger who lives in Dallas, recently decided to pair a $3,500 dining table with $25 dining chairs from Temu to save money. She's also purchased clothes from Temu. The quality or fit wasn't always always great, so Flowers donated some unwanted pieces to thrift stores to avoid paying return shipping fees that would cost almost as much as the clothes.",
      "Flowers planned to buy stocking stuffers on Temu as well as baubles for an ornament-swapping party in early December. She also wanted to buy necklaces and bracelets for an activity at her 5-year-old niece's upcoming birthday party.",
      "\u201cI love buying my nieces presents,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cSince they\u2019re young, they don\u2019t need the Louis Vuitton handbag. I can give them a cute handbag from Temu. Then they\u2019ll lose interest in a month and I\u2019ll buy them another one.\u201d",
      "Despite their rise, Temu and Shein have proven particularly ripe for pushback. Last year, a coalition of unnamed brands and organizations launched a campaign to oppose Shein in Washington. U.S. lawmakers also have raised the possibility that Temu is allowing goods made with forced labor to enter the country.",
      "More recently, the Biden administration put forward rules that would crack down on a trade rule known as the de minimis exception, which has allowed a lot of cheap products to come into the U.S. duty-free. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to slap high tariffs on goods from China, a move that would likely raise prices and across the retail world.",
      "Both Shein and Temu have set up warehouses in the U.S. to speed up delivery times and help them better compete with Amazon, which is trying to erode their price advantage through a new storefront that also ships products directly from China.",
      "Meanwhile, Temu is onboarding Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that would allow the company to not be as exposed to changes around the de minimus trade rule, said Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse.",
      "The change comes as both Shein and Temu are attempting to expand beyond the bargain-hungry shoppers who popularized their platforms. Temu is allowing sellers to ship products to customers from local U.S. warehouses and says the move will allow it to sell larger items like furniture as it expands its selection of big-ticket items.",
      "Meanwhile, American children's clothing retailer The Children\u2019s Place signed a deal last month to distribute its products through Shein\u2019s platform. Last year, Shein went into business with women's fashion retailer Forever 21. It has been working to recruit other brands and reportedly has hopes of getting listed on the London Stock Exchange."

      "Recipients of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program are bracing for potential challenges to their status in the country during President-elect Donald Trump's second term in the White House",
      "PHOENIX -- Reyna Montoya was 10 when she and her family fled violence in Tijuana and illegally immigrated to the U.S. Growing up in Arizona, she worried even a minor traffic violation could lead to her deportation.",
      "She didn't feel relief until 11 years later in 2012, when she received a letter confirming she had been accepted to a new program for immigrants who came to the country illegally as children.",
      "\u201cAll of the sudden, all these possibilities opened up,\u201d Montoya said, fighting back tears. The Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program granted her and hundreds of thousands of others two-year, renewable permits to live and work in the U.S. legally.",
      "But as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House, after an unsuccessful bid to end DACA in his first term, the roughly 535,000 current recipients are bracing yet again for a whirlwind of uncertainty. Meanwhile, a years-long challenge to DACA could ultimately render it illegal, leaving people like Montoya without a shield from deportation.",
      "\u201cI have to take his (Trump's) words very seriously, that when they say \u2018mass deportation,\u2019 it also includes people like me,\u201d said Montoya, who runs Aliento, an Arizona-based advocacy organization for immigrant rights.",
      "Uncertainty is nothing new for DACA recipients. As many matured from school age to adulthood, they have witnessed a barrage of legal threats to the program.",
      "DACA hasn't accepted new applicants since 2021, when a federal judge deemed it illegal and ordered that new applications not be processed, though current recipients could still renew their permits. The Biden administration appealed the ruling, and the case is currently pending.",
      "For those who secured and renewed DACA permits, the benefits have been life-changing. With DACA, Montoya for the first time was able to work legally, get health and dental care, and obtain a driver's license.",
      "Many recipients had hoped Vice President Kamala Harris would win the presidency and continue fighting for them. But the reelection of Trump, who has repeatedly accused immigrants of fueling violent crime and \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of the United States, has heightened their fears that DACA could end and they could face deportation.",
      "Out of caution, some are rushing to renew their permits, according to the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, which has been providing free legal aid to help them through the extensive process.",
      "Others are preparing for potential family separations. Phoenix native and DACA recipient Pedro Gonzalez-Aboyte said he and his immigrant parents, along with his two U.S.-born brothers, recently discussed the possibility of being split.",
      "Gonzalez-Aboyte recalled his parents, who immigrated from Mexico, saying that even if they were unable to stay in the country, \"as long as the three of you are here and you're OK, then that's what we want.\"",
      "\u201cThat was a very real conversation we had,\u201d Gonzalez-Aboyte said.",
      "Officials for the Trump transition team did not respond to emailed requests for comment.",
      "While it is unclear how Trump could impact DACA this time, he has suggested scaling back other programs that offer temporary protection for immigrants and is staffing his incoming administration with immigration hardliners, including Stephen Miller and Thomas Homan.",
      "During his first term, Trump tried to rescind DACA. But in 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded his administration ended the program improperly, though it didn't rule on the program's legality.",
      "But DACA's fate won\u2019t be immediately left up to Trump, if at all.",
      "A three-judge panel on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals \u2014 regarded as the country's most conservative appeals court \u2014 heard arguments in October concerning the legality of DACA. The case, initially filed by Texas and other Republican-led states in 2018, now focuses on a Biden administration rule intended to preserve and fortify DACA.",
      "Attorneys for DACA opponents argued that immigrants in the country illegally are a financial burden on states. Meanwhile, the Biden administration, along with intervenors, contend that Texas has not shown the costs it cites are traceable to the policy and, therefore, lacks standing.",
      "The panel doesn\u2019t have a deadline to issue a ruling. Regardless, its ruling will likely be appealed, potentially elevating the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell University, said the most likely scenario is the panel affirming that DACA is illegal and that the case goes before the Supreme Court. He doesn't anticipate Trump immediately trying to end DACA but didn't rule out the possibility.",
      "\u201cI don't know that they could actually terminate the program any faster than the current ligation is going,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could still do it, but they've got an awful lot of immigration policy matters on their plate.\u201d",
      "Yale-Loehr said the Biden administration is limited in how it could help DACA recipients at this stage, but it could enable recipients to renew their permits early and process them as quickly as possible.",
      "Greisa Martinez Rosas is a DACA recipient and executive director of United We Dream, a youth-led advocacy network for immigrants that boasts more than a million members nationwide. She said the immigrant rights movement has grown so much since Trump\u2019s first term, and it\u2019s been preparing for this moment for years, \u201cbuilding a nimble and responsive infrastructure so that we will make shifts as threats emerge.\u201d",
      "She said they\u2019re calling on Americans to offer immigrants sanctuary, preparing to ensure people's physical and psychological safety in case of mass deportations, planning demonstrations and asking for help from the current administration.",
      "\u201cWe still have a couple of months for the Biden administration to use every single tool at its disposal to protect and defend as many people as possible,\u201d Martinez Rosas said at a recent press briefing. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting for them to do that now more than ever.\u201d",

      "Now the steadfast Trump ally has been tapped to lead the federal law enforcement agency he\u2019s pushed to overhaul.",
      "A look at Patel, Trump\u2019s pick to replace Christopher Wray atop the FBI.",
      "Patel has for years been a loyal ally to Trump, finding common cause over their shared skepticism of government surveillance and the \u201cdeep state\u201d \u2014 a pejorative catchall used by Trump to refer to government bureaucracy.",

      "Former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by Trump in May 2017, memorably recoiled when Trump asked him during a private dinner to pledge his loyalty to him. And Wray, who had no personal connection to Trump when he was picked to replace Comey, broke with Trump on different hot-button issues and served as FBI director during investigations into Trump that ultimately led to his indictment.",

      "He\u2019s called for dramatically reducing its footprint and limiting its authority, as well as going after government officials who disclose information to reporters.",
      "In an interview earlier this year on the \u201cShawn Ryan Show,\u201d Patel vowed to sever the FBI\u2019s intelligence-gathering activities from the rest of its mission and said he would \u201cshut down\u201d the bureau\u2019s headquarters building on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., and \u201creopen it the next day as a museum of the \u2018deep state.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201dWe\u2019re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,\u201d Patel said, referring to the 2020 presidential election in which Biden, the Democratic challenger, defeated Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re going to come after you, whether it\u2019s criminally or civilly. We\u2019ll figure that out. But yeah, we\u2019re putting you all on notice.\u201d",
      "Patel first came to prominence in Trump\u2019s orbit as an outspoken critic of the FBI\u2019s investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.",
      "As a staffer on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, chaired at the time by Rep. Devin Nunes, a Trump loyalist, Patel helped author a four-page report that detailed what it said were errors the Justice Department made in obtaining a warrant to surveil a former Trump campaign adviser.",
      "The document, which came to be colloquially known as the \u201cNunes memo,\u201d was released over vigorous objections from Wray and Justice Department leaders.",
      "A subsequent inspector general report identified significant problems with FBI surveillance during the Russia investigation, but also concluded that the inquiry had been opened for a legitimate purpose and found no evidence that the FBI had acted with partisan motives in conducting the probe.",
      "Patel has played a role in several legal investigations into Trump.",
      "He appeared in 2022 before the Washington grand jury investigating Trump\u2019s hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after receiving immunity for his testimony.",
      "He also testified at a Colorado court hearing related to Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the run-up to the violent Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Patel, who at the time of the riot was chief of staff to the then-acting defense secretary, testified that Trump had pre-emptively authorized 10,000 to 20,000 troops to deploy days before the attack. But a Colorado court later found that Patel was \u201cnot a credible witness\u201d on the topic.",
      "Shortly after Trump left office, Patel launched Fight with Kash, an organization that funds defamation lawsuits and peddles a wide variety of merchandise, including branded socks and other clothing with the \u201cK$H\u201d logo.",
      "Patel has also turned to publishing. He wrote a book called \u201cGovernment Gangsters,\u201d which is part memoir and part screed against the so-called deep state. Patel teamed with Bannon to release a film version. Patel has also authored children\u2019s books that lionize Trump \u2014 \u201cThe Plot Against the King\u201d features a thinly veiled Hillary Clinton as the villain going after \u201cKing Donald\u201d while Kash plays a wizard who thwarts her plans.",
      "Patel has been a pitchman for a variety of products marketed to Trump supporters. One dietary supplement he\u2019s promoted claims to be a COVID vaccine \u201cdetoxification system.\u201d",
      "Records show that Patel has earned hundreds of thousands of dollars a year from consulting for Trump-related entities, including a political action committee and the company that owns Truth Social.",
      "Patel helped produce \u201cAnd Justice For All,\u201d a rendition of the Star Spangled Banner sung by a group of men incarcerated for their role in the Capitol riot.",
      "Patel\u2019s candidacy has won support from prominent Trump supporters, including people who support the president-elect\u2019s agenda at the FBI and Justice Department and the idea of using his electoral win to pursue retaliation against his perceived adversaries.",

      "Even as Trump was said to be considering more conventional picks for the job whose confirmation prospects were seen as more certain, some conservative backers of the president-elect actively boosted Patel\u2019s candidacy and disparaged other potential selections, including Mike Rogers, a former FBI agent and ex-Republican chairman of the House intelligence committee.",

      "On Sunday, ahead of the hearing, advocacy groups will bring together environmental organizations from around the world. Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change \u2014 who first developed the idea of requesting an advisory opinion \u2014 together with World Youth for Climate Justice plan an afternoon of speeches, music and discussions.",
      "From Monday, the Hague-based court will hear from 99 countries and more than a dozen intergovernmental organizations over two weeks. It\u2019s the largest lineup in the institution\u2019s nearly 80-year history.",
      "Last month at the United Nations\u2019 annual climate meeting, countries cobbled together an agreement on how rich countries can support poor countries in the face of climate disasters. Wealthy countries have agreed to pool together at least $300 billion a year by 2035 but the total is short of the $1.3 trillion that experts, and threatened nations, said is needed.",
      "\u201cFor our generation and for the Pacific Islands, the climate crisis is an existential threat. It is a matter of survival, and the world\u2019s biggest economies are not taking this crisis seriously. We need the ICJ to protect the rights of people at the front lines,\u201d Vishal Prasad, of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, told reporters in a briefing.",
      "Fifteen judges from around the world will seek to answer two questions: What are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? And what are the legal consequences for governments where their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment?",
      "The second question makes particular reference to \u201csmall island developing States\u201d likely to be hardest hit by climate change and to \u201cmembers of \u201cthe present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change.\u201d",
      "The judges were even briefed on the science behind rising global temperatures by the U.N.\u2019s climate change body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ahead of the hearings.",
      "The case at the ICJ follows a number of rulings around the world ordering governments to do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "In May, a U.N. tribunal on maritime law said that carbon emissions qualify as marine pollution and countries must take steps to adapt to and mitigate their adverse effects.",
      "That ruling came a month after Europe\u2019s highest human rights court said that countries must better protect their people from the consequences of climate change, in a landmark judgment that could have implications across the continent.",
      "The ICJ\u2019s host country of The Netherlands made history when a court ruled in 2015 that protection from the potentially devastating effects of climate change is a human right and that the government has a duty to protect its citizens. The judgment was upheld in 2019 by the Dutch Supreme Court."

      "NEW YORK -- The Oscar-winning screenwriter Marshall Brickman, whose wide-ranging career spanned some of Woody Allen 's best films, the Broadway musical \u201cJersey Boys\u201d and a number of Johnny Carson's most beloved sketches, has died. He was 85.",
      "Brickman died Friday in Manhattan, his daughter Sophie Brickman told The New York Times. No cause of death was cited.",
      "Brickman was best known for his extensive collaboration with Allen, beginning with the 1973 film \u201cSleeper.\u201d Together, they co-wrote \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d (1977), \u201cManhattan\" (1979) and \u201cManhattan Murder Mystery\" (1993). The loosely structured script for \u201cAnnie Hall,\u201d in particular, has been hailed as one of the wittiest comedies. It won Brickman and Allen an Oscar for best original screenplay.",
      "In his acceptance speech (Allen skipped the ceremony), Brickman referenced one of the film's many oft-quoted lines, saying: \"I've been out here a week, and I still have guilt when I make a right turn on a red light.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the film is worth anything,\u201d Brickman told Vanity Fair in 2017, \u201cit gives a very particular specific image of what it was like to be alive in New York at that time in that particular social-economic stratum.\u201d",
      "Brickman and Allen had met in the early 1960s, when Allen was breaking through as a stand-up comedian. Brickman was brought on to write jokes for him. At the time, he had been playing banjo for the folk group the Tarriers. In one of the many twists of Brickman's career, it was an album he and his college roommate Eric Weissberg recorded that later made the soundtrack to 1972's \u201cDeliverance,\u201d including \u201cDueling Banjos.\u201d",
      "Brickman, born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was the son of Jewish socialists Abram (who fled Poland during WWII) and Pauline (Wolin) Brickman, who was from New York. They later moved to the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, where Brickman grew up. His start in show business, after graduating from the University of Wisconsin with degrees in science and music, came with the Tarriers. He replaced Alan Arkin in the group.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons I was asked to join was because they needed somebody to front the group and talk while everybody was tuning up,\u201d Brickman told the Writers Guild in 2011. \u201cAnd so I started to develop little jokes and routines and stuff like that.\u201d",
      "By the late \u201860s, Brickman was head writer for Carson\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show.\" There, one of his most enduring contributions were the Carnac the Magnificent sketches, during which Carson played a \u201cmystic from the East\u201d who could divine answers to unseen questions. Brickman\u2019s other TV stints included \u201cCandid Camera,\u201d \u201cThe Dick Cavett Show\u201d and \u201cThe Muppet Show.\u201d",
      "When Brickman and Allen began writing together, they found a natural chemistry, with Brickman playing a supporting role to Allen's semi-autobiographical material.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t write scenes together. I think that\u2019s the death for any collaboration,\u201d Brickman told the Writers Guild. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any such thing really as an equal collaboration. I think that in any collaboration, one person, one personality, one point of view has to dominate.\"",
      "Brickman wrote and directed the 1980 film \u201cSimon,\u201d starring Arkin as a psychology professor brainwashed into believing he's from outer space. He also directed 1983's \u201cLovesick,\" with Alec Guinness as the ghost of Sigmund Freud, and 1986's \u201cThe Manhattan Project,\u201d about a high schooler who builds a nuclear weapon for a school project.",
      "With Rick Elice penning the music, Brickman wrote the Broadway musical \u201cJersey Boys,\u201d about the 1960s rock group The Four Seasons. It ran on Broadway for 12 years beginning in 2005. He and Elice also wrote the 2010 musical \u201cThe Addams Family.\u201d",
      "Brickman is survived by his wife, Nina, daughters Sophie and Jessica, and five grandchildren."

      "TORONTO -- Canada's ambassador to the United States said Sunday that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was successful in getting President-elect Donald Trump and key Cabinet nominees to understand that lumping Canada in with Mexico over the flow of drugs and migrants into the U.S. is unfair.",
      "Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador in Washington, told The Associated Press in an interview that Trudeau's dinner with Trump on Friday was a very important step in trying to get Trump to back away from threatened tariffs on all products from the major American trading partner.",
      "Hillman was at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and sat at an adjacent table to Trudeau and Trump.",
      "Trump threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if they don\u2019t stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders. He said in a social media post last Monday he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders.",
      "Hillman said Trudeau asked to see Trump in person in a phone call Monday and Trump invited him to dinner on Friday.",
      "At the dinner, Hillman said the case was made to Trump that there is no comparison between the Canada-U.S. border and Mexico-U.S. border.",
      "\u201cThe message that our border is so vastly different than the Mexican border was really understood,\u201d Hillman said.",
      "Hillman said the bulk of Friday night's dinner centered around Trump's border concerns. The ambassador said a priority of Trudeau's was to point out the degree of difference.",
      "Hillman said there really is no comparison, noting there is essentially zero trafficking of fentanyl from Canada to the United States. She said there are seizures but authorities say those are personal use seizures and not criminal trafficking. She said that 99.8% of the fentanyl seized by U.S. authorities in the U.S. comes from Mexico.",
      "\u201cAlso with respect to individuals, illegal individuals crossing illegally, Canada last year was less than one percent, 0.6 percent were of total interceptions from Canada,\u201d Hillman said.",
      "U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian border between October 2023 and September 2024 \u2014 and Hillman said the migrant numbers are coming down since the summer.",
      "\u201cThe facts are hard to deny,\u201d Hillman said.",
      "But Hillman said Canada is ready to make new investments in border security and there are plans for more helicopters, drones and law enforcement officers.",
      "She also noted an agreement between Canada and the United States that allows for migrants caught crossing illegally into the United States to be sent back to Canada. She said that was talked about. She said Mexico and the U.S. do not have a similar agreement.",
      "At the dinner that lasted three hours, Hillman said America's trade deficit with Canada was also raised. Hillman said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year but noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. are energy exports and prices have been high.",
      "\u201cTrade balances are something that he focuses so it\u2019s important to engage in that conversation but to put it into context,\" Hillman said.",
      "\u201cWe are one tenth the size of the United States so a balanced trade deal would mean per capita we are buying 10 times more from the U.S. than they are buying from us. If that\u2019s his metric we will certainly engage on that.\"",
      "Joining Trump and Trudeau at dinner were Howard Lutnick, Trump\u2019s nominee for commerce secretary, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Interior Department, Mike Waltz, Trump\u2019s choice to be his national security adviser, and the three men\u2019s wives.",
      "Also at the dinner were David McCormick, just elected U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, and his wife, Dina Powell, a former deputy national security adviser under Trump, as well as Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, whose responsibilities include border security, and Katie Telford, Trudeau\u2019s chief of staff.",
      "Hillman said Canadian and incoming Trump administration officials will work on Trump's concerns in the coming weeks. Trump called the talks \u201cproductive\u201d on Sunday in a social media post but signaled no retreat from his tariff pledge.",
      "Hillman said Trump and Trudeau \"get along well\" and the dinner was also a chance to socialize. She said Trump used his iPad to play music and she said Trump told Trudeau he's a big fan of Canadian singer Celine Dion.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it could have been better to be frank. Okay, I\u2019ll take that back, I\u2019ll change that. If he obviously said there would be no tariffs that would have been better but there was no realistic expectation of that,\u201d Hillman said.",
      "Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day.",
      "About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada.",
      "Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.",
      "Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 77% of Canada\u2019s exports go to the U.S."

      "\"This has profound implications for retirement planning, as it is likely to mean that savers may end up using already inadequate pension pots to clear a mortgage balance.\"",
      "The temptation for young homeowners is obvious. A longer mortgage term would reduce monthly repayments.",
      "But with the average age of first-time buyers rising - it now stands at nearly 34 - the question of how people will be able to afford mortgage payments when they hope to retire becomes increasingly important.",

      "While many young homeowners have chosen longer mortgage terms to make repayments more manageable, they may opt for shorter terms in the future if their salaries improve or they move house.",
      "That is why UK Finance expects only a small fraction of the mortgages taken out now to ultimately go into borrowers' retirement years.",
      "However, it does also raise the prospect of some people having to work longer until a mortgage is paid off, or they may choose to downsize.",
      "Lenders set limits",
      "Lenders are relatively flexible on allowing people to take out these longer-term mortgages, but there are constraints, according to David Hollingworth, from mortgage broker L&C.",
      "\"There will often still be maximum age limits at the end of the mortgage term and lenders will need to be sure that the borrowing will be affordable,\" he said.",
      "\"That will require borrowers to show that their post-retirement income is adequate.\"",
      "Affordability checks became stricter after the financial crisis of nearly 20 years ago, with lenders needing proof that mortgage applicants could cope with rising interest rates.",
      "The reality for many people is that getting any kind of mortgage remains unaffordable.",
      "Data published earlier in the week shows the dynamics of renting and owning, and their effect on financial strains and life satisfaction.",
      "\"The proportion of people renting privately doubled during the 2000s, and while it has levelled off at around a fifth of households, or a third in London, we\u2019re seeing people renting later in life,\" said Sarah Coles, from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown.",
      "\"Even when people reach their late 50s and early 60s, 11% are still in private rentals.\""

    "title": "Five ways to persuade more people to buy electric cars",
    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:20:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Demand for electric cars is lower than expected, the industry says. What might help to boost sales?",
    "story": [
      "The government is facing a backlash from car manufacturers, who claim that current rules designed to promote electric vehicles are too harsh.",
      "They say consumer demand for electric cars has fallen far short of what was expected, meaning they are struggling to sell enough.",
      "Ford insists this was a factor in its recent decision to cut 800 UK jobs.",
      "Vauxhall's owner Stellantis is to close its van-making plant in Luton - partly, it says, because of the new rules.",
      "So what could be done to encourage more consumers to buy electric?",
      "1. Subsidise the cost",
      "Electric vehicles (EVs) are generally more expensive to buy than their petrol or diesel equivalents. This is partly because they still represent a relatively small proportion of cars being built, so economies of scale \u2013 when the cost comes down the more you build \u2013 have not yet properly kicked in.",
      "The government already offers some subsidies to make EVs cheaper. They attract a low rate of company car tax, for example. Salary sacrifice schemes allow workers to lease cars cheaply through their employers, using their untaxed income, which can offer significant savings.",
      "But since the abolition of the plug-in grant for cars in 2022, there has not been a similar incentive for people who cannot get a car through their company. People within the industry believe that should change.",
      "Automotive journalist Quentin Willson, who now fronts the campaign group FairCharge, thinks the government should consider \u201cinterest free loans on used electric vehicles for lower income drivers and halve the VAT on new cars\u201d. This, he suggests, could be funded by abandoning the current freeze on fuel duty.",
      "2. Make cheaper electric cars",
      "The price of electric cars is coming down, partly due to cheaper battery packs. Despite sharp fluctuations in the value of metals used to make them, such as lithium and cobalt, battery pack prices have fallen by about 70% since 2015.",
      "This has helped reduce the price gap between electric and conventional cars. Earlier this year, Stellantis began offering the electric version of its Frontera model at the same price as the petrol hybrid model.",
      "However, that doesn\u2019t mean it is easy to find a low-budget electric car. There is a shortage of truly cheap options on the market.",
      "That is partly because a number of manufacturers have preferred to focus on more expensive and potentially more profitable models. But as Roger Atkins, founder of the Electric Vehicles Outlook consultancy, puts it, \u201ccars that cost \u00a350,000 to \u00a360,000 are not the kind of cars everyone can buy\u201d.",
      "However, change is around the corner. The Dacia Spring went on sale in the UK a few weeks ago, with a starting price of \u00a314,995. The newly launched Leapmotor T03 costs very little more, while Chinese giant BYD has said it will bring a version of its super-budget Seagull model to the UK next year.",
      "Vauxhall owner to close Luton factory",
      "Ford calls for incentives to buy electric cars as backlash grows",
      "3. Cut out the confusion",
      "The government says the sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in 2030 \u2013 but will it?",
      "Plans to force conventional cars off the market were originally meant to take effect in 2040, under plans introduced by Theresa May's government. But the target was brought forward to 2030 under Boris Johnson, then delayed to 2035 under Rishi Sunak.",
      "People within the industry claim the changing target has sent out mixed messages and confused consumers, leading some people to delay buying an electric car until the situation becomes clearer.",
      "According to Melanie Shufflebotham, co-founder of electric charging guide Zapmap, many drivers are \u201cconfused about dates, concerned on costs and have questions about charging.\u201d She says \u201ca consistent factual communication programme\" is needed, supported by government.",
      "4. Cut VAT on public charging points",
      "Although the cost of using public charging points can vary widely depending on the provider and the charging speed you choose, public chargers are usually more expensive than charging at home.",
      "This is partly due to tax. An EV owner charging a car on their drive will pay 5% VAT on the electricity they consume. But if they use a public charger they will pay 20%. People who are unable to charge at home are left with no choice but to pay the higher rate.",
      "The industry, EV advocates and even a House of Lords committee have called for the public rate to be reduced to 5%",
      "Consultant Roger Atkins claims the current policy is \u201cdivisive\u201d, because it \u201cfavours better-off people who can charge at home on their driveways\u201d.",
      "5. Sort out the public charging network",
      "Read any survey of potential buyers\u2019 attitudes towards electric cars, and concerns about charging infrastructure will be at or near the top. People worry about whether they will be able to find a charger at a busy service station, or in a rural area.",
      "The number of charging points is growing. According to ZapMap, as of October this year, there were 71,459 charging points across the UK, at 36,060 locations. This was a 38% increase on the year before.",
      "But not everyone is happy. Complaints from existing owners struggling to find a charging point, having to queue for a long time or arriving to find it broken are not hard to find.",
      "As more EVs come onto the roads, many more charging points will be needed. The government wants 300,000 in place by 2030 \u2013 but the current rate of expansion is not fast enough to reach it.",
      "Part of the blame appears to lie with local authorities, who are responsible for granting planning permission for new rapid charging hubs. According to Roger Atkins, the process simply takes too long.",
      "Simon Smith, of charging firm Instavolt agrees that red tape is a problem. He thinks that difficulties getting grid connections for rapid charging stations is also a \"critical barrier\" to expanding the network.",
      "\"We need greater support to address planning delays, local council resistance and grid connectivity challenges\", he says."

      "Her life would have been much easier had she had a right to maternity leave, paid by her employer.",
      "Under a new law in Belgium - the first of its kind in the world - this will now be the case. Sex workers will be entitled to official employment contracts, health insurance, pensions, maternity leave and sick days. Essentially, it will be treated like any other job.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for us to exist as people,\u201d Sophie says.",
      "There are tens of millions of sex workers worldwide. Sex work was decriminalised in Belgium in 2022 and is legal in several countries including Germany, Greece, the Netherlands and Turkey. But establishing employment rights and contracts is a global first.",
      "\u201cThis is radical, and it\u2019s the best step we have seen anywhere in the world so far,\u201d says Erin Kilbride, a researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cWe need every country to be moving in that direction.\u201d",
      "Critics say the trade causes trafficking, exploitation and abuse - which this law will not prevent.",
      "\u201cIt is dangerous because it normalises a profession that is always violent at its core,\u201d says Julia Crumi\u00e8re, a volunteer with Isala - an NGO that helps sex workers on the streets in Belgium.",
      "For many sex workers, the job is a necessity, and the law could not come soon enough.",
      "Mel was horrified when she was forced to give a client oral sex without a condom, when she knew a sexually transmitted infection (STI) was going round the brothel. But she felt she had no option.",
      "\u201cMy choice was either to spread the disease, or make no money.\u201d",
      "She had become an escort when she was 23 - she needed money, and quickly started earning beyond expectations. She thought she had struck gold, but the experience with the STI brought her sharply back to earth.",
      "Mel will now be able to refuse any client or sexual act she feels uncomfortable with - meaning she could have handled that situation differently.",
      "\u201cI could have pointed the finger at my madam [employer] and said: \u2018You're violating these terms and this is how you should treat me.\u2019 I would have been legally protected.\u201d",
      "Belgium\u2019s decision to change the law was the result of months of protests in 2022, prompted by the lack of state support during the Covid pandemic.",
      "One of those at the forefront was Victoria, president of the Belgian Union of Sex Workers (UTSOPI) and previously an escort for 12 years.",
      "For her, it was a personal fight. Victoria regards prostitution as a social service, with sex being only about 10% of what she does.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s giving people attention, listening to their stories, eating cake with them, dancing to waltz music,\u201d she explains. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s about loneliness.\u201d",
      "But the illegality of her job before 2022 raised significant challenges. She worked in unsafe conditions, with no choice over her clients and her agency taking a big cut of her earnings.",
      "In fact, Victoria says she was raped by a client who had become obsessed with her.",
      "She went to a police station, where she says the female officer was \u201cso hard\u201d on her.",
      "\"She told me sex workers can't be raped. She made me feel it was my fault, because I did that job.\u201d Victoria left the station crying.",
      "Every sex worker we spoke to told us that at some point they had been pressured to do something against their will.",
      "Because of that, Victoria fiercely believes this new law will improve their lives.",
      "\u201cIf there is no law and your job is illegal, there are no protocols to help you. This law gives people the tools to make us safer.\u201d",
      "Pimps who control sex work will be allowed to operate legally under the new law - provided they follow strict rules. Anyone who has been convicted of a serious crime will not be allowed to employ sex workers.",
      "\u201cI think many businesses will have to shut down, because a lot of employers have a criminal record,\u201d says Kris Reekmans. He and his wife Alexandra run a massage parlour on Love Street in the small town of Bekkevoort.",

      "\u201cI hope the bad employers will be shut out and the good people, who want to do this profession honestly, will stay - and the more the better,\u201d he says.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s about not being outside in the freezing weather and having sex with strangers who pay to access your body.\u201d",
      "Under Belgium\u2019s new law, each room where sexual services take place must be equipped with an alarm button that will connect a sex worker with their \u201creference person\u201d.",

      "\u201cIn what other job would you need a panic button? It\u2019s not the oldest profession in the world, it\u2019s the oldest exploitation in the world.\u201d",
      "How to regulate the sex industry remains a divisive issue globally. But for Mel, bringing it out of the shadows can only help women.",
      "\u201cI am very proud that Belgium is so far ahead,\u201d she says. \u201cI have a future now.\u201d",

      "Mohamed Al Fayed manipulated Harrods managers to conceal his crimes, sacking those he could not control, an ex-director has told the BBC.",
      "Jon Brilliant, who worked in Al Fayed's private office for 18 months, says the late entrepreneur plied him with envelopes full of cash - totalling about $50,000 (\u00a339,000)  - to try to compromise and control him.",
      "\u201cHe tried to own you. And ultimately, I got fired because I couldn't be bought,\u201d he says.",
      "Harrods didn't respond to Mr Brilliant's claims. It has previously said that it was \u201cutterly appalled\u201d by the abuse allegations, adding that it is a \u201cvery different organisation to the one owned and controlled by Al Fayed\u201d.",
      "Mr Brilliant says he was \u201chorrified\u201d when he first heard the allegations that Al Fayed had abused hundreds of women and says he \u201cbeat himself up\u201d about whether there was anything he should have questioned more.",
      "He told the BBC about surveillance, sackings, and a culture designed to keep top managers from trusting or communicating with one another.",
      "This made it harder for them to do their duty as directors to exercise independent judgement and check Al Fayed\u2019s power - or ask questions which may have revealed more to them about how he was treating women.",
      "\u201cI 100% can see how the management structure and culture was set up to cover it up, mask it from people,\u201d says Mr Brilliant.",
      "Four other former directors have anonymously confirmed elements of this picture.",
      "A US citizen, Mr Brilliant was 36 when he joined the firm in August 2000. He was hired to relaunch the Harrods online business.",
      "He says that shortly before his first business trip to visit Microsoft in Seattle, Al Fayed gave him a brown envelope containing $5,000 (\u00a33,993) in $50 notes.",
      "After the trip he tried to return the full amount. He says Al Fayed refused, asking him, \u201cYou didn't need any entertainment?\u201d",
      "Mr Brilliant replied that he did not need it - he had been too busy to visit the cinema or theatre, and someone else had paid for dinner.",
      "Receiving cash ahead of business trips - large-value notes of pounds, francs or dollars depending on his destination - continued over the following six months.",
      "Three senior colleagues suggested to Mr Brilliant at the time that Al Fayed was trying to get him to compromise himself.",
      "Mr Brilliant says they told him: \u201cHe was trying to get you to come back and say \u2018oh, I spent money on drugs or I spent money frolicking, doing something that I shouldn't have been doing,\u2019 and that he would then use that information against you if you should ever turn on him.\u201d",
      "He adds: \u201cI am certainly aware of people who... succumbed to the temptation.\u201d",
      "Mr Brilliant continued trying to return the money, until his family arrived in London and he started looking for a home. With Al Fayed\u2019s consent, he put it towards the purchase of a property.",
      "Al Fayed had form for using envelopes of cash as a tool of power and control. It had caused a scandal in the 1990s after he paid MPs to ask questions in the House of Commons - and then exposed those who had accepted his gifts.",
      "Mr Brilliant believes he was not immune to Al Fayed\u2019s extensive use of bugging and surveillance, carried out by the Harrods owner\u2019s large team of security guards.",
      "\u201cEven when I tell this story to you right now, I get kind of goosebumps and the hair stands up on the back of my neck, realising that my phones were being listened in on,\u201d he says.",
      "Mr Brilliant\u2019s first suspicion that he may have been bugged came in 2002, shortly before he was fired. After a disagreement about the funding of Fulham FC, words from a private phone conversation with someone in the US were quoted back to him in a meeting.",
      "Another former Harrods director, who wanted to remain anonymous, told us he had moved into an Al Fayed-owned property when he started at the store and one of the security team warned him it was bugged.",

      "He worked in Al Fayed\u2019s \u201cring of steel\u201d office suite on the fifth floor of Harrods, protected by two sets of security doors. There was a group of administrative assistants who were all young, blonde and attractive - he says.",
      "Mr Brilliant recalls them as \u201cobedient\u201d. He explains: \u201cThere was this notion of \u2018do this, jump, how high should I jump?\u2019 - and really being on the ball. Mohamed demanded a lot of people, and they were serving their role.\u201d",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 00:05:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Thermal imaging tech has become cheaper and homeowners are using it to track down heat loss.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s like X-ray vision \u2013 for heat loss. Last year, web engineer Jamie Matthews bought a thermal imaging camera. His home, in the southeast of England, was about to give up some of its secrets.",
      "The colourful images on the device\u2019s small screen soon revealed how his loft hatch was letting him down.",
      "\u201cThat was really obvious on the camera,\u201d he says, explaining that he could see cool areas on the hatch, where heat was apparently escaping.",
      "Mr Mathews, who runs a software company that supplies the clean tech industry, also found some other small gaps in external walls and parts of his roof that appeared less well insulated than others.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good fun and it certainly shows up things that may not be immediately obvious,\u201d he says.",
      "While Mr Matthews was able to draught-proof some areas himself, he says he would take a more methodical approach if he were planning any major changes to his home. The web engineer later had a professional heat loss survey carried out when he installed a heat pump, for example.",
      "That approach is sensible, according to building physics researchers who spoke to the BBC. There are signs that thermal cameras are becoming more popular, as homeowners seek to slash their heating bills and carbon emissions. Local councils are increasingly allowing residents to borrow the devices for free, for example.",
      "But there is no substitute for professional advice if you are planning big works or interventions, experts say.",
      "Thermal cameras work by using a sensor to detect infrared light, which we cannot see, but which we can sometimes feel as heat. Such devices aren\u2019t cheap. Mr Matthews spent roughly \u00a3160 on his, though organisations including local councils and energy supplier Octopus Energy do loan them out to people free of charge so that they can gain a basic understanding of heat loss in their homes.",
      "Wiltshire Council recently made 11 devices available to borrow from local libraries, as well as a brief guide on how to use them. There has been \u201chuge uptake\u201d says Cllr Ian Blair-Pilling, such that the council now has a waiting list for interested residents.",
      "\"Expert advice, combined with a measured approach to the findings from thermal imaging, will give residents the best chance of making informed decisions about energy-saving home improvements,\" says Cllr Blair-Pilling.",
      "Small interventions could help people keep their homes warm and reduce the risk of cold-related health conditions, he adds.",
      "However, Jo Atkinson, senior consultant in buildings decarbonisation at Energy Systems Catapult, a research organisation, expresses concern over the growing availability of thermal cameras: \u201cIn my opinion, the risks are too great for making the wrong choices.\u201d",
      "It is possible to misinterpret thermal camera images, she says, noting that if a wall has been warmed by the sun, an image of that wall taken outside could make it look as though heat is escaping, when it is not. Reflective surfaces can also appear, misleadingly, to be leaking heat.",
      "While using a thermal camera as a starting point for understanding your home is \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d, according to Ronita Bardhan at the University of Cambridge, it is important to ask for independent expert advice when planning any renovation works.",
      "Thermal camera imagery can make it look as though some areas of your home are losing a lot of heat, but this might simply be a result of how the camera has been calibrated, how the user holds it and moves it around, and which colour palette was chosen for the display.",
      "Dr Bardhan adds that there is a risk of triggering \u201cretrofit anxiety\u201d in homeowners.",
      "Plus, if people go on to alter their insulation, for example, such measures should be taken with great care as improper installation can cause damp and mould.",
      "North Somerset Council provides thermal cameras to residents, on loan, and this scheme is also currently operating on a waiting list basis due to its popularity. The Council has published introductory advice on how to use the cameras, including an online video.",
      "The Centre for Sustainable Energy (CSE), a charity, highlights a more detailed guide from the National House-Building Council, which describes how to use thermal cameras. However, a CSE spokeswoman adds that the organisation still recommends people seek expert advice.",
      "Phil Steele, future technologies evangelist at Octopus Energy, agrees: \u201cYou have got to be careful.\u201d Thermal cameras can, for instance, make the corners of rooms look very cold but this is simply a reflection of reduced air circulation in those areas, rather than an insulation problem, he explains.",
      "Octopus Energy has around 500 cameras that it loans out to customers every winter. Last year, the firm distributed the devices roughly 3,800 times.",

The device indicated loss of heat around windows and doors in Miss Green\u2019s home. She and her partner were able to compare the results to their neighbour\u2019s better-insulated property.",
      "\u201cIt just confirmed what we knew already, but it was still interesting to see, you know, were there any other areas?\u201d she explains.",

      "He adds that Flir aims to make thermal images as clear and easy to interpret as possible \u2013 including by merging optical imagery with thermal imagery, to add more detail to the final picture. And he suggests that, in the future, Flir cameras may offer machine learning-based instructions and advice as people use the devices.",

    "story": [
      "The most popular mobile games in the UK are being advertised without disclosing they contain loot boxes - random in-game purchases which critics say are \"exploitative\" and \"foster addiction\".",
      "The regulator, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), says it bans and removes ads which fail to make the clear whether or not a game contains a loot box.",
      "But a BBC investigation found only two of the top 45 highest-grossing games on the Google Play store actually followed those rules.",
      "Dr Jane Rigbye, chief executive of Young Gamers & Gamblers Education Trust (Ygam), called the findings \"deeply concerning\".",
      "\"In the absence of robust regulation in gaming, it is essential for games to provide clear and transparent information about their features, allowing both parents and gamers to make informed decisions,\" she said.",
      "In a statement, the ASA said: \"This is an ongoing area of our work, and we\u2019re closely monitoring the sector to discover the scale of compliance and act accordingly.\"",
      "However, some say the regulator lacks the teeth to deal with the problem.",
      "\"The ASA, although it has upheld some complaints, it takes so long to properly process all of these things - they will go to a company and say, 'you should comply', but they don't comply,\" said Leon Y  Xiao, a video game regulation researcher at the IT University of Copenhagen.",
      "\"People are walking into a video game not knowing the potential risks, and this is assuming that people have even understood the risk of loot boxes to begin with.\"",
      "What is a loot box?",
      "Loot boxes contain random digital items that gamers can only reveal through gameplay or - more controversially - by making a payment.",
      "Game-makers have previously defended them as being akin to a chocolate egg containing a plastic toy, with children not knowing exactly what they are getting until the egg is bought and opened.",
      "But critics say they are in fact a form of gambling, with a report in 2022 by the Norwegian Consumer Council concluding they \"often involve exploiting consumers through predatory mechanisms, fostering addiction, targeting vulnerable consumer groups and more.\"",
      "The same year, the UK government resisted pressure to regulate loot boxes, saying the video game industry could self-regulate instead.",
      "Trade body Ukie published guidance in July 2023, including the requirement to disclose loot boxes prior to games being purchased, which the industry was given a year to comply with.",
      "But, more than 12 months later, the BBC has discovered the vast majority of major mobile games containing loot boxes are still flouting the rules, with most games only disclosing their presence if would-be players tap a small information button on the Play Store.",
      "Adrian Hon, head of game developer Six to Start, said the games industry had a track record of \"conveniently ignoring or forgetting regulations that might interfere with their ability to sell to players\".",
      "\"We know that many people, including children, struggle with overspending on loot boxes,\" he said, adding they were deliberately designed to be \"habit-forming\".",
      "\"The least that games companies could do is disclose the presence of loot boxes, but they won't even do that - it's an indictment of their priorities and lack of care towards vulnerable players.\"",
      "Non-compliance",
      "The BBC checked the adverts for the top 45 highest grossing games on Google's Play Store, which along with Apple's App Store are where the vast majority of people access mobile games.",
      "Of those 45, 26 were labelled as including loot boxes - 22 of which were being actively advertised at the same time.",
      "However, only two of those titles spelt out the presence of the loot boxes in their ads.",
      "The highest-grossing game on the Play Store to contain loot boxes, Monopoly GO, was among those not to mention random in-game purchases in its adverts.",
      "The game has been downloaded more than 50 million times, generating more than $3bn (\u00a32.37bn) in revenue according to the IP's owner Hasbro.",
      "Mr Xiao told the BBC the findings were in line with preliminary results of his own research, which has also found around 90% of games containing loot boxes are not disclosing this in their ads.",
      "The BBC has approached Hasbro, Meta and the ASA for comment.",
      "Zo\u00eb Osmond, CEO of GambleAware, said she was \"extremely concerned\" about \"gambling-like activities\" becoming normalised for children.",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:14:06 GMT",
    "summary": "Supermarket customers can save money with loyalty cards but should still shop around.",
    "story": [
      "Supermarket loyalty cards do offer genuine savings, the UK's competition watchdog has found, but it said people should still shop around.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) looked at 50,000 products on loyalty price promotions across Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Co-op and Waitrose.",
      "It found \"very little evidence\" that supermarkets were inflating their \"usual\" prices to make promotions look like a better deal.",
      "However, it found that despite discounts being legitimate many shoppers still did not trust that the offers were cheaper.",
      "While the CMA also said its review \"has shown that loyalty prices aren\u2019t always the cheapest option, so shopping around is still key\".",
      "\"We know many people don\u2019t trust loyalty card prices,\" said George Lusty, the CMA's interim executive director of consumer protection. \"Which is why we did a deep dive to get to the bottom of whether supermarkets were treating shoppers fairly.\"",
      "Loyalty pricing is where there are two prices on a product - a \"normal\" one and a lower price for customers who have a loyalty card or app.",
      "Warning over new supermarket spending 'challenges'",
      "How a big yellow label influences what we buy",
      "It said about nine out of 10 loyalty promotions it looked at offered genuine savings against the usual in-store price.",
      "Customers made an average saving of between 17% and 25% across the five supermarkets the CMA examined.",
      "The watchdog also surveyed shoppers and said that nearly 70% of those it spoke to think loyalty pricing offers decent savings.",
      "However, there remains a significant amount of mistrust among consumers towards loyalty promotions.",
      "The CMA said: \"A significant proportion - 40% - say they do not trust loyalty prices are a genuine saving on the usual price.\"",
      "A common view among younger people was that non-member prices in a promotion were higher than normal.",
      "More than 70% of 18 to 29-year-olds thought that the price for those without a loyalty card or app had been bumped up, said the CMA.",
      "While the report examined other supermarkets, it did not draw any conclusions about two of the UK's largest - Asda and Aldi.",
      "Asda has a loyalty points scheme which customers can redeem for vouchers but it does not offer lower prices on a product for those with a loyalty card.",
      "Discounters Aldi and Lidl were not included as they don't sell online, and don't stock a wide enough range of branded products to do a like-for-like comparison, the watchdog said.",
      "Consumer group Which? said two-tier pricing had \"become a common practice across retailers\" so it was \"reassuring\" that people could make genuine savings.",
      "However, it has also studied thousands of products, \"and repeatedly found examples of loyalty price offers that aren't as good as they seem\" according to Sue Davies, Which? head of food policy.",
      "She also said there are concerns that \"millions of consumers are being excluded from accessing lower prices due to loyalty scheme restrictions\" because they have not signed up to a card or app.",
      "Shoppers have been under pressure from the pace of food price rises in recent years, the CMA said.",
      "Although inflation has fallen considerably since then, it said the price of food is still substantially higher relative to how much money people earn.",
      "Customer data",
      "One of the main reasons supermarkets offer loyalty schemes is so they can collect data on customers.",
      "This is very valuable information - studying buying decisions can help supermarkets understand and influence shoppers.",
      "They create highly detailed shopper profiles looking at what people bought and how often.",
      "Some supermarkets sell data to suppliers which can then be used to deliver targeted advertising.",
      "Selling data can be lucrative. Sainsbury's has said it expects Nectar360, the group which manages the supermarket's loyalty scheme, to make an additional \u00a3100m in profit over the next three years.",
      "The CMA said shopper attitudes to data collection range from feeling pressure to trade their personal data for lower prices, to others not feeling concerned.",
      "But only 7% of people surveyed by the watchdog said they hadn't signed up to a loyalty scheme due to privacy concerns.",
      "Annich McIntosh, editor and chief executive of Loyalty Magazine, said there was a question mark over whether it was morally right to force people to participate in loyalty schemes to get price promotions.",
      "But she said these schemes in general benefit shoppers because they can help slow down supermarket price increases.",
      "She added that a \"sci-fi scenario\" of customers being offered promotions as they walk past a product was unlikely, as there was little customer appetite.",
      "However, using artificial intelligence to personalise offers could benefit both shoppers and supermarkets, she added.",
      "How to save money on your food shopping",
      "Learn prices: Get to know the cost of the items you buy regularly so you can spot what is a good offer and what is notCompare price per 100g: Look along the shelf at similar items as loyalty prices might not be the cheapest option.Set a budget and stick to it:  Often supermarket vouchers or challenges will require you to spend more so don't be tempted to overspendStock up: If you do want to take advantage of a money-off voucher then bulk buy staples like pasta, rice or tinned food that have a long shelf lifeUse tech: Use independent supermarket comparison apps to save your favourite items and get alerts when they go down in price",

    "summary": "The US president-elect's import taxes may be just talk until he takes office - but they are having an impact anyway.",
    "story": [
      "When handbag designer Sherrill Mosee learned that roughly 2,700 purses and backpacks she had ordered from her Chinese manufacturing partner would not make it onto one ship this autumn, she was initially content to wait.",
      "Then Donald Trump was re-elected as US president.",
      "\"I'm like, okay, we've got to bring those in,\" said Ms Mosee, founder of MinkeeBlue, a small business based in Philadelphia. Her firm is one of the many thousands across the country preparing for the potential impact of Trump's promises to impose stiff new tariffs on all goods coming into the country.",
      "Those efforts gained urgency this week as Trump said he would take action on his first day in office. He aimed the measures - a kind of border tax - at China, Mexico and Canada, America's top three trade partners.",
      "Writing on social media, Trump said he planned to impose a 25% levy on goods from Canada and Mexico and \"an additional 10% tariff, above any additional tariffs\" on imports from China.",
      "The post followed his campaign pledge to impose across-the-board tariffs of at least 10% on all imports coming into the US, and 60% or more on goods from China - many of which already face steep duties left over from actions taken during his first term as president.",
      "Some experts have said that Trump's policies may ultimately prove less aggressive than promised, and that his statements should be understood as opening salvos in bigger negotiations of migration and drug policy.",
      "But regardless of how policy shakes out, the threats are already having economic consequences, as firms like MinkeeBlue start to stockpile, shift supply chains, re-work contracts and take other steps to guard against the possible impact.",

      "Trump vows new tariffs on day one",
      "Canada, Mexico and China respond to Trump tariff threats",
      "Trump proves he is serious on tariffs - but it's not about trade",
      "Could Trump\u2019s tariffs hurt US consumers?",
      "Chris Caton, managing director for global strategy and analytics at warehouse giant Prologis, said his firm had already seen an uptick in activity \"on the margin\" as businesses respond to possible tariffs by looking for space to stock up.",
      "\"There's economic impact whether it's bluster or not,\" said economist Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.",
      "In the days after the election, footwear giant Steve Madden told investors that it was moving forward with plans to shift manufacturing outside of China, with the aim of cutting its imports from the country in half over the next year.",
      "Tool and hardware maker Stanley Black & Decker also said it had initiated conversations with its customers about price hikes tied to the tariffs.",
      "Executives at retail giants such as Walmart have discussed similar plans.",
      "Even if Trump's policies remain just talk, Ms Edelberg said the public could see higher prices, as well as possible shortages of some items, as hoarding left some firms scrambling.",
      "Just the simple fact that firms were unsure about what was going to happen was also likely to reduce economic growth in the months ahead, she added.",
      "\"Even if firms don't think that these tariffs are going to happen with 100% certainty, it's not zero, so they should be responding,\" Ms Edelberg said.",
      "Trump and his advisers have argued that tariffs will help revive US manufacturing and drive a new US jobs boom.",
      "But that can come at a cost, businesses owners and economists warn.",
      "Martin Pochtaruk, chief executive of Canadian solar panel maker Heliene, said his firm was nearly wiped out in 2018 when Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made solar panels and it had to absorb the fees.",
      "The firm now does all of its manufacturing in the US, where it employs 400 people. Many of its suppliers have also set up shop in the US, lured by government incentives for renewable energy introduced by President Joe Biden.",
      "Mr Pochtaruk's firm has learned from its experience, changing the design of its contracts so that customers are responsible for unexpected cost changes - whether due to tariffs or the kind of price spikes that hit during the pandemic.",
      "But despite these protections, the possibility of renewed trade tension between countries as closely connected as Canada and the US was worrying, Mr Pochtaruk said.",
      "Some key materials - such as glass - still come from overseas and face likely price hikes. The new administration could also bring other policies that slow growth in the industry.",
      "\"We are talking to all of our clients,\" Mr Pochtaruk said. \"There is a lot of anxiety.\"",
      "Economists say the evidence from existing tariffs - which have been present for decades in sectors such as clothing and footwear - suggests that while they can protect some firms, the cost is high and they do little to boost overall employment, while raising prices for US companies and consumers.",
      "The National Retail Federation (NRF) has warned that tariffs along the lines of Trump's campaign proposals would cost US consumers between $46bn (\u00a336.6bn) and $78bn more annually for apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods.",
      "By NRF estimates, a $40 toaster, for example, would rise in price to $48-$52, while a $50 pair of athletic shoes could jump to $59-$64.",
      "Trump's move on Monday to target Mexico - a key supplier of grocery staples such as fruits and vegetables and historically protected by a free-trade agreement - underscores the tension between his tariff promises and other pledges on the campaign trail to bring down prices for Americans.",
      "Viktor Shvets of Macquarie Capital said that although Trump's ideas were in conflict with each other, he believed in the end Trump's fear of disrupting financial markets would limit his trade actions.",
      "\"Risks are high, but we remain convinced that 'guardrails' are sufficiently robust to avoid the worst outcomes,\" he wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.",
      "Such bets are little comfort to small business owners like Ms Mosee, who have little extra financial cushion to weather uncertainty.",
      "As a small brand facing significant competition, Ms Mosee said she was not in a strong position to raise prices on her bags, which typically sell for about $180 a piece.",
      "She has been looking in Cambodia and India for a new supplier.",
      "But after a decade on her own, Ms Mosee - a former engineer who has decorated her office with motivational posters promising that \"something wonderful is about to happen\" - said she probably needed to find a business partner if her business, with its two employees, was to survive the expected changes ahead.",

    "story": [
      "\"It's not just about brewing a good cup of coffee but connecting with customers on a deeper level.\"",
      "It was this one thought that made Harmanpreet Singh leave his family bakery to open a specialty coffee shop in the northern Indian city of Jalandhar.",
      "It was an unexpected decision - coffee has always been popular in southern states, traditionally served strong and frothy in a steel tumbler. But it's still not the first choice of beverage in the vast swathes of north India, where drinking tea is an intrinsic part of the culture.",
      "For Mr Singh, the journey began in 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic when he saw a growing demand for specialty coffee, particularly among the city's youth and the overseas residents who returned to the country at that time.",
      "Recognising this shift, he moved to the southern city of Bengaluru to learn brewing techniques. \"I studied everything - from the way coffee is served to the role things like decor, cutlery, music and even packaging played in the overall experience,\" he said.",
      "Three months later, Mr Singh put his learnings to test and opened Buland Caf\u00e9 in Jalandhar.",
      "Today, the cafe has 40 outlets across the city and has become a favourite spot for the city's youth, who come here to relax or work over piping cups of coffee.",
      "The beans, roasted in various blends, are sourced from the famed coffee estates of  Karnataka. Mr Singh says he personally trained his staff on how to brew the perfect cuppa and take care of the coffee machine.",
      "\"It's a thriving scene,\" he says.",
      "Mr Singh is among a crop of young entrepreneurs that are benefitting from a wave of specialty coffee consumption in small north Indian towns and cities.",
      "India has had a vibrant cafe culture for years - but it has been largely restricted to big cities where homegrown specialty and international coffee chains dominate the market.",
      "However, post-Covid, several tier-two cities are also seeing a boom in demand for such spaces as people embrace practices like remote working and look for new places to meet their friends and families.",
      "Cafe owners say more Indians are now willing to pay more for coffee that's roasted in smaller batches and customised as per their preferences.",
      "\"Clients have become more knowledgeable about the roasts and are interested in the origins of their coffee,\" says Bharat Singhal, the founder of Billi Hu roasteries.",
      "In fact, more than 44% of the Indian population now drinks coffee, a 2023 report by CRISIL, a marketing analytical company, shows.",
      "While a lot of it comes from home consumption, the growing demand for specialty coffee in small cities plays a big part, says Bhavi Patel, a coffee consultant and dairy technologist.",
      "Roastery owners say the growth is also evident in numbers. \"Subscription based orders have surged by 50% in one year,\" says Sharang Sharma, the founder of Bloom Coffee Roasters. \"Customers have moved from French presses to pour-over or espresso machines, adopting more sophisticated brewing methods.\"",
      "While India is often associated with tea, it also has a long coffee-drinking history.",
      "The culture took shape in the 1900s when Indian Coffee Houses emerged as a hangout spot for the intellectual and elite class. Housed in colonial-styled buildings, these cafes served English breakfasts with steaming hot coffee and offered a space to discuss politics and mobilise support during pivotal periods in history.",
      "A shift occurred in the 1990s when economic reforms opened India to the world, allowing entrepreneurs to open private coffee shops frequented by young peeople, who saw it as a hip experience.",
      "Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day (CCD), which opened in 1996, quickly became one of India\u2019s most popular and widespread coffee chains. At its peak, CCD boasted over 1,700 outlets, serving as a popular gathering spot for students and young adults. But mounting debt, management issues and the untimely death of its founder led to a closure of most of its outlets across India.",
      "In 2012, the arrival of international giant Starbucks spurred the rise of homegrown specialty coffee brands like Blue Tokai Roasters, Third Wave Coffee and Subko Coffee.",
      "Mr Singhal says that while big cities like Delhi, Jaipur, Mumbai, and Bengaluru still dominate the scene, smaller cities are quickly catching up.",
      "However, it's not just changing palettes that's driving consumption. \"Often it's social media,\" Mr Singh says. \"People want good coffee but they also want to be in a space that's trendy and which they can post online.\"",
      "Nishant Sinha from Lucknow city is among those who understood the trend early on.",
      "His Roastery Coffee House offers trendy ambience, free wi-fi and cosy seating options along with an array of coffee roasts. While the beans are sourced from coffee estates in the south, the food is distinctively north Indian.",
      "Others like Jatin Khurana in the northern city of Ludhiana are experimenting with flavours.",
      "At his Urban Buhkkad cafe, Mr Khurana serves the \"Shadi Wali Coffee [the wedding coffee]\" - a wedding favourite in the 1990s, which became famous for its blend of instant coffee, milk, sugar, and a sprinkle of chocolate powder.",
      "But instead of coffee powder, Mr Khurana uses freshly grounded beans, available in different roasts and varieties, to enhance its flavours. \"The idea is to capture the essence of the beverage that many Indians grew up drinking,\" he says.",
      "It's an exciting time to be in the business - but growth comes with its own set of challenges.",
      "\"Demand is growing, but a smaller coffee shop owners tend to cut corners, whether it\u2019s by opting for substandard machines, serving weaker coffee shots, or hiring inexperienced baristas,\" Mr Singhal says.",
      "And running the business is not always profitable given the high price of coffee and the infrastructural costs involved in running such spaces.",
      "When Neha Das and Nishant Ashish opened The Eden\u2019s caf\u00e9 in Ranchi in 2021, they wanted to create a safe and relaxed space for young students to get together in the city.",
      "Today, their hazelnut coffee and cold brews have become a favourite of many.",
      "\"It took some time but longevity requires more than profit,\" Ms Das says.",
      "\"It\u2019s about dedication, crafting local flavours, and understanding customers, even if it means working with slim profit margins for the long haul.\""

      "His predecessor Durk Jager resigned as a result of the failure of a huge global restructuring that he led. Cutting 15,000 jobs and 10 factories was meant to increase profits, but instead led to repeated profit warnings and a steep share price collapse.",

      "The average for an S&P500 CEO last year was a record $16.3m, according to executive consultants Equilar. It means they are getting 196 times as much as the average worker at their companies and critics says CEO\u2019s aren\u2019t worth that much more than their staff.",

    "story": [
      "One of the innovations at this year's Paris Olympics was supposed to be an electric flying taxi service.",
      "Germany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.",
      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "But the company has been through financial challenges and recently agreed a rescue deal with its biggest creditor, US based Mudrick Capital.",
      "Under the deal, Mudrick will invest up to $50m in Verticial , meanwhile $130m of loans from Mudrick will be converted into shares.",
      "That will leave the US investment firm with a 70% stake in Vertical, while Mr Fitzpatrick's stake falls from 70% to 20%.",
      "\"This comprehensive deal - alongside the recent piloted flight campaign...  means Vertical is positioned to be a winner in one of the 21st century\u2019s most exciting technologies,\" Mr Fitzpatrick said in a statement accompanying the deal.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",
      "Given all the uncertainty and expense, you might wonder why investors put money into new electric aircraft in the first place.",

      "Tamuna\u2019s search had begun in 2016, after the woman who raised her died. Clearing out her house, Tamuna found a birth certificate with her own name on it but the wrong birth date, and she started to suspect she was adopted. After doing some research, she set up a Facebook group called Vedzeb, or I\u2019m Searching, hoping to find her birth parents.",
      "Instead, she uncovered a baby trafficking scandal in Georgia that has affected tens of thousands of lives. Over many decades, parents were lied to and told their newborn babies had died \u2013 the infants were then sold.",
      "Tamuna is a journalist and her work has reunited hundreds of families, yet - until now - she couldn\u2019t solve the mystery of her own origins and wondered if she too had been stolen as a child.",
      "\u201cI was a journalist on this story, but it was a personal mission for me as well,\u201d she says.",
      "The breakthrough in her search had come in the summer, when she received a message through her Facebook group. It was from someone who lived in rural Georgia, who said they knew a woman who had concealed a pregnancy and given birth in Tbilisi in September 1984. That\u2019s around the time Tamuna was born - a date she had shared publicly.",

      "A woman soon responded, saying the woman who had concealed the pregnancy was her own aunt. She asked Tamuna to take the post down but she agreed to do a DNA test.",
      "While they were waiting for the results, Tamuna made the phone call to her mother.",
      "A week later, the DNA results arrived, indicating that Tamuna and the woman on Facebook were indeed cousins. Armed with this evidence, Tamuna managed to convince her mother to acknowledge the truth and reveal the name of her father. It was a man called Gurgen Khorava.",
      "\u201cThe first two months were shocking, I couldn\u2019t believe these things were happening to me,\u201d she recalls, \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe I had found them.\u201d",
      "Once Tamuna had Gurgen\u2019s name, she quickly tracked him down on Facebook. It turned out that he had been following her story on social media - her work reconnecting families is widely known across Georgia.",
      "Tamuna was amazed to find that he had \u201cbeen in my friend list for three years\u201d. He just hadn\u2019t realised he was a part of her story.",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t even know my birth mother had been pregnant,\u201d says Tamuna. \u201cIt was a huge surprise for him.\"",
      "They soon arranged to meet in his hometown of Zugdidi in western Georgia \u2013 about 160 miles (260km) from where she lives in Tbilisi.",
      "Looking back, Tamuna thinks she was in a state of shock, but as she walked up to Gurgen\u2019s garden gate, she felt surprisingly calm.",
      "When the 72-year-old appeared, they hugged, then stopped to take a moment to look at each other, smiling.",
      "\u201cIt was strange, the moment he looked at me, he knew that I was his daughter,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI had so many mixed emotions.\u201d",
      "She had a lot of questions and didn\u2019t know where to start. \u201cWe just sat together, watching each other and trying to find something in common,\u201d she says.",
      "As the two of them chatted, they realised they shared a lot of interests - Gurgen had once been a renowned dancer at the State Ballet of Georgia, and was delighted to learn that Tamuna\u2019s daughters - his granddaughters - shared his passion.",
      "\u201cThey both love dancing, and so does my husband,\u201d she says with a smile.",
      "Gurgen invited his entire family to his home to meet Tamuna, introducing her to a large group of new relatives - half siblings, cousins, aunts, and uncles. The family agreed there was a strong resemblance between them. \u201cOut of all his children, I look the most like my father,\u201d she says.",
      "They spent an evening sharing stories, eating traditional Georgian food, and singing while Gurgen played the accordion.",
      "Even though she had now met her father, Tamuna still had a niggling question: had she - like thousands of other Georgians - been stolen from her mother at birth and sold? Her adoptive parents were no longer alive so she couldn\u2019t turn to them for answers.",
      "She finally got a chance to ask her birth mother in October. A Polish TV company was filming a documentary about Tamuna and took her to meet her mother, who agreed to talk to her in private.",
      "Unlike many people Tamuna has helped to reunite, she discovered that she had not been a stolen child herself. Instead, her mother had given her up and kept the secret for 40 years.",
      "Her mother and father were not in a relationship and had only had a brief encounter. Her mother - overwhelmed by shame - chose to hide her pregnancy. In September 1984, she travelled to Tbilisi, telling people she was going for surgery, and instead gave birth to a daughter. She stayed there until arrangements were made for Tamuna\u2019s adoption.",
      "\u201cIt was painful to learn that I spent 10 days alone with her before the adoption. I try not to think about that,\u201d Tamuna reflects.",
      "She says that her mother asked her to lie and tell people she had been stolen. \u201cShe told me that if I would not say that I was stolen, everything would end between us\u2026 and I said that I couldn\u2019t do that.\"",
      "Tamuna feels this would be unfair to all the parents whose babies were stolen. \u201cIf I lie, nobody's going to believe those mothers any more,\u201d she explains.",
      "Her mother then asked her to leave the house and they have not spoken since.",

    "story": [
      "Chart-topping K-pop group NewJeans have said they are leaving their agency after accusing it of \"mistreatment\" and \"manipulation\".",
      "The five-member girl band announced their departure from Ador, a subsidiary of powerhouse label Hybe, in a late-night press conference held on Thursday.",
      "Ador however has said its contract with NewJeans still stands, as the agency has not violated any terms.",
      "This dispute is the latest development in a long-running conflict between former NewJeans producer Min Hee-Jin and Hybe's chairman Bang Si-hyuk, which has made headlines in South Korea.",

      "K-pop star gives tearful testimony on harassment",
      "NewJeans face uncertainty after failed ultimatum",
      "One of the group's members, Hanni, has alleged that she suffered workplace harassment while working with the label.",
      "\"This is not the type of work ethic we respect and not one we want to be a part of, and to continue working under a company with no intention of protecting NewJeans would only do us harm,\" Hanni said.",
      "She added the group had faced \"mistreatment, not just towards us but also including our staff\", and said the group had experienced \"deliberate miscommunications and manipulation in multiple areas\".",
      "Ador maintains that its contract with NewJeans remains valid as it has not violated its duty and has asked the group to \"continue their activities\" with the agency.",
      "\"A unilateral claim that trust has been broken does not constitute valid grounds for termination of a contract,\" Ador said in the statement after the group's announcement.",
      "\"We regret that the press conference on the termination of the contract took place without sufficient consideration, and even before we gave our response to the demand letter,\" the agency said.",
      "NewJeans said they would like to work with Min, the group's former mastermind  who left Ador in August following accusations that she had planned to split from Hybe, taking NewJeans with her.",
      "This would have made NewJeans and Ador independent of Hybe. Min has denied the accusations against her.",
      "She has previously accused Hybe of launching another girl group, Illit, that was copying NewJeans' music and appearance.",
      "On 13 November, NewJeans filed a legal notice to Ador demanding the company resolve breaches of their exclusive contracts within 14 days.",
      "They said that failure to meet their demands would result in the termination of their contracts.",
      "The group has asked for an apology for a comment allegedly made by an executive at Belift Lab, another subsidiary of Hybe, and accused the company of workplace bullying. They have also asked for the immediate reinstatement of Min.",
      "They added that they would fulfil their contractual obligations, but at the conference warned their fans they might not be able to use the band's name after the contract terminates.",
      "Prior to the NewJeans' announcement, the band were committed to a seven-year contract, which runs out in 2029.",
      "The contract includes a clause specifying that parties can unilaterally terminate the contract if the other has violated its duty. However, the matter is likely to go to court as both sides do not agree. In such a scenario, a judge would decide if the contract can be terminated and if one side owes the other any damages.",
      "In October, the K-pop news site Koreaboo estimated that the members would have to pay about 300bn South Korean Won (about \u00a3170m) to terminate the contract early.",
      "But group singer Haerin said it made \"no sense\" that the group would be liable to pay a contract breach fee.",
      "\"We never broke any rules,\u201d Haerin said. \u201cWe did nothing but try our best - they are the ones at fault. Hybe and Ador are the ones responsible.\"",
      "Ador said it had not \"violated\" the terms of the contract, adding that it \"respectfully requests that the group continue its collaboration with Ador on upcoming activities\".",
      "\"Despite multiple requests for meetings with the artists, our efforts have not been successful. We hope the members will now be willing to engage in an open and candid discussion,\" it said, referring to NewJeans.",
      "The group has been embroiled in a year-long controversy with audits and emotional accusations making South Korean headlines.",
      "In October, a member of the group, Hanni, 20, testified at the Labour Committee of South Korea's National Assembly at a hearing about workplace harassment.",
      "She alleged that entertainment agency Hybe had deliberately undermined her band, and accused senior managers of deliberately ignoring her.",
      "Following several incidents, she said: \"I came to the realisation that this wasn\u2019t just a feeling. I was honestly convinced that the company hated us.\"",
      "Hybe shares fell by 4% in Seoul trading on Friday.",
      "NewJeans made its debut in 2022 and is among Hybe's most successful K-pop groups, along with BTS.",
      "With slick pop hits including Super Shy and OMG, NewJeans were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world last year, and were nominated for best group at this year's MTV Awards.",
      "Formed by Ador in 2022, its five members - Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein - range in age from 16 to 20.",

      "He branded number two as a \"hurtling Disneyland rollercoaster ride\" that lacks the joy and refreshing originality of its predecessor.",

      "Drake responded with a track called The Heart Part 6, in which he denied accusations of sexual misconduct and claimed to have fed Lamar \"false\" information through a double agent. However, the musician later deleted the track from his Instagram feed.",
      "The Canadian star, who is one of the most-streamed musicians of all time, releases music through his own label, OVO Music, but licenses the songs to Universal's subsidiary label Republic for marketing and distribution.",

      "Did The Beatles crack America because Kennedy was killed?",

      "Dr Patrick Andelic, assistant professor of American History at Northumbria University, said it was a moment that shook the nation to its core, partially because of JFK's own pop culture persona.",
      "\"In a sense, Kennedy was the first TV president, which was relatively new at this point,\" he said.",
      "\"By the beginning of the '60s, 90% of American families had TVs, so the way news and media was consumed totally changed.\"",

      "There had been limited success for those that came before The Beatles.",
      "Lonnie Donegan, the titular \"King of Skiffle\", had two top ten hits, while Cliff Richard, then the biggest act in Britain, had only made it into the US top 40 on one occasion.",
      "Spencer Leigh, author of many books on The Beatles, said the trend of British acts failing to \"make it\" in the United States, had seen Capitol, one of the country's biggest record companies, even refuse to distribute The Beatles' music for fear of the same result.",
      "\"Artists from the UK didn't sell well in America and it seemed Capitol looked down its nose at the British work,\" he said.",
      "Capitol's concerns were understandable. The singles Please Please Me, From Me To You and She Loves You had all been released in the US in 1963 and seen limited success, so they were reluctant to put out I Want To Hold Your Hand.",

      "The TV channel CBS reportedly received more than 50,000 requests for seats at its 700-capacity studio ahead of the band's visit and those who failed to get their hands on any huddled excitedly around TVs at home.",
      "\"More than 70 million people watched the first one and they performed so well,\" Leigh said.",

    "title": "'It's part of my DNA': Charli XCX and the fight to save club culture",
    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 18:05:05 GMT",
    "summary": "Can Charli XCX's Brat tour give the UK's club scene the boost it desperately needs?",
    "story": [
      "Don't put away your strappy top and bic lighter just yet - Charli XCX's Brat arena tour has just landed in the UK.",
      "Kicking off in Manchester on Wednesday, the gigs will be hoping to keep the mania of Brat summer alive well into the winter months.",
      "But could the mega tour give the UK's club scene the boost it desperately needs?",
      "\"The clubbing landscape right now, I would say honestly it's quite terrifying,\" London DJ Moxie tells BBC Newsbeat.",
      "More than 100 music venues in the UK stopped putting on live music last year according to the Music Venue's Trust - with more than half of those fully closing.",
      "\"We rely on a lot of students and a lot of students are not going out,\" Moxie says.",
      "\"They're prioritising staying in because they can't quite afford to go out.",
      "\"Everything has gone up and that's had such a knock on effect on venues.\"",
      "The venues that are closing or struggling to stay open are the types of places where Charli XCX honed her craft.",
      "Charli's spoken before about getting her parents to take her to raves when she was a teenager and before she was selling out arenas, she was working warehouse gigs.",
      "\"She has been around for such a long time and she used to go out - I would be at raves that she was at when she was like 15,\" says Moxie.",
      "\"She is opening up the conversation about the sorts of places that have inspired her.\"",
      "And as those places start to disappear, Moxi's hopeful that Charli's fanbase will discover a love of club music that has been on the wane.",
      "\"Especially if someone like Charli XCX is telling them: 'This is where I've come from, the clubs have made me, it's part of my DNA'.\"",
      "It's not just Charli bringing club music to the mainstream either - Fred Again headlined Reading and Leeds festival over the summer and Peggy Gou's had a string of sold out shows.",
      "Brat is Charli's sixth album and it's up for an armful of awards including three Grammys and the Mercury Prize.",
      "Hot on its heels was the remix album, Brat And It's Completely Different But Also Still Brat, and an arena tour.",
      "And for top artists headlining arenas, fans are used to paying above the odds.",
      "But at Charli's show in Manchester on Wednesday, friends Niamh and Freya say they were \"really surprised\" to only pay \u00a340 each to see Charli XCX.",
      "\"We thought it would be more expensive,\" they say.",
      "\"It wasn't bad at all - it was really affordable.\"",
      "Compare that to Taylor Swift's Eras Tour where, on average, fans spent \u00a3206 on a ticket.",
      "Regular standing tickets for Beyonc\u00e9 Renaissance shows cost up to \u00a3410 and tickets for Billie Eilish's upcoming UK dates could set you back up to \u00a3398.",
      "More than half of people in the UK have said high prices have stopped them going to gigs in the last five years.",
      "For people under 34, two thirds of them have said that's meant they've reduced the number they go to.",
      "Tasha and Lucas also spent \u00a340 on their tickets and are hoping Charli XCX will give a boost to the clubbing scene.",
      "They travelled from Chester where Lucas says \"there's not a huge club scene\" but they often go to other towns and cities to support artists and venues.",
      "Tasha says they've always enjoyed the club scene and are excited Charli's brought it more into the mainstream.",
      "\"She's the first in our first generation to make that crossover,\" she says.",
      "\"She's breaking boundaries,\" adds Lucas.",
      "Other fans who spoke to Newsbeat at the gig told us they were new to clubbing and Charli's music had brought them into the scene.",
      "\"Party culture died out a bit,\" says fan Amara. \"I hope this revives it.\"",
      "Music journalist and critic Shaad D'Souza tells Newsbeat he \"has to hope and pray\" that lots of Charli's fans are as excited as Amara about getting into clubbing and going out.",
      "He's particularly excited about what Brat could mean for the future of the genre - as well as people going out dancing and supporting venues.",
      "\"It's refreshing that someone's going to the underground for new sounds,\" he says.",
      "\"Because what we see a lot lately is pop musicians' direct reference points are the history of pop.\"",
      "He points to Tate McRae throwing back to Britney Spears as an example, compared to artists like Madonna and Prince taking inspiration from different styles outside of pop in previous decades and bringing them into the mainstream.",
      "\"I think that's what Charli is doing here and I think that's something that's been missing,\" Shaad says.",
      "\"We lose something when pop references itself.\"",
      "As for what the Brat tour can do for the clubbing scene, Shaad believes that, while there's a growing market for big ticket events like festivals and the Eras tour, huge gigs can happily co-exist with a smaller club scene.",
      "\"I don't think the big pop tour is eating the small club landscape,\" he says.",
      "\"What's closing clubs near me is property development and council regulations - no one pop star is not responsible for clubs closing.\"",

    "title": "Michael Kiwanuka on the 'wake-up call' that changed his music",
    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 02:40:03 GMT",
    "summary": "The musician says winning the Mercury Prize helped put an end to his \"desperate\" search for approval.",
    "story": [
      "When Michael Kiwanuka was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2020, he thought he knew the deal.",
      "He'd been up for the prestigious album award twice before. Like most artists, he said it was an honour to be nominated. A win would be nice, but not particularly life-changing.",
      "He was wrong.",
      "When Annie Mac ambushed him on The One Show to reveal it was third time lucky, a switch was flipped.",
      "\"It sort of woke me up,\" the singer-songwriter reveals.",
      "\"I'd been desperately looking for approval from my peers and certain [media] outlets - and the Mercury freed me from that desperation.",
      "\"It allowed me to feel that, actually, I just want to make the records that come naturally.\"",
      "The realisation was particularly powerful because his winning album, simply titled Kiwanuka, had grappled with his sense of inferiority as a musician, a black man, a partner and a friend.",
      "External validation didn't silence the voices in his head - but it gave him a healthy dose of perspective.",
      "\"When you have impostor syndrome and you\u2019re busy beating yourself up, you're actually using up all your energy doing that, as opposed to being like, 'Wow, how amazing it is to be making my own record?', or, 'How amazing that I'm playing the Pyramid Stage [at Glastonbury]?'",
      "\"The list is so long of how cool this job is, and I spent most of my time moaning. Winning the Mercury kicked off that feeling of, oh, I've got to sort this out.\"",
      "You could see that newfound freedom when he played at Glastonbury in June. Basking in the late afternoon sun, the 37-year-old took to the stage wearing a bright white kanzu robe - a traditional tunic from Uganda, where his parents are from.",
      "And when a malfunctioning synthesizer forced him to abort a performance of his new song Small Changes, the former perfectionist just laughed it off.",
      "\"I could hear my friend Joe laughing, and I sort of forgot I was on the Pyramid Stage,\" he recalls.",
      "\"A second later, I heard the crowd cheer, and it lifted me up off the ground.",
      "\"It was an amazing feeling. I felt like I had a massive battery pack from these people. I could do no wrong. Wherever I went, they would hold me up.\"",
      "Afterwards, the musician realised that one simple moment of fallibility had put the audience on his side.",
      "\"They saw the real me for a second, rather than what I thought people wanted to see,\" he reflects. \"It was really eye-opening.\"",
      "It\u2019s a little odd to hear the musician describe himself as a people pleaser.",
      "Since the release of his debut album Home Again in 2012, his music has worked in opposition to the trend-chasing virality of modern pop. His grooves are unhurried and thoughtful, his lyrics deeply introspective, and his inspirations - such as Isaac Hayes, Bill Withers and Marvin Gaye - decidedly old-school.",
      "His second album, Love & Hate, brought him to international attention after its opening track, Cold Little Heart, was picked to be the opening theme for hit TV show Big Little Lies,  starring Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman.",
      "Kiwanuka, released in 2019, earned him the Mercury Prize and his first Grammy Award nomination. But the densely-arranged, sumptuous soul often pushed his voice back in the mix \u2013 something he has confronted on his latest record, Small Changes.",
      "\"I fell in love with my voice again, which sounds weird,\" he says. \"But I realised being able to sing, and to have a voice that sounds good on recording, is a blessing.",
      "\"So I started to want that to be heard more than all the other stuff - the drums or the guitars or the strings. And that really aided the sound of the record.\"",
      "Chart battle",
      "The result is his smallest, most understated album to date. Aided once again by producers Inflo and Danger Mouse, he has created a suite of spacious, slow-burning confessionals that compel you to lean in and pay attention, slowly revealing their beauty on repeated listens.",
      "Reviews have been ecstatic. Awarding a score of 9/10, Uncut magazine called it \"rich, moving and inventive\", while Dork said the \"perfectly-balanced\" collection was \"genuine, gracious, and absolutely first-class\".",
      "The record is locked in a two-way battle for this week's UK number one album with Kendrick Lamar\u2019s surprise release GNX \u2013 but you get the impression Kiwunka won't pay too much attention to chart positions.",
      "For him, fulfilment came in the studio, surrounded by some of his favourite musicians -  including legendary bassist Pino Palladino and Janet Jackson\u2019s producer Jimmy Jam, who popped in to say hello and ended up contributing organ parts to half of the record.",
      "Each song is about a small change Kiwanuka has made in his life - confronting depression, rediscovering the innocence of childhood, and weathering the ups and downs of marriage.",
      "His languorous voice can tend towards the melancholy, but the lyrics are full of hope. \u201cSmall changes solve the problems,\u201d he sings on the title track.",
      "Despite that, the album was written during a period of major upheaval, as Kiwanuka moved away from London, became a father, and stared down the barrel of middle age.",
      "\"I realised, at the age of 37, it\u2019s the first time I can talk about something that happened 10 years ago, and I was still an adult,\" he laughs.",

      "\"Some friendships are full season, some friendships are forever, but one isn't more important than the other.",
      "\"And that song, Small Changes, I just loved the feeling of it when I wrote it in the studio.",
      "\"It sounded the way I felt about change - part hopeful, part excited, but also with the melancholy of realising that, sometimes change is hard and it's overwhelming and you've got no control over it.\"",
      "The power of commitment",
      "The biggest development is the arrival of two children \u2013 a change that's simultaneously \"given me wings\" and raised questions about his own priorities.",
      "\"I find that difficult,\" he admits. \"When you're 18, music is all-encompassing. You don't really care about anything else. Now there's something in my life that's more important \u2013 and sometimes you worry about keeping the work up to a standard.",
      "\"You find that you can, but that's another big change.\"",
      "Family is one of the album's central themes.",
      "\"Back when I was lost, stumbling around / You found me / Now I can see / My feet won't touch the ground,\" Kiwanuka sings over the dreamy grooves of The Rest Of Me.",
      "\"Commitment is a funny word,\" he says. \"It's not really that exciting, but it does a lot.",
      "\"I feel like, in this day and age, it's almost revolutionary to stick something through to the very end. And, actually, it can negate that worried feeling the world is giving us right now.",
      "\"The last five years have been crazy, but that idea of committing to someone, whatever happens, until they leave the planet, is becoming rare. But it's something I want to hold on to.\""

      "Speaking a day after the historic vote, Mr Porter told the BBC's Today programme, for many palliative care consultants, \"the absolute, fundamental definition of palliative care is that it neither hastens nor postpones death\".",
      "He added that the bill was \"a enormous and fundamental change in the UK\" from what this \"wonderful group of doctors believes in and has practiced up until now\", however, \"society has spoken through the MPs\" and the issues had been \"extensively debated\".",
      "This week the Office for Health Economics said an increase in palliative care funding was crucial, with the system struggling to meet the needs of an ageing population.",

      "If you have an illness that cannot be cured, for example, palliative care aims to make you as comfortable as possible by managing your pain and other distressing symptoms.",
      "But a recent report by end-of-life charity Marie Curie cited data showing around 100,000 go without, with half of families unhappy about the care their loved ones receive when they die. There are reports of people left in pain and with too little support.",
      "Audits show four in 10 hospitals do not have specialist palliative care services available seven days a week.",
      "Hospices, which provide care for around 300,000 people a year, are struggling for money. Around a third of their funding comes from the NHS, with the sector having to raise the rest themselves. A parliamentary report has described this funding system as \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d.",

      "More coordination between hospitals, community NHS teams, care homes and hospices is needed, and training for non-palliative care specialists is also an issue, she said.",
      "Sam Royston, director of policy at Marie Curie, agreed action was needed on palliative care: \u201cWe have taken a neutral position on assisted dying, but we do not take a neutral position on the need for improvement on palliative care.",
      "\"The needs of people at the end of life are being neglected. There are no realistic plans currently in any UK nation to improve palliative care.\u201d",
      "He said just because MPs had backed assisted dying, did not automatically mean there would be improvements in palliative care too: \u201cWe had asked for a clause within the bill for a strategy around palliative care. If it does pass we will ask for this to be given greater attention.\u201d",
      "But Prof Sam Ahmedzai, a retired palliative care doctor and former NHS adviser on end-of-life care, said he had been to countries where both systems worked well in parallel with each other - and in some places where assisted dying had been introduced, palliative care had been improved.",
      "He suggests more attention and training could be given to the people who provide the most palliative care \u2013  often GPs, district nurses and hospital doctors working in different departments.",
      "Baroness Ilora Finlay, a leading expert on palliative care, said a \"head of steam\" was building for calls for an independent commission to examine hospice and end of life care. Any commission would be separate from the bill passing through parliament.",
      "The crossbench peer, who opposes the bill, said leading political figures across parties have been involved in discussions about establishing a commission, including former prime ministers Theresa May and Gordon Brown.",
      "\"We need a commission to look at the services people need,\" she added. \"It's just not sustainable that hospices only receive one third of their funding from the NHS, with the rest being made up from cake sales, fun-runs and the like.\""

The number of assisted deaths has also risen substantially over the years.",

Medical assistance in dying (Maid) was introduced in 2016, initially just for the terminally ill.",

It is one of the few countries which allows foreigners access to help to die via organisations like Dignitas, in Zurich. More than 500 Britons have died at Dignitas in the past two decades, including 40 last year. The lethal medication must be self-administered.",
      "The Netherlands and Belgium both legalised assisted dying more than 20 years ago for patients experiencing unbearable suffering from an incurable illness, including mental health issues. It has since been extended to children - the only European countries to allow this. Both allow euthanasia - or physician-assisted dying.",
      "Most recently, Spain and Austria have legalised assisted dying for both terminal illness and intolerable suffering. In Austria, the drugs must be self-administered, whereas in Spain a medical professional can administer them.",
      "Despite the variation, what\u2019s clear is that eligibility for assisted dying is far wider across Europe than is being proposed anywhere in the British Isles. MSPs at Holyrood are to debate a similar bill covering Scotland as that being voted on at Westminster.",
      "A bill to allow terminally ill adult patients to die if they have 12 months or less to live has nearly passed all its stages in the Isle of Man parliament. The legislation is likely to get Royal Assent next year and the first assisted death on the island could happen in 2027. There is a residency requirement of five years. Jersey has also committed to changing the law to allow assisted dying for the terminally ill.",

      "There will be a further \u00a31m for social landlords and the third sector for homelessness prevention work.",
      "Somerville's statement has been viewed by some as an attempt to outmanoeuvre Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, who had vowed to undo some of the cuts from Westminster.",
      "Labour MSPs had called on the Scottish government to use extra UK funding from the Chancellor's Autumn statement to provide universal coverage to pensioners this year.",

      "He also pointed to an increase of \u00a33.4bn in next year\u2019s Scottish Budget.",
      "Meanwhile, Scottish Conservative social security spokeswoman Liz Smith accused ministers of \"hoodwinking\" pensioners by pretending that a full winter fuel payment was being introduced.",

      "Ms Murphy said the action by the Scottish government was welcome, although she said she was concerned about how that would be funded.",
      "But Geoff Mayne, 84, said he believed the UK decision to restrict the benefit in the first place was \"perfectly fair.\"",

      "At Inchgarth Community Centre in Aberdeen Harry Buck, 71, said it was \"a bit of a concern\" that he would get no fuel payment this winter.",
      "\"I don't receive any credits at all so I'll not receive any additional help from the government.",
      "\"I'm probably lucky enough that I can afford my bills just now, so it will still be interesting to see how it goes this year without that wee bit of extra help.\"",

      "Ms Crawford said: \u201cIt would have been absolutely fantastic to be in a position to reinstate the full winter fuel payment for pensioners in Scotland as of now, but we do appreciate that logistically that would just have not been possible.\"",
      "It has been previously reported that up to 40% of eligible pensioners do not apply for Pension Credit.",
      "However, new UK government figures show a spike in claims since Chancellor Rachel Reeves revealed her plans to means test the winter fuel payment.",
      "She announced the move on 29 July. In the 16 weeks since then, about 150,000 Pension Credit applications have been made across the UK \u2013 up by almost 150% compared with the 16 weeks before the chancellor\u2019s statement.",
      "Yet the number of approvals has risen by just 17% over the same period, while refusals almost doubled from 27,100 to 53,100.",
      "That means 81,000 more pensioners have received the extra cash since the summer, out of a possible 880,000 people who the government believes are eligible for the money.",
      "The UK government is urging pensioners to check if they are eligible for the benefit.",
      "Those who apply before 21 December will receive backdated payments of both Pension Credit and the winter fuel allowance.",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions has deployed 500 extra staff to handle claims for the benefit.",
      "This is a significant policy announcement from the Scottish government.",
      "Having said they would match the UK government\u2019s decision to restrict the winter fuel payment to older people in receipt of Pension Credit, they have now decided to do something different.",
      "They\u2019ve found a bit of extra cash to help the neediest households this winter. They are also promising ALL Scottish pensioner households a winter fuel payment of at least \u00a3100 next year, with the poorest pensioners continuing to receive \u00a3200-\u00a3300.",
      "That means many pensioners in Scotland may get a better deal than they would in England, even if that deal is not as good as it used to be across the UK.",
      "The offer is not very different to what Scottish Labour has been demanding, which might seem a bit odd because it was the Labour government at Westminster that started this controversy by making the initial cuts.",

    "story": [
      "Unite is pushing ahead with its legal action against the government in a bid to overturn cuts to the winter fuel payment for millions of pensioners.",
      "The union - one of Labour's biggest funders - claims ministers did not follow correct procedure in their decision to restrict the payments to poorer pensioners.",
      "Sharon Graham, Unite's general secretary, told the BBC \"picking the pockets of pensioners is wrong at every level\".",
      "The government says it cannot comment on the legal action, but it was committed to supporting pensioners.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said the policy, announced in July, is necessary to repair a \"hole\" in the public finances left by the previous government.",
      "Unite union may bring legal action over winter fuel payments",
      "Winter fuel payments cut makes sense, Starmer says",
      "How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it?",
      "Winter fuel payment is a lump-sum amount of \u00a3200 a year for pensioners under 80, increasing to \u00a3300 for over 80s, paid in November or December.",
      "From this winter, it will be restricted to those who qualify for pension credit and other means-tested help, meaning an estimated 10 million pensioners will no longer be eligible to receive it.",
      "Among those are 200,000 Unite members, and the union says it is acting on behalf of retired members struggling to get by.",
      "It says many of them have modest private pensions, making them ineligible for pension credit.",
      "Juliet Jeater is one of 11 Unite members who have joined the union's legal action.",
      "She told the BBC she believed the pension credit threshold was too low, and to qualify for it \"you truly have to be on the breadline\".",
      "Ms Jeater, a retired teacher in her seventies who lives in a Northamptonshire village, said she needed the winter fuel payment to pay for heating her cottage.",
      "In the recent cold snap, she was given scrap wood from a neighbour, who is a scaffolder, to heat her home.",
      "A former Labour member who joined the Green Party, Ms Jeater said she was surprised to find herself better off under the last Conservative government.",
      "She said: \"I feel quite angry about what has happened.",
      "\"Last year when we had a Conservative government, I actually received \u00a3500, which was the winter fuel allowance plus a cost-of-living payment.",
      "\"This year I get nothing.\"",
      "Unite claims the government should have done more to gather evidence on the impact of the cuts before announcing them.",
      "The union threatened to take legal action earlier this month, unless the government cancelled the cuts or produced more evidence for them.",
      "Now, it has instructed lawyers who are asking the High Court for an urgent judicial review of the policy.",
      "The government did undertake a limited \"equality analysis\" of the policy, which was disclosed to MPs last week and revealed an estimated 50,000 people could fall into relative poverty next year as a result of the change.",
      "Ministers say this figure does not take account of its ongoing drive to increase the take-up of pension credit among an estimated 880,000 eligible pensioners not currently claiming it.",
      "But the union says this falls short of a full impact assessment, which would also take the effect on older people\u2019s health into account .",
      "The union has also claimed that the independent Social Security Advisory Committee should have been consulted in advance.",
      "Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall has argued she had to act urgently to bring in the necessary regulations before winter, and to make in-year savings in government spending.",
      "'Not going away'",
      "Ms Graham told the BBC the government had \"brought something in without knowing what it is going to cost in terms of illness, what it is going to cost in terms of death\".",
      "Asked why she was backing potentially costly legal action, she said: \u2018\"What I want is for the courts to hear this quickly, and to say if the proper impact assessment wasn\u2019t done, then actually the government needs to go back to the beginning and in the interim, they need to pay the winter fuel allowance for this year\".",
      "Otherwise, she argued that \"people will not forgive Labour\u2019s decision\".",
      "\"This issue is not going away,\" she added.",
      "Official figures released on Thursday showed there has been a rise in the number of people applying for pension credit since the decision in July to link it to the winter fuel payment.",
      "About 150,000 people applied for the top-up in the 16 weeks following the announcement, compared to 61,300 in the 16 weeks before.",
      "The government has said that it can not comment on ongoing legal action, but that pensions will increase under the \"triple-lock\" uprating policy and that some pensioners will get an additional \u00a3150 warm home discount.",
      "There is no guarantee that taking legal action will stop the cuts.",
      "Government sources seem confident that the policy will not be reversed in the courts.",
      "But Unite\u2019s action once again highlights the controversy over the cuts as winter approaches.",
      "Pressure on the government at Westminster is likely to mount further if the Scottish government were to decide to mitigate the cuts in next week\u2019s budget.",
      "And the cross-party Work and Pensions Committee is to start an inquiry into pensioner poverty - partly prompted by the cuts - in January.",

      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said her party got it \"wrong\" on immigration, leading to a strain on public services and making integration harder.",
      "Badenoch outlined the core principles of Conservative new immigration policy - including re-committing her party to a \"strict numerical cap\" on migration.",
      "The Conservatives spent 14 years in government pledging to reduce the number of people coming to the UK but net migration - the difference between those entering and leaving - hit a record of 745,000 in 2022 before dropping last year to 685,000.",

      "Theresa May admits mistakes over migrant policies",
      "At a hastily called press conference ahead of Thursday\u2019s new migration figures, Badenoch said \"on behalf of the Conservative Party it is right that I, as the new leader, accept responsibility and say truthfully we got it wrong\".",
      "She did not set out what the cap on immigration numbers would be if her party wins the next election.",
      "But she pledged a full review of \"every policy, treaty and part of our legal framework\" including the role of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the Human Rights Act.",
      "The review will also examine migrants' access to benefits. Migrants on visas and asylum seekers in the UK cannot claim welfare benefits or social housing but can apply for access to public funds in certain circumstances.",
      "Under Badenoch, the Conservatives will advocate for tightening access to British Passports and \"zero tolerance\" of foreign criminals staying in the UK, she said.",
      "Challenged on why a numerical cap would work under her leadership when past attempts have not, she said past leaders \"thought stating a number was enough\" and \"hoped things would work out\".",
      "When fully set out, her cap would \"explain how you get to those numbers\".",
      "She also said that the Conservatives still believed that a \"deterrent\" was necessary but did not commit to a revival of the Rwanda scheme scrapped by Labour.",
      "Speaking ahead of publication of the latest net migration figures, Badenoch claimed that any fall in numbers would be due to actions taken by the last Conservative government.",
      "Commenting on Badenoch's speech, Home Office minister Angela Eagle said the new Conservative leader \"offers no new ideas or alternative to her party\u2019s failed policies of the past\".",
      "\u201cThe Conservatives wasted hundreds of millions of pounds in taxpayers\u2019 cash on the Rwanda gimmick, and it\u2019s clear they would do it all over again,\" she said.",
      "Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage said the Conservatives \"broke their promises on immigration after the 2010, 2015, 2017 and 2019 manifestos\".",
      "\u201cWhy on earth would I or anyone else believe them now,\" he added.",
      "In her speech, Badenoch said the UK \"cannot sustain the numbers we have seen\" on immigration.",
      "\"We are reducing the quality of life for people already here because immigration is at a pace too fast to maintain public services, and at a rate where it is next to impossible to integrate those from radically different cultures,\" she said.",
      "\"The ties that bind us start to fray.",
      "\"It doesn't matter whether you are massively for immigration or massively against it, without a shared national identity, our country will suffer.\"",
      "This is not the first time Badenoch has criticised her party's record on immigration.",
      "At her speech at this year's Conservative Party Conference, she blamed the Treasury for pushing immigration up claiming it \"was good for the economy\".",
      "\"But we knew it was not good for our country,\" she told party members.",
      "When the government \"does not grasp the realities\" of immigration \" we know it's time to make a change\", she said."

      "The petition, started by a West Midlands publican who voted Conservative at July's general election, accuses Labour of reneging on its pre-election promises.",
      "It was set up last week and has since been promoted by Reform UK leader Nigel Farage and tech billionaire Elon Musk.",

      "There will not be a vote at the end of the debate, although the government will have to issue a written response because the petition received over 10,000 signatures.",
      "The petition offered Badenoch a way to attack the government at Prime Minister's Questions, as she faced off with Sir Keir for only the third time since becoming Tory leader earlier this month.",
      "She added that rises to employers' National Insurance (NI) at last month's Budget had prompted calls from business that they would have to cut jobs.",
      "The tax increase was not in Labour's election manifesto, but ministers claim it is needed to fill a \"black hole\" in the public finances left by the previous government, and raise money for public services.",
      "\"There's a petition out there, two million people asking him to go,\" she told MPs.",
      "\"He's the one who doesn't know how things work. It is not government that creates growth, it is business,\" she added.",
      "The PM replied: \"She talks about a petition, we had a massive petition on the 4th of July in this country.",
      "\"We spent years taking our party from a party of protest to a party of government, they are hurtling in the opposite direction.\"",
      "Badenoch also challenged the prime minister to repeat a pledge from Chancellor Rachel Reeves not to make further increases to taxes or borrowing after the Budget.",
      "Sir Keir declined to restate the pledge, adding he was \"not going to write the next five years of Budgets\u201d.",
      "And he accused Badenoch of making \"unfunded commitments\" by backing extra spending, whilst not saying whether she would reverse the NI hike if she were in government.",
      "The Conservatives, he told MPs, had \u201cnothing to offer except complaints\u201d.",
      "Those signing online petitions on Parliament's website are asked to tick a box saying they are a British citizen or UK resident, and provide a postcode.",
      "The most popular e-petition ever came in 2019, when one calling for Brexit to be cancelled received 6.1 million signatures.",
      "Three years earlier, a call for a second Brexit referendum garnered 4.2 million names.",
      "The current petition system replaced one run by the Cabinet Office between 2011 and 2015, which in turn replaced a Downing Street website set up under New Labour in 2006.",
      "Almost 1.8 million people backed a petition on the Downing Street website calling on the Blair government to \"scrap the planned vehicle tracking and road pricing policy\"."

      "For the first time in almost a decade, MPs will vote on Friday on giving terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to have an assisted death. While it\u2019s something that remains illegal in most countries, more than 300 million people now live in countries which have legalised assisted dying.",
      "Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Spain and Austria have all introduced assisted dying laws since 2015 \u2013 when UK MPs last voted on the issue \u2013 some allowing assisted death for those who are not terminally ill.",
      "The proposed bill in England and Wales comes with safeguards supporters say will make it the strictest set of rules in the world, with patients needing the approval of a High Court judge. Critics on the other hand say changing the law would be a dangerous step that would place the vulnerable at risk. They argue the focus should be on improving patchy access to palliative care.",

      "Across the US, assisted dying - which some critics prefer to call assisted suicide - is legal in 10 states, as well as in Washington DC. Oregon was one of the first places in the world to offer help to die for some patients, in 1997, and so has more than 25 years\u2019 experience. It has become the model on which other US assisted dying laws have been framed.",
      "In Oregon, assisted dying is open to terminally ill, mentally competent adults expected to die within six months - and must be signed off by two doctors. Since 1997, 4,274 people have received a prescription for a lethal dose of medication - with 2,847 (67%) deaths.",
      "Two thirds of patients in the state who asked for help to die last year had cancer. Around one in 10 had a neurological condition and about the same proportion had heart disease. Of the 367 patients who took a lethal dose of medication last year, the vast majority (91.6%) said loss of autonomy was a key concern, while others cited:",

      "Oregon is important for supporters of assisted dying in England and Wales as they point out it has remained restricted to terminally ill adults since its introduction. However, opponents say some of the rules have been relaxed. A residency requirement has been lifted, which means it is open to people from outside the state. The number of assisted deaths has also risen substantially over the years.",
      "Canada",
      "Canada is the country often cited by opponents of assisted dying as an example of the so-called \"slippery slope\" - a place where assisted dying has been extended and made available to more people since it was first brought in. Medical assistance in dying (Maid) was introduced in 2016, initially just for the terminally ill.",
      "This was amended in 2021 and extended to those experiencing \"unbearable suffering\" from an irreversible illness or disability. It\u2019s still due to become available to those with a mental illness in three years, despite delays.",
      "Critics say the more the law is widened, the more disabled and vulnerable people will be put at risk. There has also been a dramatic growth in the number of people using Maid. Four in 100 deaths in Canada are now medically assisted, compared to about one in 100 in Oregon.",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the MP who proposed the assisted dying bill in Westminster, says the Canadian system is not what is being debated for England and Wales, where eligibility would be restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Europe",
      "Across Europe, six countries have some form of legalised assisted dying: Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Austria. In all of them - unlike the proposals in England and Wales - help to die is not restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Switzerland was the first country in the world to create a \u201cright to die\u201d when it made assisted suicide legal in 1942. It is one of the few countries which allows foreigners access to help to die via organisations like Dignitas, in Zurich. More than 500 Britons have died at Dignitas in the past two decades, including 40 last year. The lethal medication must be self-administered.",
      "The Netherlands and Belgium both legalised assisted dying more than 20 years ago for patients experiencing unbearable suffering from an incurable illness, including mental health issues. It has since been extended to children - the only European countries to allow this. Both allow euthanasia - or physician-assisted dying.",
      "Most recently, Spain and Austria have legalised assisted dying for both terminal illness and intolerable suffering. In Austria, the drugs must be self-administered, whereas in Spain a medical professional can administer them.",
      "Despite the variation, what\u2019s clear is that eligibility for assisted dying is far wider across Europe than is being proposed anywhere in the British Isles. MSPs at Holyrood are to debate a similar bill covering Scotland as that being voted on at Westminster.",
      "A bill to allow terminally ill adult patients to die if they have 12 months or less to live has nearly passed all its stages in the Isle of Man parliament. The legislation is likely to get Royal Assent next year and the first assisted death on the island could happen in 2027. There is a residency requirement of five years. Jersey has also committed to changing the law to allow assisted dying for the terminally ill.",
      "Australia and New Zealand",
      "In the past few years voluntary assisted dying has become legal across most of Australia. While in New Zealand, patients must be terminally ill and expected to die within six months. That is extended to 12 months for those with a neurodegenerative condition in eligible parts of Australia.",
      "In both countries, patients can self-administer the lethal medication. But it can also be administered by a doctor or nurse, usually via an intravenous injection.",

    "title": "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 01:12:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Governments don\u2019t want to tell people they\u2019re going to have to pay more, argues an expert.",
    "story": [
      "It is the perfect start to a holiday: your plane ticket is cheap, your cabin baggage is safely stowed, the engines are roaring into life - and the pilot has announced that there\u2019s no need to worry about the environmental impact.",
      "This is Jet Zero, a vision where air travel is entirely carbon neutral thanks to new technology and green ventures that offset the environmental impact. The plan was drafted in 2022 when Boris Johnson was prime minister, marking a step towards the government\u2019s legal obligation to reach net zero by 2050. The Labour government has since made a similar pledge, and in addition it wants all domestic flights and UK airport operations to reach zero emissions by 2040.",
      "This is no easy feat when you consider the scale of the challenge: one passenger taking an economy-class flight from London to New York generates 309kg of carbon dioxide, which would take roughly a year to absorb via 10 mature trees.",
      "Multiply this on the global scale and the aviation industry would need to plant roughly 100 billion mature trees each year to offset its emissions. For UK emissions alone you\u2019d need a forest almost the size of Wales.",
      "So, just how realistic is the plan to hit Jet Zero by 2050? And what is the knock-on cost for passengers?",
      "Earlier this year, Anthony Browne, who was the aviation minister in the Conservative government at the time, said that he thought any increase in ticket prices would be \u201cmarginal\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe don't think the difference will be noticeable to most consumers,\u201d he said.",
      "But some experts claim that politicians are not being realistic. Sir Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, argues that there \u201cdefinitely would be higher cost\u201d.",
      "\u201cGovernments desperately don\u2019t want to tell people they\u2019re going to have to pay for what they do.\u201d",
      "But ultimately, the cost depends on which methods are employed to cut or reduce emissions.",
      "From sharklets to UltraFans",
      "The previous government said that it aimed reach Jet Zero by focusing on \"the rapid development of technologies\u201d, as well as operational improvements and - among other things - more sustainable fuel types.",
      "This is not an entirely new quest. Aircraft around the world have been steadily getting cleaner since 1969 when the first high-bypass turbofan engines were used on the new Boeing 747 aircraft. In the years since there have been other innovations including sharklets, or upturned wing tips on modern planes that reduce drag and save, on average, 4% of fuel per trip.",
      "More developments are in the pipeline, including a new type of jet engine, developed by Rolls Royce, called the \u201cUltraFan\u201d, which will reduce average fuel consumption by 10%.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s a gearbox, the turbine can run very fast, much more efficiently, the fan can run slower and be much bigger,\u201c explains Simon Burr, a director at Rolls-Royce.",
      "The problem is that, though it was first tested in 2023, it\u2019s unlikely to be available on commercial aircraft until the 2030s because of production lead times - and even then, a 10% improvement is impressive but not a game changer.",
      "Aviation\u2019s CO2 emissions come primarily through jet engines using carbon-rich fossil fuels, which produce CO2 when burned, so there have been attempts to create an alternative type made from renewable biomass and waste resources, known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).",
      "The first SAF flight ran between London and Amsterdam in 2008 using fuel derived from a mixture of Brazilian babassu nuts and coconuts.",
      "Now the British government says that 22% of all jet fuel from UK aviation has to come from sustainable sources by 2040. But this comes with further challenges.",
      "In the UK, SAF is mainly made from cooking oil, some of which is shipped from Asia, and shipping is responsible for 2% of global CO2 emissions.",
      "Alternative methods of creating SAF require large quantities of electricity as part of the manufacturing process. This would involve a vast amount of renewable energy to make it sustainable.",
      "\"It's very hard, to think there is such a thing as a sustainable aviation fuel,\u201d says Sir Dieter Helm. \u201cThere are aviation fuels that are less polluting than the ones being used at the moment, and you can use elements of biofuel and chip fat and so on.",
      "\"Think about the scale that's required to do it.\u201d",
      "Remapping the sky",
      "There is another more unexpected way that airlines could reduce emissions. That is, making their flight paths more direct to reduce fuel consumption.",
      "Currently most planes fly on routes determined by a network of beacons, many of which were put in place decades ago. As a result they don\u2019t always fly by the shortest route, but \"airspace modernisation\", as it is known, will allow for straighter paths to destinations.",
      "Satellite technology is required to do this: aircraft flying over the Atlantic used to have to fly at least 40 miles apart, but the satellite technology means that aircraft can in theory fly as close as 14 miles apart, allowing more aircraft to fly on the direct flight paths.",
      "The Jet Zero Strategy estimates that this, together with other fuel efficiency improvements, could cut emissions by as much as 15% by 2050.",
      "But the National Air Traffic Services (NATS), which control most flights in and out of England and Wales, caution that these changes are neither easy nor quick. \u201cIt's a very, very complicated thing to do,\u201d warns Chris Norsworthy, director of future planning.",
      "\u201cThe national infrastructure change of this type takes many years. The deployments we've made already are years in the making.\u201d",
      "The electric plane race",
      "Hidden away in a mini aircraft hangar of sorts, just outside Bristol, inventor Stephen Fitzpatrick has spent seven years working on a pioneering aircraft that could be the basis of another solution. His carbon fibre creation, known as VX4, has eight propellers and looks like a giant drone, but what's crucial is that it doesn\u2019t use fuel. Instead it is powered by lithium-ion batteries similar to those in electric cars.",
      "The batteries alone weigh 800kg, which brings the first challenge: the sheer weight limits how far it can fly.",
      "Mr Fitzpatrick says the VX4 will have a range of around 100 miles to begin with. \u201cEach year the batteries that we use will improve... Over time, we\u2019ll be able to develop a hybrid powertrain, probably using hydrogen fuel cells and batteries, and that will increase the range further.\u201d",
      "The prospect of replacing jet engine-powered long-haul flights is, however, remote. \u201cThere is no battery chemistry in the world that will give us the energy we need to take hundreds of passengers over the Atlantic,\u201d he concedes.",
      "Harnessing hydrogen in other ways may be a better bet.",
      "The British-American aircraft company, ZeroAvia, says it expects to have an 80-seater powered entirely by hydrogen in the air within two to three years. Airbus is developing something similar.",
      "Both are propeller planes, however, with limited speeds and ranges.",
      "The pricetag for passengers",
      "The reductions from SAF, fuel efficiency improvements and zero carbon aircraft will only cut aviation emissions by around a third, according to the previous government's estimates. So another part of the Jet Zero strategy involves a pricing scheme to charge airlines for CO2 emissions and carbon offsetting.",
      "Airlines already pay a duty for each flight someone takes in the UK, a cost that is passed to passengers. In much of the UK (excluding Scotland) this adds \u00a37 to each domestic flight, \u00a314 to short-haul ones and \u00a392 for long-haul. But carbon offsetting means paying another fee.",
      "Some schemes have been highly controversial, with questions around how to prove how many trees have been prevented from being cut down.",
      "Cait Hewitt, policy director at the Aviation Environment Federation, is concerned that the current informal offsetting projects may be counterproductive: \u201cThey could actually have made that problem a bit worse over time by giving consumers the false impression that the emissions from their flight [are] being cancelled out somehow by an offset.\u201d",
      "The Lebanon ceasefire is a respite, not a solution for the Middle East",
      "How service charges in flats spiralled out of control",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "Duncan McCourt, chief executive of Sustainable Aviation, an umbrella group for UK airlines, airports, manufacturers and others in the business, is optimistic that removing carbon from flying won\u2019t add much more than a few pounds to the cost of an airline ticket.",
      "\u201cWe think we can do it while enabling people to continue to fly and continue to get that benefit of flying, such as connecting people, such as being able to go on holiday,\u201d he says.",
      "But the Jet Zero plan says nothing directly about the knock-on cost to passengers. Instead, it refers to \u201cdemand management\u201d.",
      "Sir Dieter Helm has his own take on what Jet Zero means for holidaymakers and fully believes that it will lead to higher costs. As for the likelihood of the government hitting its Jet Zero target on time, he is unconvinced of this too, but he also suggests that this may not be the point.",
      "\u201cIt depends whether you think Jet Zero is\u2026 genuinely a target and they mean to achieve it. I'm really sceptical about the second.\u201d",
      "And now, the number of flights taken annually by people in the UK is projected to rise even further, translating into an additional 150 million more flights a year. So the scale of the government's challenge, which was large enough when it began, is only set to grow.",

      "The most popular mobile games in the UK are being advertised without disclosing they contain loot boxes - random in-game purchases which critics say are \"exploitative\" and \"foster addiction\".",
      "The regulator, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), says it bans and removes ads which fail to make the clear whether or not a game contains a loot box.",
      "But a BBC investigation found only two of the top 45 highest-grossing games on the Google Play store actually followed those rules.",
      "Dr Jane Rigbye, chief executive of Young Gamers & Gamblers Education Trust (Ygam), called the findings \"deeply concerning\".",
      "\"In the absence of robust regulation in gaming, it is essential for games to provide clear and transparent information about their features, allowing both parents and gamers to make informed decisions,\" she said.",
      "In a statement, the ASA said: \"This is an ongoing area of our work, and we\u2019re closely monitoring the sector to discover the scale of compliance and act accordingly.\"",

      "\"The ASA, although it has upheld some complaints, it takes so long to properly process all of these things - they will go to a company and say, 'you should comply', but they don't comply,\" said Leon Y  Xiao, a video game regulation researcher at the IT University of Copenhagen.",
      "\"People are walking into a video game not knowing the potential risks, and this is assuming that people have even understood the risk of loot boxes to begin with.\"",
      "What is a loot box?",
      "Loot boxes contain random digital items that gamers can only reveal through gameplay or - more controversially - by making a payment.",
      "Game-makers have previously defended them as being akin to a chocolate egg containing a plastic toy, with children not knowing exactly what they are getting until the egg is bought and opened.",
      "But critics say they are in fact a form of gambling, with a report in 2022 by the Norwegian Consumer Council concluding they \"often involve exploiting consumers through predatory mechanisms, fostering addiction, targeting vulnerable consumer groups and more.\"",
      "The same year, the UK government resisted pressure to regulate loot boxes, saying the video game industry could self-regulate instead.",
      "Trade body Ukie published guidance in July 2023, including the requirement to disclose loot boxes prior to games being purchased, which the industry was given a year to comply with.",
      "But, more than 12 months later, the BBC has discovered the vast majority of major mobile games containing loot boxes are still flouting the rules, with most games only disclosing their presence if would-be players tap a small information button on the Play Store.",
      "Adrian Hon, head of game developer Six to Start, said the games industry had a track record of \"conveniently ignoring or forgetting regulations that might interfere with their ability to sell to players\".",
      "\"We know that many people, including children, struggle with overspending on loot boxes,\" he said, adding they were deliberately designed to be \"habit-forming\".",
      "\"The least that games companies could do is disclose the presence of loot boxes, but they won't even do that - it's an indictment of their priorities and lack of care towards vulnerable players.\"",
      "Non-compliance",
      "The BBC checked the adverts for the top 45 highest grossing games on Google's Play Store, which along with Apple's App Store are where the vast majority of people access mobile games.",
      "Of those 45, 26 were labelled as including loot boxes - 22 of which were being actively advertised at the same time.",
      "However, only two of those titles spelt out the presence of the loot boxes in their ads.",
      "The highest-grossing game on the Play Store to contain loot boxes, Monopoly GO, was among those not to mention random in-game purchases in its adverts.",
      "The game has been downloaded more than 50 million times, generating more than $3bn (\u00a32.37bn) in revenue according to the IP's owner Hasbro.",
      "Mr Xiao told the BBC the findings were in line with preliminary results of his own research, which has also found around 90% of games containing loot boxes are not disclosing this in their ads.",
      "The BBC has approached Hasbro, Meta and the ASA for comment.",

    "story": [
      "One of the innovations at this year's Paris Olympics was supposed to be an electric flying taxi service.",
      "Germany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.",
      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "But the company has been through financial challenges and recently agreed a rescue deal with its biggest creditor, US based Mudrick Capital.",
      "Under the deal, Mudrick will invest up to $50m in Verticial , meanwhile $130m of loans from Mudrick will be converted into shares.",
      "That will leave the US investment firm with a 70% stake in Vertical, while Mr Fitzpatrick's stake falls from 70% to 20%.",
      "\"This comprehensive deal - alongside the recent piloted flight campaign...  means Vertical is positioned to be a winner in one of the 21st century\u2019s most exciting technologies,\" Mr Fitzpatrick said in a statement accompanying the deal.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",
      "Given all the uncertainty and expense, you might wonder why investors put money into new electric aircraft in the first place.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 00:05:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Thermal imaging tech has become cheaper and homeowners are using it to track down heat loss.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s like X-ray vision \u2013 for heat loss. Last year, web engineer Jamie Matthews bought a thermal imaging camera. His home, in the southeast of England, was about to give up some of its secrets.",
      "The colourful images on the device\u2019s small screen soon revealed how his loft hatch was letting him down.",
      "\u201cThat was really obvious on the camera,\u201d he says, explaining that he could see cool areas on the hatch, where heat was apparently escaping.",
      "Mr Mathews, who runs a software company that supplies the clean tech industry, also found some other small gaps in external walls and parts of his roof that appeared less well insulated than others.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good fun and it certainly shows up things that may not be immediately obvious,\u201d he says.",
      "While Mr Matthews was able to draught-proof some areas himself, he says he would take a more methodical approach if he were planning any major changes to his home. The web engineer later had a professional heat loss survey carried out when he installed a heat pump, for example.",
      "That approach is sensible, according to building physics researchers who spoke to the BBC. There are signs that thermal cameras are becoming more popular, as homeowners seek to slash their heating bills and carbon emissions. Local councils are increasingly allowing residents to borrow the devices for free, for example.",
      "But there is no substitute for professional advice if you are planning big works or interventions, experts say.",
      "Thermal cameras work by using a sensor to detect infrared light, which we cannot see, but which we can sometimes feel as heat. Such devices aren\u2019t cheap. Mr Matthews spent roughly \u00a3160 on his, though organisations including local councils and energy supplier Octopus Energy do loan them out to people free of charge so that they can gain a basic understanding of heat loss in their homes.",
      "Wiltshire Council recently made 11 devices available to borrow from local libraries, as well as a brief guide on how to use them. There has been \u201chuge uptake\u201d says Cllr Ian Blair-Pilling, such that the council now has a waiting list for interested residents.",
      "\"Expert advice, combined with a measured approach to the findings from thermal imaging, will give residents the best chance of making informed decisions about energy-saving home improvements,\" says Cllr Blair-Pilling.",
      "Small interventions could help people keep their homes warm and reduce the risk of cold-related health conditions, he adds.",
      "However, Jo Atkinson, senior consultant in buildings decarbonisation at Energy Systems Catapult, a research organisation, expresses concern over the growing availability of thermal cameras: \u201cIn my opinion, the risks are too great for making the wrong choices.\u201d",
      "It is possible to misinterpret thermal camera images, she says, noting that if a wall has been warmed by the sun, an image of that wall taken outside could make it look as though heat is escaping, when it is not. Reflective surfaces can also appear, misleadingly, to be leaking heat.",
      "While using a thermal camera as a starting point for understanding your home is \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d, according to Ronita Bardhan at the University of Cambridge, it is important to ask for independent expert advice when planning any renovation works.",
      "Thermal camera imagery can make it look as though some areas of your home are losing a lot of heat, but this might simply be a result of how the camera has been calibrated, how the user holds it and moves it around, and which colour palette was chosen for the display.",
      "Dr Bardhan adds that there is a risk of triggering \u201cretrofit anxiety\u201d in homeowners.",
      "Plus, if people go on to alter their insulation, for example, such measures should be taken with great care as improper installation can cause damp and mould.",
      "North Somerset Council provides thermal cameras to residents, on loan, and this scheme is also currently operating on a waiting list basis due to its popularity. The Council has published introductory advice on how to use the cameras, including an online video.",
      "The Centre for Sustainable Energy (CSE), a charity, highlights a more detailed guide from the National House-Building Council, which describes how to use thermal cameras. However, a CSE spokeswoman adds that the organisation still recommends people seek expert advice.",
      "Phil Steele, future technologies evangelist at Octopus Energy, agrees: \u201cYou have got to be careful.\u201d Thermal cameras can, for instance, make the corners of rooms look very cold but this is simply a reflection of reduced air circulation in those areas, rather than an insulation problem, he explains.",
      "Octopus Energy has around 500 cameras that it loans out to customers every winter. Last year, the firm distributed the devices roughly 3,800 times.",
      "Thermal camera-wielding homeowners who have spoken to the BBC, such as Mr Matthews, say they have treated the imagery with caution.",
      "Louise Green, a designer in London, says she read online training materials before using a thermal camera to search for points of heat loss in a house shortly after she and her partner moved in.",
      "In her case, Miss Green rented the camera from Library of Things, a community-focused organisation that makes various items available for people to borrow. The device indicated loss of heat around windows and doors in Miss Green\u2019s home. She and her partner were able to compare the results to their neighbour\u2019s better-insulated property.",
      "\u201cIt just confirmed what we knew already, but it was still interesting to see, you know, were there any other areas?\u201d she explains.",
      "Darrell Taylor at Flir, a firm that makes thermal cameras, says that members of the public can access some free training materials on his company\u2019s website.",
      "He adds that Flir aims to make thermal images as clear and easy to interpret as possible \u2013 including by merging optical imagery with thermal imagery, to add more detail to the final picture. And he suggests that, in the future, Flir cameras may offer machine learning-based instructions and advice as people use the devices.",
      "Those who know how best to interpret thermal camera imagery can find extraordinary hidden problems in a building, though.",
      "Dr Bardhan recently took a very high resolution camera to a viewing of a house she was considering buying. But the thermal images revealed cracks in a wall, which later proved to be signs of subsidence.",
      "\u201cThat would probably not have been exposed unless I had gone in and seen it,\u201d she says. Dr Bardhan decided not to make an offer on the property.",

    "summary": "The country's president has already shown he is prepared to go to brutal lengths to save his regime.",
    "story": [
      "The reignited war in Syria is the latest fallout from the turmoil that has gripped the Middle East since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October last year.",
      "The attacks, and Israel\u2019s response, upended the status quo. Events in Syria in the last few days are more proof that the war gripping the Middle East is escalating, not subsiding.",
      "During a decade of war after 2011, Bashar al-Assad\u2019s rule survived because he was prepared to break Syria to save the regime he had inherited from his father.",
      "To do that he relied on powerful allies, Russia, Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah. They intervened on his side against rebel groups that ranged from the jihadist extremists of Islamic State to militias supported by the US and the rich Gulf monarchies.",
      "Now Iran is reeling from severe blows inflicted by Israel, with US support, on its security in the Middle East. Its ally Hezbollah, which used to send its best men to fight for the Assad regime in Syria, has been crippled by Israel\u2019s attacks. Russia has launched air strikes in the last few days against the rebel offensive in Syria \u2013 but its military power is almost entirely earmarked to fight the war in Ukraine.",
      "The war in Syria did not end. It dropped out of the place it used to occupy in headline news, partly because of turbulence across the Middle East and beyond, and because it is almost impossible for journalists to get into the country.",
      "In places the war was suspended, or frozen, but Syria is full of unfinished business.",
      "The Assad regime has never regained the power it had used to control Syria before 2011, the year of the Arab uprisings, though it still kept a gulag of Syrian prisoners in its jails.",
      "Even so, until the last few days, the regime of President Bashar al-Assad controlled the major cities, their surrounding countryside and the main highways connecting them.",
      "Now a coalition of rebel groups, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), has broken out of Idlib, the province along the border with Turkey that it controls, and in only a few days since 27 November swept away Syrian troops in a series of \"astonishing\" events, as one senior international diplomat told me.",
      "Two days into the offensive, they were posting photos of fighters who had taken the ancient citadel of Aleppo, which had been an impregnable base for government troops between 2012 and 2015, when the city was divided between rebels and regime forces.",
      "The atmosphere in Aleppo seems calm after the rout of government troops. One photo on social media showed uniformed and armed rebel fighters queuing for fried chicken at a fast-food outlet.",
      "HTS has roots in al-Qaeda, though it broke with the group in 2016 and at times has fought its rump loyalists. But HTS is still designated as a terrorist group by the UN Security Council and countries including the US, the European Union, Turkey and the UK.  (The Syrian regime calls all its opponents terrorists.)",
      "The leader of HTS, Abu Mohammad al-Jawlani, has a long history as a jihadist leader in Iraq and Syria. In recent years, though, he has moved away from strict jihadist ideology to try to broaden the appeal of his group.",
      "The rebranding is also being used to attract support for the offensive, which HTS calls Operation Repelling the Aggression. That name, and its official announcements, avoid jihadist language and Islamist references.",
      "Neutral language, according to Mina al-Lami, the jihadist media specialist at BBC Monitoring, is designed to distance what\u2019s happening from the jihadist past of HTS and present the offensive as a joint rebel enterprise against the regime.",
      "Syrians are generally repelled by extreme religious rhetoric. As jihadist groups came to dominate the rebellion after pro-democracy demonstrations were crushed after the first year or so of war after 2011, many Syrians either stayed neutral or sided reluctantly with the regime because they feared the murderous jihadist ideology of Islamic State.",
      "The offensive led by HTS comes out of the splintered political landscape of northern Syria. Much of the north-east is controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a group led by Kurds and supported by the United States, which stations around 900 troops in the area.",
      "Turkey is a big player, controlling borderlands where it has deployed its own regular troops as well as the militias it sponsors. Sleeper cells drawn from the remnants of Islamic State sometimes mount deadly ambushes on roads through the Syrian desert.",
      "Reports from Syria say that the rebel forces have captured significant supplies of military equipment, including helicopters, and are pressing on towards Hama, the next significant city on the road to Damascus.",
      "Without a doubt the regime and its allies will be working to steady themselves and to hit back, especially with air power. The rebels do not have an air force, though in another sign of the way that unmanned aerial vehicles are revolutionising warfare, there are reports that they used a drone to kill a senior regime intelligence official.",
      "The renewed fighting in Syria is causing international alarm. The UN envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, issued a statement saying that \"the latest developments pose severe risks to civilians and have serious implications for regional and international security\u2026 No Syrian party or existing group of actors can resolve the Syrian conflict via military means\".",
      "Pedersen added that there had been \"a collective failure to bring about a genuine political process\" to implement UN Security Council resolution 2254, which was passed in 2015. That laid out a roadmap for peace, with the principle in the text that \u201cthe Syrian people will decide the future of Syria\u201d.",
      "The objective was a future shaped by free elections and a new constitution. But that meant Assad and his family giving up a country that they treated for years as their personal fief. More than half a million dead attest to their determination not to let that happen.",
      "It is too soon to write the Assad regime off. It has a core of genuine support. Some Syrians see it as the least bad option \u2013 better than the jihadists who came to dominate the rebellion. But if other anti-Assad groups \u2013 and there are many \u2013 rise up, his regime will once again be in mortal danger.",

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 16:10:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Two years of negotiations to reduce global plastic production have collapsed amid a split between countries.",
    "story": [
      "Countries have failed to reach a landmark agreement on tackling plastic pollution after more than two years of negotiations.",
      "More than 200 nations met in South Korea for what was meant to be a final round of talks.",
      "But deep divisions remained between a group of nearly 100 \"high ambition\" countries calling for plastic to be phased out and oil-producing nations who warned this would affect the world's development.",
      "\"The objective of this treaty is to end plastic pollution not plastic itself, plastic has brought immense benefit to societies worldwide,\" said the Kuwait negotiators in the final hours.",
      "In 2022, the world's nations agreed that a global treaty was needed to tackle the issue of plastic pollution particularly the impacts on the marine environment - and this should be completed within two years given the urgency of the issue.",
      "Since 1950, more than eight billion tonnes of plastic have been produced globally but less than 10% has been recycled, estimates the United Nations.",
      "This has led to millions of tonnes entering the world's oceans and seas, posing serious risks to wildlife and their environment. Birds, fish and whales can become injured or killed if they become entangled in plastic debris or mistakenly ingest it, leading to starvation.",
      "Plastic is also produced from fossil fuels, and is currently estimated to be responsible for 5% of global emissions - so efforts to restrict it could also help with efforts to tackle climate change.",
      "The meeting in Busan, South Korea, was meant to be the final fifth round of negotiations but after late night talks countries were unable to resolve their differences missing their key two-year deadline.",
      "\"A few critical issues prevent us from reaching a comprehensive agreement,\" said the talks' chair Luis Vayas Valdivieso on Sunday - the final day of talks.",
      "Although many issues are being discussed the key split is around Article 6 - whether there should be a commitment to cutting how much plastic is produced, or just try and reduce plastic waste by increasing efforts to recycle.",
      "Oceans littered with 171 trillion plastic pieces",
      "Plastic waste 'building up' in Arctic",
      "Hermit crabs are 'wearing' our plastic rubbish",
      "A group of 95 countries have emerged, including the UK, European Union, African Group and many South American nations, who are calling for Article 6 to be a legally binding pledge to reduce production levels.",
      "\"We carry the weight of expectations of our citizens who are counting on us to protect them and the environment to protect it from the plastic pollution crisis,\" said Camila Zepeda, Mexico's chief negotiator, who spoke on behalf of this group at the final meeting.",
      "\"We must do everything in our power to meet this expectation.\"",
      "Her speech was meet with strong applause across the room, but a group of oil-producing nations including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait and Russia pushed back strongly.",
      "The demand for oil across most sectors is expected to fall from 2026 as countries move to cleaner technologies like electric vehicles - but plastic is seen as one of the remaining growth markets. This may explain why these countries are particularly concerned about any global target to cut production levels.",
      "\"Attempting to phase out plastic rather than addressing the issue of plastic production risks undermining global progress and exacerbating economic inequality,\" said Salman Alajmi, a Kuwait delegate.",
      "India also voiced its concerns with including any commitments to cut production of plastic on the basis it could impact its right to development.",
      "Environmental charities and scientists expressed their deep disappointment that the talks had collapsed and raised concerns about the influence of the fossil fuel industry.",
      "InfluenceMap, a think tank, found that the petrochemical industry intervened dozens of times on the treaty via company statements, social media and consultation responses, and 93% of those were unsupportive of efforts to cut production levels.",
      "But the report did highlight that these efforts were outweighed by positive support from key manufacturers of plastic products like Unilever, Mars and Nestl\u00e9 who want consistent global regulation on the issue.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 00:08:43 GMT",
    "summary": "After days of demonstrations and public resignations, Georgia's prime minister rejects a call for new elections.",
    "story": [
      "Georgia has seen a fourth night of street demonstrations and a string of public resignations, triggered by the ruling party's decision to suspend a push to start talks on joining the European Union.",
      "As tens of thousands of Georgians headed back to the streets of several cities, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said they had fallen victim to opposition lies and he rejected calls for new elections.",
      "He confirmed reports that Georgia's ambassador to the US, David Zalkaliani, had become the latest senior diplomat to stand down, explaining that he had come under considerable pressure.",
      "But Kobakhidze sought to deny the reason for the protests, saying on Sunday that \"we have not suspended anything, it's a lie\".",
      "Only three days before, his party Georgian Dream had accused the EU of using talks on joining the union as \"blackmail\" and said the government had decided not to put that issue on the agenda until the end of 2028.",
      "Pro-EU protesters were out in big numbers again on Sunday night, and when fireworks were aimed at the parliament building as well as riot police, the police responded with water cannon. Large groups of riot police huddled in side streets beside parliament, and it was not until late into the night that reports emerged of clashes with demonstrators.",
      "Georgia's increasingly authoritarian government has been accused by the EU and US of democratic backsliding. On Saturday, the US took the significant step of suspending its strategic partnership with Georgia.",
      "Kobakhidze insisted that Georgian Dream was still \"committed to European integration... and we are continuing on our path to the European dream\".",
      "And yet an increasing array of public officials do not appear to believe that is the case. Several ambassadors have resigned, and hundreds of civil servants and more than 3,000 teachers have signed letters condemning the decision to put EU accession on hold.",
      "Many Georgians have been shocked by the level of violence directed at Georgian journalists as well as protesters. Dozens of reporters have been beaten or pepper sprayed and some have needed hospital treatment.",
      "Georgia's human rights ombudsman Levan Ioseliani said \"this is brutality\", and he appealed to police not to abuse their power.",
      "The prime minister said it was opposition groups and not the police that had meted out \"systemic violence\".",
      "Georgian ex-ambassador to the EU Natalie Sabanadze, now at Chatham House in the UK, believes the level of violence, the string of resignations and civil disobedience indicate a \"qualitative change\" to the protests now taking place.",
      "\"Maybe [the government] thought people would be scared, but it's not working out like this,\" she told the BBC. \"Yesterday civil society activists and artists went to the public broadcaster and took it over and forced their way into the live stream. I've seen this before, in pre-revolutionary Georgia [in 2003].\"",
      "Georgia's pro-Western president, Salome Zourabichvili, is due to step down in a matter of weeks, however since last month's contested parliamentary elections which opposition parties have denounced as rigged, she has become a powerful figurehead, rallying protesters against the government and calling for a new vote.",
      "She and the protesters accuse the government of aiming to drag their country back into Russia's sphere of influence, even though an overwhelming majority of the population backs joining the EU.",
      "Georgia has a population of some 3.7 million and 20% of its territory is under Russian military occupation in two breakaway regions.",
      "During the day on Sunday, a small group of protesters occupied a traffic intersection during the day on Sunday in front of Tbilisi State University.",
      "\"I'm here for my country's future and the future of my three-year-old son,\" said one protester called Salome, aged 29. \"I don't want him to spend his life at protests and I don't want a Russian government.\"",
      "While Georgian Dream flatly denies any links to the Kremlin, it has in the past year adopted Russian-style laws that target civil society groups with funding from abroad as well as LGBT rights.",
      "Half an hour's walk away from the daylight protest, a small army of cleaners was trying to scrub off graffiti from a wall in front of the Georgian parliament.",
      "Some of the windows of the building were smashed on Saturday night, and an effigy was set alight of Bidzina Ivanishvili, the billionaire seen as the driving force behind Georgian Dream's 12 years in power.",
      "The question now is what will happen next in Georgia's deepening political and constitutional crisis.",
      "The Georgian Dream government's relations with its Western partners are very badly damaged.",
      "The EU's new foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, warned on Sunday that the government's actions would \"have direct consequences from EU side\", and the US decision to suspend its strategic partnership will also be widely felt.",
      "The Georgian prime minister had little time for the president or her call for new elections.",
      "\"Mrs Salome Zourabichvili has four Fridays left [as president] and she can't get used to it. I understand her emotional state, but of course on 29 December she'll have to leave.\"",

    "title": "She fled Israeli bombing four times. It still found her",
    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 22:01:06 GMT",
    "summary": "Rihab Faour's long journey to safety, from her small village in southern Lebanon, ended in the death of her young family.",
    "story": [
      "Rihab Faour fled her home. Then she fled again. Then a third time. Then a fourth. And by the fourth time, a year after the first, she had been fleeing Israeli bombs for so long that nowhere in Lebanon felt safe.",
      "Her journey had begun in October 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel. That prompted Hezbollah, the Lebanese political and militant group, to fire rockets into Israel and Israel to retaliate by bombing southern Lebanon.",
      "The Israeli bombs fell close enough to Rihab\u2019s village that the 33-year-old and her husband Saeed, an employee of the municipal water company, gathered their daughters Tia, eight, and Naya, six, and fled to Rihab\u2019s parents\u2019 house in Dahieh, a  suburb of the capital Beirut.",
      "In Dahieh, for a while, life went on almost as normal, with the exception that Naya and Tia missed their friends, their own beds, their toys and all clothes they had had to leave behind.",
      "Most of all they missed going to school, which had been replaced by online learning. They were excited when, back in August, Rihab enrolled them in a new school in Beirut and took them to buy brand new school uniforms.",
      "But before their first day could arrive, Israel expanded its bombing of Lebanon to include parts of Beirut, particularly the Dahieh suburb that the family now called home.",
      "Israel was assassinating senior Hezbollah figures in the suburb, but it was using large, bunker-busting bombs, each capable of destroying a residential building. In some strikes, Israel dropped dozens of these bombs in one go and flattened entire city blocks.",
      "So the Faour family packed up and fled again, this time to a rented house in another Beirut neighbourhood, Jnah. After a powerful air strike in Jnah, they moved to Saeed\u2019s parents\u2019 house in the neighbourhood of Barbour. There, they lived with 17 others in a single house - people piled on people.",
      "For Tia and Naya though, now nine and seven, it was a rare joy to be surrounded by their cousins day and night. So much so that even when Rihab\u2019s father, a retired Lebanese army sergeant, found a rental apartment in the Basta neighbourhood just for the four of them, the girls did not want to go.",
      "\u201cNaya begged us to stay there with all the family,\u201d Rihab recalled. \u201cWe told her we  just had to go for one sleep in this new house, then we would come straight back to the family and to all the children.\u201d",
      "And she offered the girls a bargain - come to stay at the new apartment and you can choose your dinner. So on the way home they stopped for rotisserie chicken and other treats from the shop, and at about 7.30pm, with the streets still alive with people, the family pulled up to a rundown building in Basta in central Beirut.",
      "Back in 2006, during the previous war between Israel and Hezbollah, the bombing was confined to certain areas of Lebanon - the south, Dahieh, and some infrastructure targets. This time, as senior members of Hezbollah spread out around the country, Israel bombed them where they went.",
      "This brought bombs to places previously thought safe, including parts of central Beirut.",
      "None of that was weighing on Tia and Naya as the family unloaded their belongings into the new apartment. For now, the girls were more concerned with returning to their cousins at the earliest opportunity.",
      "Unlike Saeed's parents' house, the new Basta apartment had running water and a generator for electricity. The girls were happy when they saw that the family finally had their own space. Rihab and Saeed relaxed a little. Most likely, there would have been an Israeli drone buzzing overhead, but the sound had become so common over Beirut that it was possible to tune it out.",
      "Rihab put the food and treats on the table. \u201cWe sat down to eat and we were talking and laughing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that was it, my last memory of them.\u201d",
      "The bomb was a US-made Jdam. It hit the building on 10 October at about 8pm, half an hour after the family had arrived. It levelled all three storeys and destroyed parts of adjacent buildings and cars, and killed 22 men, women and children, making it the deadliest strike on central Beirut since the beginning of the fighting a year earlier.",
      "The Israeli military issued no warning ahead of the strike, so the building was full of people. Israel was reportedly targeting Wafiq Safa, the head of Hezbollah\u2019s co-ordination and liaison unit, but Safa was never reported to be among the dead. He had either survived, or he wasn't there to begin with. The IDF declined to comment on the strike or the lack of a warning ahead of it.",
      "Rihab woke up in Beirut\u2019s Zahraa Hospital, unable to move. Her back and arm were badly injured and she needed at least two operations. She drifted in and out of consciousness. Everything in her mind between laughing with her daughters at dinner and waking up in the hospital was blank.",
      "While she lay there that night, her family searched Beirut\u2019s hospitals. By midnight, they knew that Saeed and Tia were dead. DNA tests would be required to confirm that Naya had been killed, as well as another girl her age brought to the same hospital, because their injuries prevented straightforward identification.",
      "Rihab\u2019s doctors advised the family not to tell her any of this. They were worried that, still facing significant surgery, the news would be too much for her. So for two weeks, as she underwent and then recovered from her operations, her mother Basima reassured her that Saeed and the girls were being treated in different hospitals.",
      "But Rihab sensed that something was wrong, and she began to insist on seeing pictures and videos of the girls. \u201cShe could feel it in her heart,\u201d Basima said.",
      "Eleven days after the strike, the DNA test confirmed that Tia was dead, and on the 15th day a hospital psychiatrist told Rihab that Saeed and the girls were gone.",
      "Six weeks later, Rihab was sitting in a stiff plastic chair in an apartment in Beirut, her eyes dark and her face drawn. She was still recovering from her surgeries - to install eight screws into her spine and another three into her arm. She had been lying down for a long time, and now she was trying to sit up more and to walk a little, though every movement caused her pain.",
      "Naya\u2019s eighth birthday had been four days earlier. Rihab was passing her time \u201ceither crying or sleeping\u201d, she said. But she wanted to talk about her family.",
      "\u201cNaya was very attached to me, she followed me wherever I went. Tia loved her grandparents and she was happy if I left her with them. Both of the girls loved drawing, they loved playing with toys, they missed going to school. They would play teacher and student together for hours.\u201d",
      "Above all they loved to watch videos together on TikTok. Rihab and Saeed thought they were still too young to post their own videos online, so Rihab would film them dancing and playing and tell the girls she was posting them on the app, which seemed to satisfy them, for now.",
      "Saeed had come into Rihab\u2019s life in 2013. Rihab was raised in Beirut but her family would visit the village of Mays El Jabal in the summer, because the air was cooler there and the village was surrounded by countryside, and that summer she met Saeed through mutual friends.",
      "Rihab completed her undergraduate law degree and began studying for a masters, but the couple became engaged and then married, and soon Tia was born, so Rihab put her budding law career on hold.",
      "Now, in the midst of her loss, she has tentatively begun to think of studying again. \u201cI am going to need something to fill my days,\u201d she said.",
      "Saeed and Tia were buried the day after they died, by Rihab\u2019s father and uncles, in temporary wooden caskets in an unmarked grave in Dahieh. Two weeks later, the men of the family dug again in the same spot and buried Naya. Rihab\u2019s uncle placed two sprigs of artificial cherry blossom atop the grave, for the two girls, and later someone else laid a wreath for a stranger buried beside them.",
      "Then an Israeli air strike hit the building directly adjacent to the cemetery and the resultant blast wave and debris smashed gravestones and churned up the earth around them. About the same time, another Israeli air strike hit the family home in Dahieh, destroying several items Rihab had wanted to keep, including two new, unworn school uniforms.",
      "Not long after that, it was all over. A ceasefire announced last week allowed thousands of displaced people to stream back to their villages in the south of Lebanon. Rihab and Saeed\u2019s village was heavily bombed by the Israelis and their family home there destroyed, her uncle said, but Rihab cannot return home anyway, because she will be in a backbrace for several more months and cannot travel.",
      "As joy spread through Lebanon at the news of the ceasefire, new pictures emerged of Wafiq Safa, the reported target of the bomb that killed Saeed, Tea, Naya and 19 others. Safa had not been seen in public since the strike, but he appeared to be alive and well.",

      "This is almost universally regarded by economists as misleading.",

      "Back on home soil, McGregor was named Sportsperson of the Year at the RT\u00c9 Sport Awards. Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Carroll, an Irish journalist and editor who covered the recent trial, says this was seen as a \u201cremarkable feat\u201d as it happened in the same year as the Olympics and Ireland\u2019s Euro 2016 victory over Italy.",
      "\u201cIt was divisive though,\" she adds. \u201cSome people thought that he wasn\u2019t so much a sportsperson, that he was more a celebrity and people looked up to him because of his attitude and his fame.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s never been a very clear-cut, popular figure in Ireland, but he would have been part of that establishment, winning that award, being invited onto the Late Late Show and would have been highly regarded for his feats in the cage, if nothing else,\u201d she says.",

      "China says it has steadied a volatile city. Hundreds have been jailed under a sweeping national security law (NSL), which also drove thousands of disillusioned and wary Hongkongers abroad, including activists who feared or fled arrest. Others, like Kenneth, have stayed and keep a low profile.",
      "But in many of them lives the memory of a freer Hong Kong - a place they are fighting to remember in defiance of Beijing\u2019s remaking of their city.",
      "When Hong Kong, a former British colony, was returned to China in 1997, it was under the assurance that the city would keep some rights, including free speech, freedom of assembly and rule of law for 50 years. But as Beijing\u2019s power grew, so did the disquiet within the city\u2019s pro-democracy camp.",
      "In September 2014, tens of thousands of protesters began to stage mass sit-ins in downtown Hong Kong, demanding fully democratic elections. It propelled a new generation of pro-democracy campaigners to prominence - such as Joshua Wong, then a 17-year-old student, and Benny Tai, a college professor, who called the movement Occupy Central.",
      "It also seeded the ground for more explosive protests in 2019, which were triggered by Beijing\u2019s proposal to extradite locals to the mainland. The plan was scrapped but the protests intensified over several months as calls grew for more democracy, becoming the most serious challenge to Beijing\u2019s authority in Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cWithout Benny Tai, there would have been no Occupy Central,\u201d says Chan Kin-man, who co-founded the campaign with Tai and Reverend Chu Yiu-ming.",
      "\u201cHe had the temper of scholars and spoke his mind\u2026 that\u2019s why he was bold enough to push for changes and think about big ideas. It is always people [like this] who change history.\u201d",
      "Chan and Rev Chu are both exiles in Taiwan now. Chan moved to Taipei in 2021, after serving 11 months in jail for inciting public nuisance in his role in Occupy Central. He is now a fellow at a local research institute.",
      "Tai is still in Hong Kong, where he will spend the next decade behind bars.",
      "In November, he was sentenced to jail for subversion, along with more than 40 other pro-democracy campaigners including Wong, many of whom have been in jail since their arrest in early 2021. As Wong left the courtroom, he shouted: \u201cI love Hong Kong.\u201d",
      "The following day 76-year-old billionaire Jimmy Lai, a fierce critic of China, testified at his trial for allegedly colluding with foreign forces. Frail but defiant, he told the court his now-defunct newspaper Apple Daily had only espoused the values of Hong Kong\u2019s people: \u201cPursuit of democracy and freedom of speech\u201d.",
      "The trials have passed quietly, in stark contrast to the events that led to them. Small signs of protest outside the court were quickly shut down - a woman sobbing about her son\u2019s sentence was taken away by police.",
      "Beijing defends the restrictions - including the NSL under which the trials are happening - as essential for stability. It says the West or its allies have no right to question its laws or how it applies them.",
      "But critics accuse China of reneging on the deal it struck in 1997. They say it has weakened the city\u2019s courts and muzzled the once resounding cry for democracy in Hong Kong.",
      "Chan has watched these events unfold from afar with a heavy heart.",
      "After 2014, there had still been the possibility of change, he said. Now, \u201ca lot of things have become impossible\u2026 Hong Kong has become no different from other Chinese cities\u201d.",
      "Faced with this reality after campaigning for democracy for more than a decade, \u201cyou can say that I have failed in everything I have done in my life\u201d, he said with a wry smile.",
      "But still he perseveres. Besides teaching classes on Chinese society, he is writing a book about Occupy Central, collecting items for an archive of Hong Kong\u2019s protest scene, organising conferences, and giving virtual lectures on democracy and politics.",
      "These efforts \u201cmake me feel that I haven\u2019t given up on Hong Kong. I don\u2019t feel like I have abandoned it\u201d.",
      "Yet, there are moments when he grapples with his decision to leave. He is happier in Taiwan, but he also feels \u201ca sense of loss\u201d.",
      "\u201cAm I still together with other Hongkongers, facing the same challenges as them?\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you are not breathing the air here, you don\u2019t really know what\u2019s happening\u2026 if you don\u2019t feel the pulse here, it means you are truly gone,\u201d said Kenneth, as he continued his walk through Victoria Park.",
      "With friends leaving the city in droves in the last few years, he has lost count of the number of farewell parties he\u2019s attended. Still, he insists on staying: \u201cThis is where my roots are.\u201d",
      "What irritates him is the rhetoric from those who leave, that the Hong Kong they knew has died. \u201cHong Kong continues to exist. Its people are still here! So how can they say that Hong Kong is dead?\"",
      "But, he acknowledged, there have been dramatic changes. Hongkongers now have to think twice about what they say out loud, Kenneth said.",
      "Many are now adapting to a \u201cnormalised state of surveillance\u201d. There are red lines, \u201cbut it is very difficult to ascertain them\u201d.",
      "Instead of campaigning openly, activists now write petition letters. Rallies, marches and protests are definitely off-limits, he added. But many, like Kenneth, are wary of taking part in any activism, because they fear they\u2019ll be arrested.",
      "A t-shirt, social media posts and picture books have fallen foul of the law recently, landing their owners in jail for sedition.",
      "These days Kenneth goes out less frequently. \u201cThe contrast is so drastic now. I don\u2019t want to remember what happened in the past.\u201d",
      "Still, as he walked out of the park and headed to the Admiralty district, more memories unspooled.",
      "As he neared the government headquarters, he pointed to the spot where he choked on tear gas for the first time, on 28 September 2014.",
      "That day, the police fired 87 rounds of tear gas on unarmed protesters, an act that enraged demonstrators and galvanised the pro-democracy movement.",
      "As the protests deepened and tear gas became a common sight, many sheltered behind umbrellas, spawning a new moniker - the Umbrella Movement.",
      "The final stop was his alma mater, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, also known as PolyU. It was a key battleground during the 2019 demonstrations that saw protesters battling police on the streets, hurling projectiles against tear gas, water cannons and rubber bullets.",
      "Five years on, the PolyU entrance where students fended off the police with bricks and petrol bombs in a fiery showdown has been reconstructed. A fountain which saw the most intense clashes has been demolished.",
      "Like elsewhere in Hong Kong, the campus seemed to have been scrubbed of its disobedient past. Kenneth believed it was because the university \u201cdoesn\u2019t want people to remember certain things\".",
      "Then, he darted away to a quiet corner. Hidden beneath the bushes was a low wall pockmarked with holes and gobs of concrete. It was impossible to tell what they were. But Kenneth believes these were traces of the battles which escaped the purge of memories.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe we will forget what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cForgetting the past is a form of betrayal.\u201d",
      "At a Tesco\u2019s caf\u00e9 in Watford in the UK, Kasumi Law remembered what she missed about her old home.",
      "\u201cI never thought I\u2019d love the sea in Hong Kong so much. I only realised this when I arrived in the UK,\u201d she said, as she tucked into a full English breakfast. Unlike the cold and dark ocean surrounding Britain, \u201cin Hong Kong the sea is so shiny, because there are so many buildings\u2026 I didn\u2019t realise how beautiful our city is\u201d.",
      "Kasumi\u2019s decision to move to the UK with her husband and young daughter had stemmed from an unease that crept up on her over the previous decade. The Occupy Central protests began just months after her daughter was born in 2014.",
      "In the following years, as Beijing's grip appeared to tighten - student activists were jailed and booksellers disappeared - Kasumi's discomfort grew.",
      "\u201cStaying in Hong Kong was, I wouldn\u2019t say, unsafe,\u201d she said. \u201cBut every day, little by little, there was a feeling of something not being right.\u201d",
      "Then Hong Kong erupted in protest again in 2019. As Beijing cracked down, the UK offered a visa scheme for Hongkongers born before the 1997 handover, and Kasumi and her husband agreed it was time to go for the sake of their daughter.",
      "They settled in the town of Watford near London, where her husband found a job in IT while Kasumi became a stay-at-home mum.",
      "But she had never lived abroad before, and she struggled with a deep homesickness which she documented in emotional video diaries on YouTube. One of them even went viral last year, striking a chord with some Hongkongers while others criticised her for choosing to emigrate.",
      "Eventually it was too much to bear, and she returned to Hong Kong for a visit last year. Over two months she visited childhood haunts like a theme park and a science museum, scoffed down her mum\u2019s homecooked fuzzy melon with vermicelli and stir fried clams, and treated herself to familiar delights such as egg tarts and melon-flavoured soy milk.",
      "But the Hong Kong she remembered had also changed. Her mum looked older. Her favourite shops in the Ladies Market had closed down.",
      "Sitting by the harbour at Tsim Sha Tsui one night, she was happy to be reunited with the twinkling sea she had missed so much. Then she realised most of the people around her were speaking in Mandarin.",
      "Tears streamed down her face. \u201cWhen I looked out at the sea it looked familiar, but when I looked around at the people around me, it felt strange.\u201d",
      "Kasumi wonders when she would visit again. With the passing of a new security law this year - Article 23 - her friends have advised her to delete social media posts from past protests before returning.",
      "It is a far cry from the fearlessness she remembers from 2019, when she brought her daughter to the protests and they marched on the streets with thousands of people, united in their defiance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too late to turn back,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel if I go back to Hong Kong I might not be used to life there, to be honest.",
      "\u201cMy daughter is happy here. When I see her, I think it\u2019s worth it. I want her world to be bigger.\u201d",
      "Kasumi\u2019s world is bigger too - she has found a job and made new friends. But even as she builds a new life in the UK, she remains determined to preserve the Hongkonger in her - and her child.",
      "Kasumi and her husband only speak in Cantonese to their daughter, and the family often watches Cantonese films together. Her daughter doesn\u2019t yet understand the significance of the 2019 protests she marched in, nor the movement that began in 2014, when she was born. But Kasumi plans to explain when she is older.",
      "The seeds Kasumi is planting are already taking root. She is particularly proud of the way her daughter responds to people who call her Chinese. \u201cShe gets angry, and she will argue with them,\u201d Kasumi said, with a smile.",
      "\u201cShe always tells people, \u2018I\u2019m not Chinese, I\u2019m a Hongkonger'.\"",

      "For Patel to take the job, the current FBI director Christopher Wray would need to resign or be fired - although Trump did not call on him to do so in his post.",

      "Patel and Chronister join Attorney General nominee Pam Bondi in filling out Trump's law enforcement picks.",
      "All three choices will have to be confirmed by a majority vote in the US Senate.",

      "\"Kash is a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending justice, and protecting the American people,\" Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media platform, adding that Patel was \"an advocate for truth, accountability, and the constitution\".",

      "Trump's plan would have Patel replace current FBI director Christopher Wray, who Trump appointed in 2017 for the routine 10-year term.",

      "Meanwhile, some Republicans voiced their immediate enthusiasm for Patel.",
      "Speaker of the House Mike Johnson was staunch in his support. \"Kash Patel has extensive experience in national security and intelligence. He is an America First patriot who will bring much-needed change and transparency to the FBI,\" Johnson said.",

      "\u201cThere are serious problems at the FBI,\" Hagerty said, also on Meet the Press. \u201cThe American public knows it. They expect to see sweeping change, and Kash Patel is just the type of person to do it.\u201d",
      "The son of Indian immigrants, Patel is a former defence lawyer and federal prosecutor who caught Trump\u2019s eye after he became a senior counsel to the House of Representatives intelligence committee in 2017.",
      "He was hired by Trump as a national security aide in 2019 and a year later was appointed chief of staff to the head of the Pentagon.",

      "Men, women and children wept at the sight of the crater, while the crowd chanted \u201cAt your service, Nasrallah\u201d \u2013 a common rallying cry among Hezbollah supporters.",
      "Nasrallah led Hezbollah for more than 30 years as it became a formidable force in Lebanon, turning him into one of the most influential figures in the Middle East.",
      "A ceasefire deal agreed between Hezbollah and Israel on Wednesday paved the way for the southern suburb where Nasrallah was killed, on 27 September, to be opened to journalists and the public.",
      "The militant and political group had previously closely guarded access to the suburb, known as the Dahieh, particularly the place where Nasrallah was assassinated, which was entirely closed off.",
      "The Israeli strike that killed the Hezbollah leader was reportedly made up of as many as 80 bunker busting bombs, and it destroyed several residential buildings in Harek Hreik \u2013 the neighbourhood that forms the centre of Hezbollah\u2019s operations in Beirut.",

      "The hundreds of Hezbollah flags at the event would \u201ccontinue to fly high\u201d, said Fida Nasreddine, 34. \u201cWe are with Hassan Nasrallah until the last breath,\u201d she said.",
      "Nasrallah\u2019s assassination shocked Lebanon and the wider world when the news broke in September. He had rarely been seen in public since Hezbollah\u2019s 2006 war with Israel, and was protected by tight security at all times.",
      "He was one of a number of senior Hezbollah figures killed by Israel in air strikes between September and the ceasefire agreement struck on Wednesday.",
      "The group had been badly damaged by the assassinations, but the sense of celebration in the Hezbollah-dominated areas of Beirut \"cannot be dismissed as insincere\", said David Wood, a Lebanon analyst with Crisis Group.",
      "\"The achievements that Hezbollah has promoted - maintaining its ground operations against Israel, ensuring that tens of thousands of Israelis couldn't return to their homes, and having a severe impact on Israel's economy, I don't think those achievements are nothing, and I think lots of its supporters will see an element of victory in that.\"",

    "summary": "Tamuna Museridze has reunited hundreds of families torn apart by a baby trafficking scandal \u2013 now she has found her own birth parents.",
    "story": [
      "Tamuna Museridze took a deep breath and made the phone call she had dreamed of since finding out that she might be adopted.",
      "She was calling the woman she believed was her biological mother. She knew it might not lead to a fairy tale reunion - but she didn't expect the response to be cold and angry.",
      "\u201cShe started screaming, shouting - she said she hadn\u2019t given birth to a child. She didn't want anything to do with me,\u201d Tamuna recalls, explaining she felt more surprised than upset by the response.",
      "\u201cI was ready for anything, but her reaction was beyond anything I could imagine.\u201d",
      "Tamuna wasn\u2019t prepared to walk away just yet. She wanted to know the circumstances of her adoption, and there was something else she wanted that only her mother could give her - the name of her father.",
      "Tamuna\u2019s search had begun in 2016, after the woman who raised her died. Clearing out her house, Tamuna found a birth certificate with her own name on it but the wrong birth date, and she started to suspect she was adopted. After doing some research, she set up a Facebook group called Vedzeb, or I\u2019m Searching, hoping to find her birth parents.",
      "Instead, she uncovered a baby trafficking scandal in Georgia that has affected tens of thousands of lives. Over many decades, parents were lied to and told their newborn babies had died \u2013 the infants were then sold.",
      "Tamuna is a journalist and her work has reunited hundreds of families, yet - until now - she couldn\u2019t solve the mystery of her own origins and wondered if she too had been stolen as a child.",
      "\u201cI was a journalist on this story, but it was a personal mission for me as well,\u201d she says.",
      "The breakthrough in her search had come in the summer, when she received a message through her Facebook group. It was from someone who lived in rural Georgia, who said they knew a woman who had concealed a pregnancy and given birth in Tbilisi in September 1984. That\u2019s around the time Tamuna was born - a date she had shared publicly.",
      "The person believed the woman was Tamuna\u2019s birth mother - and crucially they gave a name.",

      "Georgia's stolen children: Twins sold at birth reunited by TikTok video",
      "Tamuna immediately searched for her online but when she couldn\u2019t find anything, she decided to post an appeal on Facebook asking if anyone knew her.",
      "A woman soon responded, saying the woman who had concealed the pregnancy was her own aunt. She asked Tamuna to take the post down but she agreed to do a DNA test.",
      "While they were waiting for the results, Tamuna made the phone call to her mother.",
      "A week later, the DNA results arrived, indicating that Tamuna and the woman on Facebook were indeed cousins. Armed with this evidence, Tamuna managed to convince her mother to acknowledge the truth and reveal the name of her father. It was a man called Gurgen Khorava.",
      "\u201cThe first two months were shocking, I couldn\u2019t believe these things were happening to me,\u201d she recalls, \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe I had found them.\u201d",
      "Once Tamuna had Gurgen\u2019s name, she quickly tracked him down on Facebook. It turned out that he had been following her story on social media - her work reconnecting families is widely known across Georgia.",
      "Tamuna was amazed to find that he had \u201cbeen in my friend list for three years\u201d. He just hadn\u2019t realised he was a part of her story.",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t even know my birth mother had been pregnant,\u201d says Tamuna. \u201cIt was a huge surprise for him.\"",
      "They soon arranged to meet in his hometown of Zugdidi in western Georgia \u2013 about 160 miles (260km) from where she lives in Tbilisi.",
      "Looking back, Tamuna thinks she was in a state of shock, but as she walked up to Gurgen\u2019s garden gate, she felt surprisingly calm.",
      "When the 72-year-old appeared, they hugged, then stopped to take a moment to look at each other, smiling.",
      "\u201cIt was strange, the moment he looked at me, he knew that I was his daughter,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI had so many mixed emotions.\u201d",
      "She had a lot of questions and didn\u2019t know where to start. \u201cWe just sat together, watching each other and trying to find something in common,\u201d she says.",
      "As the two of them chatted, they realised they shared a lot of interests - Gurgen had once been a renowned dancer at the State Ballet of Georgia, and was delighted to learn that Tamuna\u2019s daughters - his granddaughters - shared his passion.",
      "\u201cThey both love dancing, and so does my husband,\u201d she says with a smile.",
      "Gurgen invited his entire family to his home to meet Tamuna, introducing her to a large group of new relatives - half siblings, cousins, aunts, and uncles. The family agreed there was a strong resemblance between them. \u201cOut of all his children, I look the most like my father,\u201d she says.",
      "They spent an evening sharing stories, eating traditional Georgian food, and singing while Gurgen played the accordion.",
      "Even though she had now met her father, Tamuna still had a niggling question: had she - like thousands of other Georgians - been stolen from her mother at birth and sold? Her adoptive parents were no longer alive so she couldn\u2019t turn to them for answers.",
      "She finally got a chance to ask her birth mother in October. A Polish TV company was filming a documentary about Tamuna and took her to meet her mother, who agreed to talk to her in private.",
      "Unlike many people Tamuna has helped to reunite, she discovered that she had not been a stolen child herself. Instead, her mother had given her up and kept the secret for 40 years.",
      "Her mother and father were not in a relationship and had only had a brief encounter. Her mother - overwhelmed by shame - chose to hide her pregnancy. In September 1984, she travelled to Tbilisi, telling people she was going for surgery, and instead gave birth to a daughter. She stayed there until arrangements were made for Tamuna\u2019s adoption.",
      "\u201cIt was painful to learn that I spent 10 days alone with her before the adoption. I try not to think about that,\u201d Tamuna reflects.",
      "She says that her mother asked her to lie and tell people she had been stolen. \u201cShe told me that if I would not say that I was stolen, everything would end between us\u2026 and I said that I couldn\u2019t do that.\"",
      "Tamuna feels this would be unfair to all the parents whose babies were stolen. \u201cIf I lie, nobody's going to believe those mothers any more,\u201d she explains.",
      "Her mother then asked her to leave the house and they have not spoken since.",
      "\u201cWould I do it all again?\u201d she reflects. \u201cOf course I would, I found out so much about my new family.\u201d",

    "summary": "Theyyam is an ancient folk ritual combining theatre, mime, and worship, predating Hinduism.",
    "story": [
      "For nearly 300 years, a family\u2019s ancestral house in India's southern state of Kerala has been the stage for theyyam, an ancient folk ritual.",
      "Rooted in ancient tribal traditions, theyyam predates Hinduism while weaving in Hindu mythology. Each performance is both a theatrical spectacle and an act of devotion, transforming the performer into a living incarnation of the divine.",
      "The predominantly male performers in Kerala and parts of neighbouring Karnataka embody deities through elaborate costumes, face paint, and trance-like dances, mime and music.",
      "Each year, nearly a thousand theyyam performances take place in family estates and venues near temples across Kerala, traditionally performed by men from marginalised castes and tribal communities.",
      "It is often called ritual theatre for its electrifying drama, featuring daring acts like fire-walking, diving into burning embers, chanting occult verses, and prophesying.",
      "Historian KK Gopalakrishnan has celebrated his family\u2019s legacy in hosting theyyam and the ritual\u2019s vibrant traditions in a new book, Theyyam: An Insider\u2019s Vision.",
      "The theyyams are performed in the courtyard of Mr Gopalakrishnan's ancient joint family house (above) in Kasaragod district. Hundreds of people gather to witness the performances.",
      "The theyyam season in Kerala typically runs from October to April, aligning with the post-monsoon and winter months. During this time, numerous venues near temples and family estates, especially in northern Kerala districts like Kannur and Kasaragod, host performances.",
      "The themes of performances at Mr Gopalakrishnan's house include honouring a deified ancestor, venerating a warrior-hunter deity, and worshipping tiger spirits symbolising strength and protection.",
      "Before the performance honouring a local goddess, a ritual is conducted in a nearby forest, revered as the deity's earthly home.",
      "Following an elaborate ceremony (above), the \"spirit of the goddess\" is then transported to the house.",
      "Mr Gopalakrishnan is a member of the Nambiar community, a matrilineal branch of the Nair caste, where the senior-most maternal uncle oversees the arrangements. If he is unable to fulfil this role due to age or illness, the next senior male member steps in.",
      "Women in the family, especially the senior-most among them, play a crucial role in the rituals.",
      "They ensure traditions are upheld, prepare for the rituals, and oversee arrangements inside the house.",
      "\"They enjoy high respect and are integral to maintaining the family\u2019s legacy,\" says Mr Gopalakrishnan.",
      "The spectacle is a blend of loud cries, fiery torches, and intense scenes from epics or  dances.",
      "Performers sometimes bear the physical toll of these daring feats, with burn marks or even the loss of a limb.",
      "\"Fire plays a significant role in certain forms of theyyam, symbolising purification, divine energy, and the transformative power of the ritual. In some performances, the theyyam dancer interacts directly with fire, walking through flames or carrying burning torches, signifying the deity\u2019s invincibility and supernatural abilities,\" says Mr Gopalakrishnan.",
      "\"The use of fire adds a dramatic and intense visual element, further heightening the spiritual atmosphere of the performance and illustrating the deity\u2019s power over natural forces.\"",
      "The deities can be manifestations of gods and goddesses, ancestral spirits, animals, or even forces of nature.",
      "Here, the theyyam performer (above) embodies Raktheswari, a fierce manifestation of Kali, the Hindu goddess of destruction.",
      "She is portrayed drenched in blood, a powerful symbol of her raw energy and destructive force.",
      "This intense ritual delves into themes of sorcery, voodoo, and divine wrath.",
      "Through dramatic costume and ritualistic dance, the performance channels Kali\u2019s potent energy, invoking protection, justice, and spiritual cleansing.",
      "During the performance, the artist (or kolam) transforms into these deities, through elaborate costumes and body paint, their striking colours bringing the deities to life.",
      "Here, a performer meticulously adjusts his goddess attire, checking his look in the mirror before stepping into the ritual. The transformation is as much an act of devotion as it is a preparation for the electrifying performance ahead.",
      "Distinct facial markings, intricate designs, and vibrant hues - especially vermillion -define the unique makeup and costumes of theyyam.",
      "Each look is carefully crafted to symbolise the deity being portrayed, showcasing the rich diversity and detail that distinguishes this ritual art. Some theyyams do not require face painting but use only masks.",
      "Theyyam\u2019s animistic roots shine through in its reverence for nature and its creatures.",
      "This crawling crocodile theyyam deity symbolises the power of reptiles and is venerated as a protector against their dangers.",
      "With its detailed costume and lifelike movements, it highlights humanity\u2019s deep-rooted connection to nature.",
      "The deity will bless a large congregation of devotees after a performance.",
      "Here, a female devotee unburdens her troubles before a theyyam deity, seeking solace and divine intervention.",
      "As she offers her prayers, the sacred space becomes a moment of spiritual release, where devotion and vulnerability intertwine."

    "summary": "Imran Khan's third wife guided protesters to the heart of the capital - and then disappeared.",
    "story": [
      "A charred lorry, empty tear gas shells and posters of former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan - it was all that remained of a massive protest led by Khan\u2019s wife, Bushra Bibi, that had sent the entire capital into lockdown.",
      "Just a day earlier, faith healer Bibi - wrapped in a white shawl, her face covered by a white veil - stood atop a shipping container on the edge of the city as thousands of her husband\u2019s devoted followers waved flags and chanted slogans beneath her.",
      "It was the latest protest to flare since Khan, the 72-year-old cricketing icon-turned-politician, was jailed more than a year ago after falling foul of the country's influential military which helped catapult him to power.",
      "\u201cMy children and my brothers! You have to stand with me,\u201d Bibi cried on Tuesday afternoon, her voice cutting through the deafening roar of the crowd.",
      "\u201cBut even if you don\u2019t,\u201d she continued, \u201cI will still stand firm.",
      "\u201cThis is not just about my husband. It is about this country and its leader.\u201d",
      "It was, noted some watchers of Pakistani politics, her political debut.",
      "But as the sun rose on Wednesday morning, there was no sign of Bibi, nor the thousands of protesters who had marched through the country to the heart of the capital, demanding the release of their jailed leader.",
      "While other PMs have fallen out with Pakistan's military in the past, Khan's refusal to stay quiet behind bars is presenting an extraordinary challenge - escalating the standoff and leaving the country deeply divided.",
      "Exactly what happened to the so-called \u201cfinal march\u201d, and Bibi, when the city went dark is still unclear.",
      "All eyewitnesses like Samia* can say for certain is that the lights went out suddenly, plunging D Chowk, the square where they had gathered, into blackness.",
      "As loud screams and clouds of tear gas blanketed the square, Samia describes holding her husband on the pavement, bloodied from a gun shot to his shoulder.",
      "\"Everyone was running for their lives,\" she later told BBC Urdu from a hospital in Islamabad, adding it was \"like doomsday or a war\".",
      "\"His blood was on my hands and the screams were unending.\u201d",
      "But how did the tide turn so suddenly and decisively?",
      "Just hours earlier, protesters finally reached D Chowk late afternoon on Tuesday. They had overcome days of tear gas shelling and a maze of barricaded roads to get to the city centre.",
      "Many of them were supporters and workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the party led by Khan.",
      "He had called for the march from his jail cell, where he has been for more than a year on charges he says are politically motivated.",
      "Now Bibi - his third wife, a woman who had been largely shrouded in mystery and out of public view since their unexpected wedding in 2018 - was leading the charge.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t go back until we have Khan with us,\u201d she declared as the march reached D Chowk, deep in the heart of Islamabad\u2019s government district.",
      "Insiders say even the choice of destination - a place where her husband had once led a successful sit in - was Bibi\u2019s, made in the face of other party leader\u2019s opposition, and appeals from the government to choose another gathering point.",
      "Her being at the forefront may have come as a surprise. Bibi, only recently released from prison herself, is often described as private and apolitical. Little is known about her early life, apart from the fact she was a spiritual guide long before she met Khan. Her teachings, rooted in Sufi traditions, attracted many followers - including Khan himself.",
      "Was she making her move into politics - or was her sudden appearance in the thick of it a tactical move to keep Imran Khan\u2019s party afloat while he remains behind bars?",
      "For critics, it was a move that clashed with Imran Khan\u2019s oft-stated opposition to dynastic politics.",
      "There wasn\u2019t long to mull the possibilities.",
      "After the lights went out, witnesses say that police started firing fresh rounds of tear gas at around 21:30 local time (16:30 GMT).",
      "The crackdown was in full swing just over an hour later.",
      "At some point, amid the chaos, Bushra Bibi left.",
      "Videos on social media appeared to show her switching cars and leaving the scene. The BBC couldn\u2019t verify the footage.",
      "By the time the dust settled, her container had already been set on fire by unknown individuals.",
      "By 01:00 authorities said all the protesters had fled.",
      "Eyewitnesses have described scenes of chaos, with tear gas fired and police rounding up protesters.",
      "One, Amin Khan, said from behind an oxygen mask that he joined the march knowing that, \"either I will bring back Imran Khan or I will be shot\".",
      "The authorities have have denied firing at the protesters. They also said some of the protesters were carrying firearms.",
      "The BBC has seen hospital records recording patients with gunshot injuries.",
      "However, government spokesperson Attaullah Tarar told the BBC that hospitals had denied receiving or treating gunshot wound victims.",
      "He added that \"all security personnel deployed on the ground have been forbidden\" from having live ammunition during protests.",
      "But one doctor told BBC Urdu that he had never done so many surgeries for gunshot wounds in a single night.",
      "\"Some of the injured came in such critical condition that we had to start surgery right away instead of waiting for anaesthesia,\" he said.",
      "While there has been no official toll released, the BBC has confirmed with local hospitals that at least five people have died.",
      "Police say at least 500 protesters were arrested that night and are being held in police stations. The PTI claims some people are missing.",
      "And one person in particular hasn\u2019t been seen in days: Bushra Bibi.",
      "\u201cShe abandoned us,\u201d said one PTI supporter.",
      "Others defended her. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t her fault,\u201d insisted another. \u201cShe was forced to leave by the party leaders.\u201d",
      "Political commentators have been more scathing.",
      "\u201cHer exit damaged her political career before it even started,\u201d said Mehmal Sarfraz, a journalist and analyst.",
      "But was that even what she wanted?",
      "Khan has previously dismissed any thought his wife might have her own political ambitions - \u201cshe only conveys my messages,\u201d he said in a statement attributed to him on his X account.",
      "Speaking to BBC Urdu, analyst Imtiaz Gul calls her participation \u201can extraordinary step in extraordinary circumstances\".",
      "Gul believes Bushra Bibi\u2019s role today is only about \u201ckeeping the party and its workers active during Imran Khan\u2019s absence\u201d.",
      "It is a feeling echoed by some PTI members, who believe she is \u201cstepping in only because Khan trusts her deeply\u201d.",
      "Insiders, though, had often whispered that she was pulling the strings behind the scenes - advising her husband on political appointments and guiding high-stakes decisions during his tenure.",
      "A more direct intervention came for the first time earlier this month, when she urged a meeting of PTI leaders to back Khan\u2019s call for a rally.",
      "Pakistan\u2019s defence minister Khawaja Asif accused her of \u201copportunism\u201d, claiming she sees \u201ca future for herself as a political leader\u201d.",
      "But Asma Faiz, an associate professor of political science at Lahore University of Management Sciences, suspects the PTI\u2019s leadership may have simply underestimated Bibi.",
      "\u201cIt was assumed that there was an understanding that she is a non-political person, hence she will not be a threat,\u201d she told the AFP news agency.",
      "\u201cHowever, the events of the last few days have shown a different side of Bushra Bibi.\u201d",
      "But it probably doesn\u2019t matter what analysts and politicians think. Many PTI supporters still see her as their connection to Imran Khan. It was clear her presence was enough to electrify the base.",

    "story": [
      "\"It's not just about brewing a good cup of coffee but connecting with customers on a deeper level.\"",
      "It was this one thought that made Harmanpreet Singh leave his family bakery to open a specialty coffee shop in the northern Indian city of Jalandhar.",
      "It was an unexpected decision - coffee has always been popular in southern states, traditionally served strong and frothy in a steel tumbler. But it's still not the first choice of beverage in the vast swathes of north India, where drinking tea is an intrinsic part of the culture.",
      "For Mr Singh, the journey began in 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic when he saw a growing demand for specialty coffee, particularly among the city's youth and the overseas residents who returned to the country at that time.",
      "Recognising this shift, he moved to the southern city of Bengaluru to learn brewing techniques. \"I studied everything - from the way coffee is served to the role things like decor, cutlery, music and even packaging played in the overall experience,\" he said.",
      "Three months later, Mr Singh put his learnings to test and opened Buland Caf\u00e9 in Jalandhar.",
      "Today, the cafe has 40 outlets across the city and has become a favourite spot for the city's youth, who come here to relax or work over piping cups of coffee.",
      "The beans, roasted in various blends, are sourced from the famed coffee estates of  Karnataka. Mr Singh says he personally trained his staff on how to brew the perfect cuppa and take care of the coffee machine.",
      "\"It's a thriving scene,\" he says.",
      "Mr Singh is among a crop of young entrepreneurs that are benefitting from a wave of specialty coffee consumption in small north Indian towns and cities.",
      "India has had a vibrant cafe culture for years - but it has been largely restricted to big cities where homegrown specialty and international coffee chains dominate the market.",
      "However, post-Covid, several tier-two cities are also seeing a boom in demand for such spaces as people embrace practices like remote working and look for new places to meet their friends and families.",
      "Cafe owners say more Indians are now willing to pay more for coffee that's roasted in smaller batches and customised as per their preferences.",
      "\"Clients have become more knowledgeable about the roasts and are interested in the origins of their coffee,\" says Bharat Singhal, the founder of Billi Hu roasteries.",
      "In fact, more than 44% of the Indian population now drinks coffee, a 2023 report by CRISIL, a marketing analytical company, shows.",
      "While a lot of it comes from home consumption, the growing demand for specialty coffee in small cities plays a big part, says Bhavi Patel, a coffee consultant and dairy technologist.",
      "Roastery owners say the growth is also evident in numbers. \"Subscription based orders have surged by 50% in one year,\" says Sharang Sharma, the founder of Bloom Coffee Roasters. \"Customers have moved from French presses to pour-over or espresso machines, adopting more sophisticated brewing methods.\"",
      "While India is often associated with tea, it also has a long coffee-drinking history.",
      "The culture took shape in the 1900s when Indian Coffee Houses emerged as a hangout spot for the intellectual and elite class. Housed in colonial-styled buildings, these cafes served English breakfasts with steaming hot coffee and offered a space to discuss politics and mobilise support during pivotal periods in history.",
      "A shift occurred in the 1990s when economic reforms opened India to the world, allowing entrepreneurs to open private coffee shops frequented by young peeople, who saw it as a hip experience.",
      "Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day (CCD), which opened in 1996, quickly became one of India\u2019s most popular and widespread coffee chains. At its peak, CCD boasted over 1,700 outlets, serving as a popular gathering spot for students and young adults. But mounting debt, management issues and the untimely death of its founder led to a closure of most of its outlets across India.",
      "In 2012, the arrival of international giant Starbucks spurred the rise of homegrown specialty coffee brands like Blue Tokai Roasters, Third Wave Coffee and Subko Coffee.",
      "Mr Singhal says that while big cities like Delhi, Jaipur, Mumbai, and Bengaluru still dominate the scene, smaller cities are quickly catching up.",
      "However, it's not just changing palettes that's driving consumption. \"Often it's social media,\" Mr Singh says. \"People want good coffee but they also want to be in a space that's trendy and which they can post online.\"",
      "Nishant Sinha from Lucknow city is among those who understood the trend early on.",
      "His Roastery Coffee House offers trendy ambience, free wi-fi and cosy seating options along with an array of coffee roasts. While the beans are sourced from coffee estates in the south, the food is distinctively north Indian.",
      "Others like Jatin Khurana in the northern city of Ludhiana are experimenting with flavours.",
      "At his Urban Buhkkad cafe, Mr Khurana serves the \"Shadi Wali Coffee [the wedding coffee]\" - a wedding favourite in the 1990s, which became famous for its blend of instant coffee, milk, sugar, and a sprinkle of chocolate powder.",
      "But instead of coffee powder, Mr Khurana uses freshly grounded beans, available in different roasts and varieties, to enhance its flavours. \"The idea is to capture the essence of the beverage that many Indians grew up drinking,\" he says.",
      "It's an exciting time to be in the business - but growth comes with its own set of challenges.",
      "\"Demand is growing, but a smaller coffee shop owners tend to cut corners, whether it\u2019s by opting for substandard machines, serving weaker coffee shots, or hiring inexperienced baristas,\" Mr Singhal says.",
      "And running the business is not always profitable given the high price of coffee and the infrastructural costs involved in running such spaces.",
      "When Neha Das and Nishant Ashish opened The Eden\u2019s caf\u00e9 in Ranchi in 2021, they wanted to create a safe and relaxed space for young students to get together in the city.",
      "Today, their hazelnut coffee and cold brews have become a favourite of many.",
      "\"It took some time but longevity requires more than profit,\" Ms Das says.",
      "\"It\u2019s about dedication, crafting local flavours, and understanding customers, even if it means working with slim profit margins for the long haul.\""

    "title": "Did JFK's assassination help The Beatles break the US?",
    "published": "Sat, 30 Nov 2024 01:51:59 GMT",
    "summary": "Paul McCartney says their success may have been the US needing a lift \"out of sorrow\", but is he right?",
    "story": [
      "In Beatles '64, the new documentary which charts the impact of the band's first US tour and how it catapulted them to global superstardom, Paul McCartney makes a suggestion as to why they achieved so much so quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen we came, it was quite shortly after Kennedy had been assassinated,\" he said.",
      "\"Maybe America needed something like The Beatles to be lifted out of sorrow.\"",
      "Beatles scholars and cultural historians have long remarked upon how much of a lift the band gave to an America in mourning.",
      "But was McCartney right? Was the rise of the world's most famous band partly down to the murder of the 35th president of the United States?",
      "Did The Beatles crack America because Kennedy was killed?",
      "'Unstoppable force'",
      "When The Beatles landed at the recently-renamed John F. Kennedy International Airport on 7 February 1964, it was just 70 days after the the 46-year-old Democrat had been murdered.",
      "Kennedy was shot as his motorcade drove through Dallas, Texas, on 22 November 1963 and his death threw his country into a period of mourning.",
      "Dr Patrick Andelic, assistant professor of American History at Northumbria University, said it was a moment that shook the nation to its core, partially because of JFK's own pop culture persona.",
      "\"In a sense, Kennedy was the first TV president, which was relatively new at this point,\" he said.",
      "\"By the beginning of the '60s, 90% of American families had TVs, so the way news and media was consumed totally changed.\"",
      "He said the president was, like The Beatles, \"young, handsome, witty and energetic, which translated really well to TV\".",
      "\"He embraced television and was well suited to it,\" he said.",
      "\"And that makes the shock and trauma of his death sharper in the aftermath.",
      "\"It was the first killing of a sitting president in 60 years.\"",
      "It was, of course, TV which also helped The Beatles become a phenomenon in their homeland.",
      "Settling on their now final line-up of Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr in 1962, the Liverpool four-piece had already scored two number one albums in 1963 with Please Please Me and With The Beatles.",
      "When that success was coupled with the famous 1963 Royal Variety Performance appearance during which Lennon asked \"the people in the cheaper seats to clap their hands\" and the rest to just \"rattle their jewellery\" they became a national sensation.",
      "Senior music industries lecturer Dr Holly Tessler, from the University of Liverpool, said it was that show that \"made them stars overnight\".",
      "\"At this point, The Beatles were an unstoppable force in the UK,\" she said.",
      "Fear of failure",
      "The Beatles' youthful exuberance was central to their success, chiming with the legions of British teenagers that had begun to follow them.",
      "Dr Andelic said in America, JFK had a similar appeal.",
      "\"Kennedy projected youth and vitality and in his inaugural address, he spoke of the torch being passed to a new generation of Americans,\" he said.",
      "\"His death cut that short in a shocking way.\"",
      "He said in the aftermath, the nation started \"to look for more positive things, stability and reassurance\".",
      "\"When The Beatles arrive, I think they represented that.",
      "\"They were also young, vital, and [in the footage] of them getting off the plane, they were being silly.",
      "\"So, for a nation shattered by a trauma, The Beatles represented an opportunity to laugh and have fun again.\"",
      "Winning over a portion of America's youth was one thing, but cracking the national market was another.",
      "Many British acts had tried and failed to mirror the transatlantic appeal of their US counterparts, who had seen great chart success in the UK, and crack the American market.",
      "There had been limited success for those that came before The Beatles.",
      "Lonnie Donegan, the titular \"King of Skiffle\", had two top ten hits, while Cliff Richard, then the biggest act in Britain, had only made it into the US top 40 on one occasion.",
      "Spencer Leigh, author of many books on The Beatles, said the trend of British acts failing to \"make it\" in the United States, had seen Capitol, one of the country's biggest record companies, even refuse to distribute The Beatles' music for fear of the same result.",
      "\"Artists from the UK didn't sell well in America and it seemed Capitol looked down its nose at the British work,\" he said.",
      "Capitol's concerns were understandable. The singles Please Please Me, From Me To You and She Loves You had all been released in the US in 1963 and seen limited success, so they were reluctant to put out I Want To Hold Your Hand.",
      "The band's manager Brian Epstein and Capitol's parent company EMI managed to change the label's minds and on Boxing Day 1963, about a month after Kennedy's assassination, the single hit America's stores.",
      "Its impact was huge and by the first week of February, it was at the top of the US charts, a position it would hold for seven weeks.",
      "The success meant more than 3,000 fans and a large press pack were at the airport when the band touched down.",
      "For Spencer Leigh, it was what came next, not what had happened before, that led to their global success.",
      "\"My view is the people screaming for The Beatles at the airport were young and didn't know much about politics,\" he said.",
      "\"For me, the turning point was the Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "'Fleeting at best'",
      "At 20:00 on 9 February 1964, The Beatles made the first of three appearances on the programme, which was one of America's most popular TV variety shows.",
      "The TV channel CBS reportedly received more than 50,000 requests for seats at its 700-capacity studio ahead of the band's visit and those who failed to get their hands on any huddled excitedly around TVs at home.",
      "\"More than 70 million people watched the first one and they performed so well,\" Leigh said.",
      "He said one of the moments that really caught the audience's attention was when cameras panned to each band member, flashing their names on the screen.",
      "\"They put a caption on John Lennon saying 'sorry girls he's married',\" he said.",
      "\"I'm not sure how much [the band] appreciated that.\"",
      "About a month after those first three performances, The Beatles made US chart history by becoming the first act to hold the top five slots simultaneously.",
      "Beatlemania had now gone global and the rest was history.",
      "For Dr Tessler, the notion that America went down with the death of JFK and back up with the arrival of The Beatles is too simplistic.",
      "For her too, it was the Ed Sullivan Show appearances, rather than the assassination aftermath that set The Beatles on the road to pop immortality.",
      "\"I really struggle with the idea that The Beatles owe their US success to JFK being shot,\" she said.",
      "\"Their manager Brian Epstein had already been to America and done the deal to get them on the Sullivan show weeks before Kennedy was killed, and there was so much hype when the band finally landed in the US.",
      "\"America might have wanted a distraction from that feeling of 'what's next' after the assassination, but The Beatles became the story so quickly that the connection to Kennedy was only fleeting at best.\"",

      "Published30 November 2024",
      "The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is coming to an end and it has been an active one overall.",
      "There have been 18 named tropical storms, with 11 of those reaching hurricane strength and five becoming major hurricanes - category three and above.",
      "An average season would bring 14 storms, seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes.",
      "Some records have been equalled or broken but the active weather was not spread evenly across the season. In fact the middle of the season, normally the peak, was very quiet.",
      "18 tropical storms were named in the Atlantic basin in 2024",
      "A lively start",
      "Pre-season forecasts suggested this would be an above-average season - \"extraordinary\" according to some predictions.",
      "There were early signs that it would live up to these expectations, with Hurricane Beryl becoming the Atlantic's earliest category five hurricane on record on 2 July.",
      "It caused widespread damage and a number of deaths across the Caribbean before hitting the coast of southern Texas, bringing flooding and power cuts here and in the neighbouring state of Louisiana.",
      "But after Beryl dissipated, the Atlantic fell quiet.",

      "How unusual has this hurricane season been?Published11 October",
      "How unusual has this hurricane season been?",
      "Published11 October",
      "Published11 October",
      "A lull in proceedings",
      "The hurricane season runs from 1 June to 30 November with activity typically reaching its peak in early September. But after Beryl in July there were only four named storms - and no major hurricanes - until Helene formed on 24 September.",
      "This quiet spell was, on the face of it, something of a surprise.",
      "Hurricanes are fuelled by warm oceans, and sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic were consistently above average.",
      "The end of El Nino, which can put the brakes on hurricane development, was also expected to mean storms would form readily.",
      "But the formation of hurricanes is a complex recipe requiring many ingredients.",
      "It is thought that a shift in weather patterns in Africa - which brought rare rain to the Sahara - meant the clusters of thunderstorms that give birth to tropical systems emerged into the Atlantic further north than usual in an area less ripe for development. Large amounts of Saharan dust may also have suppressed activity.",
      "But sea surface temperatures remained high - meaning the potential for powerful hurricanes remained.",
      "Helene brought devastation as far north as Asheville, North Carolina",
      "The Atlantic roars back to life",
      "This potential was realised in late September with the birth of Hurricane Helene. It intensified rapidly before making landfall on the Florida coast as a major category four storm.",
      "Helene brought catastrophic flooding and widespread wind damage across large swathes of the south-east US, from Florida's Gulf Coast to the southern Appalachians.",
      "According to preliminary data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) it was the deadliest hurricane to affect the continental US since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, causing more than 150 deaths.",
      "Helene was the first of six storms to develop in quick succession. Five of these became hurricanes of which four underwent rapid intensification, where sustained winds strengthen by at least 35mph (56km/h) in 24 hours.",
      "This culminated with Hurricane Milton, which formed in the Gulf of Mexico in early October and saw its wind speeds increase by a massive 90mph (145km/h) in 24 hours - one of the most extreme examples of rapid intensification on record.",
      "It reached category five strength for a time, before weakening to a category three and making landfall on the west coast of Florida. It brought widespread impacts including a destructive storm surge and an outbreak of 46 tornadoes.",
      "The final storm of the Atlantic season was Tropical Storm Sara. This storm did not strengthen into a hurricane - but it became slow-moving close to the coast of Central America, bringing widespread flooding. The north coast of Honduras saw more than 3ft (nearly 1m) of rain.",
      "Destructive winds were just one impact from Hurricane Milton in Florida",
      "Is climate change to blame?",
      "High sea temperatures are a key driver of tropical storms and hurricanes - these have been around 1C above the 1991-2020 average, according to BBC analysis of data from the European climate service.",
      "This fits a pattern of warm oceans around the globe, fuelled by climate change.",
      "Analysis by Climate Central, external has found that maximum wind speeds in every Atlantic hurricane in 2024 were higher because of climate change. In the case of Hurricane Milton, the winds were 23mph stronger as a result of human-induced global warming.",
      "The very high sea temperatures that fuelled the storm were made 400 to 800 times more likely by climate change",
      "Meanwhile a study by World Weather Attribution , externalshows that climate change increased rainfall from Milton by 20-30%.",
      "Globally, scientists say that tropical cyclones and hurricanes are unlikely to become more frequent overall. But those that do occur will intensify more rapidly and bring more rainfall - making them increasingly dangerous.",

    "published": "Sat, 30 Nov 2024 01:18:54 GMT",
    "summary": "Palestinian perfumers try to evoke memories of a better time with \"ingredients\" of their heritage.",
    "story": [
      "A young Palestinian couple in Jerusalem have produced a range of perfumes to embody the heritage of their people. Despite the horror of the war in Gaza, they hope their scents can still summon memories of a better time, as Sebastian Usher reports from Jerusalem.",
      "Out in the fields of the Jordan valley, Palestinian women still sing old folk songs as they harvest the olive groves. One tells the story of how a fabled ship carrying a life-saving cargo of food heads to port during a terrible famine that swept the Levant in the dying days of Ottoman rule. While in the Old City of Jerusalem, the scents of leather, spices and livestock fuse into a fragrance that evokes thousands of years of history.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to send a message to people through our perfumes, revealing our heritage and the scent of our land,\u201d Qassem Abu Khalaf says as he explains the motivation behind the Mejana fragrance line that he\u2019s set up with his wife, Malak Hijazi.",
      "The young couple are Palestinians from the Beit Hanina district in occupied East Jerusalem. He is an advanced materials engineer and she is an English and special needs teacher. Their fragrance line grew from a passion Qassem developed over the years for producing the best quality perfumes. He worked at night on his ideas, building up a library of hundreds of ingredients.",
      "In a restaurant in East Jerusalem amid the ongoing war in Gaza, he says the five scents he\u2019s so far produced are intended to let people hold a piece of Palestinian history in their hands. While for Palestinians themselves, he hopes that it\u2019s a way to reconnect with their roots in a Proustian rush of memory triggered by an aroma.",
      "He and Malak chose the name Mejana, as it\u2019s a word that describes the old songs that Palestinians sing as they are working.",
      "\u201cMejana has a special rhythm when you sing it,\u201d Malak says. \u201cIt means joy and happiness. We chose it, because when you smell a special fragrance, you feel good, you feel happy in the same sort of way.\u201d",
      "Palestinian folk memory also influenced the naming of their first two scents. Zaref Atool is a dark, heavy fragrance - very much what people expect from an oriental style. Qassem says it\u2019s intended to conjure up the feel of the ancient, labyrinthine alleyways of the Old City of Jerusalem. It\u2019s named after the main character in a popular old song - in which the singer laments that a tall, handsome young man is leaving his Palestinian homeland to travel far away.",
      "The other fragrance is called Rozana, after a ship that was feverishly anticipated by people starving across Palestine, Lebanon and Syria after failed wheat harvests 100 years ago. It was meant to deliver salvation, but only brought further bitter disappointment and loss - as its cargo contained almost nothing to eat. Again, there\u2019s a famous song inspired by the story that\u2019s been sung by many of the great Arab singers, such as Fairouz and Sabah.",
      "\u201cI love our identity, our heritage, our folklore and I\u2019m proud of it,\u201d says Malak.",
      "If the past is their inspiration, then the present has complicated their efforts to create and launch a brand that celebrates Palestinian identity.",
      "\u201cWe launched our brand on 27 September last year,\u201d Malak says. \u201cWe went to two bazaars in Jerusalem but then the war began and put a stop to everything for many months.\u201d",
      "The souks and shops in the Old City and elsewhere in Israel and the occupied West Bank are denuded of tourists, as shopkeepers try to survive on the still bustling local market.",
      "Qassem and Malak have had some success selling their fragrances to the Palestinian diaspora - in Australia in particular. And they have continued undeterred, producing a second range of three perfumes, beautifully presented in a box painted by a Palestinian artist with local flowers and wildlife.",
      "The perfumes themselves are contained in wooden capsules with a key embossed on one side, which opens up the gold dispenser when turned. A large old key is a symbol of all the Palestinian homes lost when hundreds of thousands were expelled or fled during the war in 1948 that established the State of Israel.",
      "\u201cWhen we chose the key, it was about our memories,\" Malak say. \"It\u2019s designed a little bit differently from the traditional Palestinian key, but it is related to it. When you smell a particular scent, it brings back beautiful memories. So, it is the key to our ancestors and our childhood memories.\u201d",
      "The couple have not only just produced their new range of perfumes - with combinations such as tuberose and berry, and coconut and agarwood - but also their first child - a daughter, Sadeel.",
      "Qassem and Malak say it is a difficult time to bring new life into a world in such conflict. Malak says she feels guilty about it but she had to stop watching news about Gaza during her pregnancy as it was causing her so much stress - and she feared it might negatively affect her baby.",
      "\"It\u2019s not easy,\" Qassem says. \u201cBut we hope everything will come to an end and we\u2019ll have peace. A little peace of mind, too.\u201d"

    "summary": "Creatives in Nairobi unleash their imaginations in an effort to inspire a new future for the city.",
    "story": [
      "Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi, has long been known as \u201cthe green city in the sun\u201d because of its mix of forest and grasslands among the urban sprawl, but it all depends on where you are viewing it from.",
      "Seen from one of the city\u2019s comfortable apartment blocks or homes, then yes, perhaps \u2013 from one of its densely packed slums, then no.",
      "There, life can be characterised by poverty and ecological disaster, such as flooding and deadly landslides.",
      "But an art collective - Kairos Futura \u2013 has been trying to take what might seem like some of the city\u2019s more dystopian elements and create a vision of a utopia, or at least how that might be achieved.",
      "Their exhibition Hakuna Utopia features the works of seven artists exploring themes of apocalypse and resilience \u2013 some in quite abstract ways - as they respond to the daily challenges endured by Nairobi\u2019s six million residents.",
      "One of the collective, Stoneface Bombaa, grew up in Mathare, the capital\u2019s second-largest informal settlement.",
      "He has overcome great odds to become an artist and wants to use his work to address the way that people in Mathare live \u2013 often lacking jobs, housing and education.",
      "Bombaa says they endure a \u201chand-to-mouth economy\u201d, never sure where their next meal will come from.",
      "\u201cPeople are really angry,\u201d he says, but through art, he feels he can \u201cchannel\u201d his community\u2019s anger into something positive as \u201cart unites\u201d.",
      "Bombaa set out to create from the exhibitions \u201cmicro-utopia\u201d sites dotted around the city.",
      "He called it the \u201cjungle room\u201d and hoped to get people to connect with nature from within Mathare itself, in an attempt to bridge the ecological divide.",
      "Ironically, the building he had identified as a possible site was demolished by the authorities to make way for a road.",
      "Undeterred, he has been taking children from his community, often stuck living in unimaginable urban squalor, to experience Nairobi\u2019s verdant parks and expose them to green spaces.",
      "\u201cThere are no trees or green spaces in Mathare,\u201d Bombaa says.",
      "But by contemplating the idea of utopia, he believes that he can imagine what it would be like if people in his community actually had unrestricted access to the city\u2019s green spaces.",
      "In this way, people in his community can claim a right to access nature that is denied to them simply because they are poor.",
      "Bombaa also complains about how ordinary Nairobians, often scrabbling to make a living, have to pay to enter some of their city\u2019s most beautiful locations such as the arboretum or Karura forest.",
      "The Kairos Futura team are also drawing inspiration from nature to use their imagination in how to address urgent environmental issues.",
      "For example, Coltrane McDowell has applied this to architecture.",
      "In his work Invisible Cities, he was inspired by termite mounds to reimagine what architecture might look like in the future.",
      "Another artist in the show, Abdul Rop, known for his mesmerising woodcut prints and paintings, says that in order to \u201cachieve utopia\u201d, Nairobians need to work together.",
      "\u201cThat's why the young people are agitating right now for change,\u201d he says, suggesting they are frustrated by a corrupt political system that hems in their potential.",
      "Gen Z were at the forefront of protests this year against new tax measures, which saw the government make an embarrassing U-turn.",
      "Rop argues that by thinking about utopia through the lens of art, young people may find creative ways to fight for their future.",
      "Rather than being far-fetched, he thinks that it can help imagine a bolder and more equal future for his city.",
      "\u201cThe moment to act for the future is now,\u201d he says.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 15:05:54 GMT",
    "summary": "Paris's Gothic cathedral has been painstakingly returned to its former glory. Here's how it was done.",
    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron has toured Paris's Notre-Dame cathedral live on TV, giving the public a first look inside the building since much of it was destroyed or damaged in a huge fire in 2019.",
      "From the spire to the stained glass, it has been completely transformed. It is not just a renovation after the fire, but a complete overhaul including removing decades of crud and soot built up since the last restoration.",
      "Here we take a look at some of the key features of the repair work and how it was achieved.",
      "The return of the spire",
      "The collapse of the spire was the climax of the 2019 fire. Many people thought it was medieval, but in fact the original was taken down in the 1790s because it was deemed dangerous.",
      "Its replacement, which burned down five years ago, was put up decades later as part of a neo-Gothic reconstruction conducted by architect Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-Le-Duc.",
      "This time, carpenters used a mix of the traditional and the computerised to design and build the massive wooden base.",
      "It was lifted into place by Europe\u2019s largest crane, then a scaffolding shell was mounted allowing workers to assemble the steadily rising structure.",
      "Like the rest of the roof, the spire is lined with lead. At the top a new gilded cock has been fitted to replace the original that fell in the fire. It was recovered but was too damaged to go back.",
      "Inside the new cock are holy relics including a thorn from the cathedral\u2019s Crown of Thorns, and a parchment with the names of 2,000 people who worked on the renovation.",
      "Luminous limestone",
      "The most striking feature of the renovated cathedral is the luminosity of the stonework. This is because all the limestone blocks have been cleaned, or in some parts replaced.",
      "Replacement stone was sourced in quarries in northern France. Experts were able to detect tiny features in the original stone \u2013 like certain fossils \u2013 that helped them to determine the geographical origin.",
      "The vast majority of the masonry was undamaged, but it was covered not just in age-old accretions of dust and dirt from the past, but also in a layer of soot and lead powder from the fire. It was cleaned with high-power vacuums, and then with a spray which peeled off to remove the dirt.",
      "Overall some 40,000 square metres of stone were cleaned.",
      "To rebuild the vaulted ceiling beneath where the spire had stood, masons had to relearn the principles of Gothic architecture \u2013 using a wooden frame to put the stones in place and crowning it all with the keystone.",
      "More than 1,000 oak trees",
      "It was the wooden roof that burned \u2013 all 100 metres of it. None of the 800-year-old timbers survived. But the decision was quickly made to replace them as faithfully as possible \u2013 with oak from the forests of France.",
      "By happy coincidence an architect called Remi Fromont had conducted an in-depth study of the timber frame as part of his university thesis. This served as a template for carpenters.",
      "Some 1,200 oak trees had to be found, with the stipulation that they be straight, free from knots and a condition called \"frost-crack\", and 13 metres long.",
      "Much of the wood was hand-sawn then hewed into shape with axes, just as the beams were in the 13th century.",
      "Altogether there are 35 \"fermes\" (the triangular structures that take the weight) running the length of the building.",
      "Digitally scanned gargoyles",
      "Many of the exterior sculptures \u2013 including the famous (but not medieval) gargoyles and chimaeras \u2013 were damaged by high-pressure hoses used to fight the fire. Many were already in poor condition because of pollution.",
      "A workshop was set up in front of the cathedral to repair and where necessary replace these statues. Five of the gargoyles (products of Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s imagination) were scanned by computer, and then re-made in limestone.",
      "Inside the cathedral, the most famous sculptures \u2013 such as The Virgin of the Pillar and The Vow of Louis XIII \u2013 emerged unscathed. But they have all been cleaned and given minor repairs.",
      "The cathedral's many paintings have also been cleaned. These include the \"Mays\" \u2013 massive scenes from the life of Christ which were an annual gift to the cathedral in the 17th Century from the goldsmiths of Paris.",
      "The return of colour",
      "One of the most remarkable changes to the cathedral is the return of colour to the choir and many of the side-chapels.",
      "Here again, the fire offered an opportunity to rediscover the glories that lay beneath decades of crud and soot. Blues, reds and golds have re-emerged, combining with the creaminess of the rejuvenated limestone to create a lightness that must be much closer to the original experience.",
      "The same is true of the stained-glass windows. These were undamaged, but filthy. They were dismantled, removed, cleaned, and returned. The big rose-windows were left alone.",
      "Again, much of what the visitor sees today is not actually medieval \u2013 but the product of the medieval imagination of Viollet-le-Duc.",
      "Great organ's 8,000 pipes cleaned",
      "The great organ \u2013 built in the 18th Century \u2013 was unaffected by either heat or water on the night of the fire. What did for it was the accumulation of a yellow dust - lead monoxide - in its pipes.",
      "The whole structure \u2013 12 metres high, six keyboards, 7,952 pipes, 19 wind-chests \u2013 was disassembled and taken to workshops outside Paris.",
      "Sheep-leather linings were replaced and new electronic controls were added. After reinstallation the instrument was re-tuned \u2013 a task which takes several months as each pipe is minutely altered.",
      "On 7 December, the Archbishop of Paris\u2019s first words on entering the reclaimed cathedral will be:  \u201cAwake oh organ, Let God\u2019s praise be heard!\u201d",
      "The eight bells of the north tower were also removed in 2023 \u2013 a massive operation given their size. They were cleaned and treated, and then returned a few weeks ago. The biggest of the bells is called Emmanuel.",
      "New chalices and bronze altar",
      "Visitors will also notice a change to the liturgical lay-out of the cathedral, whose altar, lectern and seating were all destroyed. A simple bronze altar has been created, with new chalices for the sacraments.",
      "There are 1,500 new wooden chairs for the congregation, and a new reliquary behind the choir to hold the Crown of Thorns.",
      "New vestments have also been created for clergy by designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac.",
      "Buried 13th Century structure unveiled",
      "Renovation work at Notre-Dame has been a boon for archaeologists, who have been able to access underground areas that date back to hundreds of years before the cathedral was built.",
      "Among the many sets of bones they discovered are those believed to belong to the Renaissance poet Joachim du Bellay.",
      "Another major discovery was the carefully buried remains of the medieval rood-screen, which originally separated the sacred part of the church from the congregation.",
      "This 11-metre stone partition, built in the 13th Century, contained rich and colourful sculptures depicting the life of Christ. It was dismantled in the 18th Century following a change in church rules.",
      "But clergy clearly hoped the remains would be rediscovered because the parts appear to have been lain with great care beneath the ground. It is hoped they can be pieced together and put on display.",
      "What next?",
      "Despite the success of the renovation, work is not complete. There is still scaffolding around much of the eastern end, and in coming years the outside walls of the apse and sacristy will need treatment.",
      "There are also plans to redesign the esplanade, and to create a museum in the neighbouring H\u00f4tel-Dieu hospital.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 07:32:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Owas Mwape posted on Facebook about his son's drug addiction - and then met up with him for a BBC interview.",
    "story": [
      "One of Zambia's most popular actors and filmmakers Owas Mwape broke a social taboo by admitting that one of his young sons has an addiction to drugs when he posted a recent appeal for advice on Facebook.",
      "The 52-year-old told the BBC he wanted to use his standing as a public figure to open the lid on Zambia\u2019s drug problems and help other parents who fear the stigma of having a child with substance abuse in a socially conservative country.",
      "\"I've discovered most parents hide such kind of things, they're hiding their children,\" said Mwape, the father of five sons and one daughter.",
      "\"It\u2019s out there and on our doorsteps. We can\u2019t run away from it. As long as you send your children to school, know that it could hit your household.\"",
      "The star of award-winning films like Mwansa the Great agreed to sit down to do an in-depth interview with the BBC to discuss the acute pain he feels as a parent and the problem that has clearly shattered his family over the last four to five years.",
      "Mayamiko, now 23, was a teenager when things began to unravel.",
      "First his dad noticed that money was missing from his bank account - Mayamiko had hacked his phone to steal about $3,000 (\u00a32,300) over about two years. Then there was some petty thieving.",
      "Initially it was not clear that he was using the money for drugs, but things came to a head a few minutes before he was due to write final-year school exams - and he ran away from home to live on the streets.",
      "It all clearly stunned and pained Mwape who could not believe the boy he described as sparky and generous could have gone down this path, saying his whole demeanour changes when he's on drugs.",
      "\"It\u2019s a very difficult thing to be a father in the moment that I have found myself in. It\u2019s tough because every child is special and Maya is one of those special kids because he is intelligent,\" he says.",
      "But he says you have to forgive your children to help them, turning to an African proverb to express himself: \"Your child is like an axe, it will hammer you and you pick it up and put it on your shoulder.\"",
      "Mayamiko is now back in touch with his father, but it is always on his terms as he uses different phone numbers, making it difficult to contact him.",
      "But it has given his father hope that things can change - though he realises that for any rehab to work, Mayamiko needs to want to change.",
      "When we met for our interview, Mwape had managed to coax Mayamiko to come along too. It was a frank conversation that at one stage turned into a moving discussion between father and son.",
      "\"Maya, if we found you work to do and you start getting paid, are you going to work extra hard?\" Mwape asked him nearly an hour into our session.",
      "Mayamiko, whose speech was somewhat incoherent and punctuated by long pauses, admitted he would like some help to change his lifestyle and be able to earn money.",
      "His dad followed up with this question: \"Are you promising us that you will stay away from drugs?\"",
      "Mayamiko hesitated and said: \"Yeah.\"",
      "For his father it was a relief to hear that he has aspirations - it is something that he can build on.",
      "But the most frustrating thing for Mwape is that his second-oldest son is never explicit about what drugs he is taking, how he gets hold of them - and often obfuscates when asked a question.",
      "\"When you're trying to speak to him, you can tell that things are not adding up, so that's why for me I really need that sort of... intervention.\"",
      "When probed more during the interview about the drugs, Mayamiko said he mostly took \"cheese\" - a reference to marijuana - or \"anything\".",
      "That is why Mwape, who is currently starring in popular Zambian soap opera Zuba that airs on DStv, took to Facebook, because he wanted to know about rehab centres that have proven examples of success - stories not widely shared in a country where drug addiction is such a hush-hush affair.",
      "There are several private facilities in Zambia - but no publicly funded one - and he says some people have even reportedly sent their children to China.",
      "\"I couldn\u2019t believe [it], there were a number of parents who came into my inbox with similar problems,\" he said.",
      "Mwape\u2019s experience has also influenced the films his company has recently produced - with subject matter considered to be \"un-Zambian\".",
      "\"Girls 2 Ladies is about drugs in boarding schools,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm not saying boarding schools are not good, but I think it's important as parents now that we put a keen eye to try to find out what type of schools we're sending our children to, [which is] one of my greatest fears even with what type of rehabilitation centre I should send him [Mayamiko] to.\"",
      "His oldest son, Maxwell, has just directed The Flask, a hard-hitting account of an alcoholic\u2019s downward spiral into addiction that will be released next month.",
      "Researching all these projects has led Mwape to the door of Zambia\u2019s Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) - headed by Nason Banda, whom he praises for his enlightened leadership that favours interventions for youngsters rather than jail - which many parents fear.",
      "\"Sending them to prison doesn\u2019t help because there are still drugs in there,\" Mwape said.",
      "According to Mr Banda, drug abuse in Zambia is worsening, with some of the most abused drugs being cannabis, cocaine, heroin and over-the-counter medicines such as the cough syrup Benylin, which contains codeine.",
      "He told the BBC there had been a 300% increase in the number of people his organisation had attended to over the past 10 years.",
      "\"Now that is just as DEC but we have several other institutions that assist with drug-dependent persons, so that is not the full reflection of the extent of the problem.\"",
      "The head of the country\u2019s anti-drug agency said the main drivers of drug abuse were broken families plus the accessibility and affordability of  drugs.",
      "Peer pressure and the glamourising of drug culture by adults had also contributed, he said.",
      "The DEC was committed to fighting drug abuse by targeting suppliers, consumers and proceeds of the trade, Mr Banda said, adding that he also wanted the government to launch a dedicated rehab centre if the money was available.",
      "For Mwape, he hopes his openness about his son\u2019s problems will not only help his own family but others too - and stop the country living in denial.",
      "And while he admits the pain of a parent never leaves, he feels he will succeed - and that Mayamiko will get clean.",
      "\"Sometimes, battles are never won by simply getting into battle - battles are won by employing strategy and I know that all strategies that I have employed are definitely taking me to the right place.\"",

    "summary": "Displaced Lebanese are trying to get to their homes after a ceasefire came into force.",
    "story": [
      "The family of four stood in the middle of the street in front of the pile of twisted metal and broken concrete, struggling to comprehend the devastation they were seeing.",
      "The building had been destroyed by a recent Israeli air strike and smoke was still rising from the rubble. The next building to the right had partially collapsed; the one behind it had a huge hole at the top.",
      "They continued walking to the building where they used to live, in Tyre in southern Lebanon. The displaced family was back, hours after a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah had come into effect. Nobody seemed to have stayed in their home.",
      "As there was no electricity they took the stairs to the sixth floor, helped by the torches on their phones.",
      "Mohamad Marouf led his wife and two sons. He struggled to open the main door. When he finally got in, he instantly realised that his home as he knew it was, for now, gone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so sad, it\u2019s a nice and decent house,\u201d said Mr Marouf, a car dealer. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much damage.\u201d",
      "Panels had fallen from the ceiling. Windows, doors and furniture were destroyed. In the kitchen, cups and plates lie broken on the floor. There was dust and debris everywhere. Room by room, he mourned objects that were now beyond repair, and celebrated those that somehow had remained intact.",
      "The destruction, Mr Marouf said, had been caused by an attack on a residential building nearby. It was so powerful that his building, too, was heavily damaged.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said. They were living with his brother, and did not know when they would be able to move back.",
      "On Tyre\u2019s beachfront, a yellow banner with a Hezbollah logo was put up next to one of many residential buildings hit. It said, \u201cMade in USA\u201d, in reference to the bombs that were probably used in the attack.",
      "As the pause in the fighting held, residents returned to badly damaged homes. All day Wednesday a constant flow of cars arrived, packed with families, bags and mattresses.",
      "Some people waved Hezbollah flags; in the distance, there was the sporadic sound of celebratory gunfire. Many supporters say the ceasefire is a sign of the group\u2019s victory. The \u201cresistance\u201d, as they often refer to Hezbollah, stopped the Israeli military\u2019s advances on the ground, they contend, and Israel failed to achieve its objectives in Lebanon.",
      "It is a narrative that will find very little \u2013 if any \u2013 support elsewhere.",
      "Hezbollah has been weakened, large parts of the country lie in ruins, and many, including those who had accused the group of dragging Lebanon to a conflict that was not in its interests, say the war has only led to death and destruction.",
      "Nearly 4,000 people were killed and more than 16,000 injured, according to Lebanon\u2019s health ministry.",
      "The Lebanon ceasefire is a respite, not a solution for the Middle East",
      "What we know about Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire deal",
      "The conflict began in October 2023 when Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing into Israel in support of Palestinians in Gaza, and escalated dramatically in September, with intense Israeli air strikes, the killings of several top Hezbollah leaders including long-time chief Hassan Nasrallah, and a ground invasion in the south.",
      "Israel\u2019s stated goal was to remove the group from the border and allow the return of around 60,000 residents who had been displaced.",
      "Israeli bombardments were mostly contained to mainly Shia Muslim areas of the country where Hezbollah was essentially in control. More than one million people were forced to leave their homes.",
      "A 60-day pause is now in force as part of a ceasefire deal, which many hope will bring an end to the conflict. Under its terms Israel and Hezbollah will pull out from the south, a traditional Hezbollah stronghold, and the Lebanese military will deploy an additional 5,000 soldiers to the area.",
      "In the morning, Hezbollah organised a tour for journalists to show the damage around Tyre, a sign that they are still very much present \u2013 and in control \u2013 here.",

    "story": [
      "Israel is creating a new military dividing line in Gaza, separating off the far north of the strip, satellite images studied by BBC Verify appear to show.",
      "Troops are in control of, and are clearing, an area across the width of north Gaza. Satellite images and videos show that hundreds of buildings have been demolished between the Mediterranean Sea and the Israel border, mostly through controlled explosions.",
      "Images also show Israeli troops and vehicles have been stationed across the new divide. Analysts said the images suggest Gaza is being split into zones to make it easier to control.",
      "An IDF spokesperson told the BBC it was \"targeting terrorist operatives and infrastructure\" in north Gaza.",
      "Dr H A Hellyer, a Middle East security expert from the Rusi think tank, said the satellite images suggested Israel was preparing to block Palestinian civilians from returning to the north Gaza governorate. More than 100,000 people have already been displaced from the far north of Gaza, according to the UN.",
      "Images appear to show two long sections of road on either end of the strip being connected by cleared land through an urban area. Buildings are being demolished between the two sections of road, with a clear pattern visible since early October.",
      "This partition stretches about 5.6 miles (9km) across Gaza, from east to west, dividing Gaza City and the towns of Jabalia, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia in north Gaza.",
      "The BBC has been told that there is a tactical route between Jabalia and Gaza City, which is part of operational activities targeting Hamas in Jabalia.",
      "Videos filmed by the IDF and posted online show several multi-storey buildings being destroyed in controlled explosions since the beginning of October.",
      "The graphic below shows examples geolocated by BBC Verify along the new corridor.",
      "An IDF spokesperson told the BBC that it had no intention of destroying civilian infrastructure \"without operational necessity\" to neutralise Hamas.",
      "Other footage shows IDF Humvee vehicles being driven through the cleared area from the direction of Israel. Humvees are not as heavily armoured as other military vehicles - and Dr Hellyer told the BBC that they were unlikely to be used unless the military was confident about their safety, indicating that Israeli troops are in control of the area.",
      "Some analysts believe the IDF\u2019s presence could indicate a permanent military partition \u2013 giving it control of who can travel between the Gaza and the North Gaza governorates.",
      "Dr Hellyer said of the IDF: \u201cThey\u2019re digging in for the long term. I would absolutely expect the north partition to develop exactly like the Netzarim Corridor.\u201d",
      "The BBC has previously documented how two partitions have been constructed in Gaza since the start of the current war. The Netzarim Corridor splits an area south of Gaza City, while the Philadelphi Corridor gives the IDF control of land running the length of Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt.",
      "BBC analysis of this new partition in the north shows a similar pattern to the construction of the previous corridors over the past year, with existing and newly built roads being connected and military positions emerging at regular intervals. Buildings and agricultural land are cleared so roads can be paved and military infrastructure built.",
      "Dr Eado Hecht from the Begin\u2013Sadat Center for Strategic Studies (Besa), an Israeli think tank specialising in national security and foreign policy, agreed that the data showed a new dividing line, but questioned whether it was designed to be permanent.",
      "\u201cThere is a new partition corridor separating Gaza City and the northern towns of the Gaza Strip. The goal is to cut off the Hamas - and other organizations' - forces that have returned to that area from support and the ability to retreat, so they can be dealt with more effectively.\u201d",
      "Israel has denied that it is implementing the \"General\u2019s Plan\". Under the strategy, devised by former general Giora EIland, civilians would be told to leave the north, supplies would be blocked and the area would become a military zone. Those who remained would be treated as combatants and faced with the choice of \u201csurrender or starve\", with the aim of putting pressure on Hamas to release its hostages.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, an IDF spokesperson said: \"The IDF operates according to well-established military plans, and the claim that the IDF is implementing this specific plan is incorrect.\"",
      "But concerns have mounted over the safety of the thousands of Palestinian civilians who remain in besieged towns in north Gaza.",
      "The UN and aid charities have raised significant concerns about the situation in the north of Gaza. While thousands of people have been displaced, the UN says over 65,000 people could remain in the area.",
      "The UN also said that \"virtually no aid\" has entered parts of the North Gaza governorate in 40 days on 20 November. A spokesperson on 26 November said that Palestinians were facing \u201cfacing critical shortages of supplies and services, as well as severe overcrowding and poor hygiene conditions\u201d due to the blockade.",
      "Earlier this month, a UN-backed assessment said there was a strong likelihood that famine was imminent in the besieged areas of northern Gaza.",
      "BBC analysis shows around 90% of north Gaza has been subject to evacuation orders since the start of October. Videos posted on social media document people being moved south of the new partition. It is not clear if and when they will be able to return, but Israel\u2019s foreign minister has insisted civilians will be allowed to return after the war.",
      "Satellite images show the displacement of people in north Gaza. Large groups of tents, erected as temporary shelter, disappear. In the area left behind, there are often destroyed buildings and other examples of military activity.",
      "While the IDF appears to have established enough control in the area to travel in lightly armoured vehicles, heavy fighting has also persisted in the area between IDF troops and Hamas fighters.",
      "Videos posted by Hamas fighters show clashes with IDF tanks in the area around the dividing line.",
      "Experts disagree over how long the new partition might be intended to remain in place. Dr Hellyer suggested that it could form the basis of plan to expel Palestinians from the area permanently.",
      "\"Personally I think they're going to settle Jewish settlers in the north, probably in the next 18 months,\" he said. \"They won't call them settlements. To begin with they'll call them outposts or whatever, but that's what they'll be and they'll grow from there.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 14:39:32 GMT",
    "summary": "The proposed tariffs, if applied to oil and gas, could hammer Canada's economy and hike prices at the pump for Americans, analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "In Canada\u2019s oil-rich province of Alberta, there is a deep sense of unease over President-elect Donald Trump's threat to impose a 25% tariff on Canadian goods.",
      "Canadian politicians and energy experts are warning the hefty tariff would have dire consequences for the economy of America's northern neighbour - and hike prices on US consumers.",
      "\"Canada has no choice in this,\" Dennis McConaghy, an Alberta-based former energy executive, told the BBC.",
      "\"It has to find an accommodation with Trump.\"",
      "Trump announced on Monday that, upon taking office in January, he would slap an across-the-board tariff on Mexico and Canada - with no suggestion that would exclude oil and gas.",
      "It remains unclear whether the tariffs will ultimately materialise, analysts have noted, as Trump has been known to use such threats in the past as a negotiating tactic to achieve his goals.",
      "In this case, Trump has signalled that the levies would remain in place until both Canada and Mexico work on securing their shared borders with the US, limiting the number of unlawful migrants and drugs flowing into the country.",
      "As the threat lingers, Canadian officials and industry leaders are working to meet Trump's demands, while communicating to the public the importance of the Canada-US energy partnership.",
      "Lisa Baiton, president and CEO of the Calgary-based Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said the levy would likely mean Canada producing less oil.",
      "Mr McConaghy said that would lead to job losses in Alberta, with potential repercussions for Canada as a whole, as poorer provinces rely on cash transfers from revenues generated by wealthier provinces - like Alberta - to help offset costs and provide social services.",
      "It could also lead to a devaluation of the Canadian dollar at a time when the currency is already struggling due to domestic economic factors, he said.",
      "\u201cKeep in mind, roughly 80% of Canada\u2019s trade is with the United States, and a majority of that trade is in hydrocarbons. Canadians can\u2019t escape how integrated they are with the US.\u201d",
      "US fuel makers have also urged Trump to rule out oil and gas from any proposed levies given that Americans rely heavily on imported Canadian crude.",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 22:54:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Three men allegedly using Google Maps for directions died after their car fell off an unfinished bridge.",
    "story": [
      "Can a navigation app be held responsible if a user gets into an accident?",
      "That is the question being asked in India after three men died when their car veered off an unfinished bridge and fell on to a riverbed in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.",
      "Police are still investigating the incident, which took place on Sunday, but they believe that Google Maps led the group to take that route.",
      "A part of the bridge had reportedly collapsed earlier this year because of floods and while locals knew this and avoided the bridge, the three men were not aware of this and were from outside the area. There were no barricades or sign boards indicating that the bridge was unfinished.",
      "Authorities have named four engineers from the state's road department and an unnamed official from Google Maps in a police complaint on charges of culpable homicide.",
      "A spokesperson from Google told BBC Hindi that it was co-operating with the investigation.",
      "The tragic accident has spotlighted India's poor road infrastructure and sparked a debate on whether navigation apps like Google Maps share responsibility for such incidents.",
      "Some blame the app for not providing accurate information while others argue that it is a larger failure on the part of the government for not cordoning off the place.",
      "Google Maps is the most popular navigation app in India and has become synonymous with GPS (Global Positioning System), a satellite-based radio navigation system.",
      "It also powers the services of many ride-sharing, e-commerce and food delivery platforms. The app reportedly has around 60 million active users and witnesses around 50 million searches in a day.",
      "But the app has frequently come under scrutiny for providing incorrect directions, sometimes leading to fatal accidents.",
      "In 2021, a man from Maharashtra state drowned after he drove his car into a dam, allegedly while following directions on the app.",
      "Last year, two young doctors in Kerala state died after they drove their car into a river.  Police said that they had been following a route shown by the app and cautioned people against relying on it too much when roads were flooded.",
      "But how does Google Maps learn about changes on a road?",
      "GPS signals from users\u2019 apps track traffic changes along routes - an increase signals congestion, while a decrease suggests a road is less used. The app also receives updates from governments and users about traffic jams or closures.",
      "Complaints related to high traffic, or the ones notified by authorities are given priority, as Google does not have the manpower to deal with the millions of complaints streaming in daily, says Ashish Nair, the founder of mapping platform Potter Maps and a former Google Maps employee.",
      "\"A map operator then uses satellite imagery, Google Street View and government notifications to confirm the change and update the map.\"",
      "According to Mr Nair, navigating apps cannot be held responsible for mishaps as their terms of services make it clear that users must apply their own judgement on the road and that the information provided by the app might differ from actual conditions.",
      "Besides, it is simply very difficult for a platform like Google, which manages maps across the world, to keep across every change that happens on a road, he adds.",
      "Unlike other countries, India also does not have a robust system for reporting such issues on time.",
      "\"Data remains a big challenge in India. There is no system for infrastructural changes to be logged into a web interface, which can then be used by apps like Google Maps. Countries like Singapore have such a system,\" Mr Nair says.",
      "He adds that India's vast population and fast-paced development make it even more challenging to get accurate, real-time data. \"In other words, bad maps are here to stay until governments become more proactive about collecting and sharing data.\"",
      "Lawyers are divided on whether GPS apps can be held legally responsible for road accidents.",
      "Advocate Saima Khan says that since India's Information Technology (IT) Act gives digital platforms like Google Maps the status of an 'intermediary' (a platform that merely disseminates information provided by a third party) it is protected against liability.",
      "But she adds that if it can be proven that the platform did not rectify its data despite being given correct, timely information, then it might be held liable for   negligence.",

      "But in Israel, some feel they have lost the chance to do more damage to Hezbollah.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met the heads of Israel\u2019s northern municipalities, which have been turned into ghost towns with around 60,000 civilians evacuated further south.",
      "Israel\u2019s Ynet news website reported that it was an angry meeting that turned into a shouting match, with some of the local officials frustrated that Israel was taking the pressure off their enemies in Lebanon and not offering an immediate plan to get civilians home.",
      "In a newspaper column, the mayor of Kiryat Shmona, close to the border, said he doubted the ceasefire would be enforced, demanding that Israel creates a buffer zone in south Lebanon. In a poll commissioned by the Israeli station Channel 12 News those questioned were roughly split between supporters and opponents of the ceasefire.",
      "Half of the participants in the survey believe Hezbollah has not been defeated and 30% think the ceasefire will collapse.",
      "Back in late September, at the UN General Assembly in New York, a deal looked as if it was close. Diplomats from the US and UK were convinced that a ceasefire very similar to the one that is now coming into force was about to happen.",
      "All sides in the war appeared to have signalled their willingness to accept a ceasefire based on the provisions of Security Council resolution 1701, which was passed to end the 2006 Lebanon war: Hezbollah would pull back from the border to be replaced by UN peacekeepers and the Lebanese Armed Forces. As they moved in, Israeli forces would gradually move out.",
      "But Prime Minister Netanyahu went to the podium at the UN to deliver a fiery speech that refused to accept any pause in Israel\u2019s offensive.",
      "Back at his New York hotel Netanyahu\u2019s official photographer captured the moment as he ordered the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, along with most of his high command. Netanyahu\u2019s office released the photos, in another calculated snub for American diplomacy.",
      "The assassination was a significant escalation and a blow to Hezbollah. In the weeks since, Israel\u2019s military has inflicted immense damage to Hezbollah\u2019s military organisation. It could still fire rockets over the border and its fighters continued to engage Israel\u2019s invasion force. But Hezbollah is no longer the same threat to Israel.",

      "Military success is one of several factors that have come together to persuade Benjamin Netanyahu that this is a good time to stop.",

      "If Hezbollah looks to be preparing an attack, Israel has a side letter from the Americans agreeing that it can take military action.",
      "In a recorded statement announcing his decision, Netanyahu listed the reasons why it was time for a ceasefire. Israel, he said, had made the ground in Beirut shake. Now there was a chance \u2018to give our forces a breather and replenish stocks,\u2019 he continued.",
      "Israel had also broken the connection between Gaza and Lebanon. After the late Hassan Nasrallah ordered the attacks on Israel\u2019s north, the day after Hamas went to war on 7 October last year, he said they would continue until there was a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "Now, Netanyahu said, Hamas in Gaza would be under even more pressure. Palestinians fear another escalation in Israel\u2019s Gaza offensive.",
      "There was one more reason; to concentrate on what Netanyahu called the Iranian threat. Damaging Hezbollah means damaging Iran. It was built up by the Iranians to create a threat right on Israel\u2019s border. Hezbollah became the strongest part of Iran\u2019s axis of resistance, the name it gave to its network of forward defence made up of allies and proxies.",
      "Why Iran wanted a ceasefire",
      "Just like Hezbollah\u2019s surviving leaders, their patrons in Iran also wanted a ceasefire. Hezbollah needs a pause to lick its wounds. Iran needs to stop the geostrategic bleeding. Its axis of resistance is no longer a deterrent. Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel after Nasrallah\u2019s assassination did not repair the damage.",
      "Two men, both now assassinated, designed Hezbollah to deter Israel not just from attacking Lebanon \u2013 but also from attacking Iran. They were Qasem Soleimani, head of the Quds Force of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, who was killed by an American drone strike at Baghdad airport in January 2020. The order was issued by Donald Trump in his last few weeks in the White House at the end of his first term. The other was Hassan Nasrallah, killed by a huge Israeli air strike in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs.",
      "Hezbollah and Iran\u2019s deterrence strategy matched Israel\u2019s own deterrence for almost 20 years after the end of the 2006 war. But among the profound changes caused by the 7 October attacks was Israel\u2019s determination not to accept restrictions on the wars it would wage in response. America, its most important ally, also put almost no restrictions on the supply or use of the weapons it kept on providing.",
      "Nasrallah and Iran failed to see what had happened. They did not understand how Israel had changed.  They sought to impose a war of attrition on Israel, and succeeded for almost a year. Then on 17 September Israel broke out of it by triggering the miniature bombs built into the network of booby-trapped pagers its intelligence services had duped Hezbollah into buying.",
      "Hezbollah was thrown off balance. Before it could react with the most powerful weapons Iran had provided, Israel killed Nasrallah and most of his key lieutenants, accompanied by massive strikes that destroyed arms dumps. That was followed by an invasion of South Lebanon and the wholesale destruction of Lebanese border villages as well as Hezbollah\u2019s tunnel network.",
      "Trump, Gaza and the future",
      "A ceasefire in Lebanon is not necessarily a precursor to one in Gaza. Gaza is different. The war there is about more than security of the border, and Israeli hostages.",
      "It is also about revenge, about Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s political survival, and his government\u2019s absolute rejection of Palestinian aspirations for independence.",

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 10:09:06 -0500",
    "summary": "At 32, she's an accomplished actor, successful singer-songwriter, billionaire business owner, and philanthropist. But Selena Gomez's gutsiest move may have been sharing her real self.",
    "story": [
      "On any red carpet, Selena Gomez is the picture of beauty, poise and confidence. But she'll be the first to tell you that things aren't always what they appear. For instance, her latest film: \"Emilia P\u00e9rez.\" Gomez co-stars as the wife of a powerful Mexican drug lord who secretly transitions. The film is a hard-hitting true crime story, a poignant love story, a journey of self-discovery \u2013 and a musical. But somehow it all works.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" click on the video player below:",
      "Gomez said shooting left her \"a little sore\" from all the dance numbers. So, why did she want to do it? \"I found it incredibly compelling,\" she said. \"I've never really seen a movie like this before. I don't think I've ever been this proud of something in the acting field.\"",
      "And that's really saying something; at 32, Gomez has a lot to be proud of: She's an accomplished actor, but she's also a very successful singer-songwriter, and thanks to her wildly popular Rare Beauty line of cosmetics, she's a billionaire, and a very active philanthropist. It's all quite impressive, and even more so when you realize where she started.",
      "Gomez was born in the Texas town of Grand Prairie. Her mom, Mandy Teefy, was only 16 years old. Selena's parents split when she was five. She says the family had a lot of love, and not much else, with tough times when her mother struggled to put food on the table. \"My mom worked multiple jobs,\" she said. \"She also was finishing high school when she was having me. When I'm doing something great today, it just makes me more thankful for the lessons that my mother taught me.\"",
      "Gomez was barely 10 when she landed a part on TV's \"Barney & Friends,\" and a few years later she became a fixture on the Disney Channel, on such shows as \"Wizards of Waverly Place.\"",
      "She branched out into music, and became a pop sensation. And when the pandemic came, she switched gears again, hosting \"Selena + Chef,\" a popular online cooking show shot in the kitchen of her L.A. home. \"We had cameras everywhere, from every aspect of it,\" she said.",
      "And how are her cooking skills now? \"They're not that great, I'm not gonna lie!\" she laughed.",
      "And then, in 2021 she helped cook up one of the biggest hits on TV: \"Only Murders in the Building.\" She praised her co-stars, Steve Martin and Martin Short: \"These men, Steve and Martin, have been working longer than I've been alive, but they are the first ones to be on set. They take time to ask everyone they run into how their day is. And on top of it, they think everything through. They are wonderful people, and they've helped me grow up in a lot of ways. These guys have become my friends and allies and people I can ask advice from. I couldn't be more grateful to work with them.\"",
      "Gomez is the first to admit that she's had a magical life, and that it hasn't always been a bed of roses. She's been open about her health struggles, like having lupus and receiving a kidney transplant.",
      "She also decided to take her struggles with anxiety and depression, and her bipolar diagnosis, public. Her 2022 documentary, \"Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me,\" is an unvarnished look at her life \u2013 the highs and the very deep lows.",
      "She admits she was a little nervous about sharing it with the world but, \"once I released it, it felt like a huge relief, because I am a firm believer that one of the strongest things you can do is be vulnerable. And that doesn't mean you have to pour your heart out to everyone. But I made that choice, because I knew I wasn't the only one that felt that way. And if my world was already out there for everyone to see, I'd like to tell my part of the story. And to add on that, it's a dream what I'm doing.\"",
      "Part of what her dream is was a benefit held last month for her Rare Impact Fund, a charity aimed at helping young people who suffer from the same mental health challenges she's been through. \"This is probably the most important thing to me, besides my family,\" she said. \"This is the cherry on top of everything.\"",
      "Another high point is her relationship with music producer Benny Blanco, whom People Magazine named one of the sexiest men alive. \"Yeah, that's my man!\" Gomez said. \"To know that there is someone in the world that deeply cares about every tiny detail about who I am, I'm really, really lucky.\"",
      "It's clear from \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" that she's an artist who likes to take risks. But Selena Gomez's gutsiest move has been sharing her real self, and that has made all the difference.",
      "I asked, \"The reaction in general has been overwhelmingly positive, hasn't it?\"",
      "\"Sure. Maybe,\" Gomez replied.",
      "Maybe?\u00a0 \"It's not that I really need anyone's approval,\" she added. \"I think I'm just really, I'm okay with where I am and who I am. And I'm glad. I'm glad that I finally got there.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 09:38:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Since 1996, the New York City and Santa Fe-based disc jockey has hosted \"Elvis Duran and the Morning Show,\" the country's most popular Top-40 morning program.",
    "story": [
      "If the annual Jingle Ball at New York's Madison Square Garden is the Super Bowl of holiday concerts, then Elvis Duran is in the role of head coach. From introducing acts like Olivia Rodrigo, to mingling with pop princesses (\"Sabrina Carpenter, everyone!\"), and interviewing rock royalty like Cher, on this day, this Elvis is king.",
      "But he says being interviewed for TV is different for him: \"I'm not a camera guy, I'm a radio guy,\" he said.",
      "If you don't recognize his face, you may know his voice. Since 1996 the 60-year-old disc jockey has been host of \"Elvis Duran and the Morning Show,\" the country's most popular Top 40 morning program. \"I can't believe it's been 30 years, because it's been nothing but fun,\" he said.",
      "Every day, millions of listeners nationwide wake up to Duran and his crew dishing about music, pop culture \u2026 pretty much whatever's on their minds. \"I've been working with some of the same people for 25-30 years,\" he said. \"The energy with each other is what makes it work. I don't need to be the center of attention.\"",
      "With 70 markets across the country listening, Duran's a rarity these days \u2013 a nationally-known radio DJ.",
      "I asked, \"Growing up, I remember big-name radio DJs. Now it's kind of you and Ryan Seacrest. What happened?\"",
      "\"Radio isn't what radio used to be,\" Duran replied. \"A lot of radio companies gave up on personalities; they just wanted to play music, it's cheaper. That's not good for our business. So, I've done everything I can to keep personality on a radio show in the mornings.\"",
      "And it's Duran's personality that over the years has won him loyal fans, including some of the biggest names in pop music. \"Lady Gaga grew up dreaming of hearing her song on our show,\" he said. \"And when she walked into the room, she was sort of nervous. And I was thinking, 'Well, shouldn't it be the opposite way? It is Lady Gaga!'\"",
      "But it's everyday listeners with whom Duran feels a special bond. He said, \"We are in the friendship business. I think about you when you hop in your car in the morning. You're either leaving a house that may be full of turmoil, or going to a job with a boss you don't like. But I have you for 20-30 minutes, and I can be your friend.\"",
      "Duran fell in love with radio as a kid: \"I'd spend the night at my grandmother's house when mom and dad were out late, and I listened to the radio. And I became friends with this voice in the dark.\"",
      "He was just seven and growing up in McKinney, Texas. \"I didn't have a lot of friends growing up. I was a loner. And so, I found friendship through the radio.\"",
      "And so began his quest to become one of those voices. He even built his own transmitter, with a studio located in his bedroom closet. \"My only listener was the lady next door.\"",
      "Duran's first real radio job came at age 14. After dropping out of college, he spent a decade bouncing between markets across the country. \"Back in the old days in radio, you never unpacked, you never took dishes out of boxes, because you were always moving,\" he said. \"But you know what, I've been very lucky. I've been at Z100 since 1989. So, I'm doing okay.\"",
      "While his show is based in the Big Apple, Duran's heart belongs in New Mexico. As a kid, he visited the \"Land of Enchantment\" frequently. He says the quiet of Santa Fe is the polar opposite of New York City. \"Of course, I need that. Santa Fe is a magical place. And I think, in some ways, this city has kind of saved my life a little bit. It's good to be in a situation where you're forced to relax.\"",
      "Duran and his husband, Alex Carr, share a home here, not far from where they were married in 2019. But decades before their first date, they had a chance encounter \u2013 where else? \u2013 on the radio, back in 1998. \"I had him on as a contest winner once,\" Duran said.\u00a0 \"Jingle Ball tickets. How old were you?\"",
      "\"Eighteen,\" said Carr.",
      "\"Ooh, God!\"",
      "Duran often hosts his show from Santa Fe. Thanks to a home studio, his commute is short. \"Every morning at 2:30 a.m. Santa Fe time, I slither up this staircase, and here you go.\"",
      "I asked, \"Is the Elvis in New Mexico a different Elvis than the Elvis in the New York studio?\"",
      "\"Oh, absolutely,\" he replied. \"And everyone back in New York has said to me at one time or another, 'You're so relaxed out there. We really like the New Mexico Elvis.'\"",
      "Duran can't say how long he'll keep broadcasting (\"To be able to do this this long, with this family, it's a miracle, it really is\"), but he isn't ready to mute his microphone just yet. He's still got a lot of friends to keep company.",
      "Asked how much this goes back to the seven-year-old Elvis listening to that voice on the radio, Duran replied, \"All of it. You know, I'm not lonely anymore. I never, ever want to go back to being a lonely person ever again. And I don't want anyone listening to our show to be lonely. That's the legacy we're all trying to leave. I don't want them to remember my name; I just want them to remember how we made them feel every day. That's it.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 09:24:56 -0500",
    "summary": "It was in the chaos of a kitchen where the chef, restaurateur and TV cooking judge (and author of the new cookbook-memoir, \"Why I Cook\") learned how to be himself.",
    "story": [
      "When you find yourself at the farmer's market next to a guy with strong opinions about fennel and scallions, you listen. That's especially true if the guy is Tom Colicchio, who for more than 20 seasons has been a judge on one of America's biggest food shows, \"Top Chef,\" while also working as one of America's most successful restaurateurs.",
      "Many of his celebrated dishes have started at a local greenmarket in New York City's Union Square, but lately the meals he enjoys the most are even more local than these ingredients. \"I cook very simply at home,\" he said. \"It's not the food part of it. I enjoy the half an hour, 45 minutes that we're sitting together as a family.\"",
      "Now 62, married and a father of three, Colicchio is sharing the story of his many lives in the kitchen in a new book, \"Why I Cook\" (Artisan).",
      "So, why does he cook? \"Partly it was something that I found at a very young age that I was good at,\" he said. \"It came very easy.\"",
      "Thomas Patrick Colicchio grew up in Elizabeth, New Jersey, sharing a bedroom with two brothers, and big boisterous family meals in a working-class Italian neighborhood. While mom ran the family kitchen, it was dad, a gambler-turned-corrections officer, who helped turn Tom into a chef. \"Having ADHD, I struggled with recipes; I'd get frustrated by recipes,\" Colicchio said. \"But I loved cooking. And my dad wasn't the kind of dad who sat down and had these long conversations with you about your future. But he came home with these books \u2013 I had no idea what 'La Technique' was doing in a county jail library, but there it was!\"",
      "Yes, Jacques Pepin's \"La Technique\" is what helped Colicchio understand the fundamentals of cooking. \"Once I understood that, I could look at a recipe and go, 'Oh, they want me to roast something here. I know how to roast something. So, I don't need a recipe anymore,'\" he said. \"Or I can braise something. But now when I braise it, well, I can change the flavor profile by adding different things into that braise.\"",
      "The kitchen, however, was where Colicchio learned how to be himself, a place where in the chaos of orders and ingredients, he found a calling.",
      "His career took off fast, from flipping burgers at a local snack bar, to building whole menus at a North New Jersey hot spot, and ultimately to New York City, where \u2013 not yet 30 \u2013 he earned his first three-star review from The New York Times, at Mondrian.",
      "Colicchio doesn't credit his family for his entrepreneurial spirit: \"I think it came from the fact that I worked in kitchens and worked in restaurants that I didn't like. And I didn't want to have a boss.\"",
      "But even as he soared professionally \u2013 becoming executive chef at New York's celebrated Gramercy Tavern - Colicchio's private life was cruising toward rock-bottom. \"I was doing drugs when I was cooking the whole time,\" he said. \"Had a bad night and ended up in Harlem somewhere, you know, with another cook getting a bunch of drugs and, you know, getting high all night. I woke up in my bed \u2026 my shirt was covered in blood. I don't remember getting home, which kind of scared me, 'cause I was driving a motorcycle. So, somehow I made it home. But that was it. I woke up and said, 'That's it. No more.'\"",
      "He quit the drugs, but his working-class roots still led to some awkward moments in the Frenchified, fancy world of fine dining. \"I knew I could hold my own, but I just still felt like I was a fish out of water here,\" he said. \"Now I'm in New York. You know, you get three stars, now all of a sudden you're getting pulled in a lot of different directions. Was there a certain amount of impostor syndrome? Absolutely.\"",
      "He said he tried saying no to \"Top Chef\" (\"Didn't really love food TV\"), but then he had the experience of attending a food festival: \"Come time to sign books, and I'm sitting next to Bobby Flay, and he's signing 300 and I'm signing 20. I didn't think it was because he had a better book. He was on TV. It was like, 'All right, let me do this TV thing.'\"",
      "Looking back now, in his new book, Colicchio traces the arc of a changing industry, where sexism and even abuse has been replaced by something a little kinder, and a lot more welcoming. \"There's still voices being raised,\" he said. \"It's a little different than it used to be, but there's still, you know, in the middle of service there were times you got to be forceful. But you can be sure it's not personal. What's really missing is a lot of the misogyny that I saw.\"",
      "But for Tom Colicchio, after all these years, the one thing that hasn't changed is the one thing that also keeps him in the kitchen: \"Looking back on it, food has the power to bring people around a table. And to this day, I love doing dinner parties, love having people over. That's another reason why I cook.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 10:28:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Target is the only place you can buy the latest Taylor Swift merch, including a new book, vinyl and CD.",
    "story": [
      "Taylor Swift's latest release isn't a new song or album \u2014 it's a book commemorating the pop star's\u00a0record-setting\u00a0\"Eras Tour,\" which hit store shelves on Black Friday.",
      "The collector's item chronicles Swift's wildly successful concert tour, which concludes in December and which last year became the first music tour to gross over $1 billion.",
      "A movie version of the concert she performed on her Eras Tour also shattered box office records. It earned an estimated $96 million domestically over its opening weekend, making it the most successful concert film of all time, according to Comscore.",
      "Where can I buy the book?",
      "The new keepsake, titled \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Book,\" is available exclusively at Target. It hit the retailer's stores on Friday, while it will become available for sale on Target's website\u00a0on Saturday. Swift self-published the book under Taylor Swift Publications.",
      "Some Target stores opened as early as 6 a.m. in anticipation of Black Friday shopping crowds and Taylor Swift fans.",
      "Target first teased the book launch in an Instagram\u00a0post on Oct. 15. Swift herself also promoted the book in an Instagram\u00a0post that garnered more than 3.6 million likes.",
      "What's in The Eras Tour book?",
      "The 256-page hardcover title, which costs $39.99, includes unreleased photographs of Swift in concert from every period of her career, according to Target.",
      "The book also documents the production of Swift's epic Eras Tour, which kicked off in August 2023, including \"personal reflections\" written by the artist herself.",
      "In tandem with the book release, Target is also exclusively launching \"The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology\" album as both a vinyl record and CD. The recording feature 35 tracks, including four acoustic versions of the following songs: \"Fortnight,\" \"Down Bad,\" \"But Daddy I Love Him\" and \"Guilty as Sin?\"",
      "Two million copies of the book have been printed, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Assuming the initial print run sells out, it would generate nearly $80 million in sales. Forbes puts Swift's net at worth $1. 6 billion, including $600 million from music royalties and touring, a music catalog valued at an estimated $600 million, and $125 million in real estate.",
      "Swift alone could be a forceful enough economic engine to boost Target. The retailer's latest sales and profit figures fell short of analysts' expectations, while Target lowered its earnings forecast for the current quarter. Analysts say that inflation-weary consumers are after deeper discounts than the retailer can offer, or simply aren't making as many discretionary purchases.",
      "\"Consumers tell us their budgets remain stretched, and they are shopping carefully,\" Target CEO Brian Cornell said in a Nov. 20 earnings call.",
      "That restraint seems unlikely to deter the Swifties, the singer's rabid fans, as she prepares to wind up the Eras Tour in Vancouver on Dec. 8.",

      "In settling, the plaintiffs said they assign no \"ill intent\" to Rose and realize now that his conduct could be subject to interpretation.",
      "Lawyers for Rose and the women \u2014 younger employees who accused him of \"predatory behavior\" and \"blatant and repeated sexual harassment\" \u2014 filed court papers this week confirming that the lawsuit has been resolved. An online court docket listed the case as settled. The terms were not disclosed.",
      "The lawsuit had been set to go to trial Monday in Manhattan after years of sparring over the women's allegations and the dismissal of their retaliation claims against Rose.",
      "Plaintiffs Katherine Brooks Harris, Sydney McNeal and Yuqing Wei said in a statement that the litigation process and the required pretrial exchange of evidence known as discovery had enabled both sides to \"better understand each others' points of view.\"",
      "\"On reflection, and after having the benefit of discovery, we realize that different people could interpret the conduct in different ways, and therefore we have resolved the claims,\" the women said. \"We do not assign any bad motive or ill intent to Charlie Rose.\"",
      "A lawyer for Rose, 82, and his production company, Charlie Rose Inc., declined comment.",
      "The veteran TV host has apologized in the past for his behavior, including in a statement on the eve of his November 2017 firing after at least eight women had come forward to accuse him of misconduct.",
      "\"It is essential that these women know I hear them and I deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior,\" Rose said. \"I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.\"",
      "Rose's downfall was part of America's #MeToo reckoning with sexual misconduct by powerful figures \u2014 a social media-fueled movement that also took down \"Today\" host Matt Lauer and movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, among others. In September 2018, Rose said the three women he settled with this week were \"exploiting the #MeToo movement\" when he filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.",
      "Rose is now hosting an interview show on YouTube where his recent guests have included author Michael Lewis and broadcaster Bob Costas.",
      "Harris, McNeal and Wei sued Rose and CBS in state court in New York in May 2018, about six months after CBS fired him as an anchor on its morning show, then called \"CBS This Morning,\" and PBS and Bloomberg Television dropped his nightly \"Charlie Rose Show,\" which had been on the air since 1991.",
      "Harris was a broadcast associate at \"CBS This Morning,\" and she later worked as an associate producer for Rose's PBS show. McNeal was Rose's executive assistant. Wei was a news associate and later an anchor assistant for Rose at \"CBS This Morning.\"",
      "The women, all in their early 20s when they were hired, accused the much older Rose of subjecting them to repeated physical and verbal sexual harassment while working, including inquires about their sex lives and boasts about his own. Harris and McNeal alleged that Rose said \"they were hired because he likes 'tall women,' i.e., he was attracted to them,\" and Wei alleged that Rose referred to her \"as China doll.\"\u00a0 The three women also accused CBS of knowingly failing to prevent Rose's harassment.",
      "CBS settled in December 2018 for an undisclosed sum. The network said at the time that the women had requested the terms be kept confidential.",
      "Had the lawsuit gone to trial, Rose's lawyer said in court papers that he would challenge the credibility of Harris, McNeal and Wei's claims with evidence showing they had previously expressed little or no concern about the ex-anchor.",
      "Among the evidence, lawyer Jonathan Bach wrote in a Nov. 13 filing, were documents showing that Wei told a CBS human resources officer that she experienced nothing \"sexually inappropriate\" while working for Rose and that McNeal confided in her therapist at the time that she had no personal experience of sexual harassment by Rose.",
      "Other evidence cited by Bach showed that Harris had told her therapist that any harassment by Rose was \"very subtle\" and that she wrote to Rose two months after working for him that his interactions with her were \"always professional and respectful.\"",

      "\"Not Like Us,\" the result of Lamar and Drake's weekslong beef, broke records on the Billboard rap charts, retaining the top spot all summer.

The urgent care centers around them were closed for the night, so around 10:30 p.m. she decided to take Ryan to the emergency room at Carle Health.",
      "The medical procedure",
      "The ER wasn't very busy when they arrived at 10:48 p.m., Wettstein recalled. Medical records indicate they checked in and she explained Ryan's symptoms, including an intermittent fever. The toddler was triaged and given a nasal swab test to check for Covid-19 and influenza A and B.",

      "Under the public health emergency declared in 2020 for the Covid pandemic, insurance companies were required to pay for Covid tests without copayments or cost sharing for patients.",
      "That requirement ended when the emergency declaration expired in May 2023. Now, it is often patients who foot the bill \u2014 and ER bills are notoriously high.",

      "The rates the insurance companies negotiate with hospitals for various procedures are often based on multipliers of what Medicare pays, Adler said.",
      "Lab tests are one of the few areas in which insurance companies can often pay less than Medicare, he said \u2014 the exception being when the test is performed by the hospital laboratory, which is often what happens during ER visits.",
      "Medicare pays $142.63 for the joint test that Ryan received, but the family is on the hook for more than twice that amount, and the initial hospital charge was over three times as much.",
      "The hospital is \"utilizing their market power to make as much money as possible, and the insurance companies are not all that good at pushing back,\" Adler said. A markup of a few hundred dollars is a drop in the bucket for big insurers. But for the patients who get unexpected bills, it can be a big burden.",
      "Brittany Simon, a public relations manager for Carle Health, did not respond to specific questions but said in a statement, \"We follow policies that support the safety and wellbeing of our patients, which includes the initial triage of symptomatic patients to the Emergency Department.\"",
      "While Ryan's family would not have had to pay for a Covid test during the public health emergency, it was the family's insurer, Cigna, that did not have to pay this time, since the family had not yet met a $3,000 yearly deductible.",
      "A Cigna representative did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The resolution",
      "Wettstein said she knew she could just pay the bill and be done with it, \"but the fact that I never saw a provider, and the fact that it was just for a Covid test, is mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "She contacted the hospital's billing department to make sure the bill was correct. She explained what happened and said the hospital representative was also surprised by the size of the bill and sent it up for further review.",
      "\"'Don't pay this until you hear from me,'\" Wettstein remembered being told.",
      "Soon, though, she received a letter from the hospital explaining that the charge was correct and supported by documentation.",
      "Wettstein thought she was avoiding any charges by taking Ryan home without being seen. Instead, she got a bill \"that they have verified that I have to pay.\"",
      "\"Like I said, it's mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "The takeaway",
      "ERs are among the most expensive options for care in the nation's health system, and the meter can start running as soon as you check in \u2014 even if you check out before receiving care.",
      "If your issue isn't life-threatening, consider an urgent care facility, which is often cheaper (and look for posted notices to confirm whether it's actually an urgent care clinic). The urgent care centers near Ryan's home were closed that evening, but some facilities stay open late or around the clock.",
      "In some ways, Wettstein was lucky. KFF Health News' \"Bill of the Month\" has received tips from other patients who left an ER after a long wait without seeing a doctor \u2014 and got slapped with a facility fee of over $1,000.",
      "Making the decision about where to go is tough, especially in a stressful situation \u2014 such as when the patient is too young to communicate what's wrong. Trying to figure out what's going on physically with a 3-year-old can feel impossible.",
      "If you decide to leave an ER without treatment, don't just walk out. Tell the triage nurse you're leaving. You might get lucky and avoid some charges.",
      "Wettstein won't think twice about taking Ryan to the pediatrician or an urgent care center the next time she's ailing. But, Wettstein said, after getting this bill, \"I'm not going to create a habit out of going to the emergency room.\"",
      "Bill of the Month is a crowdsourced investigation by KFF Health News and The Washington Post's Well+Being that dissects and explains medical bills. Since 2018, this series has helped many patients and readers get their medical bills reduced, and it has been cited in statehouses, at the U.S. Capitol, and at the White House.

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 05:00:17 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal panel has been meeting for months to draft recommendations.",
    "story": [
      "A monthslong process to decide the federal government's food recommendations for the next five years is now set to stretch well into 2025. That timing means Biden officials will miss their opportunity to lock in new guidelines before the Trump administration takes over.",
      "Switching terms in the middle of an update is unprecedented in recent history, though previous versions have come close: an update in 2005 was finished days before the inauguration and the 2020 revision came a month before Biden took office.",
      "The guidelines are hotly contested in Washington because they influence a broad array of federal programs, ranging from rules on nutrition labels to standards for school lunches. They are traditionally based around a scientific report from outside experts.",
      "That committee has been meeting since last year, wrestling with an array of controversial questions, and is not expected to issue its recommendations until mid-December. It usually takes several months after their report is done for officials to publish their guidelines.",
      "This timeline was decided long before Election Day, one person familiar with the process told CBS News.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS did not comment on the timing of the report, except to confirm that it is expected \"later in the year.\"",
      "\"HHS and USDA continue to demonstrate their commitment to transparency, equity, and scientific integrity throughout the entire process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "It is virtually impossible for the Biden administration to finish an update before leaving office, former officials said. Too many tasks remain, like vetting the findings and developing and testing updated messaging through tools like MyPlate, which replaced the food pyramid.",
      "\"This is a very heavy lift, given the complexity and given the points of view of the different departments,\" said Dr. Brett Giroir, who served as assistant secretary for health in HHS under the Trump administration's last revision.",
      "Input from the public and agencies also must be worked into the guidelines, before the agriculture and health departments can come to an agreement.",
      "\"My belief is that when Congress tells two agencies to collaborate on something, that is an intended tension, hopefully to move the final product in the right direction. And I think certainly folks would agree that HHS and USDA often come from different constituencies, different perspectives,\" said Brandon Lipps, who was the USDA's deputy under secretary for food, nutrition and consumer services under Trump.",
      "One expected fight will be over proposals floated last month by members of the committee \"to emphasize plant sources\" of protein, as part of a broader recommendation to \"shift\" to more \"nutrient dense, plant-based meals.\"",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump had accused his rival of wanting to \"stop people from eating red meat.\" In a statement last month, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association denounced the recommendations as \"unhinged\" and \"impractical.\"",
      "Under the drafts, beans, peas and lentils could be listed as protein sources too, not just vegetables. Red meat would be moved down the ranking of protein foods, over health concerns like cardiovascular disease.",
      "Red meats often needed to be substituted the most in American diets, analyses by the committee concluded, to cut health risks and still meet nutritional goals.",
      "\"Red meats, whether they were processed or not, were the ones to reduce more than the poultry or the eggs. So I would've put them very last,\" said Christopher Gardner, a member of the committee.",
      "How Trump administration officials could change the guidelines",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made changes to the committee a central part of his \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform.",
      "\"What we need to do is change the panel, so they're making good recommendations and they're telling people don't eat these foods,\" Kennedy said in September.",
      "They could also offer Kennedy a vehicle to accomplish his goals, like curbing ultra-processed foods in school lunches. If confirmed as secretary, Kennedy and his counterpart at USDA would have the ultimate authority over what goes into the guidelines.",
      "\"If Congress wanted a group of scientists to write the dietary guidelines, they would have put that in statute. So the committee makes recommendations, and the secretaries take the input from that report,\" said Lipps.",
      "Completely ignoring the committee's work would be unprecedented, though departments in the past \u2013 often driven by career civil servants \u2013 have sometimes disagreed with some recommendations.",
      "\"The process is not perfect, there's bureaucracy in there. But I do believe having transparent scientific committees that everybody knows where it's coming from is the best way to go,\" said Giroir.",

    "summary": "As the holiday shopping season kicks off, here are five ways retailers try to get consumers to spend.",
    "story": [
      "As shoppers gear up for Black Friday and the holiday shopping season, it can be easy for people to rack up debt that will weigh them down well into the new year. So it pays for consumers to be aware of some of the tactics retailers employ to get them to spend.",
      "For example, most offers that dangle savings in the form of free shipping or a free gift if you spend over a certain amount don't save you money. The practice, called \"spaving,\" or spending more in order to save, rarely benefits consumers, according to personal finance experts.",
      "\"I understand the appeal of getting to checkout and a notification pops up saying spend $10 more to get some perk,\" LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But 90% of the time when you break it down, it doesn't make sense. You're not actually saving money if you are spending more of it.\"",
      "Here are five tactics retailers use to get you to spend more, according to the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), a consumer advocacy group.",
      "Creating a false sense of urgency",
      "The fear of missing out on a good deal can nudge consumers into making impulse buys. Although some offers really are only valid for a limited time, U.S. PIRG identified a number of sellers on Etsy, an e-commerce site for independent craftspeople, who used fake countdown clocks for deals that never expire.",
      "Of 20 top-selling products on the site with countdown timers on deals, 80% of them simply reset when their tickers tickers hit \"0,\" according to a PIRG study.",
      "\"The 'limited' time window may not be as limited as it sounds and the deals not as good as they seem,\" U.S. PIRG's R.J. Cross told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Make your list, comparison shop on those items, and don't get distracted by offers you haven't had the time to think through.\"",
      "Implying scarcity",
      "Online retailers may label products as \"selling fast!\" or, as a consumer is considering a purchase, display how many other consumers are browsing the same item.",
      "\"Retailers and advertisers are always trying to get you to buy more than you need and spend more than you want,\" Cross said in a statement.\u00a0\"Once you know what to look for, you end up chuckling when you see these tactics instead of falling for them.\"",
      "Pricing tricks",
      "Ever wonder why a price reads $4.99 and not simply $5? When sellers round an item's price down, it suggests to a shopper that it is cheaper, PIRG notes. Although $4.99 is only a penny less than $5, a shopper is more likely to fixate on the dollar figure \u2014 $4 \u2014 versus the cents.",
      "Even removing a comma from a high sticker price like $1,200 and displaying it as $1200 can entice someone to pull the trigger, according to PIRG. Meanwhile, breaking the cost of an item down into monthly installments can also make the price seem smaller than it really is, the organization noted.",
      "\"You're still going to have to pay the full cost, and sometimes\u00a0even more in late fees, if you're not careful,\" Cross pointed out.",
      "Dubious testimonials",
      "Many retailers feature online testimonials ostensibly from customers raving about a \"life-changing\" vacuum cleaner or pair of sweatpants. Some of these account are from real customers, while other reviews cannot be trusted because they have been generated by a bot or the company itself, PIRG said.",
      "At bottom, it's a form of peer pressure \u2014 shoppers are subtly induced to think that buying the product will make them as happy as the satisfied customers depicted in the testimonial. In reality, many online reviews are fake, especially as AI bots proliferate.",
      "\"When you look at reviews on a product, don't necessarily take the star ratings for granted. Better to look through the comments and find those that seem real \u2014 that either include a picture of the product or that make a point specific to the product instead of a generic note like 'great product!'\" Cross recommends.",
      "Appeals based on fear",
      "Many marketing pitches and ads suggest that your life will somehow be worse if you don't make a purchase, from being at risk of a home invasion to hair loss. With e-commerce, of course, such messages are tailored to your individual interests and tastes given that website cookies track and share your browsing patterns with retailers.",
      "Messages \"about how to fix our perceived flaws only become more capable of finding us at all hours of the day whenever we go online,\" Cross said.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 13:16:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Some companies are weaving Trump's tariffs into their marketing efforts, telling consumers to buy now in case prices rise.",
    "story": [
      "Some retailers are using President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs to urge consumers to shop now, suggesting if the import duties go into effect next year, a\u00a0range of goods could cost Americans a lot more money.",
      "It's yet another sales tactic some companies are implementing, in addition to the traditional Black Friday discounts, to get consumers to spend as much as possible ahead of the holidays.",
      "On Monday, Trump pledged to add a 25% tariff on all products\u00a0from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% levy on Chinese goods, in an effort to crack down on illegal immigration and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S. The proposed taxes are in addition to earlier campaign promises to impose a baseline 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and a 60% tariff on goods shipped from China, once he takes office.",
      "While\u00a0prices on variety of goods, ranging from shoes to vacuum cleaners, could indeed rise if Trump moves forward with his tariff proposals, some retail experts say that retailers may be seeking to tap into people's universal fear of missing out on a limited-time offer or experience. But the tactic could also rub some shoppers the wrong way, experts caution.",
      "\"It's a double-edged sword. I think it it might get people interested in buying things, but it could also split consumers if they think everyone's going to bring their prices up,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData. \"The other problem is it's slightly political as well, so some retailers would want to steer clear of it.\"",
      "While Trump has said he plans to move forward with tariffs, some economists have pointed out that the next administration may simply use the duties as a bargaining chip, which could enable the White House to strike new trade deals, for instance. Even though the tariffs are far from certain, a number of companies have explicitly said the levies floated by Trump would inevitably force them to raise prices for consumers.",
      "\"Lock in our current prices\"",
      "For example, filtered shower head maker Jolie recently said it would have pass along some of the anticipated costs from the tariffs to consumers. In a recent email to customers, the company said that tariffs on goods made outside of the U.S. would \"mean we would need to raise our prices.\"",
      "\"If you're considering buying a Jolie, now is a great time to lock in our current prices,\" the company added. Currently, a shower head with a filter subscription costs $148. The company announced a \"potential\" new price of $178.",
      "Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy CEO Corie Barry similarly said on its latest earnings call that the goods it sells could become more expensive under Trump's proposed tariffs.",
      "Any added costs on U.S. imports from the three counties \"will be shared by our customers,\" Barry told investors on Nov. 26, noting that \"there's very little in [the] consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "\"Pre-tariff\" sales",
      "And on Facebook, a Dallas, Texas-based furniture store called Finally Home Furnishings, announced a \"pre-tariff sale\" that runs until January, earlier this month.",
      "\"Get a deal while you still can,\" the retailer said.",
      "Finally Home Furnishings did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment, or indicate how much it expects it may need to hike prices if new tariffs go into effect.",
      "Etsy seller Buzzy Park, who sells handmade bamboo picture frames, also advertised a \"pre-tariff \" sale on his entire inventory, starting this month and lasting until any new tariffs go into effect. \"Hurry and get them at their current prices,\" Park wrote in a social media post.",
      "While prices on variety of goods, ranging from shoes to vacuum cleaners, could indeed rise, some marketing and retail experts say that even sellers who don't expect to face added costs could be using potential tariffs as an excuse to charge customers more.",
      "\"If consumers panic about things getting more expensive, they are playing right into the hands of companies around the country to use it as an excuse to raise prices, even when it's not necessary,\" said Scott Lincicome, a trade expert at the Cato Institute, a public policy research group. \"",
      "He added, It's a pretty handy excuse when you are in a constant battle with consumers on price.\"",

      "Target first teased the book launch in an Instagram\u00a0post on Oct. 15. Swift herself also promoted the book in an Instagram\u00a0post that garnered more than 3.6 million likes.",
      "What's in The Eras Tour book?",
      "The 256-page hardcover title, which costs $39.99, includes unreleased photographs of Swift in concert from every period of her career, according to Target.",
      "The book also documents the production of Swift's epic Eras Tour, which kicked off in August 2023, including \"personal reflections\" written by the artist herself.",
      "In tandem with the book release, Target is also exclusively launching \"The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology\" album as both a vinyl record and CD. The recording feature 35 tracks, including four acoustic versions of the following songs: \"Fortnight,\" \"Down Bad,\" \"But Daddy I Love Him\" and \"Guilty as Sin?\"",
      "Two million copies of the book have been printed, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Assuming the initial print run sells out, it would generate nearly $80 million in sales. Forbes puts Swift's net at worth $1. 6 billion, including $600 million from music royalties and touring, a music catalog valued at an estimated $600 million, and $125 million in real estate.",
      "Swift alone could be a forceful enough economic engine to boost Target. The retailer's latest sales and profit figures fell short of analysts' expectations, while Target lowered its earnings forecast for the current quarter. Analysts say that inflation-weary consumers are after deeper discounts than the retailer can offer, or simply aren't making as many discretionary purchases.",
      "\"Consumers tell us their budgets remain stretched, and they are shopping carefully,\" Target CEO Brian Cornell said in a Nov. 20 earnings call.",
      "That restraint seems unlikely to deter the Swifties, the singer's rabid fans, as she prepares to wind up the Eras Tour in Vancouver on Dec. 8.",

    "story": [
      "Canada's antitrust watchdog said Thursday it is suing Google over alleged anticompetitive conduct in the tech giant's online advertising business and wants the company to sell off two of its ad tech services and pay a penalty.",
      "The Competition Bureau said that such action is necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
      "The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about non-compliance with the Competition Act.",
      "The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX. It estimates Google holds a market share of 90% in publisher ad servers, 70% in advertiser networks, 60% in demand-side platforms and 50% in ad exchanges.",
      "This dominance, the bureau said, has discouraged competition from rivals, inhibited innovation, inflated advertising costs and reduced publisher revenues.",
      "\"Google has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors, and distorting the competitive process,\" Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition, said in a statement.",
      "Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector.",
      "Dan Taylor, Google's vice president of global ads, said in a statement that the bureau's complaint \"ignores the intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice.\"",
      "The statement added that Google intends to defend itself against the allegation.",
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup, floated in a 23-page document filed this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" He outlined a timeline for a trial on proposed remedies next spring and plans to issue a decision by August 2025.",
      "Mehta also found that Google in 2021 Google paid about $26 billion to Apple and other partners to ensure its search engine would be the default one on internet browsers.",
      "His ruling stemmed from a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit first filed against Google in October 2020 during the first Trump administration.",
      "Google has already said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling, but the tech giant must wait until he finalizes a remedy before doing so. The appeals process could take as long as five years, predicts George Hay, a law professor at Cornell University who was the chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division for most of the 1970s.",

    "summary": "Experts warn of fabricated websites posing as retailers to scam shoppers looking for Black Friday deals.",
    "story": [
      "Experts are warning that fraudsters are exploiting Black Friday sales to target U.S. shoppers with fake websites and ads for major brands like IKEA, Wayfair and The North Face, after online scams hit record highs in 2023.",
      "A new report released by threat intelligence company EclecticIQ identified a campaign that operates a sprawling network of fabricated websites using \"Trusted Store\" badges to lure shoppers with fake products.",
      "When consumers attempt to make a purchase, scammers steal their personal and payment information. The consumers are often unaware they were scammed until they fail to receive the product.",
      "Reports of online fraud in 2023 exceeded $12.5 billion in potential losses \u2014   a 22% jump from 2022, according to FBI data. Officials say increasingly sophisticated scams are using tools including AI to power their campaigns.",
      "\"With the way it now seems like everyone is shopping online, reliance on digital platforms has handed these groups a wider attack surface than ever,\" EclecticIQ CEO Cody Barrow told CBS News. \"Unfortunately, it's likely we'll see its impact stretch into next week.\"",
      "The scams",
      "EclecticIQ says it identified at least 8,000 fabricated sites that lure shoppers by offering steep \"deals\" on popular brands. The websites are not affiliated with the brands they appear to represent, but are designed to look like official sites and use URLs that appear authentic.",
      "In one example, a site posing as Wayfair used the URL wayfairtoday.com. Another site used the URL wayfairblackfriday.com. The website was registered in early November and offered fake \"deals\" including an $800 mattress reduced to $39.",
      "CBS News also found an ad appropriating Wayfair's logo that directed users to another counterfeit site posing as the retailer. It was removed from Meta's ad library as of Friday. Wayfair told CBS News that it is actively monitoring scams to ensure customers are protected.",
      "Analysts discovered Mandarin coding and Chinese IP addresses on the sites, indicating that the phishing campaign was operated by a China-based group. IKEA told CBS News it was investigating one of the scam websites using its name that EclecticIQ identified.",
      "Separately, an ad on Facebook and Instagram using The North Face logo routed users to a fabricated site. The ad was removed for policy violations, and The North Face told CBS News it was working with Meta and \"other partners\" to combat scam sites.",
      "\"Scammers use every online platform available to them and constantly evolve their tactics in order to evade enforcement,\" said Meta spokesperson Erin Logan. \"In this instance, our systems proactively detected and removed a number of these ads before they were reported to us.\"",
      "The Federal Trade Commission released data in February that shows online shopping fraud was the second most common type of fraud reported in 2023.",
      "Experts say fraudulent sites and ads remain a pervasive issue. \"Many of the scam sites are short-lived campaigns, so it's an ongoing effort to identify new sites,\" Ilya Volovik, director of Recorded Future Payment Fraud Intelligence, told CBS News. \"Some of the longer living scam sites change their 'sales' advertisement based on a holiday.\"",
      "Tips to protect yourself",
      "Cliff Steinhauer, director of Information Security and Engagement at the National Cybersecurity Alliance, said consumers should take precautions, stay alert when online shopping and act quickly if they believe they have been scammed.",
      "Secure your accounts. Experts recommend setting up multifactor authentication as well as strong and unique passwords for all accounts, including shopping and bank sites.",
      "Avoid unfamiliar links: Be wary of links from unsolicited emails and text messages. Instead, use a search engine to navigate to the retailer's website.",
      "Look for red flags. Be wary of deals that appear too good to be true, as well as websites that use excessive pop-ups and urgent language. If in doubt, leave the site.",
      "Research the website. Look up reviews from other shoppers who have used the site. Visit the Better Business Bureau's website, which maintains a database with ratings for millions of businesses.",
      "If you think you have been the victim of fraud, immediately notify your bank to reverse the charges. You should also change the passwords to your online accounts. File a police report if you experience harassment or repeated attempts to steal more of your information.",
      "Experts also recommend freezing your credit on the three major credit reporting bureaus if your personal information has been compromised through a data breach. This will ensure your identity can't be stolen in the event that scammers obtain your social security number.",

The official, who stressed no final decision has been taken, spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly.",

Trump said the stepped-up duties are necessary to curb the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs from Mexico and Canada.",
      "\"Blanket 25% tariffs on Canada threatened by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump earlier this week would push Canada into a recession in 2025, cause a sharp spike in inflation and force the Bank of Canada to hold rates higher next year,\" economist Michael Davenport of Oxford Economics said in a report Thursday.",
      "Inflation in Canada would top 7% by mid-2025, while unemployment would approach 8% by year-end, according to the investment research firm. The country's auto, energy and heavy manufacturing industries, which rely on exports to the U.S., would take the biggest hit, he added, noting that the sectors also depend on components from American suppliers.",
      "Canada fired back with duties of its own when Trump slapped tariffs on the country's steel and aluminum exports to the U.S. during his first stint in the White House. Canada targeted U.S. products including whiskey and yogurt, most of which came from one plant in Wisconsin, home state of then-House Speaker Paul Ryan.",
      "Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but say they are ready to make new investments in border security and work with the Trump administration to lower the numbers from Canada. The Canadians are also worried about an influx of migrants if Trump follows through with his plan for mass deportations.",
      "U.S. also would feel the pain",
      "Trump and his allies, including his choice for Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent,\u00a0have said\u00a0tariffs deployed during his first term advanced U.S. economic aims, including boosting federal revenue, and didn't boost inflation.",
      "But the U.S. likely wouldn't go unscathed in a full-blown trade war with Canada. Across-the-board tariffs on American products would likely cause a \"shallow\" recession in the U.S. and fracture political relations between the allies, according to Oxford.",
      "Although the U.S. is the world's leading oil producer, Canada supplies roughly 20% of the oil used stateside. As a result, U.S. gas prices could shoot up 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, soon after Trump levied the tariffs on Canada, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "With so much on the line, the incoming Trump administration is more likely to impose limited tariffs on Canadian products, such as steel, lumber and farm products like dairy.",
      "\"Despite Trump's latest threat of blanket tariffs, we still think it's unlikely that the Trump administration will put tariffs on Canadian autos and energy exports, which make up about 40% of total Canadian exports to the U.S.,\" Davenport said. \"The North American energy sector and auto supply chains are highly integrated across the U.S.-Canada border and any tariffs on these goods would also have a significant negative effect on the US economy.\"",

      "To be sure, it remains uncertain if Trump will follow through on his trade threats.

    "summary": "Tariffs on U.S. imports would raise prices for consumers on a range of goods, experts say. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Prices could rise\u00a0on a variety of goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas under tariffs that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose as soon as he takes office next year, according to experts.",
      "Trump on Monday pledged to put a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% levy on Chinese goods, in an effort to crack down on illegal immigration and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S. The tariffs are not certain to go into effect, and if they are implemented, their impact would depend on how they are structured and if certain categories are exempted.",
      "Trump and his allies, including his choice for Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent,\u00a0have argued that his first-term tariffs didn't boost inflation, and that import taxes can provide valuable benefits to American workers and businesses. Among them, Trump has said, are protecting U.S. manufacturing jobs and boosting federal revenue, although tariffs are paid by importers and often passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "For their part, experts and business groups are clear that tariffs would lift prices. A barrage of new duties on foreign imports would likely boost consumer costs on everything from vacuum cleaners to tiki torches, which are largely imported from China and are already subject to tariffs, according to Scott Lincicome, a trade expert at the Cato Institute, a public policy research group.",
      "\"A lot of vacuum cleaners are made in China, so that's one I could be sort of confident you're going to see some price effects on,\" he said.",

      "The trade group \u2014 which modeled the impact of a 10% tariff on Chinese imports, coupled with a 60% levy on goods from the country that Trump previously floated \u2014 estimated that laptops and tablets would see the steepest price hikes, with costs surging as much as 45%. Video game consoles and smartphones could also see double-digit gains.",
      "Researchers assumed retailers would pass all added costs related to tariffs along to consumers. In the smartphone category, the average increase in price would be $213 per device, according to CTA.",
      "\"The likelihood of retailers or any importer absorbing the tariff cost is very low, so the pass through to consumers will be quick,\" said Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at CTA. \"On all the products we looked at, there are going to be price increases.\"",
      "Best Buy CEO Cory Barrie on Tuesday also said on the company's earnings call that Trump's proposed tariffs would force the retailer to raise costs on a\u00a0range of consumer electronics, noting that \"there's very little in consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "Footwear",
      "Footwear is another goods category that experts are watching. According to Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America (FDRA), 99% of footwear sold in the U.S. is imported from other countries, with 56% of footwear by volume coming from China.",
      "\"We know that if they apply tariffs on Chines goods and Chinese footwear, it will hit working families the hardest,\" FDRA CEO Matt Priest told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some retailers could also decide to hike prices whether or not they face added costs related to potential tariffs. \"It's a pretty handy excuse when you're in a constant battle with consumers on price,\" Lincicome said.",
      "Home goods",
      "A number of retailers have already suggested that the proposed tariffs could force them to raise prices. In an email to customers, filtered shower head maker Jolie said this week that tariffs on goods made outside of the U.S. would \"mean we would need to raise our prices.\"",
      "\"If you're considering buying a Jolie, now is a great time to lock in our current prices,\" the company added. Currently, a shower head with a filter subscription costs $148. The company announced a \"potential\" new price of $178.",

      "\"Tariffs make it more difficult for us to maintain the low prices and be affordable for many people, which in the end is our goal,\" Jesper Brodin, Ingka Group CEO, told CNN. \"But it's beyond our control. We will need to understand and adapt.\"",
      "Gasoline",
      "Adding a 25% tariff to Canadian imports would affect crude oil, which is imported from Western Canada and refined at U.S. facilities, according to Patrick De Haan, an analyst at Gas Buddy.",

      "So should consumers be thinking about buying certain products now ahead of possible tariffs next year? Brzytwa thinks so.",
      "\"People should be thinking about buying now. From all indications we have, the Trump administration wants to move as fast as possible to impose much higher tariffs on imports from China, including products not yet subject to tariffs,\" he said.",

    "title": "How Trump's economic agenda could affect mortgage rates in 2025",
    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 17:51:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Here's what a noted housing expert thinks will happen to mortgage rates next year as Donald Trump outlines his priorities.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has promised to lower prices for Americans, but his economic policies may not help one embattled part of the economy: the housing market.",
      "Mortgage rates continue to hover near a 20-year high, while house hunters face near record high\u00a0home prices. The Federal Reserve's two rate cuts, in September and November, haven't trickled through to mortgages, which instead have climbed during the past month and are again hovering close to 7%.",
      "That's because mortgage rates are based on several factors beyond the Fed's benchmark rate, including the strength of the U.S. economy and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond. The latter surged after Trump's November 5 electoral victory on concerns that his policies, including stiff tariffs on U.S. imports, big tax cuts for individuals and businesses, and a crackdown on undocumented immigrants could drive up inflation.",
      "A key question for housing",
      "Housing affordability is viewed as a top problem within the U.S. by Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike, according to a May\u00a0poll from the Bipartisan Policy Center. The difficulty of affording a home, as well as the impact of rising rents, are issues that colored how voters viewed the economy leading into the election, with the high cost of living top of mind for many.",
      "\"Going forward, the key question is: Are some of the Trump proposals inflationary or non-inflationary?\" Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"One alarming part is tariffs \u2014 that means imported products will be more expensive, and it could take time for domestic production to ramp up.\"",
      "Trump on Monday pledged to put a 25% tariff on all products\u00a0from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% levy on Chinese goods. Those costs could boost the U.S. inflation rate by almost 1 percentage point, according to a new Goldman Sachs estimate. Higher inflation in turn could lead the Fed to slow or even pause its rate cuts \u2013 another blow to Americans hoping for lower borrowing costs.",
      "Where will mortgage rates go in 2025?",
      "To be sure, forecasting mortgage rates is difficult, given the number of factors that influence them. Yet based on Trump's stated economic plans, Yun said he thinks the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate will bounce around between 6% and 7% for the next year, and could stick around 6.5% for much of 2025.",
      "But, he added, there's a risk mortgage rates could inch even higher if Trump's policies prove more inflationary than expected. Higher mortgage rates can add hundreds of dollars in monthly costs for borrowers.",
      "Another issue is whether Trump's policies could widen the federal deficit, which impacts borrowing as well as the yield on the 10-year Treasury. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget forecasts that Trump's proposals would increase the federal budget deficit by $7.75 trillion over the next decade.",
      "To pay interest on that debt, the government would likely have to issue more bonds, like 10-year Treasurys. That could lead investors to demand higher yields, or the return they receive for investing in the bonds. As those yields rise, that would push mortgage rates higher.",
      "\"In the first Trump presidency, the average mortgage rate was about 4% to 5%,\" Yun said, adding, \"We won't get back to that 4% to 5% of that first Trump presidency.\"",
      "Will housing become more affordable?",
      "Most Americans report that housing in their communities has become less affordable during the past year, a trend they don't see improving, the Bipartisan Policy Center found.",
      "The median sale price of U.S. homes has dropped slightly during the past year, dipping to about $420,000 in the third quarter from $435,000 a year earlier, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. But that's also considerably higher than the median sale price of $329,000 at the start of 2020, just prior to the pandemic.",
      "The double whammy of high home costs and mortgage rates is pricing many buyers out of the market. The share of first-time home buyers dropped to 24% in 2024, the lowest since 1981, when the National Association of Realtors started tracking the metric. Prior to 2008, the share of first-time buyers had historically been 40%.",
      "That's a problem for would-be homebuyers \u2014 as well as the nation's overall economic health \u2014 because homeownership is a key to building personal wealth. People who delay buying a home have fewer years to grow their assets, which can in turn crimp their ability to build a nest egg for their later years.",
      "The difference in wealth between homeowners and renters is stark: Homeowners had a median net worth of $396,200 in 2022, compared with $10,400 for renters and other non-homeowners, according to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances.",
      "While mortgage rates might not see much relief in 2025, home prices are likely to remain stable, Yun predicted.",
      "\"The American way is to buy a home,\" he said. \"Maybe it's a little smaller, or not perfectly ideal, but then trade up to the next home \u2014 in terms of buying rather than delaying, the data shows that homeowners build wealth, while renters are spinning their wheels.\"",

      "\"It's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,\" U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. \"It's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.\"",
      "\"This proposal would allow Americans and their doctors to determine the best path forward so they can lead healthier lives, without worrying about their ability to cover these drugs out-of-pocket, and ultimately reduce health care costs to our nation,\" the White House said in a statement.",
      "A bipartisan coalition of congressional members have lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity.",
      "Who would be eligible to get weight loss drugs?",
      "Under the\u00a0proposal, Medicare and Medicaid coverage would extended to people prescribed the drugs \"to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long-term for individuals with obesity.\"",
      "Medicare estimates most obese enrollees are already eligible through other conditions, like diabetes, heart disease or sleep apnea. Around 7% of Medicare beneficiaries would be newly eligible.This means people who are only overweight but not obese would still not be covered, unless it was paired with another qualifying condition like treating diabetes or heart disease.",
      "The change also applies to state Medicaid programs, which would now no longer be allowed to exclude coverage of weight loss drugs for obese residents.",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that 12% of adults covered by Medicaid would be newly eligible. Adolescents could also be covered, given the Food and Drug Administration  has\u00a0approved\u00a0use of Wegovy down to age 12.",
      "The anti-obesity drug market has expanded significantly in recent years, with the FDA approving a new class of weekly injectables like Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound to treat obesity.",
      "People can lose as much as 15% to 25% of their body weight on the drugs, which imitate the hormones that regulate appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.",
      "The cost of the drugs has largely limited them to the wealthy, including celebrities who boast of their benefits. A monthly supply of Wegovy rings up at $1,300 and Zepbound will put you out $1,000. Shortages of the drugs have also limited the supplies.",
      "When would coverage of weight loss drugs start?",
      "For Medicare, the proposal to require Part D plans to expand coverage for weight loss drugs would take effect for plans in 2026.Officials claimed they do not think the proposal will lead to significantly increased costs for seniors next year, citing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"We do not expect any short-term impact on premiums from this proposal, and in fact, this proposal provides a significant savings for people who currently may be paying out of pocket for these medications,\" Dr. Meena Seshamani, the top official overseeing Medicare, told reporters.",
      "It is unclear when the proposal would take effect in state Medicaid programs.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid officials said they are inviting\u00a0public comment\u00a0on when states should be required to cover the costly medications.\"States are also feeling substantial state budget pressure and we are doing our part to make sure patients, Medicaid enrollees all across the country can get access,\" Dan Tsai, the agency's top Medicaid official, told reporters.",
      "Over the next decade, the proposal would cost the federal government $11 billion and states $3.8 billion, they estimated.\"We would urge drug manufacturers to do their part as well, make sure they're thinking about offering fair, appropriate prices to the Medicaid program,\" Tsai said.",
      "The path forward in new administration is unclear",
      "While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag",
      "Medicare has been barred from offering the drugs under a decades-old law that prohibits the government-backed insurance program from covering weight-loss products. The rule proposed by the Biden administration, however, would recognize obesity as a disease that can be treated with the help of the drugs.",
      "Kennedy, who as Trump's nominee for HHS secretary is subject to Senate confirmation, has railed against the drugs' popularity. In speeches and on social media, he's said the U.S. shouldn't cover the drugs through Medicaid or Medicare. Instead, he supports a broad expansion of coverage for healthier foods and gym memberships.",
      "\"For half the price of Ozempic, we could purchase regeneratively raised, organic food for every American, three meals a day and a gym membership, for every obese American,\" Kennedy said to a group of federal lawmakers during a roundtable earlier this year.",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 09:52:13 -0500",
    "summary": "An Illinois mom got stuck with a big bill after taking her 3-year-old to the ER but never seeing a doctor. \"It's mind-blowing,\" she said.",
    "story": [
      "Ryan Wettstein Nauman was inconsolable one evening last December. After being put down for bed, the 3-year-old from Peoria, Illinois, just kept crying and crying and crying, and nothing would calm her down.",
      "Her mother, Maggi Wettstein, remembered fearing it could be a yeast or urinary tract infection, something they had been dealing with during potty training. The urgent care centers around them were closed for the night, so around 10:30 p.m. she decided to take Ryan to the emergency room at Carle Health.",
      "The medical procedure",
      "The ER wasn't very busy when they arrived at 10:48 p.m., Wettstein recalled. Medical records indicate they checked in and she explained Ryan's symptoms, including an intermittent fever. The toddler was triaged and given a nasal swab test to check for Covid-19 and influenza A and B.",
      "Wettstein said they sat down and waited to be called. And they waited.",
      "As Wettstein watched Ryan in the waiting room's play area, she noticed her daughter had stopped crying.",
      "In fact, she seemed fine.",
      "So Wettstein decided to drive them home. Ryan had preschool the next day, and she figured there was no point keeping her awake for who knew how much longer and getting stuck with a big ER bill.",
      "There was no one at the check-in desk to inform that they were leaving, Wettstein said, so they just headed home to go to bed.",
      "Ryan went to her preschool the next day, and Wettstein said they forgot all about the ER trip for eight months.",
      "Then the bill came.",
      "The final bill",
      "$445 for the combined Covid and flu test \u2014 from an ER visit in which the patient never made it beyond the waiting room.",
      "The billing problem: A healthy hospital markup and standard insurance rules",
      "Even though Ryan and her mother left without seeing a doctor, the family ended up owing $298.15 after an insurance discount.",
      "At first, Wettstein said, she couldn't recall Ryan being tested at all. It wasn't until she received the bill and requested her daughter's medical records that she learned the results. (Ryan tested negative for Covid and both types of flu.)",
      "While Wettstein said the bill isn't going to break the bank, it seemed high to her, considering Walgreens sells an at-home Covid and flu combination test for $30 and can do higher-quality PCR testing for $145.",
      "Under the public health emergency declared in 2020 for the Covid pandemic, insurance companies were required to pay for Covid tests without copayments or cost sharing for patients.",
      "That requirement ended when the emergency declaration expired in May 2023. Now, it is often patients who foot the bill \u2014 and ER bills are notoriously high.",
      "\"That's a pretty healthy markup the hospital is making on it,\" Loren Adler, associate director of the Brookings Institution Center on Health Policy, told KFF Health News when contacted about Ryan's case.",
      "The rates the insurance companies negotiate with hospitals for various procedures are often based on multipliers of what Medicare pays, Adler said.",
      "Lab tests are one of the few areas in which insurance companies can often pay less than Medicare, he said \u2014 the exception being when the test is performed by the hospital laboratory, which is often what happens during ER visits.",
      "Medicare pays $142.63 for the joint test that Ryan received, but the family is on the hook for more than twice that amount, and the initial hospital charge was over three times as much.",
      "The hospital is \"utilizing their market power to make as much money as possible, and the insurance companies are not all that good at pushing back,\" Adler said. A markup of a few hundred dollars is a drop in the bucket for big insurers. But for the patients who get unexpected bills, it can be a big burden.",
      "Brittany Simon, a public relations manager for Carle Health, did not respond to specific questions but said in a statement, \"We follow policies that support the safety and wellbeing of our patients, which includes the initial triage of symptomatic patients to the Emergency Department.\"",
      "While Ryan's family would not have had to pay for a Covid test during the public health emergency, it was the family's insurer, Cigna, that did not have to pay this time, since the family had not yet met a $3,000 yearly deductible.",
      "A Cigna representative did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The resolution",
      "Wettstein said she knew she could just pay the bill and be done with it, \"but the fact that I never saw a provider, and the fact that it was just for a Covid test, is mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "She contacted the hospital's billing department to make sure the bill was correct. She explained what happened and said the hospital representative was also surprised by the size of the bill and sent it up for further review.",
      "\"'Don't pay this until you hear from me,'\" Wettstein remembered being told.",
      "Soon, though, she received a letter from the hospital explaining that the charge was correct and supported by documentation.",
      "Wettstein thought she was avoiding any charges by taking Ryan home without being seen. Instead, she got a bill \"that they have verified that I have to pay.\"",
      "\"Like I said, it's mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "The takeaway",
      "ERs are among the most expensive options for care in the nation's health system, and the meter can start running as soon as you check in \u2014 even if you check out before receiving care.",
      "If your issue isn't life-threatening, consider an urgent care facility, which is often cheaper (and look for posted notices to confirm whether it's actually an urgent care clinic). The urgent care centers near Ryan's home were closed that evening, but some facilities stay open late or around the clock.",
      "In some ways, Wettstein was lucky. KFF Health News' \"Bill of the Month\" has received tips from other patients who left an ER after a long wait without seeing a doctor \u2014 and got slapped with a facility fee of over $1,000.",
      "Making the decision about where to go is tough, especially in a stressful situation \u2014 such as when the patient is too young to communicate what's wrong. Trying to figure out what's going on physically with a 3-year-old can feel impossible.",
      "If you decide to leave an ER without treatment, don't just walk out. Tell the triage nurse you're leaving. You might get lucky and avoid some charges.",
      "Wettstein won't think twice about taking Ryan to the pediatrician or an urgent care center the next time she's ailing. But, Wettstein said, after getting this bill, \"I'm not going to create a habit out of going to the emergency room.\"",
      "Bill of the Month is a crowdsourced investigation by KFF Health News and The Washington Post's Well+Being that dissects and explains medical bills. Since 2018, this series has helped many patients and readers get their medical bills reduced, and it has been cited in statehouses, at the U.S. Capitol, and at the White House.

    "story": [
      "23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki knows the genetic-testing and ancestry-tracing company has been in \"the eye of the storm\" recently, but she said she's confident that the company is still viable and believes it will be \"growing and thriving\" a year from now.",
      "\"I believe in the company. I believe in the long-term mission. But I believe it's essential for us to restructure,\" Wojcicki told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King in an exclusive interview.",
      "Wojcicki acknowledged recent headlines about the California-based company's struggles, including a data security incident in late 2023, a full board resignation in September, and laying off 40% of the company's workforce in November. In a public letter, the seven board members said it was \"clear that we differ on the strategic direction for the Company going forward.\"",
      "The announcement came as a surprise to Wojcicki, saying that she doesn't have \"great insights into what the strategic differences were\" and that \"there was not an overt disagreement.\" Wojcicki has recently said she intends to take the company private and isn't open to considering third-party takeover proposals.",
      "\"I will make [mistakes], and I will learn from them\"",
      "Former 23andMe employees were critical of Wojcicki's management style in an October interview with Fortune Magazine \u2013 with one calling her \"outwardly charming, but stubborn and controlling behind the scenes.\"",
      "\"I love getting feedback. Like, one of my favorite things\u2026\" Wojcicki said.",
      "Wojcicki said she encourages everyone to voice their opinions and share suggestions.",
      "\"At the heart of what 23andMe does\u2026we're about consumer empowerment and research. Okay.\u00a0 So help me navigate because this has never been done before. So I love getting feedback for all those reasons because it has never been done before,\" Wojcicki explained. \"We're doing all kinds of things for the first time. So we will make mistakes. 100% admit all of that. But\u2026my commitment to the world has always been I will always learn from my mistakes. I will make them, and I will learn from them, and we will be better going forward.\"",
      "Wojcicki sent \"CBS Mornings\" emails she says the company received in support of 23andMe, including one from 70-year-old Rebecca Jones who thanked the company for helping her learn about her increased risk for Alzheimer's. Wojcicki said stories like these show the company provides real value.",
      "When asked by \"CBS Mornings\" if she was concerned about her data following the 2023 security incident at the company, Jones said, \"I have to have some level of confidence in the integrity of 23andMe, like I trust my physician. I have to trust that they are going to safeguard it. Of course I'm concerned and am watching it and will see if there are any steps I should take. I downloaded my data and all of that.\"",
      "Wojcicki's future plans for 23andMe",
      "23andMe's stock has dropped around 98% since 2021, when it went public. The company, which was once valued at $6 billion, now has a market cap of around $80 million. In its most recent quarter, the company reported a net loss of $59.1 million.",
      "King asked, \"How does a company survive when it's lost 98% of its value though?\"",
      "\"I think market cap and reality of a company are always two different realities,\" Wojcicki said. \"We absolutely are in a situation where we're figuring out cash burn and we're looking at all the ways that we're gonna drive revenue growth.\"",
      "To help boost revenue, Wojcicki said the company is focusing on its subscription service, where members can get more insights into their health. With a premium membership, customers get health and ancestry kits, discover things like their historical matches, receive new research reports on health findings - such as new breast cancer variants - and more.",
      "\"People did 23andMe, and they loved it. And we see over 50% of our customers coming back on a quarterly basis, so they're engaged,\" said Wojcicki, adding that it shows \"they want more.\"",
      "Wojcicki said the recent layoffs, which affected more than 200 employees, were also an attempt to help slash costs.",
      "\"The focus right now is 100% on making 23andMe sustainable. And I will not be taking on research initiatives at our own cost anymore. So we will be focusing on \u2013 you know, the consumer business, the subscription, and research partnerships. And I absolutely think, like, 23andMe will, you know, turn a point at some point of being profitable,\" Wojcicki said.",
      "Wojcicki said she's confident that in 2025, the company will be \"growing and thriving.\" In five years, it \"will transform health care,\" she told King.",

    "summary": "The cartel allegedly uses fishing boats to smuggle drugs and migrants \u2014 and catch tons of red snapper, a commercially valuable but vulnerable species.",
    "story": [
      "For years, U.S. authorities and fishermen have been complaining about illegal fishing for red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico, and now it's been revealed who is behind the lucrative trade: a Mexican drug cartel.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions Tuesday against members of the Gulf drug cartel, which operates in the border cities of Reynosa and Matamoros, across from McAllen and Brownsville, Texas.",
      "While commercial fishing and drug cartels may seem like an unlikely combination, it makes perfect sense for a criminal organization.",
      "The department says the cartel uses fishing boats to facilitate drug and migrant smuggling; along the way, the boats catch tons of red snapper, a commercially valuable but vulnerable species. The boats often launch from Playa Bagdad, east of Matamoros, on the Gulf coast.",
      "\"The Gulf Cartel engages in the illicit trade of red snapper and shark species through 'lancha' operations based out of Playa Bagdad,\" the department said. \"Apart from their use for IUU (illegal, unregulated or unreported) fishing in U.S. waters, lanchas are also used to move illicit drugs and migrants into the United States.\"",
      "To add insult to injury, these Mexican boats, often based out of Playa Bagdad, sell their catch in Mexican border cities, where they are sometimes shipped into Texas for resale in the U.S. market.",
      "This occurs while U.S. fishermen had to respect strict seasonal limits or closures designed to protect fish populations.",
      "\"As the fishing of red snapper and shark species is under strict limits in the United States, and therefore those species are more abundant in U.S. waters, Mexican fishermen cross into U.S. waters to fish via these lanchas,\" the department said.",
      "\"They then bring their catch back to lancha camps into Mexico, where the product is ultimately sold and, oftentimes, exported into the United States,\" it continued. \"This activity earns millions a year for lancha camps. In addition, it also leads to the death of other marine species that are inadvertently caught\" on the long lines of baited hooks the boats use.",
      "The Treasury announced Tuesday it was designating five individuals linked to the cartel for illegal fishing -- Ildelfonso Carrillo Sapien (a.k.a. \"El Chivo\"), Raul Decuir Garcia (a.k.a. \"La Burra\"), Ismael Guerra Salinas (a.k.a. \"El Comandante\"), Omar Guerra Salinas (a.k.a. \"Samorano\"), and Francisco Javier Sierra Angulo (a.k.a. \"El Borrado\").",
      "History of illegal fishing",
      "This isn't the first time cartels have been involved in illegal fishing in Mexico. Experts say other drug cartels are involved in the prohibited gillnet fishing for totoaba in the Gulf of California, also known as the Sea of Cortez, threatening the world's most endangered porpoise, the vaquita marina.",
      "Those designated under Tuesday's sanctions - which block any of their U.S. assets - include Gulf cartel local bosses in Playa Bagdad, as well as two owners of fishing camps there.",
      "The illegal fishing problem became so severe that in 2022, the U.S. government prohibited Mexican fishing vessels from entering U.S. ports on the Gulf of Mexico, arguing the Mexican government had not done enough to prevent its boats from illegally fishing in U.S. waters.",
      "Mexican fishing boats in the Gulf \"are prohibited from entering U.S. ports, will be denied port access and services,\" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration wrote in a report in 2022. According to a Sept. 10, 2024 NOAA bulletin, those restrictions remain in place.",
      "Small Mexican boats frequently use prohibited long lines or nets to haul in snapper in U.S. waters, which can harm other marine life, such as sharks.",
      "NOAA said in a previous report that the U.S. Coast Guard apprehended dozens of Mexican boats in the Gulf, including repeat offenders who had been interdicted multiple times since 2014.",
      "It noted the United States imported nearly five tons of fresh and frozen snapper from Mexico in 2018, raising concerns that \"these imports may have included fish harvested illegally in U.S. waters.\"",
      "U.S. targeting cartels recently",
      "In recent months, the U.S. Treasury has imposed sanctions on cartels for a variety of reasons -- from drug trafficking to fuel theft to time share scams.",
      "In October, the U.S. sanctioned senior members of the armed wing of a Mexican drug cartel that operates on border territories in and around Chihuahua, Mexico. The cartel has also been linked to the 2019 ambush that\u00a0killed nine Americans\u00a0in Mexico.",
      "In September, the U.S. sanctioned a\u00a0man known as \"The Tank\"\u00a0who allegedly leads the fuel theft arm of Mexico's hyper-violent\u00a0Jalisco New Generation cartel.",
      "In July, the U.S. imposed sanctions on a group of Mexican accountants and firms allegedly linked to a\u00a0timeshare fraud\u00a0ring run by the Jalisco cartel in a multi-million dollar scheme targeting Americans.",
      "The month before that, U.S. officials announced economic sanctions against eight targets affiliated with a Mexican drug cartel, La Nueva Familia Michoacana, accused of fentanyl trafficking and human smuggling.

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 20:23:03 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump is proposing sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump, an avowed fan of tariffs, is pledging to enact stiff import duties as soon as he's inaugurated in January. For Trump, these new levies would both supercharge the\u00a0trade policies\u00a0pursued during his first administration and, more broadly, help the U.S. achieve key economic and social goals.",
      "On his Truth Social site Monday evening, Trump unveiled plans to place a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada on January 20, his inauguration day. The president-elect also said he intends to levy an additional 10% fee on all imports from China.",
      "Trump's penchant for protectionist trade policies is a source of concern for many economists and Wall Street analysts, who worry new tariffs and retaliatory measures by U.S. trade partners could slow economic growth, spur inflation and trigger a trade war.",
      "But Trump and his allies, including his choice for Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent, have argued that tariffs deployed during his first term didn't boost inflation and that the upside could far outweigh any negatives.",
      "\"But tariffs are two things if you look at it,\" Trump said in October in an interview with Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait. \"No. 1 is for protection of the companies that we have here, and the new companies that will move in because we're going to have thousands of companies coming into this country.\"",
      "Here are four ways Trump says tariffs will help with the U.S., along with what experts say.",
      "Protect U.S. manufacturing",
      "Trump believes that imposing tariffs on trading partners will help protect U.S. businesses at a time when domestic manufacturing jobs have fallen far from their peak in 1979.",
      "In some instances, the tariffs that Trump imposed in 2018-19 achieved that goal, with the Brookings Institution noting there's some evidence that jobs in specific industries may have received a boost. For instance, tariffs on imported washing machines may have created 1,800 new U.S. jobs at Whirlpool and other manufacturers, according to the centrist think tank.",
      "But that ignores the broader impact of Trump's first-term tariffs on U.S. manufacturing, with the Federal Reserve finding\u00a0that U.S. manufacturers ended up facing higher costs for raw materials they imported, as well as from retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The number of U.S. manufacturing jobs fell slightly during Trump's first term, from about 12.4 million to 12.2 million workers, although a range of factors could account for that decline.",
      "\"[O]ur results suggest that the tariffs have not boosted manufacturing employment or output, even as they increased producer prices,\" the Fed researchers noted.",
      "Bring new companies to the U.S.",
      "Trump also contends that broad-based tariffs will convince some foreign manufacturers to open plants in the U.S. as a way to avoid the import duties.",
      "\"The higher the tariff, the more likely it is that the company will come into the United States and build a factory in the United States, so it doesn't have to pay the tariff,\" Trump told Bloomberg's Micklethwait.",
      "Although such a shift is possible, Micklethwait said such changes would \"take many, many years.\" (Trump disputed that, saying companies would \"come right away.\") Experts note that many factors beyond tariffs affect where companies decide to operate, including supply chains, taxes, shipping costs, and labor and regulatory policies.",
      "Already, some businesses are anticipating the impact of tariffs by shifting their manufacturing locations, but that may not be guaranteed to benefit the U.S. For instance, shoemaker Steve Madden said if Trump places new tariffs on Chinese imports, it will shift manufacturing away from China and toward nations such as Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "Deliver billions in new federal revenue",
      "Trump has also touted tariffs as a way to generate new federal revenue that can offset his proposed tax cuts. During his first administration, his tariffs \u2014 more limited than his current proposals \u2014 generated $80 billion in revenue, according to the Tax Foundation.",
      "If Trump institutes a 10% tariff on all imports, as he proposed during his campaign, the federal government would reap $2 trillion from 2025 through 2034,\u00a0estimates\u00a0the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, a think tank focused on tax issues.",
      "According to Goldman Sachs, a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico, along with a 10% tax on Chinese imports, would generate just under $300 billion in tariff revenue per year. Overall, 43% of U.S. imports come from Mexico (15.4%), Canada (13.6%),and China (13.9%).",
      "However, that revenue would largely be paid by U.S. consumers and businesses, experts say. That's because tariffs are not paid by the countries that export to the U.S., as Trump maintains, but rather by U.S. importers.",
      "In other words, companies like Walmart would be faced with the decision of whether to swallow the higher costs of imports, or passing those on to consumers, Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser for Capital Economics, wrote in a research note.",
      "\"If the costs are passed on, then customers face a choice: continue buying the (now more expensive) import or switch to buying a domestic alternative (which will cost more than the import pre-tariff),\" she noted.",
      "Trump's tariffs could cost the typical U.S. family an additional $2,600 a year due to importers and manufacturers passing the cost of tariffs to consumers, according to an August analysis from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank focused on economic issues.",
      "Stem the flow of drugs and illegal immigration",
      "Trump also sees the threat of new tariffs as a way to curb illegal immigration and drug smuggling, citing people \"pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before.\" The tariffs would remain \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\" he added.",
      "Much of the fentanyl within the U.S.\u00a0is smuggled from Mexico. During President Biden's term, border seizures of the drug rose sharply, with U.S. officials tallying about 21,900 pounds (12,247 kilograms) of fentanyl seized in the 2024 government budget year, versus 2,545 pounds (1,154 kilograms) in 2019, when Trump was president.",
      "While it's possible that Canada, Mexico and China could increase enforcement against drug smuggling or immigration to avoid Trump's tariffs, it's unclear whether such a threat along would achieve those goals. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Tuesday suggested Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own and described illegal drugs as a U.S. problem, while indicating a willingness to discuss the issues with Trump.",
      "The flow of drugs into the U.S. \"is a problem of public health and consumption in your country's society,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said Tuesday that personal electronics could become more expensive if President-elect Donald Trump carries out his threat to slap new tariffs on foreign goods, as large retailers scramble to assess the potential impact of the proposed levies on their business.",
      "The warning came one day after Trump said he would impose a\u00a0new round of tariffs\u00a0on Mexico, Canada and China on his first day in office. Before the Nov. 5 election, he had proposed a baseline 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and a 60% tariff on goods shipped from China, arguing the such levies protect domestic manufacturers and encourage American companies to create jobs at home.",
      "Any added costs on U.S. imports from the three counties \"will be shared by our customers,\" Barry told investors in the company's Nov. 26 earnings call, noting that \"there's very little in [the] consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "\"These are goods that people need, and higher prices are not helpful,\" she added.",
      "Price hikes are not guaranteed, Barry cautioned, saying that any impact on the retailer's costs and prices are contingent on how any new tariffs might be implemented.",
      "\"I think it's going to be a very fluid situation as we continue to work through it,\" she said, adding that the company will \"make sure we do everything we can to keep prices right for our customers.\"",
      "Best Buy could try to partly offset the impact of new tariffs by importing more goods ahead of levies taking effect in 2025, as well as working with vendors to source products from countries other than China, Barry said during the call. Roughly 60% of the goods Best Buy sells are imported from China.",
      "\"We are already planning for and working with our vendor partners on next steps,\" she said.",

      "Walmart's decision to roll back some of its diversity, equity and inclusion policies nationwide is designed to \"ensure every customer, every associate\" feels welcome and like they belong, according to John Furner, president and CEO of Walmart U.S.",
      "\"Like many companies all across the United States, we've been on a journey and we continue to be on a journey. And what we're trying to do is to ensure that every customer, every associate feels welcome here to shop. And to feel like they belong,\" Furner said in response to questions about the DEI policy decision in an exclusive interview Tuesday with \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The changes, confirmed by Walmart on Monday after\u00a0Wall Street Journal earlier reported\u00a0on them, represent the end of a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up after\u00a0the police killing of George Floyd, as well as the retailer's decision to phase out the term DEI. Walmart will also no longer give priority treatment to suppliers based on race or gender diversity and will halt sellers from listing some transgender-related or themed items on the website.",
      "Furner said Walmart is undergoing the changes to help foster inclusion.",
      "\"We're going to continue to make the best decisions we can that makes everyone \u2013 our customers, our associates \u2013 feel like this is an environment they can shop in and thrive in,\" he said.",
      "Even so, Walmart's decision comes amid growing pressure from conservatives to halt corporate DEI policies, which ramped up after the U.S.\u00a0Supreme Court's ruling in June 2023\u00a0ending affirmative action in college admissions. Some conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting workplace DEI initiatives as well as hiring practices that give boosts to historically marginalized groups.",
      "Other corporations that have recently backed away from DEI policies include\u00a0Ford, Lowe's, Tractor Supply\u00a0and\u00a0Harley-Davidson.",
      "When asked if diversity among suppliers remains important to Walmart, Furner turned the focus to small businesses and small suppliers.",
      "\"We'll continue to do the things we can do to ensure small suppliers have a path to be successful,\" he said, noting that Walmart started in 1962 as a single store in Rogers, Arkansas.",
      "Walmart is also committed to selling American-made goods, which make up about two-thirds of what the company sells, Furner said, adding, \"We're going to continue to lean into ensuring that we provide the very best pathways for small businesses, our supplies to be successful here in the store.\"",
      "How Walmart's preparing for Trump's proposed tariffs",
      "Walmart will be ready for President-elect Donald Trump's new trade policies, as the retailer's products are mostly made within the U.S., Furner said. Even so, he acknowledged customers may see some impact on prices.",
      "On Monday, Trump doubled down on his campaign promise, threatening to impose sweeping new tariffs on imported goods from Mexico, Canada and China \u2013 America's top three suppliers, according to the most recent Census data \u2013 \u00a0as one of his \"many first Executive Orders.\"",
      "Trump said he plans to add a 25% tariff on all Mexican and Canadian goods, as well as an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports, which he described as part of his crackdown on drugs and immigration. He said the tariffs would stand \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country! \"",
      "\"We'll adjust to any environment. We've been in an environment with tariffs now for the last seven years,\" Furner said, adding that they have a team of people who are responsible for managing changes in trade policy.",
      "Furner said Walmart will do everything possible \u2013 between the suppliers and supply chain \u2013\u00a0 to keep prices low and help people save money.",

      "It's not clear how serious Trump's threat is. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement forbids just imposing tariffs on other member countries. And it's not clear whether the economy could even tolerate sudden levies on imports: Auto plants on both sides of the border rely on each other for parts and components, and some production lines could screech to a halt.",
      "\"It is unacceptable and would cause inflation and job losses in Mexico and the United States,\" Sheinbaum said, while offering to talk about the issues. \"If tariffs go up, who will it hurt? General Motors,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Captain Ed Evans began his day well before dawn, preparing Southwest\u00a0plane 8921 for a nearly 19-hour journey. The year-old Boeing 737 MAX8 flew nearly 4,000 miles, traveling from Baltimore to Denver, Long Beach, Reno, Las Vegas, Sacramento and back to Las Vegas.",
      "\"Planes start in 118 airports where we operate every day, and they could end up somewhere totally different,\" Evans said.",
      "For the airline, the holiday season requires precision and efficiency.",
      "\"We're ready to go,\" Evans said. \"I think we're in great shape and looking forward to the holiday travel season.\"",
      "Thanksgiving week is crunch time for airlines, and Southwest Airlines is expecting a record number of passengers this year, with 4.7 million people flying to or from their holiday destinations.",
      "At each stop, the team works quickly to prepare the plane for its next departure. Ryan Robles, a flight attendant, described it as a race against the clock.",
      "\"We've got a 45-minute turn, so it becomes very important to be prompt,\" Robles said.",
      "Behind the scenes at Southwest Airlines",
      "Meanwhile, ground crews hustle to load luggage and restock the plane. The focus is to load all the bags so the plane can get back out onto the runway.",
      "On this journey, the crew changed multiple times. Flight attendants swapped out twice, and the pilots changed in Reno. In Denver, husband-and-wife team Andrew Witmer and Jordan Baumgarner worked to quickly restock snacks and drinks.",
      "\"I'm very competitive,\" Jordan said. Andrew added, \"We try to race each other.\"",
      "Across six flights, the plane carried 698 passengers and 578 checked bags. Among the passengers was Katie Jones, who was taking her 3-year-old son, Clark, to Disneyland for his birthday.",
      "\"What do you want to go see? Mickey? The Toy Story ride?\" Jones asked her excited son.",
      "Running an airline is no small task, according to Southwest CEO Bob Jordan.",
      "\"Everything wants to stay in motion all the time. The minute you stop or slow down, things are out of place,\" Jordan explained.",
      "Inside Southwest's network operation center in Dallas, Sarah Heugel monitored the cross-country journey, watching for turbulence, bad weather, or airport backups that could cause delays.",
      "\"We can see pretty much anything that they're going to encounter and anticipate things to happen,\" she said.",
      "As night fell, plane 8921 completed its last stop of the day, remaining on schedule entire journey. Its rest would be brief\u2014just seven hours-- time for any maintenance checks and restocking before a new day of travel.",
      "For passengers, it's a chance to connect with loved ones during the holidays. For the airline, it's a delicate dance of coordination and teamwork to keep everything moving.",

      "\"Massad is an accomplished lawyer and a highly respected leader in the business world, with extensive experience on the International scene,\" Trump wrote. \"He has been a longtime proponent of Republican and Conservative values, an asset to my Campaign, and was instrumental in building tremendous new coalitions with the Arab American Community.\"",
      "His post went on to describe Boulos as \"a dealmaker, and an unwavering supporter of PEACE in the Middle East,\" who \"will be a strong advocate for the United States, and its interests.\"",
      "The selection comes as Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance continue their transition into the White House ahead of January's inauguration. Boulos will likely play a role in how Trump approaches Israel's ongoing war with Hamas in Gaza, which has triggered conflicts with Lebanon and Iran while threatening to spread more widely throughout the region. The Biden White House announced last week that it had helped broker a ceasefire deal between Israel and the Iran-backed group Hezbollah in Lebanon, although both Israel and Hezbollah have accused the other of violating the agreement. Negotiations for a similar deal with Hamas have long been stalled.",
      "Boulos already helped spearhead the Trump campaign's outreach efforts in Arab American communities in the U.S. this year, organizing meetings in Michigan and other states. He is also the second Trump in-law picked to serve in a leadership role in his next administration.",

    "summary": "Democrats and some former Trump officials criticized President-elect Donald Trump's announcement that he wants Kash Patel to be FBI director.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's announcement\u00a0Saturday that he intends to nominate Kash Patel as FBI director sent shockwaves through Washington over the weekend, prompting outrage from Democrats and even some former Trump officials, while some loyalists insisted they believed Patel would be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Patel, a 44-year-old who served in intelligence and defense roles in Trump's first term, is a controversial figure even within Trump's world, and a former U.S. official described him as \"by far the most dangerous pick\" Trump has made.",
      "\"There is no 'there' to him,\" the official told CBS News. \"He'll literally do anything.\"",
      "John Bolton, who served as national security adviser in Trump's first term and was Patel's boss, compared the nomination to Joseph Stalin's secret police chief.",
      "\"Fortunately, the FBI is not\" Stalin's secret police, Bolton said. \"The Senate should reject this nomination 100-0.\"",
      "In response to Bolton's comments, Vice President-elect JD Vance posted on social media that \"John Bolton has been wrong about everything so I guess Kash must be pretty awesome.\"",
      "In addition to objections about Patel at the helm of the FBI, current FBI director Christopher Wray's 10-year term is not due to end until 2027. For Patel to become FBI director, Wray would have to resign or be fired by Trump and Patel would need to be confirmed by the Senate. Republicans are set to hold a 53-47 majority come January, giving incoming Majority Leader John Thune only a few votes to lose.",
      "Trump called Patel \"a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People\" in a post on social media Saturday. And some of his supporters echoed the sentiment, like Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, who said Patel is a \"very strong nominee\" whom he thinks will be approved by the Senate.",
      "\"I got to say, all of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all of the people pulling their hair out, are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a real reformer come into the FBI and clean out the corrupted partisans who sadly have burrowed into senior career positions at the FBI,\" Cruz said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee Republican, said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he \"encouraged President Trump to bring Kash Patel to the table,\" saying Patel \"represents the type of change that we need to see in the FBI.\"",
      "Other Republicans, like Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, took a more cautious approach. Rounds expressed support for Wray, who was nominated by Trump in his first term in 2017.",
      "\"I think the president picked a very good man to be the director of the FBI when he did that in his first term,\" Rounds said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"I don't have any complaints about the way that he's done his job right now.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats were highly critical of the pick. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said on NBC that he will vote no, expressing concern that Patel \"is going to only care about protecting Republicans.\" And Murphy pledged to help his colleagues and the American public \"understand what's happening here.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump told the American public during the campaign that he was going to turn the Department of Justice into a political operation, an arm of the White House, to destroy his political opponents,\" Murphy said. \"Kash Patel's only qualification is because he agrees with Donald Trump that the Department of Justice should serve to punish, lock up, and intimidate Donald Trump's political opponents. And so the cost to the American public is pretty simple\"",
      "In recent weeks, Trump's most controversial selections for top posts in his administration have faced intense scrutiny as they prepare for the Senate confirmation process. And one pick, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, already withdrew his name from consideration facing headwinds in the Senate.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the current majority whip in the upper chamber, urged his Senate colleagues in a statement to reject Trump's pick of Patel, noting that \"we already have a FBI director\" and accusing the president-elect of wanting to \"replace his own appointee with an unqualified loyalist.\"",
      "\"The Senate should reject this unprecedented effort to weaponize the FBI for the campaign of retribution that Donald Trump has promised,\" Durbin said.",

      "We turn now to Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who joins us this morning from Houston.",
      "Senator, it's good to see you. Good morning to you.",
      "Let's pick up this thread on tariffs. I remember covering your presidential campaign in 2016, and you were a skeptic of tariffs then. I know the politics around tariffs have changed. President-elect Trump has done that. But have the economics changed?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ (R-Texas): Well, I will tell you, what hasn't changed is \u2013 is the importance of leverage.",
      "And I got to say, you look at the threat of tariffs against Mexico and Canada immediately has produced action. We've seen the president of Mexico stand up and promise that she is going to work hand in hand with the president of the United States, President Trump, to secure the border.",
      "I will tell you, representing Texas, we've seen four years of an invasion at our southern border. Let me ask you, Major, why hasn't Joe Biden done this? Why hasn't Joe Biden actually stood up and used leverage to secure the border?",
      "And the reason is, Joe Biden and the Democrats wanted this invasion to happen. And I got to say, this is a promise that I believe President Trump is going to deliver on and deliver quickly. We are going to secure the border. This is about using leverage to get Mexico and Canada to cooperate.",
      "And I will tell you, Major, I think one of the very first bills we're going to take up in the Senate, vote on, and I hope pass, is my legislation the Justice for Jocelyn Act that is a response to the horrific rape and murder of Jocelyn Nungaray, 12-year-old girl in Houston, Texas, killed by violent criminal illegal aliens released by Joe Biden and the Democrats.",
      "This is a promise the president needs to deliver on, and I think he's going to.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So, when you think about tariffs and president-elect Trump, you don't take them seriously as an economic matter; you take them seriously only as a diplomatic lever?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, look, I think the president was explicit with Mexico and Canada. He said he will impose these tariffs unless they secure the border.",
      "It was explicitly leverage. And, by the way, that is the same way that President Trump negotiated the remain-in-Mexico agreement. If you remember, during his first term, President Trump threatened tariffs against Mexico. And AMLO, then the president of Mexico, he was incredibly scared and concerned. He was scared of Trump, and he ended up signing the remain-in- Mexico agreement, which produced the lowest rate of illegal immigration in 45 years.",
      "It was incredibly successful. What did Joe Biden the Democrats do when they came in? The very first week in office, they ripped up that incredibly successful international agreement. I expect we will once again enter into remain-in-Mexico.",
      "And we are going to see \u2013 I'm going to make a prediction right now. We will see the numbers plummet of illegal immigration coming into this country, not in a year, not in six months, but in January and February, because we will have a president who will vigorously enforce the law.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: On that point. Senator Cruz, you would concede, in the last three or four months, numbers have gone down already, have they not?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: They have ticked down slightly. We have still seen over these four years the highest rate of illegal immigration in our nation's history. Twelve million illegal immigrants have come into this country.",
      "And I got to say, in a state like Texas, you want to see the consequences, this last election was an incredible landslide for President Trump. He won all seven of the swing states. And, in Texas, President Trump won Hispanic voters in Texas. I won Hispanic voters in Texas. I won statewide by a million votes, nine points.",
      "And South Texas, the Rio Grande Valley, has literally spent over 100 years as a bright blue Democrat bastion. This cycle, South Texas flipped Republican. And it is amazing what having 12 million people invade your home can do to change people's voting behavior. I think the president has a mandate to deliver on securing the border, and I look forward to working hand in hand with him to deliver on that promise.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Kash Patel suggested by President Trump as the new leader of the FBI, how enthusiastic are you about that?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Listen, I think Kash Patel is a very strong nominee. I think the entire slate of Cabinet nominees President Trump has put forward is very strong.",
      "I believe every one of these Cabinet nominees is going to be confirmed by the Senate. I think Kash Patel is going to be confirmed by the Senate. You look at his background, he has a serious professional background. He was a prosecutor. He was a public defender. He was a senior intelligence staffer on Capitol Hill. He was a senior intelligence staffer in the White House. He was the chief of staff of the Department of Defense.",
      "He was the deputy director of national intelligence. And I got to say, all of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all of the people pulling their hair out are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a real reformer come into the FBI and clean out the corrupted partisans who sadly have burrowed into senior career positions at the FBI.",
      "The FBI and the Department of Justice are two institutions incredibly important to the rule of law in the United States. I revere both. And one of the most tragic consequences of four years of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is, both the DOJ and the FBI have been politicized and weaponized, and I think Kash Patel is a very strong nominee to take on the partisan corruption in the FBI.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: As you know, Senator, there isn't a vacancy at the top of the FBI. What should become of Christopher Wray, appointed by President Trump?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, I think he'll make a choice. I think either he will resign or President Trump will fire him. But it's no secret to anybody, including Chris Wray, that he is not going to continue to serve as the head of the FBI under Donald Trump.",
      "Listen, if you look at James Comey and Chris Wray, there has never been a period in our nation's history where the FBI has suffered a greater loss of respect, where more Americans doubt the fundamental integrity of the FBI.",
      "And it's because James Comey and Chris Wray presided over allowing the FBI to become a partisan cudgel to be used to target parents at school board meetings, to be used to target people who chose not to take the COVID vaccine, to be used to target President Trump and to target the political opponents of Joe Biden and the White House.",
      "It is tragic. That is not what the FBI is for. That is not what the DOJ is for. And I got to say, Pam Bondi and Kash Patel, I think, together are a very strong slate of nominees to go and restore integrity to both institutions.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How do you place that up against the prosecutions of Bob Menendez, a congressman, a Democrat from Texas, Hunter Biden? Are those political prosecutions as well or not?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, first of all, let's be clear. Bob Menendez was \u2013 was literally caught with gold bars and a stack of cash with his fingerprints taking bribes, and it's why Bob Menendez is not my colleague anymore. At that point, the evidence was overwhelming.",
      "Look, Major, I wrote an entire book entitled \"Justice Corrupted: How the Left Has Weaponized the Legal System.\" And it broke down \u2013 it started, sadly, under Barack Obama, where he began using the federal government to target his political opponents.",
      "The book details how many of those partisans then burrowed in to senior career positions during the Trump administration. They waged war against President Trump during his first term. And now, under Joe Biden, they have been open and brazen, and I think it has done unbelievable damage to the integrity of the Department of Justice and the FBI.",
      "I think Merrick Garland will go down in history as the most partisan attorney general our nation has ever seen. And I got to say, I hear regularly from \u2013 from prosecutors, from FBI agents who are deeply dismayed about the institution they have devoted a lifetime working for, because, listen, I don't want a Republican Department of Justice.",
      "I don't want a Democrat Department of Justice. I want a Department of Justice and an FBI that enforces the law regardless of party. And, sadly, we haven't seen that these last four years.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What can you tell us about the three Americans released by China who are in San Antonio? Have you been in touch with them? And do you have any concerns about the contours of that swap?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, at this stage, we don't know all of the details of the contours of the swap, but I will tell you, I am celebrating the return of three Americans, especially Mark Swidan.",
      "Mark Swidan is a Texan from Houston. His mom, Katherine, is from Luling, Texas. I have talked with Katherine many times. I authored and passed a resolution in the Senate that passed unanimously calling for Mark Swidan's return to America. He spent 12 years unjustly imprisoned in communist China.",
      "I will tell you, I have raised it directly with the foreign minister of China. I have raised it with President Biden. I have raised it with Secretary of State Tony Blinken.",
      "And I will give them credit on this. Tony Blinken, just two weeks ago was the most recent time I spoke with him about Mark Swidan, and the administration has pressed the Chinese government. And Mark Swidan is back home with his mother, who has prayed for him, who has loved \u2013 loved him.",
      "I want to say, Mark, welcome home. Katherine, congratulations. I told you this day would come. This is a time where all Texans and all Americans should be celebrating.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Very quickly, Senator Cruz, because I also know you care about the case of Austin Tice.",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Yes.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you have any sense that the rebel gains in Syria of the recent vintage will have any chance of unlocking Austin Tice's freedom?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: I don't know. I certainly hope and pray. Austin Tice needs to come home. And I hope and pray.",
      "Listen, there's a combination of two things working. One, as Joe Biden is in the process of transitioning out, any \u2013 any outgoing president is looking to try to get some final wins. I would encourage him and I'm sure he is doing everything he can to bring Austin Tice home, to bring the hostages in Gaza home, both the Israelis and the Americans, bring them home in this window.",
      "I also think President Trump coming into office on January 20, the enemies of America, I think, are afraid of President Trump. That is a moment. I hope we have a moment right now that is very much like the end of the Jimmy Carter administration\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: \u2026 right before Ronald Reagan came in. And we saw, on January 20, our hostages in Iran released, I think in significant part because the ayatollah was afraid of Reagan.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes, sir.",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: I hope a similar dynamic is playing out. And if we can see more hostages come home, that would be cause for enormous celebration.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, thank you. Good morning.",
      "We'll be back with Face the Nation in just one moment. Please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "We go now to California Democratic Senator Alex Padilla. He joins us this morning from Porter Ranch, California.",
      "Senator, good to see you.",
      "Let's start with Kash Patel. Your reaction to that nomination or that suggested nomination from president-elect Trump?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA (D-California): Well, good morning. Great to be with you.",
      "And, look, the \u2013 this announcement that Kash Patel is going to be nominated for a high-ranking position at the FBI, very key to the Department of Justice, raises a lot of the same questions that other announcements and other nominations raise.",
      "Are they going to go in there and do the job of \u2013 that the Department of Justice calls for to truly, truly be independent of the president of the United States, or is he going in there to do Trump's bidding? That's the big question here. Is it a genuine, legitimate appointment or a political appointment to politicize the bureau and the Department in Trump's \u2013 in Trump's favor?",
      "That's just the beginning of the questions that we expect to raise in the con \u2013 in the confirmation hearings that will begin in January.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you expect that the current FBI director, who has three years remaining, will just have to resign?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Well, that's going to be a personal decision for Director Wray who, look, the public should remember, was a Trump appointee to begin with.",
      "And so he's got three years left. It's up to him to resign or not. Your prior guest suggested that Trump may very well fire him, which is just par for the course. Anybody who recalls the first Trump administration recalls a whole lot of Cabinet officials being named, being confirmed, and being sold as the greatest thing since sliced bread.",
      "And, as soon as they lose favor with Trump, as soon as they don't do 100 percent of what he's demanding, all of a sudden, you know, they're fired, a lot of times by social media posts. And so who knows what Donald Trump is going to decide to do, whether it's with Director Wray, Kash Patel or any of his other nominees this coming term.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: During the first Trump administration, California fashioned itself the resistance state. Some Democrats in the legislature have already begun to describe that as a cliche and say they don't even know what that means anymore.",
      "What does it mean?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Look, I think there's a lot of reason for concern of the second Trump administration, if the first administration is any indicator.",
      "I think, as the governor, as other legislative leaders and even the congressional delegation have said, if \u2013 if, you know, the federal government will continue to support California in its leadership in so many policy areas, there's a lot of good work to be done there.",
      "But Donald Trump has made it no secret that he has it in for California, whether it's the withholding of disaster funds, I mean, a lot of FEMA dollars that Donald Trump tried to keep from, not the state government of California, but from California families, simply because it's a state that did not vote for him in the presidential election. We're trying to inoculate ourselves from those types of threats.",
      "There's also a lot of good that \u2013 that can be finalized before the end of the Biden administration, whether it's Environmental Protection Agency waivers that will allow California to continue to grow our economy while tackling climate change aggressively, waivers at Health and Human Services that would give California a little bit of flexibility with our Medicare dollars to be able to also treat behavioral health issues, mental health issues of Californians, because when \u2013 we know that treating the whole body is good for both physical and mental health.",
      "We're trying to make sure those waivers\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Where do those \u2013 where \u2013 where\u2026",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: \u2026 are locked in before the end of the Biden administration.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Where do you stand with the Biden administration on that, Senator? Are they going to be responsive?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: They've been very encouraging that the technical work can and should be done before the end of the term.",
      "But we'll know it when there's signatures on the documents that we need. But, again, these are just examples that we want to lock into place before President Trump comes into office, and then can use it either as a threat, as a punishment, or, as Senator Cruz mentioned in the prior segment, simply leverage to get other things he would want out of California.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You know President elect Trump has promised mass deportations. You also know, in California, there is a state law that tells local law enforcement not to participate and cooperate with ICE agents in deportation or identification processes.",
      "The incoming Trump administration border czar, Tom Homan, has said any law enforcement who don't cooperate will be prosecuted under federal law. How is this going to be resolved?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes. Well, I think there's an important distinction here.",
      "No state government, not Texas, not California, not any state in the nation, has a constitutional authority to impose federal immigration law. That is the responsibility of the federal government. Some states like Texas want to push the envelope and try to find a way to assist, but there's no obligation to do so.",
      "And that's what California leaders and municipal leaders throughout the state are saying. You know, we're not going to utilize state and local resources to do the federal government's job for them, number one. I think there's a long history of this being smart public safety policy as well.",
      "California is the most populous state in the nation, the most diverse state in the nation, home to more immigrants than any state in the nation. And the last thing you want to do is have immigrants who are victims of crime afraid to come forward to report that crime. The last thing you want is immigrants who may be witnesses to crime to be afraid to come forward and share any information that they have in the investigation and prosecution of crimes.",
      "That's what we're talking about here. Let the federal government do the federal government's job, but have state and local officials do the state and local officials' job. There doesn't have to be a conflict, unless that's what Trump wants.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The governor has called a special session that will convene this week to set aside money to battle the Trump administration.",
      "Will some of that money also be set aside to protect migrants and undocumented immigrants in California as they seek either legal advice or continued legal financial backing to support their efforts to stay within California and the United States?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes, again, if the first Trump administration is any indicator, we know that there will continue to be a lot of fear in communities and communities that deserve to know what their rights are and what their rights are \u2013 are not.",
      "And so, if it's legal assistance, legal advice, legal support, that's just the California way. We embrace our diversity. Our diversity is what has made our communities thrive and our economy thrive. And so we will assist families against the threats of the Trump administration.",
      "If we wanted to sort of cut to the chase, you know, we're hearing a lot of bombast from Trump and his allies about the biggest deportation operation in our country's history, on the one hand, versus a \u2013 maybe a focus on violent criminals on the other.",
      "Nobody \u2013 nobody disagrees with a focus on violent criminals.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Democrats, Republicans agree. But that's very different\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: \u2026 than millions and millions of people being deported indiscriminately, not just tearing families apart, tearing communities apart\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes, Senator.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: \u2026 but tremendous damage to our economy that that would create.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Alex Padilla, Democrat from California, we thank you for your time this morning.",
      "And we'll be back right away with a lot more Face the Nation. I invite you to please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Be sure to tune in to CBS News on January 20 for full coverage of Donald Trump's inauguration here in Washington, D.C. You can watch live on CBS, on Paramount+, or on our CBS News app.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We will be right back with CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, and author H.W. Brands.",
      "Please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We're joined now by CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger. She's in Southampton, New York, this morning.",
      "Jill, Senator Ted Cruz described tariffs and the threat thereof as leverage. But what I'm curious about economically is, do retailers view it as only leverage, do consumers view it only as leverage, or are they beginning to change their behavior in anticipation?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, let's just talk about whether or not they're going to change their behavior. We know that t here were some retailers who were sort of dangling this out around this holiday weekend, saying, oh, buy now because tariffs could make prices go up. I don't know what the motivation of most people is when they shop, but I'm not sure it's tariffs.",
      "What we do know about tariffs is, remember, this is a fee that is imposed on an imported good. The importing company, the U.S. company that takes that good in has to make a decision in that moment. And that company has to decide, are we going to eat it and maybe make less money this year, or are we going to pass it along to consumers. So, that is why consumers are a little unnerved by this, and businesses are as well, because they're not really sure whether they can pass that along and have consumers pay that additional price.",
      "What we know is, over the long term, in history, tariffs tend to increase the price of certain goods. It's not necessarily across the board. But, you know, it is hard coming off of what we've just come through in the last few years with this inflationary spike to imagine that consumers are just going to take it in stride. It is a real hard thing to imagine that any company or consumer is going to feel like they want to absorb higher prices at this point.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, there was a tariff story in the first Trump administration. Do you foresee a deeper and different tariff story potentially in Trump 2.0?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, I think there's two parts of that question, which is, we don't know what these tariffs are. And as Senator Cruz said, this is a negotiation. So, we don't know whether we're going to land in that negotiation. But a big difference between where we are today and where we were back in 2017 and 2018 is, during the early Trump administration, what we had was incredibly low inflation. That was after the financial crisis. For all those years, inflation or prices only grew by about less than 2 percent a year.",
      "Now, compare that with where we are now. We had inflation spike at a 40- year high of 9 percent in the summer of 2022. Yes, that inflation rate has come down, but prices are still about 22 percent, 23 percent higher than they were just four or five years ago. So, the big difference between the first Trump administration and the second Trump administration is prices are already high, and there are many Americans who are struggling.",
      "So, I think that that is the real fear among economists that I speak to. They're worried that this is going to cause a real anxiety among consumers, and that consumers might pull back at a time where they - actually, the economy's doing pretty well.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Talking about the economy doing well. You crunch a lot of numbers, Jill, and always break them down so easily for our audience. When you look at the data, what's the best news you see and what's the most worrisome sign?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, the best news as - is that the labor market has grown really substantially and has kept up. So, I think that the labor market has been the driver of this economy. And it's been pretty consistent.",
      "The other part of the good news story is that the United States economy, more than any other developed nation, has come out of the Covid era and that post-Covid inflationary spike much stronger in a growth mode. So, we are seeing really good things from the labor market. We're seeing things in the economy. We're seeing that AI and technology is really in a boom period. These are all wonderful things.",
      "So, what's the downside here? I hate to be a kill joy, but why not, I play one on Sunday mornings. And what I can see is that these tariffs could cause a problem for a lot of consumers who are already struggling, and also this idea that we are going to see the extension of the tax cuts from the first Trump administration in the individual tax code. There is a fear among some investors that while we may not have a crisis right now when it comes to the debt and the deficit, that the extension of those tax cuts could start to really unnerve financial markets. Not happened yet, but those are the two worrisome things, the tariffs and the debt and deficit. I think those are the two looming things. And, of course, all the things we can't contemplate right now.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The three stock indexes have gone up pretty regularly since Election Day. Is that a methodical and well thought out reaction to an election or a kind of exuberance that may soon run its course?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Time will tell. I think that the initial investor reaction was a second Trump presidency would mean a drop in the tax rates - or the extension of the tax cuts and those tax rates would basically be in place for another four years. So, we'd have low taxes, which is good for especially the wealthier people out there. They love low taxes. And corporate taxes were already enshrined in the code. OK, so we have taxes staying low. That's a big factor when you come - when it comes to investing.",
      "The second part is the idea that a Trump administration would have a light regulatory touch. So, when you saw that first few trading - those first few trading days after the election, what went up a lot? The most highly regulated industries. So, that could be energy, that could be banking, that could be other areas where you could really need an industrial companies where you need a lot of regulatory prominence in the working of your business. Lighter regulatory touch will mean that those businesses will do well.",
      "OK, so is it exuberance or not? Who knows? I can only tell you that as someone who watches markets all the time, when everybody tells me that the sky is clear and the sun is shining and it's rainbows and unicorns, the only thing I can remember is what my father used to say is, well, no one ever rings a bell at the top or at the bottom. So, if you're an individual investor, don't count on everything being great. There's going to be a market slide. There is going to be a sell-off at some point. Don't count on everything being great all the time. Stick to your game plan and only change that game plan, not when the administration changes, but when your own life changes. That's it.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Breaking it down for us, as always, and beautifully so. Jill Schlesinger, thanks so very much.",
      "And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We' are joined now by President Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. He is in New Castle, New Hampshire, this morning.",
      "Jake, good morning. It's good to see you.",
      "The Hamas video release of Edan Alexander, I know the administration regards it as a cruel propagandistic maneuver, but do you detect anything tactical at all in the timing of the release of this video, Jake?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN (President Biden's National Security Adviser): Well, Major, first, thanks for having me.",
      "And as far as this video, it is a cruel reminder of the barbarity and the brutality of Hamas, holding so many innocent people hostage, including Americans, including Edan. We were in touch with Edan's family yesterday. I'll be talking to the families of all of the American hostages, including Edan's family, this week.",
      "And I do think that Hamas is feeling the pressure. They're feeling the pressure because one of their main partners in crime here, Hezbollah, has now cut a ceasefire deal and they thought that Hezbollah would be with them until the end. They're feeling the pressure, of course, because their top leader, Sinwar, has been killed. So, they may be looking anew at the possibility of getting a ceasefire and hostage deal, and we are working actively with all of the key players in the region, including Israel and Turkey and Qatar and Egypt to try to bring that about.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The fate of the hostages, of course, on the administration's mind, on the minds of all Americans and all in the region. But also, Jake, I'm sure you saw over the last couple of days the video from Gaza of Palestinians surging to try to get a loaf of bread, in some cases crushing one another unintentionally. All suggestions are that the humanitarian situation there is - if it already isn't past crisis stage, near famine crisis stage.",
      "How much does that intensify the need to get this thing across, as you just said, the finish line?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: The humanitarian situation in Gaza is a crisis. You have too many people who are suffering from shortages of food, water, medicine, access to sanitation. Innocent people who deserve a measure of peace and deserve access to all of those life-saving supplies in abundance. The United States has been working, week in, week out, month in, month out, to open crossings, to move trucks, to insure that humanitarian aid gets in. And at critical moments, we have been able to intervene in ways that have staved off the worst case scenarios of famine. But it's constantly stocking (ph) Gaza. And so more needs to be done to get aid in.",
      "Now, part of the problem, as we've seen just in the last 24 hours, is not actually moving aid from outside Gaza into Gaza, but moving it around Gaza once it's inside. The U.N., in fact, said it was suspending movement from certain areas of Gaza because of concerns about looting. These are all things that would be helped if there were a ceasefire in place.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, is the probability of a ceasefire enhanced or undercut when someone such as South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham says, President- elect Trump wants a ceasefire before inauguration deal. Does that help you or hurt you?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, I think the key actor right now holding the decision on the ceasefire is Hamas. And the key thing motivating Hamas is not American politics or the American presidential transition, it's their determination about whether or not it makes sense for them at this point, after Hezbollah has abandoned them, after their leader has been killed, after their military formations have been degraded to finally say yes to a ceasefire and hostage deal. That's going to be the telling thing more than anything that's said back here.",
      "But I will say this, there has been very good coordination between our team and the incoming team on all of the aspects of the crisis in the Middle East. We felt it was important that we be in touch with them, to keep them up to speed on what's happening, because this handoff has got to be smooth. And they, in turn, have reciprocated by being open and transparent and working with us. This is how it should be in a transition. This is what we're going to keep driving for, for every day that we have left in office.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, I want to have a conversation with you about leverage as regards to the Israeli government. I want to play for you something that Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen said on this program a week ago.",
      "Let's listen.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands of Prime Minister Netanyahu, only to be ignored or slapped down entirely. And then President Biden sends more bombs and more money. That is not an effective use of leverage.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Your response?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: First of all, I respect Senator Van Hollen. He knows these issues as well as any person in Washington, and he is passionate about them.",
      "But, of course, we have a different perspective. We have, at various points over the course of this conflict, made asks of the Israelis consistent with our values and our interests. Have we gotten everything we've asked for? No. Have we seen a change in Israeli behavior with respect to the movement of humanitarian assistance, with respect to how they conducted certain military operations, including in places like Rafah? Yes, we have.",
      "And so, we do believe that we've had a constructive engagement with the Israeli government and also been able to make a difference on the ground with respect to the flow of humanitarian aid.",
      "In addition, we worked closely with the Israeli government to bring about a ceasefire in Lebanon. A ceasefire people said wasn't possible until a new administration took office.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, I want to take - turn your attention to Ukraine, where the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to indicate in a recent interview that he could possibly be open to a peace settlement in which Russia retains the territory it has. Ukraine, meaning Kyiv, keeps all the rest, if that is swiftly brought under the umbrella of NATO. Is that the outline or the contours of something you believe the administration believes could be workable?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, Major, I'm sorry to disappoint you. I can't negotiate in public on your program, and I certainly can't negotiate on behalf of President Zelenskyy, who really should speak for himself when it comes to the destiny of his country. The future of Ukraine should be determined at the negotiating table by decisions of the Ukrainians, not imposed from the outside by the United States or anybody else.",
      "I will say, though, that we have been engaging with the Ukrainians over the course of this year on how you marry the support we provided them for use on the battlefield with a diplomatic strategy for the negotiating table.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And some recent decisions in the administration have been criticized by Republicans as setting the situation on fire, meaning ATACMS and anti-personnel mines. Those advocates for Ukraine say those decisions are way too late to change the battle space in any strategically important way. Where do you come down?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Anti-personnel land mines, which are nonpersistent mines that shut off after two weeks so they don't represent a long term threat to civilians, these could be helpful against the particular type of tactics that the Russian infantry is using right now in eastern Ukraine. So, he's sending them.",
      "The ATACMS permission into Russian territory, that was a decision he took after Russia escalated by introducing North Korean troops into this war, a foreign army into this war. So that was a responsible, coordinated step that we took with other allies to respond to that provocation, to that escalation by Russia.",
      "The president has been clear all along, we are going to give Ukraine the tools it needs. We are also going to do what we can to put them in the best possible position on the battlefield so they'll be in the best possible position at the negotiating table, and then this war will ultimately end in diplomacy.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, thanks so much for your time.",
      "And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION.",
      "Please, stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back.",
      "We turn now to author and historian H.W. Brands. He is the Jack S. Blanton senior chair at the University of Texas in Austin. And his latest book is \"America First: Roosevelt vs. Lindbergh in the Shadow of War.\"",
      "He joins us this morning from Austin, Texas.",
      "H.W., it's great to see you.",
      "First of all, what does this America first clash then tell us if anything about today and references to America first?",
      "H.W. BRANDS (Author, \"America Frist: Roosevelt vs. Lindbergh in the Shadow of War\"): The debate that I describe in the book is whether the United States should enter World War II. Between the time Germany started the war in September of 1939 and the United States entered the war in December of 1941, that was the narrow focus of the debate. The larger question and the one that persists today is, what do Americans think their country's role in the world ought to be? Should the United States, must the United States take a leading role in the world? Should the United States concern itself in conflicts among other nations that perhaps don't directly address American interests? This - this was the question then. It's a question we're dealing with again today.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: If you could, sketch out briefly Charles Lindbergh's stature at the time this debate with Franklin Delano Roosevelt was engaged.",
      "H.W. BRANDS: Lindbergh came to the attention of the American public, indeed to the world public, in 1927 when he flew a solo flight for the first time across the Atlantic Ocean. He became this national hero. He became a world celebrity for accomplishing this great technical feat, but it was also a feat of personal daring.",
      "He was a darling of the United States, a darling in other countries. He was decorated by foreign governments. He became an early celebrity in an age when celebrity was first starting to take form. So, that was his position as of 1927.",
      "His celebrity took a different turn in the early 1930s when his and his wife's infant son was kidnapped and murdered in what then was called the crime of the century, which gave rise to the trial of the century. And so, this golden boy, all of a sudden had a dark shadow cast across his life. And so he was, in some ways, this star-crossed hero at that point.",
      "He continued to be influential in aeronautical engineering circles. He knew a lot about aircraft. But in the American mind he was this - he was this great celebrity. And many people were surprised actually that he did take a leading role in the debate over American policy because he was not a political figure, he eschewed politics.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And in that debate with Roosevelt, did Roosevelt and his administration regard Charles Lindbergh as a potential political threat? And if so, how did they deal with it?",
      "H.W. BRANDS: It's a little bit hard to say. Franklin Roosevelt at some point decided that he wanted to run for a third term. This broke a long- standing, informal rule of American politics. And he knew that Republicans were constantly going up to Charles Lindbergh and saying, you could be president. You'd be a great candidate.",
      "Lindbergh's father had been a congressman, but Lindbergh took from his father's experience, which turned out badly because of his opposition to American policy during World War I, that he didn't want to have anything to do with politics or politicians. He considered politicians a bunch of liars, people who could not be trusted and he considered politics this low and sort of mean occupation that he wanted to have nothing to do with.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: When this debate began in 1931, Lindbergh was in one place. When it ended in 1941, he was in a different place in the public mind. Some accused him of being a Nazi sympathizer. Some editorialist described him as an anti-Semite. Where do you come down?",
      "H.W. BRANDS: The one thing I should say is that everybody who calls him an anti-Semite or a Nazi sympathizer, had political reasons for doing so because Lindbergh became the face of opposition to American intervention in the war. And it served his opponents' purposes to paint him in this negative category.",
      "In terms of his Nazi sympathy, he - there were American Nazis. There was an American Nazi party. They were clearly Nazi sympathizers. Lindbergh was not a member of the party. In fact, the America first committee, of which Lindbergh was a part, took pains to keep its distance from those. Lindbergh did not want Germany to win the war. His position was that the United States should not place its frontier of security in the middle of Europe the way Franklin Roosevelt and the interventionists appears to be doing.",
      "But because he took that position - and it was a position the Germans supported. The Germans didn't want the United States to enter the war. There was this objective sense in which one could say that when Lindbergh gave a speech, it served the purposes of the German government.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How about his appraisal of American Jews wanted to push America into the war and then exercising outsized influence culturally in our country?",
      "H.W. BRANDS: So, the charges of anti-Semitism against Lindbergh really are associated with a single speech he gave in the autumn of 1941, in which he identified three groups that in his opinion were most influential in pushing the United States toward war. One was the British government. Britain was already at war, and he explained it was natural that they would try to get the United States involved in the war. The second group he said was American Jews. And he said, it's perfectly understandable that they should want the United States to get into the war given what Hitler and the Nazis have done to their relatives, friends, co-religionists in Europe. And the third group was the Roosevelt administration. He was most critical of the Roosevelt administration because Lindbergh claimed that Roosevelt was using the excuse of the war to further his own political ambitions.",
      "Now, merely for mentioning American Jews in the context of war policy, the sky fell down upon Lindbergh. Everybody who wanted to make sure that they weren't accused of anti-Semitism, everybody who opposed Lindbergh's policy came down and pointed the finger of anti-Semitism at Lindbergh.",
      "To what extent was Lindbergh actually an anti-Semite? Well, I would - I would - I would - I would put him in the category of the sort of not in my country club kind of anti-Semite, which was extremely common in the United States at the time.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Very quickly, H.W., there's a clash over information and disinformation. Both sides warn each other and the American public about that. Unspool that for us, if you could, real quick.",
      "H.W. BRANDS: The British government and the germane government, the two antagonists in the war at that point, were both engaged in propaganda campaigns in the United States. And so, when the British government would plant editorials, features in American newspapers, often unknown to the reading public, then Lindbergh and his side would say, well, look what the British government is doing. When the German government would do something similar, then the Roosevelt administration would say, look at what the German government is doing. So, each side then, the governments of the two sides, they were doing their best to sway American public opinion because they realized that in the end it was American public opinion that had to be persuaded.",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We turn now to Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who joins us this morning from Houston. Senator, it's good to see you. Good morning to you. Let's pick up this thread on tariffs. I remember covering your presidential campaign in 2016 and you were a skeptic of tariffs. Then I know the politics around tariffs have changed, President-elect Trump has done that, but have the economics changed?",
      "SEN. TED CRUZ: Well, I'll tell you, what hasn't changed is, is the importance of leverage. And I got to say, you look at the threat of tariffs against Mexico and Canada, immediately has produced action. We've seen the President of Mexico stand up and promise that she is going to work hand in hand with the President of the United States, President Trump, to secure the border. I'll tell you, representing Texas, we've seen four years of an invasion at our southern border. Let me ask you, Major. Why hasn't Joe Biden done this? Why hasn't Joe Biden actually stood up and used leverage to secure the border? And the reason is, Joe Biden and the Democrats wanted this invasion to happen. And I got to say, this is a promise that I believe President Trump is going to deliver on and deliver quickly. We are going to secure the border. This is about using leverage to get Mexico and Canada to cooperate. And I'll tell you Major I think one of the very first bills we're going to take up in the Senate, vote on, and I hope pass, is my legislation, the Justice for Jocelyn Act, that is a response to the horrific rape and murder of Jocelyn Nungaray, 12-year-old girl in Houston, Texas, killed by violent criminal illegal aliens released by Joe Biden and the Democrats. This is a promise the President needs to deliver on and I think he's going to.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So when you think about tariffs and President-elect Trump, you don't take them seriously as an economic matter. You take them seriously only as a diplomatic lever.",
      "SEN. CRUZ: Well, look, I think the President was explicit with Mexico and Canada. He said he will impose these tariffs unless they secure the border. It was explicitly leveraged. And by the way, that is the same way that President Trump negotiated the Remain in Mexico agreement. If you remember, during his first term, President Trump threatened tariffs against Mexico and AMLO, then the President of Mexico. He was incredibly scared and concerned. He was scared of Trump, and he ended up signing the remain in Mexico agreement, which produced the lowest rate of illegal immigration in 45 years. It was incredibly successful. What did Joe Biden the Democrats do when they came in? The very first week in office, they ripped up that incredibly successful international agreement. I expect we will once again enter into remain in Mexico, and we are going to see, I make a prediction right now, we will see the numbers plummet of illegal immigration coming into this country, not in a year, not in six months, but in January and February, because we will have a president who will vigorously enforce the law.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: On that point. Senator Cruz, you would concede, in the last three or four months, numbers have gone down already, have they not?",
      "SEN. CRUZ: They have ticked down slightly. We have still seen over these four years the highest rate of illegal immigration in our nation's history. 12 million illegal immigrants have come into this country. And I got to say, in a state like Texas, you want to see the consequences. This last election was an incredible landslide for President Trump. He won all seven of the swing states. And in Texas, President Trump won Hispanic voters in Texas, I won Hispanic voters in Texas, I won statewide by a million votes, nine points. And South Texas, the Rio Grande Valley, has literally spent over 100 years as a bright blue Democrat Bastion. This cycle, South Texas flipped Republican. And it is amazing what having 12 million people invade your home can do to change people's voting behavior. I think the President has a mandate to deliver on securing the border, and I look forward to working hand in hand with him to deliver on that promise.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Kash Patel suggested by President Trump as the new leader of the FBI. How enthusiastic are you about that?",
      "SEN. CRUZ: Listen, I think Kash Patel is a very strong nominee. I think the entire slate of Cabinet nominees President Trump has put forward is very strong. I believe every one of these Cabinet nominees is going to be confirmed by the Senate. I think Kash Patel is going to be confirmed by the Senate. You look at his background, he has a serious professional background. He was a prosecutor, he was a public defender. He was a senior intelligence staffer on Capitol Hill. He was a senior intelligence staffer in the White House. He was the Chief of Staff of the Department of Defense. He was the deputy director of national intelligence. And I got to say, all of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all of the people pulling their hair out, are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a real reformer come into the FBI and clean out the corrupted partisans who sadly have burrowed into senior career positions at the FBI. The FBI and the Department of Justice are two institutions incredibly important to the rule of law in the United States. I revere both. And one of the most tragic consequences of four years of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is both the DOJ and the FBI have been politicized and weaponized, and I think Kash Patel is a very strong nominee to take on the partisan corruption in the FBI.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: As you know, Senator, there isn't a vacancy at the top of the FBI. What should become of Christopher Wray, appointed by President Trump?",
      "SEN. CRUZ: Well, I think he'll make a choice. I think either he will resign or President Trump will fire him. But it's no secret to anybody, including Chris Wray, that he is not going to continue to serve as the head of the FBI under Donald Trump. Listen, if you look at James Comey and Chris Wray, there has never been a period in our nation's history where the FBI has suffered a greater loss of respect, where more Americans doubt the fundamental integrity of the FBI, and it's because James Comey and Chris Wray presided over allowing the FBI to become a partisan cudgel to be used to target parents at school board meetings, to be used to target people who chose not to take the COVID vaccine, to be used to target President Trump and to target the political opponents of Joe Biden the White House. It is tragic. That is not what the FBI is for. That is not what the DOJ is for. And I got to say Pam Bondi and Kash Patel, I think together, are a very strong slate of nominees to go and restore integrity to both institutions.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How do you place that up against the prosecutions of Bob Menendez, a congressman, a Democrat from Texas, Hunter Biden. Are those political prosecutions as well or not?",
      "SEN. CRUZ: Well, first of all, let's be clear, Bob Menendez was- was literally caught with gold bars and a stack of cash with his fingerprints taking bribes, and it's why Bob Menendez is not my colleague anymore. At that point, the evidence was overwhelming. Look Major, I wrote an entire book entitled \"Justice Corrupted: How the Left Has Weaponized the Legal System\", and it broke down- it started sadly under Barack Obama, where he began using the federal government to target his political opponents. The book details how many of those partisans then burrowed in to senior career positions during the Trump administration. They waged war against President Trump during his first term, and now under Joe Biden, they have been open and brazen, and I think it has done unbelievable damage to the integrity of the Department of Justice and the FBI. I think Merrick Garland will go down in history as the most partisan Attorney General our nation has ever seen. And I got to say, I hear regularly from- from prosecutors, from FBI agents, who are deeply dismayed about the institution they devoted a lifetime working for because- listen, I don't want a Republican Department of Justice. I don't want a Democrat Department of Justice. I want a Department of Justice and an FBI that enforces the law regardless of party. And sadly, we haven't seen that these last four years.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What can you tell us about the three Americans released by China who are in San Antonio. Have you been in touch with them? And do you have any concerns about the contours of that swap?",
      "SEN. CRUZ: Well, at this stage, we don't know all of the details of the contours of the swap, but I'll tell you, I am celebrating the return of three Americans, especially Mark Swidan. Mark Swidan is a Texan from Houston. His mom, Katherine, is from Luling, Texas. I've talked with Katherine many times. I authored and passed a resolution in the Senate that passed unanimously calling for Mark Swidan's return to America. He spent 12 years unjustly imprisoned in communist China. I'll tell you, I have raised it directly with the foreign minister of China. I've raised it with President Biden. I've raised it with Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, and I will give them credit on this. Tony Blinken, just two weeks ago was the most recent time I spoke with him about Mark Swidan, and the administration has pressed the Chinese government and Mark Sweden is back home with his mother, who has prayed for him, who has loved- loved him. I want to say, Mark, welcome home. Katherine, congratulations. I told you this day would come. This is a time where all Texans and all Americans should be celebrating.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Very quickly, Senator Cruz. Because I also know you care about the case of Austin Tice. Do you have any sense that the rebel gains in Syria of the recent vintage will have any chance of unlocking Austin Tice's freedom?",
      "SEN. CRUZ: I don't know. I certainly hope and pray Austin Tice needs to come home, and I hope and pray. Listen, there's a combination of two things working. One, as Joe Biden is in the process of transitioning out any- any outgoing President is looking to try to get some final wins, I would encourage him, and I'm sure he is doing everything he can to bring Austin Tice home, to bring the hostages in Gaza home, both the Israelis and the Americans bring them home in this window. I also think President Trump coming into office on January 20, the enemies of America, I think, are afraid of President Trump. That is a moment- I hope we have a moment right now that is very much like the end of the Jimmy Carter Administration right before Ronald Reagan came in. And we saw on January 20, our hostages in Iran released, I think, in significant part because the Ayatollah was afraid of Reagan. I hope a similar dynamic is playing out, and if we can see more hostages come home, that would be cause for enormous celebration.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, thank you. Good morning. We'll be back with Face the Nation in just one moment. Please stay with us."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We are joined now by President Biden's National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan. He is in Newcastle, New Hampshire this morning. Jake, good morning. It's good to see you. The Hamas video release of Edan Alexander, I know the administration regards it as a cruel propagandistic maneuver, but do you detect anything tactical at all in the timing of the release of this video, Jake?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well Major, first, thanks for having me. And as far as this video, it is a cruel reminder of the barbarity and the brutality of Hamas holding so many innocent people hostage, including Americans, including Edan. We were in touch with Edan's family yesterday. I'll be talking to the families of all of the American hostages, including Edan's family this week. And I do think that Hamas is feeling the pressure. They're feeling the pressure because one of their main partners in crime here, Hezbollah, has now cut a ceasefire deal, and they thought that Hezbollah would be with them till the end. They're feeling the pressure, of course, because their top leader, Sinwar, has been killed. So, they may be looking anew at the possibility of getting a ceasefire and hostage deal. And we are working actively with all of the key players in the region, including Israel and Turkey and Qatar and Egypt, to try to bring that about. In the coming days, conversations will be happening, even this very day, to try to make that happen as soon as possible.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, it has been reported that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a conversation with Edan's family, said, quote, conditions are ripe, unquote, for a hostage deal. How do you assess that?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, we have been working closely with the Israelis since President Biden went out into the Rose Garden and announced the ceasefire with- across the border between Israel and Lebanon, and what President Biden said was this opens a real opportunity to get that ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza. He also spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu that day, and Prime Minister Netanyahu told him he agreed, the time is right. The moment is now. Let's drive to get it done. And now, if the world can come together to increase the pressure on Hamas, we can finally break through, get a deal in place, get a ceasefire, get a surge of humanitarian assistance, and crucially, get those hostages, including those Americans, home safely to their families.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And what have the weekend talks in Egypt told you about the prospects for that?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Look you can never really tell about whether you're going to get across the finish line until you do, even if you get down to the 5,4,3,2,1, yard line. Punching it in, getting the deal, finally getting it done, that requires the ultimate breakthrough. So I can't predict whether it's going to happen. What I can say is, there has been progress. There have been steps forward. There is a renewed sense that this is possible, but we've been here before Major where we thought we were close, it didn't pan out. And so I'm not going to get ahead of myself or make any predictions or provide false hope. What I will say is, we're driving at this with everything we've got. We think we have a chance, but we won't rest until we get it done.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The fate of the hostages, of course, on the administration's mind, on the minds of all Americans and all in the region, but also Jake, I'm sure you saw over the last couple of days the video from Gaza of Palestinians surging to try to get a loaf of bread, in some cases, crushing one another unintentionally. All suggestions are that the humanitarian situation there is- \u00a0if it already isn't past crisis stage, near famine crisis stage. How much does that intensify the need to get this thing across, as you just said, the finish line?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: The humanitarian situation in Gaza is a crisis. You have too many people who are suffering from shortages of food, water, medicine, access to sanitation. Innocent people who deserve a measure of peace and deserve access to all of those life saving supplies in abundance. The United States has been working week in, week out, month in, month out, to open crossings, to move trucks, to ensure that humanitarian aid gets in. And at critical moments, we have been able to intervene in ways that have staved off the worst case scenarios of famine. But it's constantly stalking Gaza, and so more needs to be done to get aid in. Now, part of the problem, as we've seen just in the last 24 hours, is not actually moving aid from outside Gaza into Gaza, but moving it around Gaza once it's inside. The UN, in fact, said it was suspending movement from certain areas of Gaza because of concerns about looting. These are all things that would be helped if there were a ceasefire in place. Because with a ceasefire, with calm in Gaza, it becomes that much more straightforward to move the aid around the strip so that it can get to people, including to people who are currently in areas that are experiencing very heavy conflict. So one of the key things that we would like to achieve in this cease fire deal is the surge of humanitarian aid to go along with the release of the hostages.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake is the probability of a ceasefire enhanced or undercut when someone such as South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham says, President elect Trump wants a cease fire before inauguration deal. Does that help you or hurt you?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, I think the key actor right now holding the decision on the cease fire is Hamas. And the key thing motivating Hamas is not American politics or the American presidential transition, it's their determination about whether or not it makes sense for them at this point, after Hezbollah has abandoned them, after their leader has been killed, after their military formations have been degraded, to finally say yes to a ceasefire and hostage deal. That's going to be the telling thing, more than anything that's said back here. But I will say this, there has been very good coordination between our team and the incoming team on all of the aspects of the crisis in the Middle East. We felt it was important that we be in touch with them, to keep them up to speed on what's happening, because this handoff has got to be smooth, and they, in turn, have reciprocated by being open and transparent and working with us. This is how it should be in a transition. This is what we're going to keep driving for for every day that we have left in office.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, I want to have a conversation with you about leverage as regards the Israeli government. I want to play for you something that Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen said on this program a week ago. Let's listen.",
      "[SEN. VAN HOLLEN SOT]",
      "SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands of Prime Minister Netanyahu, only to be ignored or slapped down entirely. And then President Biden sends more bombs and more money. That is not an effective use of leverage.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Your response?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: First of all, I respect Senator Van Hollen. He knows these issues as well as any person in Washington, and he is passionate about them. But of course, we have a different perspective. We have, at various points over the course of this conflict, made asks of the Israelis consistent with our values and our interests. Have we gotten everything we asked for? No. Have we seen a change in Israeli behavior, with respect to the movement of humanitarian assistance, with respect to how they conducted certain military operations, including in places like Rafah? Yes, we have. And so we do believe that we've had a constructive engagement with the Israeli government and also been able to make a difference on the ground with respect to the flow of humanitarian aid. In addition, we worked closely with the Israeli government to bring about a ceasefire in Lebanon, a ceasefire people said wasn't possible until a new administration took office. And in fact, the fact that we were able to do that says a lot about our ability to work with the Israeli government to generate an outcome, including one that has many political detractors inside the Israeli system. So we'll keep at it every single day. I respect voices like Senator Van Hollen. I look forward to continuing to work with him. But of course, we see things a different way.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, I want to turn your attention to Ukraine, where the Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenskyy appeared to indicate in a recent interview that he could possibly be open to a peace settlement in which Russia retains the territory it has. Ukraine, meaning Kyiv keeps all the rest, if that is swiftly brought under the umbrella of NATO. Is that the outline or the contours of something you believe- the administration believes could be workable?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, Major, I'm sorry to disappoint you. I can't negotiate in public on your program, and I certainly can't negotiate on behalf of President Zelensky, who really should speak for himself when it comes to the destiny of his country. The future of Ukraine should be determined at the negotiating table by decisions of the Ukrainians not imposed from the outside by the United States or anybody else. I will say though, that we have been engaging with Ukrainians over the course of this year on how you marry the support we provided them for use on the battlefield with a diplomatic strategy for the negotiating table. And we've been driving towards that before the election, we continue to drive at it, and ultimately, the new team will have to work with President Zelensky to determine the diplomatic way forward.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And some recent decisions in the administration have been criticized by Republicans as setting the situation on fire, meaning ATACMS and anti-personnel mines. Those advocates for Ukraine say those decisions are way too late to change the battle space in any strategically important way. Where do you come down?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Look what President Biden has done at critical moments in the conflict, is try to provide Ukraine with the tools that it needs to succeed. Anti-personnel land mines, which are non persistent mines that shut off after two weeks, so they don't represent a long term threat to civilians. These could be helpful against the particular type of tactics that the Russian infantry is using right now in eastern Ukraine. So he's sending them. The ATACMS permission into Russian territory. That was a decision he took after Russia escalated by introducing North Korean troops into this war, a foreign army into this war. So that was a responsible, coordinated step that we took with other allies to respond to that provocation, to that escalation by Russia. The President has been clear all along. We are going to give Ukraine the tools it needs. We are also going to do what we can to put them in the best possible position on the battlefield, so they'll be in the best possible position at the negotiating table, and then that this war will ultimately end in diplomacy.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan. Thanks so much for your time.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Thank you.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And we'll be right back with a lot more \"Face the Nation.\" Please stay with us."

      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We go now to California Democratic Senator Alex Padilla. He joins us this morning from Porter Ranch, California. Senator, good to see you. Let's start with Kash Patel. Your reaction to that nomination, or that suggested nomination from President-elect Trump?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Well, good morning. Great to be with you. And look the this announcement that Kash Patel is going to be nominated for a high ranking position at the FBI, very key to the Department of Justice. Raises a lot of the same questions that other announcements and other nominations raise, are they going to go in there and do the job of- that the Department of Justice calls for to truly, truly be independent of the President of the United States? Or is he going either to do Trump's bidding? That's the big question here. Is it a genuine, legitimate appointment? Or a political appointment to politicize the Bureau and the Department in Trump's in- Trump's favor? That's just the beginning of the questions that we expect to raise in the car in the confirmation hearings that will begin in January.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you expect that the current FBI director who has three years remaining will just have to resign?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Well that's going to be a personal decision for Director Wray who, like the public should remember, both a Trump appointee to begin with. And so he's got three years left. It's up to him to resign or not. Your prior guest suggested that Trump may very well fire him, which is just par for the course. Anybody who recalls the first Trump administration recalls a whole lot of cabinet officials being named, being confirmed, and being sold as the greatest thing since sliced bread. And as soon as they lose favor with Trump, as soon as they don't do 100% of what he's demanding all of a sudden, you know, they're fired a lot of times by social media posts. And so who knows what Donald Trump is going to decide to do, whether it's with Director Wray, Kash Patel or any of his other nominees this coming term.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: During the first Trump administration, California fashioned itself the resistance state. Some Democrats in the legislature have already begun to describe that as a cliche and say they don't even know what that means anymore. What does it mean?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Look, I think there's a lot of reason for concern of the second Trump administration, if the first administration is any indicator. I think as the governor, as other legislative leaders and even the congressional delegation have said, if- if you know, the federal government will continue to support California in its leadership in so many policy areas, there's a lot of good work to be done there. But Donald Trump has made it no secret that he has it in for California, whether it's the withholding of disaster funds. I mean, a lot of FEMA dollars that Donald Trump tried to keep from not the state government of California, but from California families, simply because it's a state that did not vote for him in the presidential election. We're trying to inoculate ourselves from those types of threats. There's also a lot of good that can be finalized before the end of the Biden administration, whether it's Environmental Protection Agency waivers that will allow California to continue to grow our economy while tackling climate change aggressively. Waivers at Health and Human Services that would give California a little bit of flexibility with our Medicare dollars to be able to also treat behavioral health issues, mental health issues of Californians, because when we know that treating the whole body is good for both physical and mental health. we're trying to make sure those waivers\u2013",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: \u2013Where do those waivers\u2013",
      "SEN. PADILLA: \u2013are locked in before the end of the Biden administration.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Where do you stand with the Biden administration on that, Senator? Are they going to be responsive?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: They've been very encouraging that the technical work can and should be done before the end of the term, but we'll note when there's signatures on the documents that we need. But again, these are just examples we want to lock into place before President Trump comes into office, and then can use it, either as a threat, as a punishment, or, as Senator Cruz mentioned in the prior segment, simply leverage to get other things he would want out of California.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You know, President elect Trump has promised mass deportations. You also know, in California, there is a state law that tells local law enforcement not to participate and cooperate with ICE agents in deportation or identification processes. The incoming Trump administration border czar, Tom Homan, has said any law enforcement who don't cooperate will be prosecuted under federal law. How is this going to be resolved?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Yeah, well, I think there's an important distinction here. No state government, not Texas, not California, not any state in the nation has a constitutional authority to impose federal immigration law that is the responsibility of the Federal Government. Some states like Texas want to push the envelope and try to find a way to assist, but there's no obligation to do so, and that's what California leaders and municipal leaders throughout the state are saying. You know, we're not going to utilize state and local resources to do the federal government's job for them. Number one, I think there's a long history of this being smart public safety policy as well. California is the most populous state in the nation, the most diverse state in the nation, home to more immigrants than any state in the nation, and the last thing you want to do is have immigrants who are victims of crime afraid to come forward to report that crime. The last thing you want is immigrants who may be witnesses to crime to be afraid to come forward and share any information that they have in the investigation and prosecution of crimes. That's what we're talking about here. Let the federal government do the federal government's job, but have state and local officials do the state and local officials job. There doesn't have to be a conflict unless that's what Trump wants.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The governor has called a special session that will convene this week to set aside money to battle the Trump administration. Will some of that money also be set aside to protect migrants and undocumented immigrants in California as they seek either legal advice or continued legal financial backing to support their efforts to stay within California and the United States?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Again, if the first Trump administration is any indicator, we know that there will continue to be a lot of fear in communities and communities that deserve to know what their rights are and what their rights are not. And so if it's legal assistance, legal advice, legal support, that's just the California way. We embrace our diversity, our diversity has made our communities thrive and our economy thrive. And so we will assist families against the threats of the Trump administration, if we wanted to sort of cut to the chase. You know, we're hearing a lot of bombas- from Trump and his allies about the biggest deportation operation in our country's history, on the one hand, versus a- maybe a focus on violent criminals on the other. Nobody- nobody disagrees with a focus on violent criminals. Democrats, Republicans agree, but that's very different than millions and millions of people being deported indiscriminately, not just tearing families apart, tearing communities apart, but tremendous damage to our economy that that would create.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Alex Padilla, Democrat from California, we thank you for your time this morning, and we'll be back right away a lot more Face the Nation. I invite you to please stay with us."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with H.W. Brands, Jack S. Blanton Sr. Chair in History at the University of Texas at Austin and author of \"America First: Roosevelt vs. Lindbergh in the Shadow of War,\" on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back. We turn now to author and historian H.W. Brands. He is the Jack S. Blanton Sr. Chair at the University of Texas at Austin, and his latest book is \"America First: Roosevelt vs. Lindbergh in the Shadow of War.\" He joins us this morning from Austin, Texas. H.W., it's great to see you. First of all, what does this \"America First\" clash then tell us, if anything, about today and references to \"America first\"?",
      "H.W. BRANDS: The debate that I describe in the book is whether the United States should enter World War II between the time Germany started the war in September of 1939 and the United States entered the war in December of 1941. That was the narrow focus of the debate. The larger question, and the one that persists today, is, what do Americans think their country's role in the world ought to be? Should the United States, must the United States, take a leading role in the world? Should the United States concern itself in conflicts among other nations that perhaps don't directly address American interests? This- this was the question then, it's a question we're dealing with again today.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: If you could, sketch out briefly Charles Lindbergh's stature at the time this debate with Franklin Delano Roosevelt was engaged.",
      "BRANDS: Lindbergh came to the attention of the American public, indeed, to the world public, in 1927 when he flew a solo flight for the first time across the Atlantic Ocean. He became this national hero. He became a world celebrity for accomplishing this great technical feat, but it was also a feat of personal daring. He was a darling of the United States, a darling in other countries. He was decorated by foreign governments. He became an early celebrity in an age when celebrity was first starting to take form. So that was his position as of 1927. His celebrity took a different turn in the early 1930s when his and his wife's infant son was kidnapped and murdered in what then was called the \"crime of the century,\" which gave raise- which gave rise to the \"trial of the century.\" And so this golden boy, all of a sudden, had a dark shadow cast across his life. And so he was, in some ways, this star crossed hero, at that point. He continued to be influential in aeronautical engineering circles. He knew a lot about aircraft, but in the American mind, he was this- he was this great celebrity. And many people were surprised, actually, that he did take a leading role in the debate over American policy, because he was not a political figure. He eschewed politics.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And in that debate with Roosevelt, did Roosevelt and his administration regard Charles Lindbergh as a potential political threat? And if so, how did they deal with him?",
      "BRANDS: It's a little bit hard to say. Franklin Roosevelt, at some point, decided that he wanted to run for a third term. This broke a long standing informal rule of American politics. And he knew that Republicans were constantly going up to Charles Lindbergh and saying, you could be president, you'd be a great candidate. Lindbergh's father had been a congressman, but Lindbergh took from his father's experience, which- which turned out badly because of his opposition to American policy during World War I, that he didn't want to have anything to do with politics or politicians. He considered politicians a bunch of liars, people who could not be trusted, and he considered politics this low and sort of mean occupation that he wanted to have nothing to do with.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: When this debate began in 1931, Lindbergh was in one place. When it ended in 1941, he was in a different place in the public mind. Some accused him of being a Nazi sympathizer. Some editorialists described him as an antisemite. Where do you come down?",
      "BRANDS: The one thing I should say is that everybody who called him an antisemite or a Nazi sympathizer had political reasons for doing so, because Lindbergh became the face of opposition to American intervention in the war. And it served his opponents' purposes to paint him in this negative category. In terms of his Nazi sympathy, he- there were American Nazis. There was an American Nazi Party. They were clearly Nazi sympathizers. Lindbergh was not a member of the party. In fact, the America First Committee, of which Lindbergh was a part, took pains to keep its distance from those. Lindbergh did not want Germany to win the war. His position was that the United States should not place its frontier of security in the middle of Europe,the way Franklin Roosevelt and the interventions appeared to be doing. But because he took that position, and it was a position that the Germans supported, the Germans didn't want the United States to enter the war. There was this objective sense in which one could say that when Lindbergh gave a speech, it served the purposes of the German government.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How about his appraisal of American Jews wanting to push America into the war and then exercising outsized influence culturally in our country?",
      "BRANDS: So, the charges of antisemitism against Lindbergh really are associated with a single speech he gave in the autumn of 1941, in which he identified three groups that, in his opinion, were most influential in pushing the United States toward war. One was the British government. Britain was already at war, and he explained it was natural that they would try to get the United States involved in the war. The second group, he said, was American Jews, and he said it's perfectly understandable that they should want the United States to get into the war, given what Hitler and the Nazis have done to their relatives, friends, co-religionists in Europe. And the third group was the Roosevelt administration. He was most critical of the Roosevelt administration because Lindbergh claimed that Roosevelt was using the excuse of the war to further his own political ambitions. Now, merely for mentioning American Jews in the context of war policy, the sky fell down upon Lindbergh. Everybody who wanted to make sure that they weren't accused of antisemitism, everybody who opposed Lindbergh's policy, came down and pointed the finger of antisemitism at Lindbergh. To what extent was Lindbergh actually an antisemite? Well, I would say- I would- I put him in the category of the sort of, not in my country club, kind of antisemite, which was extremely common in the United States at the time.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Very quickly, H.W., there's a clash over information and disinformation, both sides warn each other and the American public about that. Unspool that for us, if you could, real quick.",
      "BRANDS: The British government and the German government, the two antagonists that were at that point, were both engaged in propaganda campaigns in the United States. And so when the British government would plant editorials, features, in American newspapers, often unknown to the reading public, then Lindbergh and his side would say, well, look what the British government is doing. When the German government would do something similar, then the Roosevelt administration would say, look at what the German government is doing. So each side then, the governments of the two sides, they were doing their best to sway American public opinion, because they realized that, in the end, it was American public opinion that had to be persuaded.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Foreign interference in American public opinion, then and now. H.W. Brands, it's been a pleasure. Thank you so much. And we'll be right back"

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We're joined now by CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger. She's in Southampton, New York this morning. Jill, Senator Ted Cruz described tariffs and the threat thereof as leverage, but what I'm curious about economically is do retailers view it as only leverage? Do consumers view it only as leverage? Are they beginning to change their behavior in anticipation?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, let's just talk about whether or not they're going to change their behavior. We know that there were some retailers who were sort of dangling this out around this holiday weekend, saying, Oh, buy now because tariffs could make prices go up. I don't know what the motivation of most people is when they shop, but I'm not sure it's tariffs. What we do know about tariffs is, remember, this is a fee that is imposed on an imported good. The importing company, the U.S. company that takes that good in, has to make a decision in that moment, and that company has to decide, are we going to eat it and maybe make less money this year, or are we going to pass it along to consumers? So that is why consumers are a little unnerved by this and businesses are as well, because they're not really sure whether they can pass that along and have consumers pay that additional price. What we know is over the long term in history, tariffs tend to increase the price of certain goods. It's not necessarily across the board, but, you know, it is hard coming off of what we've just come through in the last few years with this inflationary spike to imagine that consumers are just going to take it in stride. It is a real hard thing to imagine that any company or consumer is going to feel like they want to absorb higher prices at this point.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, there was a tariff story in the first Trump administration. Do you foresee a deeper and different tariff story potentially in Trump 2.0?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, I think there's two parts of that question, which is, we don't know what these tariffs are. And as Senator Cruz said, this is a negotiation, so we don't know where we're going to land in that negotiation. But a big difference between where we are today and where we were back in 2017 and 2018 is during the- the early Trump administration, what we had was incredibly low inflation. That was after the financial crisis. For all those years, inflation or prices, only grew by about less than 2% a year. Now, compare that with where we are now. We had inflation spike at a 40-year-high of 9% in the summer of 2022. Yes, that inflation rate has come down, but prices are still about 22, 23% higher than they were just four or five years ago. So the big difference between the first Trump administration and the second Trump administration is prices are already high and there are many Americans who are struggling. So, I think that that is the real fear among economists that I speak to. They're worried that this is going to cause a real anxiety among consumers, and that consumers might pull back at a time where they- actually, the economy is doing pretty well.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Talking about the economy doing well, you crunch a lot of numbers for us, Jill, and always break them down so easily for our audience, when you look at the data, what's the best news you see and what's the most worrisome sign?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, the best news as- is that the labor market has grown really substantially and has kept up. So I think that the labor market has been the driver of this economy, and it's been pretty consistent. The other part of the good news story is that the United States economy, more than any other developed nation, has come out of the COVID era, and that post-COVID inflationary spike much stronger, in a growth mode. So we are seeing really good things from the labor market. We're seeing things in the economy. We're seeing that AI and technology is really in a boom period. These are all wonderful things. So what's the downside here? I hate to be a killjoy, but why not? I play one on Sunday mornings, and what I can see is that these tariffs could cause a problem for a lot of consumers who are already struggling, and also this idea that we are going to see the extension of the tax cuts from the first Trump administration in the individual tax code, there is a fear among some investors that, while we may not have a crisis right now when it comes to the debt and the deficit, that the extension of those tax cuts could start to really unnerve financial markets. Not happened yet, but those are the two worrisome thing:, the tariffs and the debt and the deficit. I think those are the two looming things and of course, all the things we can't contemplate right now.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The three stock indexes have gone up pretty regularly since Election Day. Is that a methodical and well thought out reaction to an election or a kind of exuberance that may soon run its course?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Time will tell. I think that the initial investor reaction was a second Trump presidency would mean a drop in the tax rates or the extension of the tax cuts, and those tax rates would basically be in- in place for another four years. So we'd have low taxes, which is good for especially the wealthier people out there. They love low taxes, and corporate taxes were already enshrined in the code. Okay, so we have taxes staying low. That's a big factor when you come- when it comes to investing. The second part is the idea that a Trump administration would have a light regulatory touch so when you saw that first few trading- those first few trading days after the election, what went up a lot? The most highly regulated industries. So that could be energy, that could be banking, that could be other areas where you could really need- industrial companies, where you need a lot of regulatory prominence in the working of your business. Lighter regulatory touch will mean that those businesses will do well. Okay, so is it exuberance or not? Who knows? I can only tell you that as someone who watches markets all the time, when everybody tells me that the sky is clear and the sun is shining and it's rainbows and unicorns, the only thing I can remember is what my father used to say is, well, no one ever rings a bell at the top or at the bottom. So if you're an individual investor, don't count on everything being great. There's going to be a market slide. There is going to be a sell-off at some point. Don't count it- on everything being great all the time. Stick to your game plan and only change that game plan, not when the administration changes, but when your own life changes. That's it.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Breaking it down for us as always and beautifully so. Jill Schlesinger, thanks so very much. And we'll be right back."

      "President Biden will travel to Angola this week, becoming the first sitting president to do so and following through on a yearslong pledge to visit sub-Saharan Africa while in office, as his presidency nears the end.",
      "Mr. Biden's trip marks the first president to visit the region since 2015, and comes as he has long planned to make the trip to discuss economic partnerships and the vision for Africa's first transcontinental open-access rail network, among other issues.",
      "The president, who departs for the trip on Sunday night, had pledged to visit the African continent in 2023 before earlier this year saying he would visit after he was reelected. But the visit was thrown into question when he dropped out of the presidential race, before a trip in October was announced. Mr. Biden then\u00a0postponed that trip\u00a0to oversee the domestic response to Hurricanes Milton and Helene.",
      "This week, the president is set to meet with Angola President Joao Lourenco and deliver remarks. Mr. Biden is expected to discuss infrastructure and economic opportunities with leaders, while highlighting the investments in Angola and Africa more broadly, according to senior administration officials previewing the trip.",
      "The president is expected to announce among a number of things that the U.S. government will have closed 12 deals in Angola by the time he departs the White House, with a combined value of $6.9 billion. He'll also outline a new global health security partnership aimed at responding to infectious diseases, while touting U.S. investments aimed at increasing food access and storage. And the president is expected to support the nomination of Angola's Kwanza Corridor as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the officials said.",
      "During the three-day visit, the president will also tout an infrastructure and rail project with heavy U.S. investment known as the Lobito Corridor, which aims to increase the speed of transport of critical minerals used for electric vehicles and AI data centers, along with drastically speeding up shipment times for food deliveries and helping to alleviate food insecurity in Africa.",
      "The visit comes as China and Russia have made inroads in the region with infrastructure investments, adding to U.S.' urgency surrounding making investments on the continent.",
      "Mr. Biden's trip also comes as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, spurring questions about the longevity of Mr. Biden's achievements. But the Biden administration officials noted that U.S.-Africa policy has enjoyed bipartisan support in recent administrations, and said they expect the next administration to continue building on the policy.",
      "The president also pledged when he took office to mend relationships around the world, after Trump's first term. The White House has touted a deepening relationship with African leaders, including Lourenco, who met with Mr. Biden in the Oval Office last year. In 2022, Mr. Biden hosted the Africa Leaders Summit, and since then, the administration officials said more than 20 Cabinet and other senior leaders have also traveled to the continent.",

    "story": [
      "Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California said on Sunday that President-elect Donald Trump \"has made it no secret that he has it in for California\" as Gov. Gavin Newsom has convened a special legislative session this week to prepare for legal fights in Trump's upcoming term.",
      "Padilla said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that there's \"a lot of reason for concern\" for the second Trump administration \"if the first administration is any indicator.\"",
      "The California Democrat cited reports that Trump initially withheld disaster funds for the state during his first term, saying the president-elect tried to keep federal dollars from California families \"simply because it's a state that did not vote for him in the presidential election.\" In September, Trump threatened to block federal wildfire aid for California if elected again.",
      "\"We're trying to inoculate ourselves from those types of threats,\" Padilla continued.",
      "California Democrats billed the state as the \"resistance\" state during the first Trump administration. And after Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election, Newsom announced that he would convene an emergency session of the California state legislature to \"safeguard California values and fundamental rights in the face of an incoming Trump administration.\" In addition to bolstering legal resources, the governor pointed to protections for civil and reproductive rights, climate action, and immigrant families.",
      "On immigration, Padilla said \"we're hearing a lot of bombast from Trump and his allies about the biggest deportation operation in our country's history.\" He said while \"nobody disagrees\" with a focus on violent criminals, that's \"very different than millions and millions of people being deported indiscriminately.\" Padilla said that providing legal support for communities that could be impacted by Trump's plans is \"just the California way.\"",
      "\"We embrace our diversity,\" Padilla said. \"Our diversity is what has made our communities thrive and our economy thrive. And so we will assist families against the threats of the Trump administration.\"",
      "Meanwhile, as a \"sanctuary state,\" California state law instructs local law enforcement not to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on deportations, teeing up what could be a clash with the Trump administration. Padilla, citing California's status as the most populous state in the nation with more immigrants than any other state, argued that the issue concerns the ability for people to be able to come forward to report a crime, saying \"the last thing you want is immigrants who may be witnesses to crime to be afraid to come forward and share any information that they have in the investigation and prosecution of crimes.\"",
      "\"Let the federal government do the federal government's job, but have state and local officials do the state and local officials' job,\" Padilla continued. \"There doesn't have to be a conflict unless that's what Trump wants.\"",
      "More broadly, Padilla said \"there's also a lot of good that can be finalized\" before President Biden leaves office, pointing to climate-related work and additional flexibility for public health care programs to target mental health issues. And the California Democrat noted that there's \"a lot of good work to be done\" beyond the current administration if the federal government will continue to support California.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Saturday that he plans to name Kash Patel as FBI director, who would replace the current FBI chief Chris Wray.",
      "In a post to his Truth Social platform, Trump called Patel \"a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People.\"",
      "For Patel to take the post, Wray would have to voluntarily vacate the position or be fired by Trump if he is to be replaced before his term ends in 2027. One source previously told CBS News the Trump team was aware of the complexities involved in ousting Wray.",
      "Patel will also have to be confirmed by the Senate. In his social media post, Trump did not call on Wray to resign. Trump nominated Wray in 2017 for the 10-year term after firing James Comey.",
      "An FBI spokesperson told CBS News in a statement Saturday evening that, \"Every day, the men and women of the FBI continue to work to protect Americans from a growing array of threats. Director Wray's focus remains on the men and women of the FBI, the people we do the work with, and the people we do the work for.\"",
      "The 44-year-old Patel\u00a0served\u00a0in intelligence and defense roles in Trump's first term, including chief of staff to the secretary of defense. He was also designated by Trump to be a representative to the National Archives and Records Administration and fought a subpoena to testify before a federal grand jury in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case.",
      "He is an attorney and staunch Trump loyalist who rose to prominence as an aide to former Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California, fighting the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
      "He served on Trump's National Security Council, then as a senior adviser to acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell, and later as chief of staff to acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller.",
      "Patel published a 2023 book titled \"Government Gangsters,\" which received praise from Trump and in which Patel writes that the \"FBI has become so thoroughly compromised that it will remain a threat to the people unless drastic measures are taken.\"",
      "\"This is the roadmap to end the Deep State's reign,\" Trump said on Truth Social about the book in September 2023.",
      "Patel, who was born in Long Island, New York, did his undergraduate work at Richmond University and earned his law degree from Pace University, as well as a certificate of international law from University of College London. He served as a county and federal public defender in Florida from 2005 to 2013 before joining the Justice Department as a trial attorney.",
      "Speaking on Steve Bannon's podcast in December 2023, Patel said that he and other Trump loyalists \"will go out and find the conspirators, not just in government but in the media.\"",
      "\"We're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,\" Patel said to Bannon, the former White House chief strategist in Trump's first term, repeating false claims often stated, without evidence, by many Republican leaders of voter fraud in the 2020 election. \"We're going to come after you, whether it's criminally or civilly. We'll figure that out. But yeah, we're putting you all on notice\u2026We're actually going to use the Constitution to prosecute them for crimes they said we have always been guilty of but never have.\"",
      "Wray and the FBI's leadership became targets of Trump's enduring ire in 2022, when FBI agents executed a court-authorized search warrant at Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The search exposed what had been an ongoing federal probe into Trump's handling of classified records after he left office.",
      "Special counsel Jack Smith, appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, ultimately charged Trump with dozens of counts, including the illegal retention of national defense information and obstruction, as a result of the investigation. All the charges were dismissed by a federal judge earlier this year. Trump pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.",
      "Earlier this week, a federal appeals court granted Smith's bid to end the case, with Smith citing a longstanding Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate, Patel would be the third FBI director to work under a Trump administration and would take over the nation's chief federal law enforcement apparatus amid years of intense criticism from Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill. While Wray's departure from the job was largely expected, Trump's announcement about replacing Wray before his 10-year term was to end is sure to reverberate throughout the bureau's rank-and-file. Presidents, however, have the power to force them out of the role and many previous directors have not served their full terms.",
      "Patel would report directly to the attorney general of the United States \u2014\u00a0 Trump's current pick for the post is former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. The president-elect announced her nomination after former Congressman Matt Gaetz withdrew his nomination because his confirmation prospects looked dim as a bipartisan group of senators raised concerns about his past conduct and a Congressional ethics report. Gaetz \u2014 a staunch critic of the Justice Department and FBI \u2014 has denied wrongdoing.",
      "Trump's pick for Attorney General and FBI Director are likely to be tasked with potential reforms and mass policy overhauls of the agencies that have long been targets of the president-elect.",
      "Wray \u2014 a former federal prosecutor and counterterrorism official \u2014 was nominated by then-President Trump in 2017. President Biden retained him as FBI director throughout his administration.",
      "While deep distrust of the FBI has been the focal point of Trump and his supporters, Wray spent much of his tenure on countering China's espionage campaigns. He sounded the alarm on foreign efforts to target American infrastructure and warned of aggressive posturing by Iran and Russia. The FBI employs about 35,000 people \u2014 including thousands of field agents \u2014 tasked with enforcing federal law and investigating crimes across the country, including terrorism, espionage, and child exploitation.",
      "The last FBI director to serve a full 10-year appointment was Robert Mueller, who was later named special counsel during the first Trump administration to investigate Russia's efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election and allegations of collusion with the Trump campaign. Mueller, and by extension the entire Justice Department and FBI, quickly became a target for Trump and Republicans in Congress.",
      "Trump's decision to fire then-FBI Director James Comey in 2017 because of the investigation into the 2016 election contributed to Mueller's appointment as special counsel. Comey, who has since become an outspoken critic of the president-elect, found himself at odds with Democrats and Republicans upon his departure from the FBI's top job.

      "Joining Trump and Trudeau at dinner were Howard Lutnick, Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump's pick to lead the Interior Department, Mike Waltz, Trump's choice to be his national security adviser, and the three men's wives, a person familiar with the dinner plans who was not authorized to speak publicly and did so on condition of anonymity told the Associated Press.",
      "Also attending the dinner, the person told the AP, were Republican Senator-elect David McCormick of Pennsylvania, and his wife Dina Powell, a former deputy national security adviser under Trump, as well as Katie Telford, Trudeau's chief of staff.",
      "On Saturday, while leaving a hotel in West Palm, Trudeau told reporters that \"it was an excellent conversation\" with Trump the night before. He did not elaborate further and would not comment on questions about whether the tariffs were part of the conversation or about his relationship with the president-elect.",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he had a \"very productive meeting\" with Trudeau during which they discussed \"many important topics that will require both Countries to work together to address.\" For issues in need of such cooperation, Trump cited fentanyl and the \"Drug Crisis that has decimated so many lives as a result of Illegal Immigration,\" fair trade deals \"that do not jeopardize American Workers\" and the U.S. trade deficit with its ally to the north.",
      "\"I made it very clear that the United States will no longer sit idly by as our Citizens become victims to the scourge of this Drug Epidemic caused mainly by the Drug Cartels, and Fentanyl pouring in from China. Too much death and hardship!\" Trump said. \"Prime Minister Trudeau has made a commitment to work with us to end this terrible devastation of U.S. Families. We also spoke about many other important topics like Energy, Trade, and the Arctic. All are vital issues that I will be addressing on my first days back in Office, and before.\"",
      "The meeting also came after Trudeau earlier Friday cautioned that if Trump follows through on this threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products, he would be raising prices for Americans and hurting American businesses.",
      "Trump\u00a0has threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if the countries don't stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across southern and northern borders. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products\u00a0entering the U.S.\u00a0from Canada and\u00a0Mexico\u00a0as one of his first executive orders.",
      "\"It is important to understand that Donald Trump, when he makes statements like that, he plans on carrying them out. There's no question about it,\" Trudeau said to reporters in Prince Edward Island in Atlantic Canada earlier Friday.",
      "\"Our responsibility is to point out that he would not just be harming Canadians, who work so well with the United States, but he would actually be raising prices for American citizens as well and hurting American industry and business,\" he added.",
      "Trudeau said Trump got elected because he promised to bring down the cost of groceries, but now he's talking about adding 25% to the cost of all kinds of products, including potatoes from Prince Edward Island.",
      "Those tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump's team negotiated during his first term. Trudeau noted they were able to successfully re-negotiate the deal, which he calls a \"win-win\" for both countries.",
      "\"We can work together as we did previously,\" Trudeau said.",
      "Although Trump once called Trudeau \"weak\" and \"dishonest\" during his first term, ties between the two countries have remained among the closest in the world. Trudeau is the first leader from the Group of Seven countries to visit Trump since the Nov. 4 election.",
      "Trump aide Corey Lewandowski, speaking on Fox News Friday night, said that he was \"certain\" that Trudeau \"is going to come down and have a conversation with the president and say, 'Sir, what can we do to keep this border open, what can we do to keep goods flowing? We know we have problems we are here to fix it.'\"",
      "Trump made the tariff threat Monday while railing against an influx of illegal migrants, even though the numbers at the Canadian border pale in comparison to the southern border.",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone \u2014 and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian one between October 2023 and September 2024.",
      "Trump also railed about fentanyl from Mexico and Canada, even though seizures from the Canadian border are few in comparison to the Mexican border. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",
      "Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but they are ready to make new investments in border security.",
      "\"We're going to work together to meet some of the concerns,\" Trudeau said. \"But ultimately it is through lots of real constructive conversations with President Trump that I am going to have, that will keep us moving forward on the right track for all Canadians.\"",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday she is confident that\u00a0a tariff war with the United States\u00a0will be averted. Trump posted on social media that he had spoken with her and she had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States.",
      "When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.",
      "Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $2.7 billion worth of goods and services cross the border each day.",
      "Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 17:05:04 -0500",
    "summary": "LGBTQ voters were among the only demographic groups that did not move more toward Trump in the 2024 election.",
    "story": [
      "Lucian Holness woke up to a daunting reality on Nov. 6. Acute stress led the mix of emotions that struck the transgender marketing manager as they learned President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 never a reliable ally to the LGBTQ community and an increasingly hostile figure for transgender Americans \u2014 had won a second term in the White House.",
      "\"I went into this election fully expecting Trump to win,\" said Holness, who lives in New Jersey and began to medically transition during the pandemic, an experience they called \"liberating\" and \"amazing\" after a long time spent \"feeling like something was wrong.\"",
      "Assuming Trump would take the presidency again was a self-preservation tactic, Holness told CBS News but it did not necessarily soften the blow.",
      "\"Maybe I thought it would be a closer race than it was. And just seeing how many states we were losing, the immense way that we lost \u2026 that really destroyed me,\" Holness said. \"And for several days after I had no hope in humanity.\"",
      "After the election, commentators and analysts suggested Trump's decisive victory against Vice President Kamala Harris was broad evidence of a thirst for economic change across\u00a0the bright red map of the country. To win, he had punctured the Democratic \"blue wall\" and flipped all seven battleground states, with CBS News exit polls\u00a0indicating he had received support from more of the electorate than ever.",
      "LGBTQ voters were among the only demographic groups that did not stray toward Trump when they cast ballots in the presidential contest this year. Black women also overwhelmingly backed Harris at the polls.",
      "\"Black voters and queer voters understood the assignment in this election, and our assignment was to defeat the great threat to our safety and freedom that Trump poses, so that we can fight for what all of us need to be safe and free,\" said Melanie Willingham-Jaggers, the executive director of GLSEN, an LGBTQ advocacy group focused on supporting and educating young people. Willingham-Jaggers identifies as nonbinary and queer.",
      "The LGBTQ community has historically voted Democrat but unlike most other demographic trends this year, LGBTQ support for the party's presidential nominee rose substantially from 2020. CBS News' national exit polls showed 86% of people who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender voted for Harris, while just 13% voted for Trump. Echoing most Harris voters, a majority of LGBTQ\u00a0 people said they feared what could happen during another Trump presidency.",
      "People in the LGBTQ community told CBS News they see the recurrence of Trumpism as a tangible affront to their basic human rights. The implications feel particularly urgent to transgender Americans, whom the president-elect and his affiliates categorically targeted throughout the campaign.",
      "\"Unfortunately, these individuals are sadly misinformed,\" said Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump-Vance transition team, in a statement to CBS News. \"President Trump campaigned on being a president for ALL Americans and will unify our country through great success.\"",
      "\"I don't feel welcome here\"",
      "The Trump campaign ran advertisements attacking trans people for months ahead of Election Day, in a move that likely cost at least tens of millions of dollars. Criticized for scapegoating, one TV ad bore a tagline interpreted as an attempt to sow division: \"Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\"",
      "The advocacy organization GLAAD\u00a0counted 225 defined attacks on the LGBTQ community by Trump during his first White House term and latest presidential campaign, in terms of policy decisions and rhetoric, which transgender Americans and others who are LGBTQ told CBS News is damaging on its own. The Trevor Project saw a 700% spike in crisis calls throughout the day after the election, and research from the organization found recent politics negatively impacted the well-being of 90% of LGBTQ young people, while anti-trans state legislation in the last year drove up suicide attempts among transgender and nonbinary youth by as much as 72%.",
      "\"I don't feel welcome here,\" said Holness.",
      "Although New Jersey is a sanctuary state for LGBTQ rights, and Gov. Phil Murphy last year declared it a safe haven for transgender and nonbinary people seeking gender-affirming care, Holness is still concerned about the ways in which a second Trump administration and Republican Congress could potentially work to break down that refuge.",
      "\"What people think being trans is, versus the actual experience of being trans, are so vastly different. And if people would just listen to us, I think they'd be surprised how much we are the same as them,\" Holness told CBS News. \"It took me a while to take Trump seriously, but after seeing the rise in trans hate crimes, and the rise in anti-trans legislation, the bounty out on trans people just for existing, you know, it's become really scary.\"",
      "Trump's anti-LGBTQ and specifically anti-trans positions stretch back to his first term in the White House, when he scrubbed federal agency sites of representation and proceeded to roll back protections for LGBTQ\u00a0 people, among other policy decisions that clamped down on their abilities to live and work freely.",
      "But vitriol toward the community became integral to Trump's politics and his overall public brand during the latest presidential bid.",
      "Health care access under siege",
      "As Trump doubled down on anti-trans rhetoric in his speeches, he backed conservative proposals to restrict access to healthcare for transgender people and punish doctors who give minors gender-affirming care.",
      "\"The number one issue, of the many that the trans people I spoke with are worried about, is access to the health care that we need to live. This is not an abstraction. It is not a culture war. It is not a political football,\" said Gillian Brandstetter, a communications strategist at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"It is very much a problem of material need. Can we access hormone therapy? Can we maintain our relationship with our doctors? Can we maintain our insurance coverage?\"",
      "Trump pushed during his last administration to federally redefine gender along binary lines that would exclude transgender identities, effectively denying trans people legal recognition and upholding an outdated characterization of \"biological sex,\" even though\u00a0the medical field has expanded its view of the spectrum of gender identity. Renewed promises made by the campaign this year are fueling panic that he will attempt to implement it nationally again.",
      "Ryan Lyman, a trans college student in New York City who volunteered for the Harris campaign and said he has \"passing privilege\" after beginning hormone therapy at 17 and undergoing top surgery, told CBS News trans people elsewhere in the country are preparing for the worst case scenario. \"Passing privilege\" in this instance means Lyman may avoid some of the prejudice other transgender people face if he is publicly perceived to be a cisgender man.",
      "\"I've seen a lot of people on the Internet lately who are going back to their assigned gender presentation,\" Lyman said. \"There is a part of the community that lives in the Deep South, in red states, who have to go stealth for their own safety. And I do not judge them at all.\"",
      "A decision that could potentially work to protect certain trans rights before Inauguration Day is the outcome of United States v. Skrmetti, a landmark case set to go before the Supreme Court in December where justices will hear a challenge to Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming health care for transgender people younger than 18. The decision could have wide-ranging impacts at a time where almost half of U.S. states have enacted laws to limit access to various aspects of gender-affirming care, like hormones, puberty-blocking drugs or surgery.",
      "An uncertain future",
      "Many LGBTQ people are anxious about how Trump could alter fundamental parts of their lives, out in the world and at home.",
      "A growing number of transgender social media users have now spent the better part of a month sharing guidance on how to update licenses, passports and other legal documents to reflect their names and pronouns. LGBTQ couples told CBS News they are having conversations about whether they should rush to get married before January's inauguration and what family planning might look like once Trump is sworn in.",
      "Lee Robinson, a comedian moving from Denver to New York City, said they were already considering some of those big questions within days of the election. They had started to discuss their options with their girlfriend, too.",
      "\"It's not just marriage, it's parentage and fertility stuff, and queer adoption,\" said Robinson. \"It just totally throws off our ability to plan for our futures when this kind of thing happens.\"",
      "Everyone who spoke to CBS News for this story shared concerns about losing discrimination protections under a second Trump administration. They also wonder what it would mean if the Supreme Court's 2015 marriage equality ruling came under review and marriage rights, like abortion rights, were returned to the states.",
      "An updated policy rundown on Trump's 2024 campaign website called Agenda 47 offers a blueprint of his \"20 Core Promises To Make America Great Again.\" Among the items on that list, Trump pledges to \"keep men out of women's sports\" and cut federal funding for schools \"pushing critical race theory, radical gender ideology, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.\"",
      "These items echo GOP state lawmakers and government leaders who have sought to bar trans youth from athletic teams that align with their gender identities and ban\u00a0LGBTQ and racial identity-focused\u00a0lesson plans and books from school curriculum. The First Amendment's freedom of speech and religion clauses have been used in high-profile court cases to justify anti-LGBTQ discrimination.",
      "They are not just concepts. Anti-LGBTQ doctrines embraced at Republican rallies have in recent years been codified across the country, keeping transgender children off of sports teams and away from bathrooms aligned with their gender identity. In Florida, laws have been passed to take transgender-focused curriculum out of schools; a legal settlement earlier this year clarified that students and teachers would be able to discuss gender identity as long as it's not part of the curriculum.",
      "Capitol Hill is not immune, as Rep.-elect Sarah McBride, a Delaware Democrat set to become the first openly transgender person in Congress, faced a swift Republican-led attempt after her trailblazing win to restrict her restroom use\u00a0in the Capitol Complex.",
      "\"It's dehumanizing people,\" said Sarah Kate Ellis, the president and CEO of the advocacy organization GLAAD. \"They want to treat us as second-class citizens, question our dignity and respect.\"",
      "Ellis said measurable repercussions in the balance, like medical coverage and equality under the law, are joined by intangible consequences that could trickle down generations.",
      "\"I think of my kids, as my wife and I's marriage is under fire, but our neighbors' marriage isn't under fire. It's awful when you think about that,\" she shared. \"So, my kids, in their understanding, see us as less than the family next door because they have two moms versus a mom and a dad, or a single mom. I just think all these are their culture wars, not ours.\"",
      "Project 2025",
      "Experts often attribute the intensification of Trump's anti-LGBTQ platform to his ties with right-wing religious groups like the Heritage Foundation, an organization with a long history of espousing anti-LGBTQ laws that helmed the presidential transition proposal Project 2025.",
      "Project 2025 is a 900-page policy handbook developed by a team linked to more than 100 conservative groups, to which Trump had denied connections, though he is hiring several of its architects to fill key staff positions in the next administration. The book calls for an overhaul of the federal government to \"restore family as the centerpiece of American life.\" Its socio-political vision for how to do that, introduced on the first page of Project 2025, directs government officials to reject transgender people and LGBTQ identities across the board.",
      "\"The next conservative President must make the institutions of American civil society hard targets for woke culture warriors. This starts with deleting the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (\"SOGI\"), diversity, equity, and inclusion (\"DEI\"), gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights, and any other term used to deprive Americans of their First Amendment rights out of every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists,\" the document states, at the outset of its opening chapter.",
      "Although Trump attempted to distance himself from Project 2025 on the campaign trail, even going so far as to call some of its proposals \"abysmal,\" the blueprint is compatible with the Republican Party agenda. But at the same time, Trump also plans to nominate Scott Bessent to be treasury secretary. He's a billionaire and former George Soros hedge fund manager and if confirmed, he'd be the first openly gay person to serve in this role.",
      "\"We should absolutely take Trump at his word,\" said Willingham-Jaggers, of GLSEN. \"We should take Project 2025 at its word. We should expect a full court press to get everything outlined in Project 2025, created into policy and enacted as the starting point, not the end point, as the starting point. That's part one. That's what I'm concerned about.\"",

      "This follows recent high-profile criminal cases involving undocumented immigrants, including the murder of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley by a Venezuelan immigrant who crossed the U.S. southern border illegally.",
      "But in interviews, Homan and other top Republicans have shared contradictory and inflated figures about the overall number of noncitizens who Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials say fall into this category.",
      "In a recent interview with Fox News, Homan said there are \"over 1.5 million convicted criminal aliens in this country with orders for removal who we'll be looking for.\" The Trump transition team has said this number includes some migrants who have crossed into the country illegally, although they are not considered \"convicted criminal aliens.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson has claimed in recent weeks that the number of migrants apprehended for committing violent crimes specifically is \"by some counts, as many as 3 or 4 million people.\"",
      "However, Immigration and Customs Enforcement provided much lower estimates to Congress.",
      "As of July 21, ICE's national docket, which tracks immigrants facing deportation proceedings, listed roughly 660,000 noncitizens with criminal histories, including 436,000 convicted criminals and 227,000 with pending criminal charges.",
      "This includes noncitizens in ICE detention and those not detained by the agency.",
      "There are only estimates of the number of noncitizens currently in the U.S. As of 2022, there were roughly 24.5 million noncitizens \u2014 including at least 11 million unauthorized immigrants and 13.5 million people who are lawful permanent residents or temporary lawful residents, according to estimates by Pew Research Center based on the latest Census data.",
      "By Homan's numbers, around 6% of noncitizens would be convicted criminals. By Johnson's numbers closer to 12% of the noncitizens would be criminals, or as much as 24% of the unauthorized population.",
      "According to ICE's figures closer to 2.6% of the noncitizens in the U.S. have criminal histories.",
      "Response from Trump's transition spokesman",
      "The agency's totals are far below the millions suggested by Homan and Johnson, and ICE's figures remain the most accurate available for tracking noncitizens with criminal histories, according to C. Mario Russell, executive director for the Center for Migration Studies, a think tank that also supports policies that safeguard migrant rights.",
      "Johnson's office did not respond to a request for clarification at time of publication.",
      "Brian Hughes, a Trump-Vance transition spokesman, told CBS News that Homan was considering the number of migrants who have crossed illegally into the U.S. who evaded border patrol, sometimes called \"gotaways\" by immigration and border security officials.",
      "\"Tom Homan is right\u2013nearly 2 million 'gotaways' have evaded border patrol under the Biden-Harris wide-open border, which is more than four times the average under President Trump,\" Hughes said.",
      "Border Patrol estimates that roughly 1.7 million migrants have evaded apprehension since the start of fiscal year 2021. However, there is no official data on the number of so-called \"gotaways\" with criminal records.",
      "There were also \"gotaways\" during the Trump administration but the average number during Trump's first three years in office, before immigration fell during COVID-19, was four times lower than the totals in fiscal year 2022 and 2023, according to testimony by Steven A. Camarota, the director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies.",
      "In some interviews, Homan has also cited lower figures more in line with ICE data. On Nov. 14, for example, Homan told NewsNation, \"authorities have identified more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions.\"",
      "What ICE's data shows about the number of noncitizens with criminal histories",
      "Noncitizens \u2014 including those with green cards \u2014 can lose their legal right to be in the U.S. after committing a crime. Many of the people ICE tracks remain incarcerated and can be deported only after serving their sentences.",
      "Data suggests many of the 436,000 convicted criminals on this list, including over 13,000 convicted of murder and 62,000 people convicted of assault, have been in the U.S. for years. Non-violent offenders are also on ICE's docket, including more than 125,000 people convicted of or facing traffic offenses.",
      "In 2016, under the Obama administration, there were 368,574 convicted criminals in ICE's non-detained docket, according to data published by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General. In June 2021, a few months into the Biden administration, there were 405,786 convicted criminals on the list.",
      "Some criminal noncitizens remain in the U.S. for years because they come from countries that don't accept or limit U.S. deportations, including Cuba, Venezuela, and China. Others are legally protected from deportation under United Nations convention because they face a credible threat of torture if they return to their home countries.",
      "Government statistics indicate that a relatively small fraction of migrants processed by Border Patrol have criminal records in the U.S. or in other countries that share information with American officials.",
      "Additionally, although the data is not exhaustive, available studies suggest that undocumented migrants are incarcerated less frequently than native-born Americans.",

    "story": [
      "West Palm Beach, Fla.\u00a0\u2014 President-elect Donald Trump declared a win on stopping illegal immigration through Mexico on Wednesday after talking with that country's leader. But Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Mexico was already doing its part and had no interest in closing its borders.",
      "The two spoke just days after Trump threatened to impose sweeping new tariffs on Canada and Mexico as part of his effort to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs \u2014 a threat that drew a prompt and terse response from Sheinbaum, who said any U.S. tariffs would be met with reciprocal measures from her government \u2014 stressing: \"There is no subordination here.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said on Thursday she did not discuss tariffs in the call with Trump.",
      "Trump said in his social media posts that Sheinbaum had \"agreed to stop Migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border.\"",
      "Sheinbaum indicated on social media, however, that she'd \"explained\" to Trump that Mexico is already \"taking care of\" migrant caravans, calling it an \"excellent conversation,\" but indicating no major changes in her government's policies.",
      "\"I explained to him the comprehensive strategy that Mexico has followed to address the migration phenomenon, respecting human rights. Thanks to this, migrants and caravans are assisted before they reach the border,\" the Mexican leader wrote. \"We reiterate that Mexico's position is not to close borders but to build bridges between governments and between peoples.\"",
      "Trump's social media posts about the borders \u2014 describing what he called \"a wonderful conversation\" with Sheinbaum and suggesting Mexico had made concessions in the wake of his tariff threat \u2014 did move financial markets.",
      "Even if the proposed tariffs fail to materialize, Trump may argue to his supporters that the mere possibility of them is an effective policy tool, and continue to rely on tariff threats.",
      "But the only new policy clearly referenced by either leader in their social media posts Wednesday was a vow by Trump to launch a new national ad campaign warning against the dangers of fentanyl use.",
      "Sheinbaum had said in her message that she and Trump, \"also talked about reinforcing cooperation on security issues, within the framework of our sovereignty, and the campaign we are carrying out to prevent fentanyl consumption.\"",
      "In his third, rapid-fire post on his own Truth Social platform about their conversation, the president-elect said he would be \"working on a large scale United States Advertising Campaign, explaining how bad Fentanyl is for people to use \u2014 Millions of lives being so needlessly destroyed. By the time the Campaign is over, everyone will know how really bad the horror of this Drug is.\"",
      "On Massachusetts' Nantucket island, where President Biden and his family are celebrating Thanksgiving, Mr. Biden while visiting a firehouse Thursday was critical of Trump's plan.",
      "\"I hope he re-thinks it, I think it's a counterproductive thing to do,\" Mr. Biden told reporters.",
      "The president warned against imposing tariffs on North American allies.",
      "\"We're surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and two allies, Mexico and Canada. The last thing we need to do is begin to screw up those relationships,\" Mr. Biden said.",
      "Illegal migration across the Mexico border is down in part because the Biden administration secured some stepped-up cooperation from Mexico \u2014 the sort Trump seems to be celebrating.",
      "Arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped 40% from an all-time high last December. U.S. officials mostly credit Mexican vigilance around rail yards and highway checkpoints.",
      "Driven by mounting pressure from the U.S. to block migrants going north, in the past few years Mexican authorities have turned to sending them to southern Mexico, in a strategy seen by experts as an attempt to wear migrants out until they give up.",
      "Neither side clarified any firm plans to impose new tariffs in their social media messages on Wednesday. But their implementation could fuel higher prices for American consumers and slow economic growth, potentially blowing up the trade agreement among the U.S., Canada and Mexico that was finalized in 2020 during Trump's previous time in the White House.",
      "Trump on Monday said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders upon taking office on Jan. 20. He also proposed an additional 10% tariff on China tied to its exporting of materials used in the production of fentanyl.",

    "story": [
      "The history of White House Thanksgiving traditions date back more than 160 years to President Abraham Lincoln, who established the national holiday.",
      "During his time in office, Lincoln issued a proclamation calling for the celebration of Thanksgiving, triumphing over similar efforts of presidents who came before him, according to the National Park Service.",
      "The official designation of the annual national holiday is due, in part, to writer Sarah Josepha Hale. The NPS notes that in 1827 \u2014 as editor of \"Boston's Ladies Magazine\" \u2014 Hale began writing essays calling for the national holiday. Finally, on Sept. 18, 1863, she wrote to Lincoln asking him to use his presidential powers to create the holiday.",
      "Lincoln obliged and a few weeks later, on Oct. 3, 1863 \u2014 during the height of the Civil War \u2014 he issued the Thanksgiving Proclamation. Ever since, the country has celebrated Thanksgiving Day.",
      "But it wasn't until after a bill passed by Congress on Dec. 26, 1941, that made the holiday fall annually on the fourth Thursday in November.",
      "Thanksgiving at the White House is usually relatively quiet and includes the tradition of pardoning lucky turkeys from their doomed fate of the dinner table.",
      "Presidential turkey pardons",
      "The first turkey pardon ever issued is believed to have been by Lincoln as recorded by White House reporter Noah Brooks in an 1865 dispatch, according to the White House Historical Association.",
      "Lincoln had granted clemency to a turkey named Jack belonging to his son Tad Lincoln, that had originally been slated to be gobbled up at the family's Christmas dinner in 1863.",
      "But the annual practice in which the White House sent pardoned presentation turkeys to a farm to live out their days did not occur until Ronald Reagan's presidency in the 1980s, the WHHA says. In decades prior, presidents would occasionally receive turkeys from the poultry industry and decide not to eat them without an official pardon.",
      "The WHHA notes the practice of sending presentation turkeys to the president became a norm in 1981, and the pardoning ceremonies quickly became a national sensation. By 1989, the annual tradition materialized with President George H.W. Bush \u2014 as documented by the association \u2014 speaking to the pardoned turkey, saying the line his successors still reprise at ceremonies today: \"He's granted a presidential pardon as of right now.\"",
      "On Monday, President Biden issued the final two turkey pardons of his term, to Peach and Blossom, sending them to live out the rest of their lives at Minnesota's Farmamerica as poultry ambassadors for agricultural students.",
      "Gathering with family and friends",
      "Aside from the turkey pardoning spectacle, presidents spend Thanksgiving in the same fashion as households across the country.",
      "The first documented Thanksgiving gathering at the White House dates back to Nov. 28, 1878, according to the WHHA. Then-President Rutherford B. Hayes held a large Thanksgiving dinner gathering with his family and private secretaries, singing hymns in the Red Room afterward and inviting African-American staff to enjoy their own Thanksgiving meal in the State Dining Room.",
      "The tradition has since withstood the test of time. Through economic hardship and times of wars, presidents have carved out time for family. The WHHA notes that President Woodrow Wilson's first Thanksgiving meal during World War I on Nov. 29, 1917, was an economical one \u2014 and one without cranberries.",
      "In recent decades, presidents have taken to the tradition of celebrating the holiday outside the White House at their so-called \"go-to\" vacation spots. President Ronald Reagan in 1985 traveled to the family ranch in Santa Barbara, California.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump spent all but one Thanksgiving of his first term at his Mar-a-Lago estate in West Palm Beach, Florida. President Biden has spent every Thanksgiving during his term with family in Nantucket, Massachusetts as the Biden family has for over 40 years.",

Elise Stefanik and Lee Zeldin, tapped to be U.N. ambassador and EPA administrator respectively, both said they were targeted, and the NYPD responded to a threat at the home of Howard Lutnick, tapped to be Commerce Secretary.

      "\"Swatting\" is the action of falsely calling emergency services in an effort to send armed police officers to a specific address or target in a threatening way. Bomb threats can represent a form of swatting \u2014 misleading authorities to believe that a serious threat or crime is underway to prompt an urgent response from police.

Mark Herring of Tennessee\u00a0suffered a fatal heart attack in 2021 after he was targeted, while a Kansas man was shot dead by police in 2017 who responded to his home.",
      "Though swatting may lead to felony charges and can be punishable by years behind bars, suspects are often tricky to track.

      "\"When Thanksgiving rolled around, we knew we wanted to spend it together, but we didn't know where,\" she writes. \"My parents wanted us to join them, his parents wanted us to join them, and even Neilia's parents had extended an invitation. We were touched and grateful, but it was stressful to think about choosing one family gathering over another, so I said to Joe, 'Let's go somewhere, just the four of us.'\"",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 12:17:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Then-candidate Donald Trump in September promised that he would sign legislation to grant federal recognition to the Lumbee Tribe.",
    "story": [
      "When Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigned in North Carolina, both candidates courted a state-recognized tribe there whose 55,000 members could have helped tip the battleground state.",
      "Trump in September promised that he would sign legislation to grant federal recognition to the Lumbee Tribe, a distinction that would unlock access to federal funds. He ultimately won North Carolina by more than 3 points, in part due to continued support from Lumbee voters.",
      "Now, as Trump prepares to return to the White House in January, the promise will be put to the test. He has Republican allies in Congress on the issue, and now the Lumbee, as well as tribal nations across the country, are watching closely to see what comes next.",
      "Tribal nations typically receive federal recognition through an application with the Department of the Interior, but the Lumbee have been trying for many years to circumvent that process by going through Congress. Chairman John Lowery called Interior's application process \"flawed\" and overly lengthy and said it should be up to Congress to right what he calls a historic wrong.",
      "\"It's just crazy that we're sitting here fighting this battle, and I have to tell you that I am real in 2024,\" Lowery said.",
      "Following the presidential election, the Lumbee hope there will be momentum behind their cause, but they face deep-rooted opposition from tribal nations across the country.",
      "There are questions about Trump's next move",
      "Several tribes, including the only one that is federally recognized in North Carolina, argue that if the Lumbee Tribe wants federal acknowledgment, it should go through the formal process in the Department of the Interior. One person familiar with Trump's thinking said the president-elect will require the Lumbee Tribe to do just that, and he won't sign a Lumbee recognition bill. The person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly speak about Trump's views.",
      "Trump's spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, said \"no policy should be deemed official unless it comes directly from President Trump.\"",
      "Federal recognition is of enormous importance, as it comes with access to resources like healthcare through Indian Health Services and the ability to create a land base such as reservations through the land-to-trust process. But before that happens, a tribal nation has to file a successful application with the Office of Federal Acknowledgement, a department within the Interior.",
      "The Lumbee Tribe has applied for federal recognition, but that petition was denied in 1985 because it \"could not establish the group's descendency either culturally, politically, or genealogically from any tribe which existed historically in the area.\"",
      "In 2016, the Interior reversed a decision barring the Lumbee Tribe from reapplying, but the Lumbee have opted for the congressional route.",
      "Gaining federal recognition through legislation is a rare but not unheard of path. But the Lumbee's approach has stoked a simmering debate in both Indian Country and Congress about Indigenous identity and tribal nationhood.",
      "The Lumbee have received support from members of both parties",
      "Members of Congress from both parties have supported recognizing the Lumbee through legislation, including Oklahoma Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a member of the Cherokee Nation who campaigned for Trump in North Carolina and backed the legislation.",
      "But perhaps the state-recognized tribe's most ardent ally in Congress is North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, who is up for reelection in 2026.",
      "Tillis introduced the\u00a0Lumbee Fairness Act\u00a0last year and has been a vocal supporter of the Lumbee. In interviews with The Associated Press, several tribal leaders, lobbyists, and advocates said they were told by Tillis directly or by his staff that the senator is currently and will continue to block certain bills backed by tribal nations unless the leaders of those tribes support the Lumbee.",
      "One of the bills he's promised to block, according to those interviewed by the AP, is a land transfer that would allow the Tennessee Valley Authority to return 70 acres of land to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, the only federally recognized tribal nation in Tillis's state. It would allow the tribe to put the land in Monroe County, Tennessee into trust. The plot is part of the tribal nation's homelands and contains the birthplace of Sequoyah.",
      "\"It's appalling to me. It's disgraceful,\" Principal Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Michell Hicks said. He said that Tillis told him earlier this year that he would stop any legislation dealing with the Eastern Band unless Hicks pledged his support.",
      "Hicks is among the tribal leaders who question the validity of the Lumbee's historical claims, and he said that is out of the question. At one point about a century ago, the Lumbee were known as the Cherokee Indians of Robeson County, and for many years now all three Cherokee tribes \u2014 the Eastern Band, the Cherokee Nation, and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians \u2014 have denounced this and been vocal opponents of granting the Lumbee federal recognition.",
      "Representatives for Tillis declined to comment.",
      "Tillis held up legislation last week that would have allowed for the preservation of the site of the Wounded Knee massacre. While doing so, he singled out the heads of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, who have backed the preservation measure, for not supporting his efforts to federally recognize the Lumbee.",
      "\"This is not about you,\" Tillis said to the two tribal nations, who he acknowledged had been trying for a century to preserve the site of the massacre. \"But you need to know that your leadership is playing a game that will ultimately force me to take a position.\"",
      "Tillis suggested it was a \"casino cartel\" in part driven by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and an Osage attorney named Wilson Pipestem working for the tribe, that is trying to keep the Lumbee from gaining recognition, which could one day lead to the Lumbee opening their own casinos. Tillis threatened to continue publicly naming tribal leaders and their employees who he felt were standing in the way of his bill.",
      "In a statement to the AP, Pipestem said Tillis should \"apologize to the Tribal leaders for his false allegations and unscrupulous tactics.\"",
      "Lowery acknowledged that Tillis has held up both pieces of legislation, but he said that Tillis has not done so at the direction of the Lumbee.",
      "\"If he's put a hold on the bill it's because he reached out to tribal leaders to see where they stand on his bill, and they apparently have told him that they're not in support,\" Lowery said. \"So, he said 'well, if you can't be supportive of my bill, I can't be supportive of your bill.'\""

      "Still, Trump in recent months had continued to attack Zuckerberg publicly. In July, he posted a message on his own social network Truth Social threatening to send election fraudsters to prison in part by citing a nickname he used for the Meta CEO. \"ZUCKERBUCKS, be careful!\" Trump wrote.",
      "The Thanksgiving eve visit also comes as tech mogul Elon Musk has become more influential in Trump's Make America Great Again movement, contributing an estimated $200 million through his political action committee to help elect Trump.

    "title": "NASA shows off image of U.S. military's abandoned \"city under the ice\"",
    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 11:46:48 -0500",
    "summary": "Scientists now have a clearer picture of Camp Century, an abandoned U.S. military base long hidden under the ice in Greenland, thanks to a NASA research team's good luck.",
    "story": [
      "As NASA scientist Chad Greene flew over northern Greenland with a team of engineers in April, they never expected their radar to find something manmade buried deep within the ice. Greene and his team were flying above the Greenland Ice Sheet on a NASA Gulfstream III plane, scanning the barren expanse of ice that's more than a mile deep in some areas, when their radar instrument picked up something unusual.",
      "\"We didn't know what it was at first,\" Greene said in a statement released by NASA's Earth Observatory this week, along with new images of the discovery. \"We were looking for the bed of the ice and out pops Camp Century.\"",
      "It turns out the team had stumbled upon an abandoned Cold War-era military base built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1959. Nicknamed the \"city under the ice,\" the compound consists of a network of tunnels carved into the ice sheet. It was abandoned in 1967 and, over time, became buried about 100 feet below the surface as snow and ice accumulated.",
      "The base was built as part of Project Iceworm, a then-secret plan to experiment with building a missile launch site under the Greenland Ice Sheet during the Cold War, when tension soared between the U.S. and the then-Soviet Union. Camp Century, a remote, nuclear-powered installation, was built to study the feasibility of such a project, but it was never realized and the base was decommissioned under the assumption it would be buried forever under the ice.",
      "While the \"city under the ice\" had been picked up by previous radar scans, the instruments used on the NASA flight in April provided a more detailed, if unexpected, survey.",
      "\"In the new data, individual structures in the secret city are visible in a way that they've never been seen before,\" said Greene, who works with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",
      "Past scans had used a type of radar that points straight down at the ground and produces a two-dimensional scan of structures buried beneath the ice. Greene's flight used NASA's Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar, which is able to produce maps with \"more dimensionality,\" according to the agency.",
      "A photo released by NASA on Monday showed the features of the base hidden deep under the ice, appearing as anomalies near the base of the ice sheet.",
      "\"Scientists have used maps acquired with conventional radar to corroborate estimates of Camp Century's depth \u2014 part of an\u00a0effort to estimate\u00a0when melting and thinning of the ice sheet could\u00a0re-expose the camp\u00a0and any remaining biological, chemical, and radioactive waste that was buried along with it,\" NASA's Earth Observatory said in its article this week. \"The scientific utility of the new UAVSAR image of Camp Century remains to be seen; for now, it remains a novel curiosity acquired by chance.\"",
      "A 2016 study of the abandoned base suggested that the facility could no longer be considered \"preserved for eternity,\" due to climate change increasing the rate at which Arctic ice is melting.",
      "CBS News' Walter Cronkite visited Camp Century for a tour of the still-under-construction facility for a program that aired in 1961. The camp's commander, Captain Tom Evans, explained to him that the goals of the program were three-fold: \"The first one is to test out the number of promising new concepts of polar construction. And the second one is to provide a really practical field test of this new nuclear plant. And, finally, we're building Camp Century to provide a good base, here, in the interior of Greenland, where the scientists can carry on their R&D activities.\"",
      "The exact nature of that research and development work wasn't discussed in Cronkite's report for the CBS documentary show \"The Twentieth Century.\" \u00a0(An abridged version of that report can be viewed at the link above.)",
      "Speaking with 60 Minutes in 2016, as that show revisited Cronkite's decades-old trip to Camp Century, producer Daniel Ruetenik said the trip was fascinating, and he marveled at the evolution of human interest in the vast, frozen expanse of the Greenland Ice Sheet.",
      "\"At the time [of Camp Century], the Cold War was considered to be the greatest threat to humanity,\" Ruetenik said. \"And now, the area has become a destination for climate scientists trying to study changes in the environment. So, it has a second purpose now.\"",

    "summary": "Forensic pathologists hope advanced DNA testing technology will enable them to attach names to all the unidentified people at the Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office.",
    "story": [
      "Some may have been lost hikers, runaway children, or wanderers.",
      "One thing connects the 58 or so remains at the Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office found with no identification card and no next of kin to claim them: They remain nameless.",
      "Forensic pathologists hope advanced DNA testing technology will enable them to attach names to all of the agency's unidentified people. But for now, five cases - all children and teens - have been sent for additional testing thanks to a $50,000 grant from Texas-based cold case resolution company Othram.",
      "They include the partial skeleton of a teenager found in Keehi Lagoon near the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in 2002; parts of the body of a 7- to 10-year-old boy discovered in Waianae in 2000; six fingers of a girl under the age of 4 who was found in Honolulu in 2012; and the skeletal remains of an adolescent found mixed with animal bones inside of a vase purchased in Honolulu in 2015.",
      "The medical examiner's office wouldn't provide additional details about the cases, but medicolegal investigator Charlotte Carter said each represents a person whose family deserves closure.",
      "The five cases sent to Othram for testing were chosen in part because they are juveniles who DNA experts felt had a good chance of being identified through advanced technology.",
      "One case is connected to a 2014 homicide, so the medical examiners office declined to provide information while the investigation continues.",
      "For the case involving the severed fingers, it's unclear whether they belong to a child who died or only suffered trauma to their hands. The other cases could be missing children, a possibility that can't be ruled out until DNA testing is complete.",
      "Carter said she's committed to resolving the other unidentified cases in Honolulu's morgue, especially if DNA testing becomes more accessible and affordable.",
      "\"Anybody who's unidentified deserves to have a chance at being found and identified,\" she said, \"and given their name back.\"",
      "The Honolulu City Council in June accepted the grant from Houston-based Othram, which performs forensic genetic genealogy testing, which combines DNA analysis with genealogy research.",
      "So far, Carter said, none of the samples have been identified.",
      "Sparse information about each case is available publicly through the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, or NamUs, an organization funded by the National Institute of Justice, which runs a national database of unidentified, missing and unclaimed persons. Representatives with NamUs didn't respond to interview requests.",
      "For some cases, very little is known.",
      "For the skeletal remains found inside the vase in Honolulu, for example, forensic pathologists could not identify an age range, gender, height, weight or year of death - only that the person was still an adolescent.",
      "Other cases include more clues. The young boy found in Waianae in 2000 was suspected to have died that same year. He was recovered without a torso and was missing one or more of his limbs and one or both of his hands.",
      "A forensic artist reconstructed his face, which is included on his NamUs profile, showing what he may have looked like in life. He's listed in the missing children's database as \"John Waianae Doe 2000.\"",
      "Carter said it can take a year or more for DNA testing results to come back.",
      "Thus far, her agency has worked on one successful identification with Othram.",
      "Skeletal remains unearthed by a construction crew in Manoa in 2010 were tested and later identified as belonging to William Hans Holling Jr., a Washington man last seen by friends and family in January 1985. Othram identified Holling's remains and the Honolulu Police Department confirmed his identity in July. No arrests have been made, and the investigation remains open.",
      "Serial killer-rapist identified with the technology",
      "Forensic genetic genealogy testing enables investigators to search for an unidentified person's relatives as a starting point and, with the help of public records, to build a family tree they hope will get them closer to an identification.",
      "The method became popular in criminal investigations in the 2010s after companies like 23andMe and Ancestry came onto the market. Those companies block law enforcement agencies like the FBI from their databases, but investigators can use others, like GEDMatch, which is public-facing, and FamilyTreeDNA, which allows limited access by law enforcement, according to Stephen Kramer, a former FBI in-house counsel and founder of Indago Solutions, a DNA identification company.",
      "While still working with the FBI in 2018, Kramer helped identify the Golden State Killer using forensic genetic genealogy testing. Joseph James DeAngelo Jr., pleaded guilty to 13 murder and rape charges for crimes committed in the 1970s and '80s and has admitted overall to 161 crimes involving 48 victims, including dozens of rapes.",
      "Kramer's company recently identified Albert Lauro as the murder suspect in the 1991 killing of Dana Ireland on the Big Island.",
      "During a presentation to University of Hawaii law students this month, Kramer said genetic analysis of the DNA found on Ireland's body connected him to ancestry information about the suspect. He discovered the man was 83% Filipino, meaning he had three Filipino grandparents. He was also 5% European and Scandinavian, with the rest a mix of Hawaiian, Maori and South Pacific Islander.",
      "That told Kramer the suspect's fourth grandparent was about 30% European and 25% Pacific Islander, he said. Kramer focused on that grandparent because it's generally easier to find public records for people of European descent.",
      "He used records to identify people with this ancestry who had moved to Hawaii and married into Filipino families, leaving very few potential matches. He traced a family tree with three Filipino grandparents and one grandparent descending from Europeans, Scandinavians and Pacific Islanders.",
      "There, he found his suspect.",
      "Investigators followed Lauro by picking up a fork he discarded, which was tested against a DNA sample from Ireland's body.",
      "Detectives later reconfirmed Lauro's identity with a swab when they brought him in for questioning on July 19. Hawaii County Police Chief Ben Moszkowicz later said police didn't have enough probable cause to arrest Lauro for Ireland's murder, and they let him go.",
      "He killed himself four days later.",
      "Factors hindering use of the technology",
      "Lack of funds is the main obstacle to more intensive screening and forensic genetic genealogy on cold cases, Carter said. Each case costs about $10,000, and NamUs pays for Honolulu to send around five cases per year for testing.",
      "The 58 unidentified cases at the Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office date back to about 1966 and include people found under a variety of circumstances.",
      "Many are skeletal remains uncovered at construction sites, Carter said. Others are remains discovered by hikers that likely belonged to people who were homeless and living in encampments in remote parts of the island.",
      "If remains are found on tribal lands, are more than 50 years old or otherwise suspected to be Native Hawaiian, medical examiners contact the Department of Land and Natural Resources' State Historic Preservation Division for confirmation. If the remains are confirmed to be Native Hawaiian, the agency takes custody of them for repatriation.",
      "But some unidentified cases involve people who died fairly recently and, although they were physically recognizable when they were found, still haven't been claimed by family members or matched through any national database.",
      "Forensic pathologists haven't been able to identify a woman fatally struck by a car while trying to cross a road on May 21, 2016, Carter said. She was between 50 and 75 years old, of Asian or mixed Asian ancestry and appeared to be homeless, according to her NamUs profile. Her DNA was run through the national database and Honolulu police collected her fingerprints and sent them to the FBI but received no matches.",
      "A few people have come forward thinking they knew her, but her identity wasn't able to be confirmed, Carter said.",
      "\"That is a person who was a victim of a crime,\" she said. \"But, unfortunately, we're not able to figure out who she is.\"",
      "The most recent case was discovered on Oct. 9 when military personnel doing a training exercise found two femurs inside a camping tent off a hiking trail in Haleiwa.",
      "Carter said her office doesn't track statistics on identifications but said usually one or two unidentified remains are ID'd each year through DNA testing. If a person is identified but their next of kin can't be found, their case is moved to NamUs's unclaimed persons database.",
      "If family members are found, they are able to collect their relative's remains for burial or cremation, Carter said.",
      "She hopes that as technology improves, testing will become more accessible so every case can be resolved.",
      "\"I just think everybody deserves a name and their family deserves an answer,\" she said. \"We have a lot of families who are out there wondering what happened to somebody they love. And now that there's new technologies, we're maybe going to get a little step closer to having more closure or more processing to that new normal for those families.\"",

      "The Sombrero galaxy, named for its resemblance to the Mexican hat, is about 30 million light-years from Earth, NASA said in a news release. The galaxy is surrounded by multiple rings, where stars are formed. At its center is a supermassive black hole that emits a bright jet of light and consumes material from inside the galaxy. Both the rings and black hole are relatively docile, NASA said, and neither creates much solar activity each year.",
      "What sets the galaxy apart is its 2,000 globular clusters, or collections of hundreds of thousands of old stars held together by gravity, according to NASA. These clusters allow astronomers to study stars, since there are thousands of stars in one area. The stars are roughly the same age, but they vary in many other ways, allowing scientists to compare them.",
      "Photos taken by the Webb telescope's Mid-Infrared Instrument, or MIRI, reveals a new texture in the galaxy's outer ring and details the dust along the ring. Such dust is an \"essential building block\" for solar objects, NASA said.",
      "The outer ring had been photographed before, but appeared smooth. The more detailed MIRI images revealed intricate clumps along the rings. The images also show various galaxies in the background, which NASA said can allow astronomers to learn about their properties, including how far away they are from the Sombrero galaxy.",
      "The Webb telescope is set to begin its fourth year of science operations this summer, NASA said. Researchers are able to apply for observation time with the telescope, with a record-breaking 2,377 proposals submitted in October.

      "Canada's antitrust watchdog said Thursday it is suing Google over alleged anticompetitive conduct in the tech giant's online advertising business and wants the company to sell off two of its ad tech services and pay a penalty.",
      "The Competition Bureau said that such action is necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
      "The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about non-compliance with the Competition Act.",
      "The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX. It estimates Google holds a market share of 90% in publisher ad servers, 70% in advertiser networks, 60% in demand-side platforms and 50% in ad exchanges.",
      "This dominance, the bureau said, has discouraged competition from rivals, inhibited innovation, inflated advertising costs and reduced publisher revenues.",
      "\"Google has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors, and distorting the competitive process,\" Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition, said in a statement.",
      "Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector.",
      "Dan Taylor, Google's vice president of global ads, said in a statement that the bureau's complaint \"ignores the intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice.\"",
      "The statement added that Google intends to defend itself against the allegation.",
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup, floated in a 23-page document filed this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" He outlined a timeline for a trial on proposed remedies next spring and plans to issue a decision by August 2025.",

    "summary": "Australia's full legislature has now passed a bill that will soon ban children under the age of 16 from using most social media platforms.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's Senate passed legislation Wednesday that, once signed by the country's leader who has strongly endorsed it,\u00a0will ban children under the age of 16 from using most social media platforms. The new law will give Australia the tightest restrictions of any democracy in the world on children's use of hugely popular social media apps.",
      "The Senate passed the bill by 34 votes to 19 on Thursday, a day after Australia's House of Representatives\u00a0passed the same bill by a sweeping margin of 102 votes to 13.",
      "Australia's major parties in the House all supported the bill, which will see social media companies such as TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for failing to prevent people under 16 from creating accounts on their platforms.",
      "Tech giant Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, has called for the bill to be delayed. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0posted online Tuesday, Meta said it was \"concerned the government is rushing this legislation without adequate consultation or evidence and there are still many unknowns with respect to its implementation.\"",
      "\"The Government's approach will likely require each app provider to collect personal identification or biometric data from all Australians in order to prevent under 16s from accessing their services, an inefficient and burdensome process for everyone,\" a Meta spokesperson said.",
      "Meta also pointed to a policy it introduced earlier this year on its Instagram platform, Instagram teen accounts, which limits who can contact teenagers via their accounts and attempts to moderate the content that young users see.",
      "In a post shared last week on the X platform that he owns, tech billionaire Elon Musk also condemned the Australian bill and said it seemed to him \"like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\"",
      "Other independent bodies and non-profit organizations have also taken aim at the bill, voicing concern that young people's human rights could be restricted by it.",
      "The CEO of the Save the Children charity Mat Tinkler said in a statement\u00a0earlier this month that while he welcomes government efforts to protect children from harm online, the solution should be regulating social media companies, rather than introducing a blanket ban.",
      "\"We are asking the government to reconsider this legislative approach and instead use the momentum of this moment to hold the social media giants to account, to demand that they embed safety into their platforms rather than adding it as an afterthought, and to work closely with experts and children and young people themselves to make online spaces safer, as opposed to off-limits,\" Tinkler said.",
      "The Australian Human Rights Commission, an independent government body, expressed its own \"serious reservations\" over the proposed law in an analysis published last week.",
      "\"There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights. One example of an alternative response would be to place a legal duty of care on social media companies,\" the analysis said. \"We also need to help children and young people to better navigate online spaces by ensuring the national curriculum includes a specific focus on teaching digital literacy and online safety.\"",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese rejected criticism of the proposed law as he\u00a0addressed the parliament\u00a0Monday.",

The company restored his account in early 2023, but with certain \"guardrails.\" In July, those restrictions were lifted by Meta.",
      "Trump has a combined 65 million followers on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse a candidate for president.",
      "Zuckerberg has since taken a more positive stance toward Trump. Earlier this year, he praised Trump's response to his first assassination attempt, calling it \"badass.\" Zuckerberg also complained that senior Biden administration officials pressured Facebook to \"censor\" some COVID-19 content during the pandemic.",
      "Still, Trump in recent months had continued to attack Zuckerberg publicly. In July, he posted a message on his own social network Truth Social threatening to send election fraudsters to prison in part by citing a nickname he used for the Meta CEO. \"ZUCKERBUCKS, be careful!\" Trump wrote.",
      "The Thanksgiving eve visit also comes as tech mogul Elon Musk has become more influential in Trump's Make America Great Again movement, contributing an estimated $200 million through his political action committee to help elect Trump. Musk is the billionaire owner of the X social network, a competitor to Meta.",
      "Trump's X account, then known as Twitter,\u00a0was also suspended\u00a0in January 2021. But his account was\u00a0reinstated\u00a0in November 2022 following Musk's purchase of the company. Must reinstated Trump's account after posting a poll asking users whether to do so.",

    "summary": "Daisy's mission is two-fold: To waste scammers' time so they can't speak to real people and to draw attention to fraud by warning consumers to be vigilant.",
    "story": [
      "Meet Daisy \u2013 an AI-generated grandma created by British phone company Virgin Media O2 as the ultimate scam buster. Daisy's sole purpose is to talk to scammers all day so real people don't have to.",
      "Daisy made her debut on Nov. 14 and has already had more than 1,000 conversations with scammers so far, the longest lasting around 40 minutes, frustrating them with her tech-illiteracy and wasting their time by telling irrelevant stories about her grandchildren.",
      "\"The newest member of our fraud-prevention team, Daisy, is turning the tables on scammers \u2013 outsmarting and outmaneuvering them at their own cruel game simply by keeping them on the line,\" Murray Mackenzie, director of fraud at Virgin Media O2, said in a statement.",
      "While Daisy may sound like a human, she is essentially an AI large language model with the character application of a grandma. She functions by listening to the scammers and translating their voice to text. The AI then searches its large database to find an appropriate response, based on the specific scam training it's received, and translates that text response to speech for Daisy to reply. All this happens in seconds with no additional input needed.",
      "The company told CBS they worked with known scam artists to train Daisy and used a tactic called number seeding to get Daisy's phone number added to a list of online \"mugs lists\" \u2014 lists used by scammers targeting U.K. consumers. When they call, Daisy \"has all the time in the world\" to keep the scammers occupied.",
      "In addition to wasting scammers' time, Virgin Media O2 hopes to draw attention to fraud by warning consumers to be vigilant about who they may be speaking to.",
      "\"Daisy is also a reminder that no matter how persuasive someone on the other end of the phone may be, they aren't always who you think they are,\" Mackenzie said.",
      "According to the company's research, 69% of the British public has reported being the target of a scam and the company says it intercepted and blocked over \u00a3250 million ($260 million) in suspected fraudulent transactions last year.",
      "\"Fraud is at epidemic levels, with organized gangs of fraudsters operating professional call centers which relentlessly target Brits every second of every day,\" said Virgin Media O2 COO Rob Orr.",
      "\"We're constantly building our defenses higher and sharing compelling evidence of what these gangs are up to but with no real deterrent in place, these criminals can repeatedly steal free from the threat of prosecution.\"",
      "Fraud is a big problem in the U.S. too. According to TrueCaller, a caller ID and phone blocking app, Americans receive an average of 2.9 billion unwanted or spam calls a month. That's about eight spam calls per user, per month.",
      "Although there is no American version of Daisy, many U.S. phone companies have call screening software that can identify a likely scam or robocall.",
      "On Nov. 13, Google announced a new A.I. feature for its Pixel phone that will go one step further and listen in to calls you make. Google AI will sound an alarm or vibrate if it detects conversation patterns commonly associated with scams, like a caller urgently requesting money transfers or asking for account login information or your bank details.",
      "As phone companies and scammers continue to innovate with AI for their own purposes, the best thing consumers can do is stay vigilant.",
      "\"In terms of tips and tricks, whether you're shopping online, reviewing your emails, or receiving an out-of-the-blue phone call, it's important to always remain vigilant,\" a spokesperson for O2 told CBS. \"We never call customers and ask for their full passwords, one-time passcodes or bank details over the phone, so any call like this is guaranteed to be fraud. Always check links you receive and if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\"",

      "\"Massad is an accomplished lawyer and a highly respected leader in the business world, with extensive experience on the International scene,\" Trump wrote. \"He has been a longtime proponent of Republican and Conservative values, an asset to my Campaign, and was instrumental in building tremendous new coalitions with the Arab American Community.\"",
      "His post went on to describe Boulos as \"a dealmaker, and an unwavering supporter of PEACE in the Middle East,\" who \"will be a strong advocate for the United States, and its interests.\"",
      "The selection comes as Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance continue their transition into the White House ahead of January's inauguration. Boulos will likely play a role in how Trump approaches Israel's ongoing war with Hamas in Gaza, which has triggered conflicts with Lebanon and Iran while threatening to spread more widely throughout the region. The Biden White House announced last week that it had helped broker a ceasefire deal between Israel and the Iran-backed group Hezbollah in Lebanon, although both Israel and Hezbollah have accused the other of violating the agreement. Negotiations for a similar deal with Hamas have long been stalled.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's announcement\u00a0Saturday that he intends to nominate Kash Patel as FBI director sent shockwaves through Washington over the weekend, prompting outrage from Democrats and even some former Trump officials, while some loyalists insisted they believed Patel would be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Patel, a 44-year-old who served in intelligence and defense roles in Trump's first term, is a controversial figure even within Trump's world, and a former U.S. official described him as \"by far the most dangerous pick\" Trump has made.",
      "\"There is no 'there' to him,\" the official told CBS News. \"He'll literally do anything.\"",
      "John Bolton, who served as national security adviser in Trump's first term and was Patel's boss, compared the nomination to Joseph Stalin's secret police chief.",
      "\"Fortunately, the FBI is not\" Stalin's secret police, Bolton said. \"The Senate should reject this nomination 100-0.\"",
      "In response to Bolton's comments, Vice President-elect JD Vance posted on social media that \"John Bolton has been wrong about everything so I guess Kash must be pretty awesome.\"",
      "In addition to objections about Patel at the helm of the FBI, current FBI director Christopher Wray's 10-year term is not due to end until 2027. For Patel to become FBI director, Wray would have to resign or be fired by Trump and Patel would need to be confirmed by the Senate. Republicans are set to hold a 53-47 majority come January, giving incoming Majority Leader John Thune only a few votes to lose.",
      "Trump called Patel \"a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People\" in a post on social media Saturday. And some of his supporters echoed the sentiment, like Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, who said Patel is a \"very strong nominee\" whom he thinks will be approved by the Senate.",
      "\"I got to say, all of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all of the people pulling their hair out, are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a real reformer come into the FBI and clean out the corrupted partisans who sadly have burrowed into senior career positions at the FBI,\" Cruz said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee Republican, said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he \"encouraged President Trump to bring Kash Patel to the table,\" saying Patel \"represents the type of change that we need to see in the FBI.\"",
      "Other Republicans, like Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, took a more cautious approach. Rounds expressed support for Wray, who was nominated by Trump in his first term in 2017.",
      "\"I think the president picked a very good man to be the director of the FBI when he did that in his first term,\" Rounds said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"I don't have any complaints about the way that he's done his job right now.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats were highly critical of the pick. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said on NBC that he will vote no, expressing concern that Patel \"is going to only care about protecting Republicans.\" And Murphy pledged to help his colleagues and the American public \"understand what's happening here.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump told the American public during the campaign that he was going to turn the Department of Justice into a political operation, an arm of the White House, to destroy his political opponents,\" Murphy said. \"Kash Patel's only qualification is because he agrees with Donald Trump that the Department of Justice should serve to punish, lock up, and intimidate Donald Trump's political opponents. And so the cost to the American public is pretty simple\"",
      "In recent weeks, Trump's most controversial selections for top posts in his administration have faced intense scrutiny as they prepare for the Senate confirmation process. And one pick, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, already withdrew his name from consideration facing headwinds in the Senate.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the current majority whip in the upper chamber, urged his Senate colleagues in a statement to reject Trump's pick of Patel, noting that \"we already have a FBI director\" and accusing the president-elect of wanting to \"replace his own appointee with an unqualified loyalist.\"",

      "Let's pick up this thread on tariffs. I remember covering your presidential campaign in 2016, and you were a skeptic of tariffs then. I know the politics around tariffs have changed. President-elect Trump has done that. But have the economics changed?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ (R-Texas): Well, I will tell you, what hasn't changed is \u2013 is the importance of leverage.",
      "And I got to say, you look at the threat of tariffs against Mexico and Canada immediately has produced action. We've seen the president of Mexico stand up and promise that she is going to work hand in hand with the president of the United States, President Trump, to secure the border.",
      "I will tell you, representing Texas, we've seen four years of an invasion at our southern border. Let me ask you, Major, why hasn't Joe Biden done this? Why hasn't Joe Biden actually stood up and used leverage to secure the border?",
      "And the reason is, Joe Biden and the Democrats wanted this invasion to happen. And I got to say, this is a promise that I believe President Trump is going to deliver on and deliver quickly. We are going to secure the border. This is about using leverage to get Mexico and Canada to cooperate.",
      "And I will tell you, Major, I think one of the very first bills we're going to take up in the Senate, vote on, and I hope pass, is my legislation the Justice for Jocelyn Act that is a response to the horrific rape and murder of Jocelyn Nungaray, 12-year-old girl in Houston, Texas, killed by violent criminal illegal aliens released by Joe Biden and the Democrats.",
      "This is a promise the president needs to deliver on, and I think he's going to.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So, when you think about tariffs and president-elect Trump, you don't take them seriously as an economic matter; you take them seriously only as a diplomatic lever?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, look, I think the president was explicit with Mexico and Canada. He said he will impose these tariffs unless they secure the border.",
      "It was explicitly leverage. And, by the way, that is the same way that President Trump negotiated the remain-in-Mexico agreement. If you remember, during his first term, President Trump threatened tariffs against Mexico. And AMLO, then the president of Mexico, he was incredibly scared and concerned. He was scared of Trump, and he ended up signing the remain-in- Mexico agreement, which produced the lowest rate of illegal immigration in 45 years.",
      "It was incredibly successful. What did Joe Biden the Democrats do when they came in? The very first week in office, they ripped up that incredibly successful international agreement. I expect we will once again enter into remain-in-Mexico.",
      "And we are going to see \u2013 I'm going to make a prediction right now. We will see the numbers plummet of illegal immigration coming into this country, not in a year, not in six months, but in January and February, because we will have a president who will vigorously enforce the law.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: On that point. Senator Cruz, you would concede, in the last three or four months, numbers have gone down already, have they not?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: They have ticked down slightly. We have still seen over these four years the highest rate of illegal immigration in our nation's history. Twelve million illegal immigrants have come into this country.",
      "And I got to say, in a state like Texas, you want to see the consequences, this last election was an incredible landslide for President Trump. He won all seven of the swing states. And, in Texas, President Trump won Hispanic voters in Texas. I won Hispanic voters in Texas. I won statewide by a million votes, nine points.",
      "And South Texas, the Rio Grande Valley, has literally spent over 100 years as a bright blue Democrat bastion. This cycle, South Texas flipped Republican. And it is amazing what having 12 million people invade your home can do to change people's voting behavior. I think the president has a mandate to deliver on securing the border, and I look forward to working hand in hand with him to deliver on that promise.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Kash Patel suggested by President Trump as the new leader of the FBI, how enthusiastic are you about that?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Listen, I think Kash Patel is a very strong nominee. I think the entire slate of Cabinet nominees President Trump has put forward is very strong.",
      "I believe every one of these Cabinet nominees is going to be confirmed by the Senate. I think Kash Patel is going to be confirmed by the Senate. You look at his background, he has a serious professional background. He was a prosecutor. He was a public defender. He was a senior intelligence staffer on Capitol Hill. He was a senior intelligence staffer in the White House. He was the chief of staff of the Department of Defense.",
      "He was the deputy director of national intelligence. And I got to say, all of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all of the people pulling their hair out are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a real reformer come into the FBI and clean out the corrupted partisans who sadly have burrowed into senior career positions at the FBI.",
      "The FBI and the Department of Justice are two institutions incredibly important to the rule of law in the United States. I revere both. And one of the most tragic consequences of four years of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is, both the DOJ and the FBI have been politicized and weaponized, and I think Kash Patel is a very strong nominee to take on the partisan corruption in the FBI.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: As you know, Senator, there isn't a vacancy at the top of the FBI. What should become of Christopher Wray, appointed by President Trump?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, I think he'll make a choice. I think either he will resign or President Trump will fire him. But it's no secret to anybody, including Chris Wray, that he is not going to continue to serve as the head of the FBI under Donald Trump.",
      "Listen, if you look at James Comey and Chris Wray, there has never been a period in our nation's history where the FBI has suffered a greater loss of respect, where more Americans doubt the fundamental integrity of the FBI.",
      "And it's because James Comey and Chris Wray presided over allowing the FBI to become a partisan cudgel to be used to target parents at school board meetings, to be used to target people who chose not to take the COVID vaccine, to be used to target President Trump and to target the political opponents of Joe Biden and the White House.",
      "It is tragic. That is not what the FBI is for. That is not what the DOJ is for. And I got to say, Pam Bondi and Kash Patel, I think, together are a very strong slate of nominees to go and restore integrity to both institutions.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How do you place that up against the prosecutions of Bob Menendez, a congressman, a Democrat from Texas, Hunter Biden? Are those political prosecutions as well or not?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, first of all, let's be clear. Bob Menendez was \u2013 was literally caught with gold bars and a stack of cash with his fingerprints taking bribes, and it's why Bob Menendez is not my colleague anymore. At that point, the evidence was overwhelming.",
      "Look, Major, I wrote an entire book entitled \"Justice Corrupted: How the Left Has Weaponized the Legal System.\" And it broke down \u2013 it started, sadly, under Barack Obama, where he began using the federal government to target his political opponents.",
      "The book details how many of those partisans then burrowed in to senior career positions during the Trump administration. They waged war against President Trump during his first term. And now, under Joe Biden, they have been open and brazen, and I think it has done unbelievable damage to the integrity of the Department of Justice and the FBI.",
      "I think Merrick Garland will go down in history as the most partisan attorney general our nation has ever seen. And I got to say, I hear regularly from \u2013 from prosecutors, from FBI agents who are deeply dismayed about the institution they have devoted a lifetime working for, because, listen, I don't want a Republican Department of Justice.",
      "I don't want a Democrat Department of Justice. I want a Department of Justice and an FBI that enforces the law regardless of party. And, sadly, we haven't seen that these last four years.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What can you tell us about the three Americans released by China who are in San Antonio? Have you been in touch with them? And do you have any concerns about the contours of that swap?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, at this stage, we don't know all of the details of the contours of the swap, but I will tell you, I am celebrating the return of three Americans, especially Mark Swidan.",
      "Mark Swidan is a Texan from Houston. His mom, Katherine, is from Luling, Texas. I have talked with Katherine many times. I authored and passed a resolution in the Senate that passed unanimously calling for Mark Swidan's return to America. He spent 12 years unjustly imprisoned in communist China.",
      "I will tell you, I have raised it directly with the foreign minister of China. I have raised it with President Biden. I have raised it with Secretary of State Tony Blinken.",
      "And I will give them credit on this. Tony Blinken, just two weeks ago was the most recent time I spoke with him about Mark Swidan, and the administration has pressed the Chinese government. And Mark Swidan is back home with his mother, who has prayed for him, who has loved \u2013 loved him.",
      "I want to say, Mark, welcome home. Katherine, congratulations. I told you this day would come. This is a time where all Texans and all Americans should be celebrating.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Very quickly, Senator Cruz, because I also know you care about the case of Austin Tice.",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Yes.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you have any sense that the rebel gains in Syria of the recent vintage will have any chance of unlocking Austin Tice's freedom?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: I don't know. I certainly hope and pray. Austin Tice needs to come home. And I hope and pray.",
      "Listen, there's a combination of two things working. One, as Joe Biden is in the process of transitioning out, any \u2013 any outgoing president is looking to try to get some final wins. I would encourage him and I'm sure he is doing everything he can to bring Austin Tice home, to bring the hostages in Gaza home, both the Israelis and the Americans, bring them home in this window.",
      "I also think President Trump coming into office on January 20, the enemies of America, I think, are afraid of President Trump. That is a moment. I hope we have a moment right now that is very much like the end of the Jimmy Carter administration\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: \u2026 right before Ronald Reagan came in. And we saw, on January 20, our hostages in Iran released, I think in significant part because the ayatollah was afraid of Reagan.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes, sir.",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: I hope a similar dynamic is playing out. And if we can see more hostages come home, that would be cause for enormous celebration.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, thank you. Good morning.",
      "We'll be back with Face the Nation in just one moment. Please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "We go now to California Democratic Senator Alex Padilla. He joins us this morning from Porter Ranch, California.",
      "Senator, good to see you.",
      "Let's start with Kash Patel. Your reaction to that nomination or that suggested nomination from president-elect Trump?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA (D-California): Well, good morning. Great to be with you.",
      "And, look, the \u2013 this announcement that Kash Patel is going to be nominated for a high-ranking position at the FBI, very key to the Department of Justice, raises a lot of the same questions that other announcements and other nominations raise.",
      "Are they going to go in there and do the job of \u2013 that the Department of Justice calls for to truly, truly be independent of the president of the United States, or is he going in there to do Trump's bidding? That's the big question here. Is it a genuine, legitimate appointment or a political appointment to politicize the bureau and the Department in Trump's \u2013 in Trump's favor?",
      "That's just the beginning of the questions that we expect to raise in the con \u2013 in the confirmation hearings that will begin in January.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you expect that the current FBI director, who has three years remaining, will just have to resign?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Well, that's going to be a personal decision for Director Wray who, look, the public should remember, was a Trump appointee to begin with.",
      "And so he's got three years left. It's up to him to resign or not. Your prior guest suggested that Trump may very well fire him, which is just par for the course. Anybody who recalls the first Trump administration recalls a whole lot of Cabinet officials being named, being confirmed, and being sold as the greatest thing since sliced bread.",
      "And, as soon as they lose favor with Trump, as soon as they don't do 100 percent of what he's demanding, all of a sudden, you know, they're fired, a lot of times by social media posts. And so who knows what Donald Trump is going to decide to do, whether it's with Director Wray, Kash Patel or any of his other nominees this coming term.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: During the first Trump administration, California fashioned itself the resistance state. Some Democrats in the legislature have already begun to describe that as a cliche and say they don't even know what that means anymore.",
      "What does it mean?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Look, I think there's a lot of reason for concern of the second Trump administration, if the first administration is any indicator.",
      "I think, as the governor, as other legislative leaders and even the congressional delegation have said, if \u2013 if, you know, the federal government will continue to support California in its leadership in so many policy areas, there's a lot of good work to be done there.",
      "But Donald Trump has made it no secret that he has it in for California, whether it's the withholding of disaster funds, I mean, a lot of FEMA dollars that Donald Trump tried to keep from, not the state government of California, but from California families, simply because it's a state that did not vote for him in the presidential election. We're trying to inoculate ourselves from those types of threats.",
      "There's also a lot of good that \u2013 that can be finalized before the end of the Biden administration, whether it's Environmental Protection Agency waivers that will allow California to continue to grow our economy while tackling climate change aggressively, waivers at Health and Human Services that would give California a little bit of flexibility with our Medicare dollars to be able to also treat behavioral health issues, mental health issues of Californians, because when \u2013 we know that treating the whole body is good for both physical and mental health.",
      "We're trying to make sure those waivers\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Where do those \u2013 where \u2013 where\u2026",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: \u2026 are locked in before the end of the Biden administration.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Where do you stand with the Biden administration on that, Senator? Are they going to be responsive?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: They've been very encouraging that the technical work can and should be done before the end of the term.",
      "But we'll know it when there's signatures on the documents that we need. But, again, these are just examples that we want to lock into place before President Trump comes into office, and then can use it either as a threat, as a punishment, or, as Senator Cruz mentioned in the prior segment, simply leverage to get other things he would want out of California.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You know President elect Trump has promised mass deportations. You also know, in California, there is a state law that tells local law enforcement not to participate and cooperate with ICE agents in deportation or identification processes.",
      "The incoming Trump administration border czar, Tom Homan, has said any law enforcement who don't cooperate will be prosecuted under federal law. How is this going to be resolved?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes. Well, I think there's an important distinction here.",
      "No state government, not Texas, not California, not any state in the nation, has a constitutional authority to impose federal immigration law. That is the responsibility of the federal government. Some states like Texas want to push the envelope and try to find a way to assist, but there's no obligation to do so.",
      "And that's what California leaders and municipal leaders throughout the state are saying. You know, we're not going to utilize state and local resources to do the federal government's job for them, number one. I think there's a long history of this being smart public safety policy as well.",
      "California is the most populous state in the nation, the most diverse state in the nation, home to more immigrants than any state in the nation. And the last thing you want to do is have immigrants who are victims of crime afraid to come forward to report that crime. The last thing you want is immigrants who may be witnesses to crime to be afraid to come forward and share any information that they have in the investigation and prosecution of crimes.",
      "That's what we're talking about here. Let the federal government do the federal government's job, but have state and local officials do the state and local officials' job. There doesn't have to be a conflict, unless that's what Trump wants.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The governor has called a special session that will convene this week to set aside money to battle the Trump administration.",
      "Will some of that money also be set aside to protect migrants and undocumented immigrants in California as they seek either legal advice or continued legal financial backing to support their efforts to stay within California and the United States?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes, again, if the first Trump administration is any indicator, we know that there will continue to be a lot of fear in communities and communities that deserve to know what their rights are and what their rights are \u2013 are not.",
      "And so, if it's legal assistance, legal advice, legal support, that's just the California way. We embrace our diversity. Our diversity is what has made our communities thrive and our economy thrive. And so we will assist families against the threats of the Trump administration.",
      "If we wanted to sort of cut to the chase, you know, we're hearing a lot of bombast from Trump and his allies about the biggest deportation operation in our country's history, on the one hand, versus a \u2013 maybe a focus on violent criminals on the other.",
      "Nobody \u2013 nobody disagrees with a focus on violent criminals.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Democrats, Republicans agree. But that's very different\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: \u2026 than millions and millions of people being deported indiscriminately, not just tearing families apart, tearing communities apart\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes, Senator.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: \u2026 but tremendous damage to our economy that that would create.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Alex Padilla, Democrat from California, we thank you for your time this morning.",
      "And we'll be back right away with a lot more Face the Nation. I invite you to please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Be sure to tune in to CBS News on January 20 for full coverage of Donald Trump's inauguration here in Washington, D.C. You can watch live on CBS, on Paramount+, or on our CBS News app.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We will be right back with CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, and author H.W. Brands.",
      "Please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We're joined now by CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger. She's in Southampton, New York, this morning.",
      "Jill, Senator Ted Cruz described tariffs and the threat thereof as leverage. But what I'm curious about economically is, do retailers view it as only leverage, do consumers view it only as leverage, or are they beginning to change their behavior in anticipation?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, let's just talk about whether or not they're going to change their behavior. We know that t here were some retailers who were sort of dangling this out around this holiday weekend, saying, oh, buy now because tariffs could make prices go up. I don't know what the motivation of most people is when they shop, but I'm not sure it's tariffs.",
      "What we do know about tariffs is, remember, this is a fee that is imposed on an imported good. The importing company, the U.S. company that takes that good in has to make a decision in that moment. And that company has to decide, are we going to eat it and maybe make less money this year, or are we going to pass it along to consumers. So, that is why consumers are a little unnerved by this, and businesses are as well, because they're not really sure whether they can pass that along and have consumers pay that additional price.",
      "What we know is, over the long term, in history, tariffs tend to increase the price of certain goods. It's not necessarily across the board. But, you know, it is hard coming off of what we've just come through in the last few years with this inflationary spike to imagine that consumers are just going to take it in stride. It is a real hard thing to imagine that any company or consumer is going to feel like they want to absorb higher prices at this point.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, there was a tariff story in the first Trump administration. Do you foresee a deeper and different tariff story potentially in Trump 2.0?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, I think there's two parts of that question, which is, we don't know what these tariffs are. And as Senator Cruz said, this is a negotiation. So, we don't know whether we're going to land in that negotiation. But a big difference between where we are today and where we were back in 2017 and 2018 is, during the early Trump administration, what we had was incredibly low inflation. That was after the financial crisis. For all those years, inflation or prices only grew by about less than 2 percent a year.",
      "Now, compare that with where we are now. We had inflation spike at a 40- year high of 9 percent in the summer of 2022. Yes, that inflation rate has come down, but prices are still about 22 percent, 23 percent higher than they were just four or five years ago. So, the big difference between the first Trump administration and the second Trump administration is prices are already high, and there are many Americans who are struggling.",
      "So, I think that that is the real fear among economists that I speak to. They're worried that this is going to cause a real anxiety among consumers, and that consumers might pull back at a time where they - actually, the economy's doing pretty well.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Talking about the economy doing well. You crunch a lot of numbers, Jill, and always break them down so easily for our audience. When you look at the data, what's the best news you see and what's the most worrisome sign?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, the best news as - is that the labor market has grown really substantially and has kept up. So, I think that the labor market has been the driver of this economy. And it's been pretty consistent.",
      "The other part of the good news story is that the United States economy, more than any other developed nation, has come out of the Covid era and that post-Covid inflationary spike much stronger in a growth mode. So, we are seeing really good things from the labor market. We're seeing things in the economy. We're seeing that AI and technology is really in a boom period. These are all wonderful things.",
      "So, what's the downside here? I hate to be a kill joy, but why not, I play one on Sunday mornings. And what I can see is that these tariffs could cause a problem for a lot of consumers who are already struggling, and also this idea that we are going to see the extension of the tax cuts from the first Trump administration in the individual tax code. There is a fear among some investors that while we may not have a crisis right now when it comes to the debt and the deficit, that the extension of those tax cuts could start to really unnerve financial markets. Not happened yet, but those are the two worrisome things, the tariffs and the debt and deficit. I think those are the two looming things. And, of course, all the things we can't contemplate right now.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The three stock indexes have gone up pretty regularly since Election Day. Is that a methodical and well thought out reaction to an election or a kind of exuberance that may soon run its course?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Time will tell. I think that the initial investor reaction was a second Trump presidency would mean a drop in the tax rates - or the extension of the tax cuts and those tax rates would basically be in place for another four years. So, we'd have low taxes, which is good for especially the wealthier people out there. They love low taxes. And corporate taxes were already enshrined in the code. OK, so we have taxes staying low. That's a big factor when you come - when it comes to investing.",
      "The second part is the idea that a Trump administration would have a light regulatory touch. So, when you saw that first few trading - those first few trading days after the election, what went up a lot? The most highly regulated industries. So, that could be energy, that could be banking, that could be other areas where you could really need an industrial companies where you need a lot of regulatory prominence in the working of your business. Lighter regulatory touch will mean that those businesses will do well.",
      "OK, so is it exuberance or not? Who knows? I can only tell you that as someone who watches markets all the time, when everybody tells me that the sky is clear and the sun is shining and it's rainbows and unicorns, the only thing I can remember is what my father used to say is, well, no one ever rings a bell at the top or at the bottom. So, if you're an individual investor, don't count on everything being great. There's going to be a market slide. There is going to be a sell-off at some point. Don't count on everything being great all the time. Stick to your game plan and only change that game plan, not when the administration changes, but when your own life changes. That's it.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Breaking it down for us, as always, and beautifully so. Jill Schlesinger, thanks so very much.",
      "And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We' are joined now by President Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. He is in New Castle, New Hampshire, this morning.",
      "Jake, good morning. It's good to see you.",
      "The Hamas video release of Edan Alexander, I know the administration regards it as a cruel propagandistic maneuver, but do you detect anything tactical at all in the timing of the release of this video, Jake?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN (President Biden's National Security Adviser): Well, Major, first, thanks for having me.",
      "And as far as this video, it is a cruel reminder of the barbarity and the brutality of Hamas, holding so many innocent people hostage, including Americans, including Edan. We were in touch with Edan's family yesterday. I'll be talking to the families of all of the American hostages, including Edan's family, this week.",
      "And I do think that Hamas is feeling the pressure. They're feeling the pressure because one of their main partners in crime here, Hezbollah, has now cut a ceasefire deal and they thought that Hezbollah would be with them until the end. They're feeling the pressure, of course, because their top leader, Sinwar, has been killed. So, they may be looking anew at the possibility of getting a ceasefire and hostage deal, and we are working actively with all of the key players in the region, including Israel and Turkey and Qatar and Egypt to try to bring that about.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The fate of the hostages, of course, on the administration's mind, on the minds of all Americans and all in the region. But also, Jake, I'm sure you saw over the last couple of days the video from Gaza of Palestinians surging to try to get a loaf of bread, in some cases crushing one another unintentionally. All suggestions are that the humanitarian situation there is - if it already isn't past crisis stage, near famine crisis stage.",
      "How much does that intensify the need to get this thing across, as you just said, the finish line?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: The humanitarian situation in Gaza is a crisis. You have too many people who are suffering from shortages of food, water, medicine, access to sanitation. Innocent people who deserve a measure of peace and deserve access to all of those life-saving supplies in abundance. The United States has been working, week in, week out, month in, month out, to open crossings, to move trucks, to insure that humanitarian aid gets in. And at critical moments, we have been able to intervene in ways that have staved off the worst case scenarios of famine. But it's constantly stocking (ph) Gaza. And so more needs to be done to get aid in.",
      "Now, part of the problem, as we've seen just in the last 24 hours, is not actually moving aid from outside Gaza into Gaza, but moving it around Gaza once it's inside. The U.N., in fact, said it was suspending movement from certain areas of Gaza because of concerns about looting. These are all things that would be helped if there were a ceasefire in place.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, is the probability of a ceasefire enhanced or undercut when someone such as South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham says, President- elect Trump wants a ceasefire before inauguration deal. Does that help you or hurt you?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, I think the key actor right now holding the decision on the ceasefire is Hamas. And the key thing motivating Hamas is not American politics or the American presidential transition, it's their determination about whether or not it makes sense for them at this point, after Hezbollah has abandoned them, after their leader has been killed, after their military formations have been degraded to finally say yes to a ceasefire and hostage deal. That's going to be the telling thing more than anything that's said back here.",
      "But I will say this, there has been very good coordination between our team and the incoming team on all of the aspects of the crisis in the Middle East. We felt it was important that we be in touch with them, to keep them up to speed on what's happening, because this handoff has got to be smooth. And they, in turn, have reciprocated by being open and transparent and working with us. This is how it should be in a transition. This is what we're going to keep driving for, for every day that we have left in office.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, I want to have a conversation with you about leverage as regards to the Israeli government. I want to play for you something that Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen said on this program a week ago.",
      "Let's listen.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands of Prime Minister Netanyahu, only to be ignored or slapped down entirely. And then President Biden sends more bombs and more money. That is not an effective use of leverage.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Your response?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: First of all, I respect Senator Van Hollen. He knows these issues as well as any person in Washington, and he is passionate about them.",
      "But, of course, we have a different perspective. We have, at various points over the course of this conflict, made asks of the Israelis consistent with our values and our interests. Have we gotten everything we've asked for? No. Have we seen a change in Israeli behavior with respect to the movement of humanitarian assistance, with respect to how they conducted certain military operations, including in places like Rafah? Yes, we have.",
      "And so, we do believe that we've had a constructive engagement with the Israeli government and also been able to make a difference on the ground with respect to the flow of humanitarian aid.",
      "In addition, we worked closely with the Israeli government to bring about a ceasefire in Lebanon. A ceasefire people said wasn't possible until a new administration took office.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, I want to take - turn your attention to Ukraine, where the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to indicate in a recent interview that he could possibly be open to a peace settlement in which Russia retains the territory it has. Ukraine, meaning Kyiv, keeps all the rest, if that is swiftly brought under the umbrella of NATO. Is that the outline or the contours of something you believe the administration believes could be workable?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, Major, I'm sorry to disappoint you. I can't negotiate in public on your program, and I certainly can't negotiate on behalf of President Zelenskyy, who really should speak for himself when it comes to the destiny of his country. The future of Ukraine should be determined at the negotiating table by decisions of the Ukrainians, not imposed from the outside by the United States or anybody else.",
      "I will say, though, that we have been engaging with the Ukrainians over the course of this year on how you marry the support we provided them for use on the battlefield with a diplomatic strategy for the negotiating table.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And some recent decisions in the administration have been criticized by Republicans as setting the situation on fire, meaning ATACMS and anti-personnel mines. Those advocates for Ukraine say those decisions are way too late to change the battle space in any strategically important way. Where do you come down?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Anti-personnel land mines, which are nonpersistent mines that shut off after two weeks so they don't represent a long term threat to civilians, these could be helpful against the particular type of tactics that the Russian infantry is using right now in eastern Ukraine. So, he's sending them.",
      "The ATACMS permission into Russian territory, that was a decision he took after Russia escalated by introducing North Korean troops into this war, a foreign army into this war. So that was a responsible, coordinated step that we took with other allies to respond to that provocation, to that escalation by Russia.",
      "The president has been clear all along, we are going to give Ukraine the tools it needs. We are also going to do what we can to put them in the best possible position on the battlefield so they'll be in the best possible position at the negotiating table, and then this war will ultimately end in diplomacy.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, thanks so much for your time.",
      "And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION.",
      "Please, stay with us.",

      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back.",
      "We turn now to author and historian H.W. Brands. He is the Jack S. Blanton senior chair at the University of Texas in Austin. And his latest book is \"America First: Roosevelt vs. Lindbergh in the Shadow of War.\"",
      "He joins us this morning from Austin, Texas.",
      "H.W., it's great to see you.",
      "First of all, what does this America first clash then tell us if anything about today and references to America first?",
      "H.W. BRANDS (Author, \"America Frist: Roosevelt vs. Lindbergh in the Shadow of War\"): The debate that I describe in the book is whether the United States should enter World War II. Between the time Germany started the war in September of 1939 and the United States entered the war in December of 1941, that was the narrow focus of the debate. The larger question and the one that persists today is, what do Americans think their country's role in the world ought to be? Should the United States, must the United States take a leading role in the world? Should the United States concern itself in conflicts among other nations that perhaps don't directly address American interests? This - this was the question then. It's a question we're dealing with again today.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: If you could, sketch out briefly Charles Lindbergh's stature at the time this debate with Franklin Delano Roosevelt was engaged.",
      "H.W. BRANDS: Lindbergh came to the attention of the American public, indeed to the world public, in 1927 when he flew a solo flight for the first time across the Atlantic Ocean. He became this national hero. He became a world celebrity for accomplishing this great technical feat, but it was also a feat of personal daring.",
      "He was a darling of the United States, a darling in other countries. He was decorated by foreign governments. He became an early celebrity in an age when celebrity was first starting to take form. So, that was his position as of 1927.",
      "His celebrity took a different turn in the early 1930s when his and his wife's infant son was kidnapped and murdered in what then was called the crime of the century, which gave rise to the trial of the century. And so, this golden boy, all of a sudden had a dark shadow cast across his life. And so he was, in some ways, this star-crossed hero at that point.",
      "He continued to be influential in aeronautical engineering circles. He knew a lot about aircraft. But in the American mind he was this - he was this great celebrity. And many people were surprised actually that he did take a leading role in the debate over American policy because he was not a political figure, he eschewed politics.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And in that debate with Roosevelt, did Roosevelt and his administration regard Charles Lindbergh as a potential political threat? And if so, how did they deal with it?",
      "H.W. BRANDS: It's a little bit hard to say. Franklin Roosevelt at some point decided that he wanted to run for a third term. This broke a long- standing, informal rule of American politics. And he knew that Republicans were constantly going up to Charles Lindbergh and saying, you could be president. You'd be a great candidate.",
      "Lindbergh's father had been a congressman, but Lindbergh took from his father's experience, which turned out badly because of his opposition to American policy during World War I, that he didn't want to have anything to do with politics or politicians. He considered politicians a bunch of liars, people who could not be trusted and he considered politics this low and sort of mean occupation that he wanted to have nothing to do with.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: When this debate began in 1931, Lindbergh was in one place. When it ended in 1941, he was in a different place in the public mind. Some accused him of being a Nazi sympathizer. Some editorialist described him as an anti-Semite. Where do you come down?",
      "H.W. BRANDS: The one thing I should say is that everybody who calls him an anti-Semite or a Nazi sympathizer, had political reasons for doing so because Lindbergh became the face of opposition to American intervention in the war. And it served his opponents' purposes to paint him in this negative category.",
      "In terms of his Nazi sympathy, he - there were American Nazis. There was an American Nazi party. They were clearly Nazi sympathizers. Lindbergh was not a member of the party. In fact, the America first committee, of which Lindbergh was a part, took pains to keep its distance from those. Lindbergh did not want Germany to win the war. His position was that the United States should not place its frontier of security in the middle of Europe the way Franklin Roosevelt and the interventionists appears to be doing.",
      "But because he took that position - and it was a position the Germans supported. The Germans didn't want the United States to enter the war. There was this objective sense in which one could say that when Lindbergh gave a speech, it served the purposes of the German government.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How about his appraisal of American Jews wanted to push America into the war and then exercising outsized influence culturally in our country?",
      "H.W. BRANDS: So, the charges of anti-Semitism against Lindbergh really are associated with a single speech he gave in the autumn of 1941, in which he identified three groups that in his opinion were most influential in pushing the United States toward war. One was the British government. Britain was already at war, and he explained it was natural that they would try to get the United States involved in the war. The second group he said was American Jews. And he said, it's perfectly understandable that they should want the United States to get into the war given what Hitler and the Nazis have done to their relatives, friends, co-religionists in Europe. And the third group was the Roosevelt administration. He was most critical of the Roosevelt administration because Lindbergh claimed that Roosevelt was using the excuse of the war to further his own political ambitions.",
      "Now, merely for mentioning American Jews in the context of war policy, the sky fell down upon Lindbergh. Everybody who wanted to make sure that they weren't accused of anti-Semitism, everybody who opposed Lindbergh's policy came down and pointed the finger of anti-Semitism at Lindbergh.",
      "To what extent was Lindbergh actually an anti-Semite? Well, I would - I would - I would - I would put him in the category of the sort of not in my country club kind of anti-Semite, which was extremely common in the United States at the time.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Very quickly, H.W., there's a clash over information and disinformation. Both sides warn each other and the American public about that. Unspool that for us, if you could, real quick.",
      "H.W. BRANDS: The British government and the germane government, the two antagonists in the war at that point, were both engaged in propaganda campaigns in the United States. And so, when the British government would plant editorials, features in American newspapers, often unknown to the reading public, then Lindbergh and his side would say, well, look what the British government is doing. When the German government would do something similar, then the Roosevelt administration would say, look at what the German government is doing. So, each side then, the governments of the two sides, they were doing their best to sway American public opinion because they realized that in the end it was American public opinion that had to be persuaded.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: H.W. - foreign interference in American public opinion then and now.",
      "H.W. Brands, it's been a pleasure. Thank you so much.",
      "And we'll be right back.",

    "summary": "The National Weather Service said Sunday that \"travel could be difficult to impossible\" in places where ongoing snowfall is forecast through the beginning of the week.",
    "story": [
      "One of the first major snowstorms this season blanketed parts of New York, Pennsylvania and Michigan over the weekend, in the midst of hectic post-Thanksgiving travel and discount shopping sprees. Forecasters expected very cold temperatures and heavy snow to persist through the beginning of the week and potentially pose dangers to travelers in the Great Lakes, Plains and Midwest regions.",
      "The snow storm led to an emergency declaration in parts of New York and a disaster declaration in Pennsylvania, with officials warning of dangerous conditions for Thanksgiving travelers returning home.",
      "A blast of Arctic air brought bitter temperatures of 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit below average to the Northern Plains, the weather service said, prompting cold advisories for parts of North Dakota. Frigid air was expected to move over the eastern third of the U.S. by Monday, with temperatures about 10 degrees below average.",
      "Nearly 2 feet of snow fell in parts of New York, Ohio and Michigan and 29 inches was recorded in Pennsylvania's northwestern tip. By 7 a.m. ET Saturday, the weather service in Buffalo reported between a foot and 18 inches of snow had already fallen in towns and villages around Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, with 24 inches recorded in one place near the Pennsylvania border. More snow had accumulated throughout the region by the early afternoon, forecasters said.",
      "There was more snowfall to come Sunday, according to the weather service, which warned areas east of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario could potentially receive one or two feet of snow. In Jefferson County, forecasts showed a rate of 3-4 inches of snowfall per hour would continue throughout the day.",
      "Snow was also forecast to return Sunday to Cleveland, and weather service meteorologists in the Ohio city said they expected 6 to 18 inches of new snow to accumulate in an area stretching from there to the Pennsylvania-New York state line by through Tuesday.",
      "The National Weather Service said Sunday that \"travel could be difficult to impossible\" in places where ongoing snowfall is forecast through the beginning of the week.",
      "\"Snow will increase in intensity today and slowly spread south across much of the primary snow belt,\" said the weather service in Cleveland Sunday morning. Forecasters noted that snowfall would happen periodically through Tuesday morning, although heavy accumulation was expected Sunday as they predicted snowfall rates of more than an inch per hour in both Ohio and Pennsylvania.",
      "In an alert on Saturday afternoon, the weather service had said the heaviest snow totals were expected \"downwind of lakes Erie and Ontario, affecting areas from northeast Ohio, far northwest Pennsylvania, western New York State and portions of northwest New York state.\"",
      "In a phone interview Saturday with WWNY-TV, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul told the Associated Press that the state prepared for the storm for days by deploying snowplows and thousands of workers and consulting with utility providers. She also dispatched personnel from other parts of the state to assist.",
      "\"I know it's something they're all accustomed to and they can handle, but I want to let them know we are there with reinforcements and to make sure everyone can travel safely, especially over this really busy holiday weekend,\" she said.",
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro signed a disaster emergency proclamation and said parts of Erie County in the northwest received nearly 2 feet of snow with more expected through Monday night.",
      "Pennsylvania State Police responded to nearly 200 incidents during the 24-hour period from 6 a.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday, officials said. Authorities closed part of I-90 in Pennsylvania and westbound lanes of the New York Thruway heading toward Pennsylvania.",
      "The city of Erie, Pennsylvania, said travel was limited to emergency responders and essential employees and cases of medical emergency until further notice due. The snow and slippery conditions resulted in stuck vehicles blocking intersections and streets. Residents were urged to shelter in place and allow crews to clear neighborhoods.",
      "With parts of some roads impassable in northwestern Pennsylvania, scores of travelers took refuge in the lobby and hallways of a Holiday Inn near I-90. Hotel staffer Jeremiah Weatherley said workers opened the conference room and gave them blankets.",
      "\"They just showed up, and we don't want to turn people away,\" he said.",
      "In Buffalo, officials with the NFL's Bills sought stadium snow shovelers for the season, including ahead of Sunday night's game against the San Francisco 49ers. The team said it would pay $20 per hour and provide food and hot drinks.",
      "Parts of Michigan were battered by lake-effect snow, which happens when warm, moist air rising from a body of water mixes with cold dry air overhead. Bands of snow rolling off Lake Superior buried parts of the Upper Peninsula under 2 feet (61 centimeters) or more, said Lily Chapman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Marquette, Michigan.",
      "There were 27 inches of snow just northeast of Ironwood, in the Upper Peninsula's western reaches, and another 2 feet in Munising, in the eastern area, she said.",
      "Lake-effect snow could add more than a foot over the eastern Upper Peninsula through Monday morning, with 6 to 10 inches or higher to the west, Chapman said.",
      "Gaylord, Michigan, received 24.8 inches of snow Friday, setting a new single-day record for the city in a region dotted by ski resorts, said Keith Berger of the weather service's Gaylord office. The previous record of 17 inches was set March 9, 1942.",
      "The snowfall was good news for Treetops Resort, which features 80 acres of ski hill terrain among its 2,000 acres. It boosted the base that snowmaking machines will increase before the resort's season opening next weekend, Recreation Director Doug Hoeh said.",
      "\"Obviously when you get that much snowfall, it's great for the snow hills, but it's bad for the parking lots, so we're kind of digging out,\" Hoeh said.",

    "story": [
      "President Biden will travel to Angola this week, becoming the first sitting president to do so and following through on a yearslong pledge to visit sub-Saharan Africa while in office, as his presidency nears the end.",
      "Mr. Biden's trip marks the first president to visit the region since 2015, and comes as he has long planned to make the trip to discuss economic partnerships and the vision for Africa's first transcontinental open-access rail network, among other issues.",
      "The president, who departs for the trip on Sunday night, had pledged to visit the African continent in 2023 before earlier this year saying he would visit after he was reelected. But the visit was thrown into question when he dropped out of the presidential race, before a trip in October was announced. Mr. Biden then\u00a0postponed that trip\u00a0to oversee the domestic response to Hurricanes Milton and Helene.",
      "This week, the president is set to meet with Angola President Joao Lourenco and deliver remarks. Mr. Biden is expected to discuss infrastructure and economic opportunities with leaders, while highlighting the investments in Angola and Africa more broadly, according to senior administration officials previewing the trip.",
      "The president is expected to announce among a number of things that the U.S. government will have closed 12 deals in Angola by the time he departs the White House, with a combined value of $6.9 billion. He'll also outline a new global health security partnership aimed at responding to infectious diseases, while touting U.S. investments aimed at increasing food access and storage. And the president is expected to support the nomination of Angola's Kwanza Corridor as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the officials said.",
      "During the three-day visit, the president will also tout an infrastructure and rail project with heavy U.S. investment known as the Lobito Corridor, which aims to increase the speed of transport of critical minerals used for electric vehicles and AI data centers, along with drastically speeding up shipment times for food deliveries and helping to alleviate food insecurity in Africa.",
      "The visit comes as China and Russia have made inroads in the region with infrastructure investments, adding to U.S.' urgency surrounding making investments on the continent.",
      "Mr. Biden's trip also comes as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, spurring questions about the longevity of Mr. Biden's achievements. But the Biden administration officials noted that U.S.-Africa policy has enjoyed bipartisan support in recent administrations, and said they expect the next administration to continue building on the policy.",
      "The president also pledged when he took office to mend relationships around the world, after Trump's first term. The White House has touted a deepening relationship with African leaders, including Lourenco, who met with Mr. Biden in the Oval Office last year. In 2022, Mr. Biden hosted the Africa Leaders Summit, and since then, the administration officials said more than 20 Cabinet and other senior leaders have also traveled to the continent.",

    "story": [
      "Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California said on Sunday that President-elect Donald Trump \"has made it no secret that he has it in for California\" as Gov. Gavin Newsom has convened a special legislative session this week to prepare for legal fights in Trump's upcoming term.",
      "Padilla said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that there's \"a lot of reason for concern\" for the second Trump administration \"if the first administration is any indicator.\"",
      "The California Democrat cited reports that Trump initially withheld disaster funds for the state during his first term, saying the president-elect tried to keep federal dollars from California families \"simply because it's a state that did not vote for him in the presidential election.\" In September, Trump threatened to block federal wildfire aid for California if elected again.",
      "\"We're trying to inoculate ourselves from those types of threats,\" Padilla continued.",
      "California Democrats billed the state as the \"resistance\" state during the first Trump administration. And after Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election, Newsom announced that he would convene an emergency session of the California state legislature to \"safeguard California values and fundamental rights in the face of an incoming Trump administration.\" In addition to bolstering legal resources, the governor pointed to protections for civil and reproductive rights, climate action, and immigrant families.",
      "On immigration, Padilla said \"we're hearing a lot of bombast from Trump and his allies about the biggest deportation operation in our country's history.\" He said while \"nobody disagrees\" with a focus on violent criminals, that's \"very different than millions and millions of people being deported indiscriminately.\" Padilla said that providing legal support for communities that could be impacted by Trump's plans is \"just the California way.\"",
      "\"We embrace our diversity,\" Padilla said. \"Our diversity is what has made our communities thrive and our economy thrive. And so we will assist families against the threats of the Trump administration.\"",
      "Meanwhile, as a \"sanctuary state,\" California state law instructs local law enforcement not to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on deportations, teeing up what could be a clash with the Trump administration. Padilla, citing California's status as the most populous state in the nation with more immigrants than any other state, argued that the issue concerns the ability for people to be able to come forward to report a crime, saying \"the last thing you want is immigrants who may be witnesses to crime to be afraid to come forward and share any information that they have in the investigation and prosecution of crimes.\"",
      "\"Let the federal government do the federal government's job, but have state and local officials do the state and local officials' job,\" Padilla continued. \"There doesn't have to be a conflict unless that's what Trump wants.\"",
      "More broadly, Padilla said \"there's also a lot of good that can be finalized\" before President Biden leaves office, pointing to climate-related work and additional flexibility for public health care programs to target mental health issues. And the California Democrat noted that there's \"a lot of good work to be done\" beyond the current administration if the federal government will continue to support California.",

    "summary": "To do so, current FBI Director Chris Wray would have to voluntarily vacate the position or be fired by President-elect Trump.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Saturday that he plans to name Kash Patel as FBI director, who would replace the current FBI chief Chris Wray.",
      "In a post to his Truth Social platform, Trump called Patel \"a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People.\"",
      "For Patel to take the post, Wray would have to voluntarily vacate the position or be fired by Trump if he is to be replaced before his term ends in 2027. One source previously told CBS News the Trump team was aware of the complexities involved in ousting Wray.",
      "Patel will also have to be confirmed by the Senate. In his social media post, Trump did not call on Wray to resign. Trump nominated Wray in 2017 for the 10-year term after firing James Comey.",
      "An FBI spokesperson told CBS News in a statement Saturday evening that, \"Every day, the men and women of the FBI continue to work to protect Americans from a growing array of threats. Director Wray's focus remains on the men and women of the FBI, the people we do the work with, and the people we do the work for.\"",
      "The 44-year-old Patel\u00a0served\u00a0in intelligence and defense roles in Trump's first term, including chief of staff to the secretary of defense. He was also designated by Trump to be a representative to the National Archives and Records Administration and fought a subpoena to testify before a federal grand jury in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case.",
      "He is an attorney and staunch Trump loyalist who rose to prominence as an aide to former Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California, fighting the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
      "He served on Trump's National Security Council, then as a senior adviser to acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell, and later as chief of staff to acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller.",
      "Patel published a 2023 book titled \"Government Gangsters,\" which received praise from Trump and in which Patel writes that the \"FBI has become so thoroughly compromised that it will remain a threat to the people unless drastic measures are taken.\"",
      "\"This is the roadmap to end the Deep State's reign,\" Trump said on Truth Social about the book in September 2023.",
      "Patel, who was born in Long Island, New York, did his undergraduate work at Richmond University and earned his law degree from Pace University, as well as a certificate of international law from University of College London. He served as a county and federal public defender in Florida from 2005 to 2013 before joining the Justice Department as a trial attorney.",
      "Speaking on Steve Bannon's podcast in December 2023, Patel said that he and other Trump loyalists \"will go out and find the conspirators, not just in government but in the media.\"",
      "\"We're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,\" Patel said to Bannon, the former White House chief strategist in Trump's first term, repeating false claims often stated, without evidence, by many Republican leaders of voter fraud in the 2020 election. \"We're going to come after you, whether it's criminally or civilly.

      "Wray and the FBI's leadership became targets of Trump's enduring ire in 2022, when FBI agents executed a court-authorized search warrant at Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The search exposed what had been an ongoing federal probe into Trump's handling of classified records after he left office.",
      "Special counsel Jack Smith, appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, ultimately charged Trump with dozens of counts, including the illegal retention of national defense information and obstruction, as a result of the investigation. All the charges were dismissed by a federal judge earlier this year. Trump pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.",
      "Earlier this week, a federal appeals court granted Smith's bid to end the case, with Smith citing a longstanding Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate, Patel would be the third FBI director to work under a Trump administration and would take over the nation's chief federal law enforcement apparatus amid years of intense criticism from Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill. While Wray's departure from the job was largely expected, Trump's announcement about replacing Wray before his 10-year term was to end is sure to reverberate throughout the bureau's rank-and-file. Presidents, however, have the power to force them out of the role and many previous directors have not served their full terms.",
      "Patel would report directly to the attorney general of the United States \u2014\u00a0 Trump's current pick for the post is former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. The president-elect announced her nomination after former Congressman Matt Gaetz withdrew his nomination because his confirmation prospects looked dim as a bipartisan group of senators raised concerns about his past conduct and a Congressional ethics report. Gaetz \u2014 a staunch critic of the Justice Department and FBI \u2014 has denied wrongdoing.",

      "Wray \u2014 a former federal prosecutor and counterterrorism official \u2014 was nominated by then-President Trump in 2017. President Biden retained him as FBI director throughout his administration.",
      "While deep distrust of the FBI has been the focal point of Trump and his supporters, Wray spent much of his tenure on countering China's espionage campaigns. He sounded the alarm on foreign efforts to target American infrastructure and warned of aggressive posturing by Iran and Russia. The FBI employs about 35,000 people \u2014 including thousands of field agents \u2014 tasked with enforcing federal law and investigating crimes across the country, including terrorism, espionage, and child exploitation.",
      "The last FBI director to serve a full 10-year appointment was Robert Mueller, who was later named special counsel during the first Trump administration to investigate Russia's efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election and allegations of collusion with the Trump campaign. Mueller, and by extension the entire Justice Department and FBI, quickly became a target for Trump and Republicans in Congress.",
      "Trump's decision to fire then-FBI Director James Comey in 2017 because of the investigation into the 2016 election contributed to Mueller's appointment as special counsel. Comey, who has since become an outspoken critic of the president-elect, found himself at odds with Democrats and Republicans upon his departure from the FBI's top job.

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 09:52:06 -0500",
    "summary": "In his new book, author Wright Thompson examines the site of the notorious 1955 murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till, and a Mississippi Delta culture that, he says, has spent decades trying to erase a horrible crime.",
    "story": [
      "If you know where to look in the Mississippi Delta, you can find markers of what a culture has spent decades trying to erase.",
      "This plaque at the Tallahatchie River \u2013 replaced every now and then every time it's been riddled with bullets \u2013 marks the spot where young Emmett Till's brutally-beaten body was pulled from the water, a cotton gin fan wrapped around his neck, secured with barbed wire.",
      "The country store where Till whistled at a white woman \u2013 this 14-year-old boy's \"capital offense\" \u2013 is being reclaimed by nature, soon to disappear entirely. The vines growing over it, says author Wright Thompson, are \"the perfect reflection of the erasure, and of the attempt to pretend like none of this happened.\"",
      "But at the very spot where this lynching unfolded nearly 70 years ago \u2013 nothing. Every day, people drive by a barn just outside Drew, Mississippi, with no idea what they are passing \u2013 a place where the worst thing imaginable happened inside. And that, said Thompson, is the point.",
      "In his new book, \"The Barn: The Secret History of a Murder in Mississippi\" (published by Random House), Thompson, who is also a fifth-generation Mississippi Delta cotton farmer, examines what he calls evil hiding in plain sight. \"Like almost every person in Mississippi or even in America, I didn't know about the barn,\" he said. \"If I didn't know something that essential about the place that I think I know best in the world, then something was deeply, fundamentally wrong.\"",
      "Mississippi in the summer of 1955, when Emmett Till visited relatives, was a different world for this kid from Chicago. Unfamiliar with the ways of the Delta, he had no idea the price to pay for aiming his whistle at the woman working at the store. \"He whistled at sundown on a Wednesday, and he got taken at 2:30 a.m. on Sunday,\" said Thompson.",
      "An 18-year-old sharecropper named Willie Reed was out walking by the barn when a truck turned in. He hid while the woman's husband and brother-in-law, who'd snatched Till from his bed, dragged the boy into the barn. \"And he heard screams, turned to whimpers, turned to silence,\" Thompson said. Reed went home, \"and everybody in his life said, 'Don't say anything. Don't you say anything.'\"",
      "Instead, Reed summoned all of his courage and walked into a courtroom to accuse two white men, J.W. Milam and Roy Bryant, of murder.",
      "Asked why he'd ignored warnings about keeping quiet, Reed's widow, Juliet, said, \"I guess it was just something about Willie, that he wanted to do right.\"",
      "While the open casket Till's mother, Mamie, insisted upon sparked outrage that fueled the civil rights movement, without Willie Reed's bravery, no one would've ever been charged. \"It was an all-white jury,\" said Juliet, \"and the jury was laughing while [Willie] was testifying.\"",
      "Bryant and Milam were acquitted. Reed would have to flee to Chicago, and change his name. Juliet said he remained haunted by the screams he'd heard until the day he died.",
      "Thompson said, \"Everybody who did the right thing in this case had their lives deeply affected, if not ruined. And the people who did the worst of it walked away free.\"",
      "That injustice is what Thompson says needs illumination in the Delta, where the instinct has always been to keep it shrouded.",
      "In 1965, Gloria Dickerson integrated the schools in Drew, just a few miles from where Till was murdered. Schools made no mention of Till's death when she was growing up, and today, Till's murder only merits 117 words \u2013 one paragraph \u2013 in the Mississippi history textbook used today. \"In Mississippi, they're not gonna learn about what happened to Emmett Till,\" Dickerson said. \"It's like the past was being erased.\"",
      "She combats that erasure through a program, We2Togther, that teaches kids in Drew the history her parents made sure she learned as a child. \"When we would pass that barn, my mom would say, 'That is where Emmett Till was killed,'\" Dickerson said.",
      "She says all children need to be taught that history: \"Every kid; the Blacks need it, and the whites need it, too.\"",
      "While Tallahatchie County apologized to the Till family in 2007, and a statue was unveiled in 2022, the legacy of silence remains powerful there.",
      "Rev. Willie Williams, who helps run the\u00a0Emmett Till Interpretive Center\u00a0(a non-profit dedicated to Till's memory), said he didn't know anything about the barn; his first visit there was two years ago, when he was in his 60s. \"I'm in high school, when I found out this [was] the store where Emmett whistled at a white lady. And I grew up in the Delta.\"",
      "He believes not talking about what happened at Bryant's Grocery & Meat Market, and the barn, was an attempt to erase history.",
      "Today, at the barn where Emmitt Till was lynched, you'll find the most mundane items of everyday life: An outboard motor. Driftwood from the river. Christmas decorations. A cross.",
      "The barn \u2013 owned by a man who let \"Sunday Morning\" visit, but didn't want to talk, and who is negotiating to sell it to Rev. Williams' non-profit \u2013 is where the paradox hits hardest: the ordinary building so many see, concealing extraordinary evil no one knows. And that, says \"Barn\" author Thompson, is why he's dug so deep, so that if the erasure continues, no one can say \"We didn't know.\"",
      "\"It's the not knowing that we're combating,\" he said. \"Silence and erasure are just different words for the same thing.\"",

      "Nikki Battiste: Where do you think the fire started?",
      "Michael Poel: Uh, I believe the fires over here. Actually it's in these cabinets \u2014 where these cabinets used to be above the stove area.",
      "But when Poel examined the stove, thinking that perhaps cooking flames caused the cabinets to catch fire, he saw that neither the oven nor the burners had been turned on.",
      "Michael Poel: All the controls are in the off position and there is no fire damage in the interior of this oven to show that this was some type of cooking fire.",
      "Poel also did not find any electrical issues.",

      "Much of the house, besides the kitchen, remained accessible, so Poel thought Melissa could have found a way out.",
      "Michael Poel: It was what I would call a survivable fire. \u2026 This young lady was a paramedic. She is used to dealing with emergencies. \u2026 For her to totally lose her perspective and stand there and try and fight that fire. \u2026 When you start putting all these things together, you start coming up with, OK, this makes no sense.",
      "While Poel was inspecting the house, investigators talked with the Lamesch family. Ketter learned about the phone call that day between Melissa and Baal, that Melissa ended when Plote arrived at the house.",

      "Melissa's brother Karl Lamesch told investigators he had already spoken on the phone to Plote, telling him he knew he had been at the house that day. Karl Lamesch also told Plote about the fire, and that someone had died, but not that it was Melissa. Investigators did that when they asked Plote to come in for an interview that evening.",

      "Nikki Battiste: As you watched his interview, what did you think about his demeanor, his responses?",

      "To get those answers, two autopsies would be performed: one, two days after Melissa's death, and then another, about two weeks later while lab work was completed. The results: normal carbon monoxide levels, and no soot was found in her system. What was found was evidence of strangulation, including hemorrhages around her neck. Melissa, it was determined, had been murdered.",

And the first time I touched his hand. \u2026 I just remember gasping, just (gasps) \u2026 and I decided I was going to keep holding his hand, something Melissa didn't get to do.",
      "Melissa's family was convinced that Matthew Plote was responsible for their profound grief \u2014 that he killed Melissa, simply because he did not want to become a father. Plote, investigators would learn, had been juggling multiple women in his life.",

      "Lt. Brian Ketter: We kept \u2026 accusing him of things \u2026 and he never said I didn't do it. \u2026 He never said you guys got the wrong person. \u2026 He was just emotionless and he wouldn't communicate. \u2026 Not once in seven hours, not once did he get upset. \u2026 Most people would've told us \u2026 I'm done, but he just sat and listened to us.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Had you ever experienced an interview \u2026 like that before?",
      "Brian Ketter: Never.",
      "It wasn't just the lack of communication that made Ketter think Plote was guilty, but on the rare times Plote did talk, the unusual way he phrased things.",
      "LT. BRIAN KETTER Did you intend to kill her?",
      "MATTHEW PLOTE: I had no intention of hurting Melissa.",
      "Lt. Brian Ketter: During that seven-hour interview, at one point, Matthew did say \" I had no intentions of hurting Melissa.\"",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did that make you do a double take?",
      "Lt. Brian Ketter: Yes. 'Cause in our opinion, that means I hurt Melissa, but I didn't intend to do it.",
      "But it was not an admission of guilt, so Ketter wanted to see if Plote would say anything more and made an unusual request of Fire Chief Schultz.",
      "Lt. Brian Ketter: We asked Chief Schultz if he would wear a \u2026 listening device. So that he would have a conversation with Matthew, we would be able to hear it and record it and try to gain some evidence that way.",
      "Chief Rob Schultz: When Brian asks this of me, I'm pretty taken aback \u2026 And initially I said, \"no way,\" and I did some thinking about it and called him back and said \"yes.\"",
      "Nikki Battiste: You have a lot of responsibilities as a fire chief, but I can't imagine you ever thought wearing a wiretap would be one of them.",
      "Chief Rob Schultz: No. \u2026 and I don't freely talk about it \u2026 It's not something that I'm proud of. It was something that needed to be done in the hopes of helping the investigation. \u2026 There's a grieving family out there that's looking for answers.",
      "So, on Sept. 9, 2021, Chief Schultz called Matthew Plote and asked him to come in to talk.",
      "Chief Rob Schultz: And he agreed. He says,\" I'd like to come talk to you.\"",
      "Plote came in later that day. The fire station was quickly cleared of all other personnel, and Ketter and other investigators headed over. They were able to place a device that just recorded audio on a phone on Fire Chief's Schultz' desk and listened in from outside the fire station and from an adjoining office.",
      "Nikki Battiste: How were you feeling?",
      "Chief Rob Schultz: Nervous. Very nervous. A bit scared.",
      "Schultz tried to learn what happened to Melissa, by appealing to Plote on a personal level.",
      "ROB SCHULTZ (to Plote): I'm trying to find answers and I'm trying to help you. \u2026 Help me \u2014 help me \u2014 walk through \u2014 I mean, what \u2014 what happened?",
      "But the nearly two-hour conversation yielded very little info from Plote, with him again barely speaking about the day Melissa died.",
      "Chief Rob Schultz: I remember saying \u2026 \"fill in all the blanks for me.\" \u2026 And \"isn't it odd that no one here knows that you're going to be a father.\" Like that's \u2014 that's something we celebrate here.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did he say?",
      "Chief Rob Schultz: Nothing. \u2026 Uh, head was down, uh, a lot of the conversation.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did he ever say I didn't kill Melissa and my baby?",
      "Chief Rob Schultz: He did not.",
      "With none of the interviews resulting in a confession, there was still no arrest \u2014 something that exasperated the Lamesch family.",
      "Gus Lamesch: It was excruciating. And, I mean, we were pestering the police constantly.",
      "There were several reasons for the delay. There was the wait for the fire marshal's report \u2014 which concluded that \"the fire cause is most likely incendiary in nature, possibly the result of a fire being intentionally set in an effort to conceal a potential homicide.\" And getting information from Amazon on whether Plote's voice was recorded on that Echo Dot they retrieved from the kitchen took time.",
      "Lt. Brian Ketter: It did reveal voices, but nothing that proved helpful for our case. \u2026 It wasn't even on the day of the murder.",
      "Investigators had also waited to obtain Plote's DNA until after the August 2021 interview, hoping he would first confess to killing Melissa.",
      "Lt. Brian Ketter: We got the results back saying \u2026 that it was his DNA \u2026 under her fingernails.",
      "On March 9, 2022, after a year-and-a-half of investigating Melissa Lamesch's death, Matthew Plote was arrested on charges including murder, the intentional homicide of an unborn child and arson.",
      "John Kopp: The motive that the State painted, was \u2026 just an inaccurate portrayal of Matt. By the time of Matthew Plote's arrest, he had hired attorney John Kopp.",
      "John Kopp: They painted him to be this monster that \u2026 at the drop of a hat, after a career of saving people, decided to suddenly start killing people.",
      "John Kopp: The evidence doesn't show that Matthew Plote murdered Melissa Lamesch or their unborn child.",
      "MATTHEW PLOTE ON TRIAL",
      "Allison Huntley: Melissa Lamesch was loved. \u2026 This is not someone who had enemies lined up around the block who wanted to see her deceased. Rather, there was one person and one person only \u2026 and that was Matthew Plote.",
      "Assistant State's Attorneys Allison Huntley and Heather Kruse were part of the team prosecuting Matthew Plote.",
      "Heather Kruse: All signs pointed toward Matthew Plote from the very beginning.",
      "John Kopp: What we wanted to portray to the jury is that he was a \u2014 a guy \u2026 \u00a0saving lives for his entire career.",
      "Defense attorneys John Kopp and Liam Dixon say their client was misunderstood \u2014 and as a firefighter, was a responsible person, not a murderer.",
      "John Kopp: Matt's plan was to financially support her. He had offered her money before. \u2026 His plan was to be there.",
      "Plote pleaded not guilty to all charges. On March 18, 2024, more than three years since Melissa's murder, his trial began in Ogle County, Illinois. The prosecution argued that Plote murdered Melissa and their unborn child because he didn't want to be a father.",
      "Allison Huntley : He was keeping a secret \u2014 the fact that he fathered a baby \u2014 in the hopes that the child wouldn't be born.",
      "The defense told the jury there's no evidence Plote harmed Melissa, and that he had gone to see her that day just to talk.",
      "John Kopp: They discussed their finances; they discussed what would happen with the birth of the child \u2026 and then Matt left as she was making some lunch.",
      "Heather Kruse: I believe, from the very beginning, he was trying to set up a story that there was an accidental house fire, that she had been cooking something. \u2026 I believe that was how he laid out the scene \u2026 which would explain why her body was found in the kitchen.",
      "Prosecutors called Fire Investigator Michael Poel to testify about his findings. He told the court that he found no evidence of an electrical or cooking fire.",
      "MIKE POEL (in court): And you start ruling these \u2014 these various different things out.",
      "Nikki Battiste: How certain are you that this fire was intentionally set?",
      "Michael Poel: I'm certain that it was intentionally set.",
      "Nikki Battiste: No doubt.",
      "Michael Poel: No doubt.",
      "During cross examination, the defense suggested that Poel was unsure of his findings, citing language in his report such as \"most likely\" and \"it is believed.\"",
      "JOHN KOPP (in court): You used the phrase \"it is believed\" because that's an uncertain opinion. Correct?",
      "MICHAEL POEL: It's the way I described it.",
      "JOHN KOPP: But that's an uncertain opinion. Correct?",
      "MICHAEL POEL: Not to me.",
      "Poel says he was just using standard terms used during fire investigations.",
      "The State also called forensic pathologist Dr. Amanda Youmans, who had performed one of the autopsies.",
      "DR. AMANDA YOUMANS (in court): There was no soot in her airways \u2026 And her \u2026 measure of carbon monoxide in the blood was within normal limits. So she was deceased prior to the fire.",
      "Youmans testified that Melissa's body showed evidence of a violent struggle. The jury heard about the hemorrhages around Melissa's neck \u2014 a specific type of broken blood vessels called \"petechial hemorrhages\" which according to Youmans, is a telltale sign of strangulation.",
      "DR. AMANDA YOUMANS (in court): This is the most petechial hemorrhages I've ever seen in a strangulation case.",
      "Deanna Lamesch: To sit through trial was beyond devastating.",
      "Deanna Lamesch came to court every day.",
      "Deanna Lamesch: I had been prepped by the victims' advocate. \u2026 Things were going to be gruesome. I was going to see a lot.",
      "Deanna Lamesch says she always kept Melissa and her baby Barrett in her thoughts.",
      "Deanna Lamesch: She was so strong-willed and had such pride. That baby was gonna be a strong guy.",
      "Plote's parents also attended the trial.",
      "Nikki Battiste: They've been by his side throughout this?",
      "John Kopp: Yes. Every court date.",
      "One of the most important witnesses to testify was Melissa's sister, Cassie Baal, talking about the day Melissa died and that call which Baal says was interrupted by Plote.",
      "ALLISON HUNTLEY (in court): What was the last thing your sister said to you during that phone call?",
      "CASSIE BAAL: Sorry (emotional). She said she would make the conversation quick and she would call me right back.",

      "Heather Kruse: So, if you think about it logically, Thursday's Thanksgiving and Friday is her due date, his deadline. The only time to do this was Wednesday. So he took off work and completed his goal.",
      "The prosecutors found even more telling what Plote didn't say \u2014 especially during that seven-hour interview \u2014 four hours of which were played for the jury.",
      "Allison Huntley: What is chilling \u2026 is the fact that he never denied murdering Melissa. And he never denied killing her baby boy, not one time. It's chilling from a personal perspective, but that's also excellent evidence that the defendant couldn't bring himself to lie about that fact.",
      "John Kopp: Over the course of multiple interviews for several hours, he was calm and reserved.",
      "His silence, the defense says, actually points to his innocence \u2014 not his guilt.",

      "QUESTIONING THE INVESTIGATION",
      "John Kopp: The State's expert didn't do a fraction of what he should have done to properly determine the cause of the fire. \u2026 This should have been an undetermined fire.",
      "To try to poke holes in the prosecution's case, the defense called only one witness: retired firefighter and independent inspector John Knapp. He was not at the scene of the fire but did study reports and photos.",
      "JOHN KNAPP (in court): I felt like there was probably more information that could have been gathered that wasn't \u2026",
      "He disputed the prosecution's claim that Plote set the fire. He testified that the evidence collected doesn't prove that the fire was intentionally set by anyone.",
      "JOHN KNAPP (in court): I couldn't make that determination to whether or not \u2014 what the cause of the fire should be other than undetermined.",
      "Michael Poel: When you're not there at the scene, you don't see what we've seen, not always does every little tidbit end up in a report.",
      "Poel says the defense's expert is wrong, and that his investigation was thorough.",
      "Michael Poel: We're looking for anything and everything that could have contributed to the origins of this fire. \u2026 They weren't there. \u2026 You needed to be there when we were doing the examination.",
      "Plote waived his right to testify. During closing arguments, the defense accused investigators of having tunnel vision.",
      "John Kopp: The complete lack of investigation \u2026 of any other individual is shocking. I've never seen such a poorly investigated case.",
      "Liam Dixon: They didn't follow-up on any other leads that may have happened. Any other boyfriends, any other \u2014 anybody else.",
      "Allison Huntley: If there had been another lead, investigators certainly would've followed it. There simply wasn't..",
      "Prosecutors told the jury that the evidence was clear:\u00a0 Melissa Lamesch was strangled to death by the only person who had a motive to kill her, Matthew Plote, who was juggling multiple women and didn't want to change his lifestyle.",
      "Allison Huntley: He clearly \u2026 did not want to be involved in this baby's life. This is someone who actively hid the fact that a woman in the community was carrying his child.",
      "John Kopp: He \u2026 clearly had made some choices about having \u2026 multiple relationships but did not make him a killer.",
      "The trial lasted a week. After two hours of deliberation, the jury returned with a verdict: guilty of all charges.",

      "Nikki Battiste: What did you feel?",
      "Deanna Lamesch: Shock. Shock.",
      "The verdict was a relief for Chief Schultz. He says the case had long weighed on him and everyone at the firehouse who had worked with Plote.",
      "Chief Rob Schultz: There was a huge closure here when Matt was found guilty. \u2026 You still have the family out there that lost a daughter or lost a grandson \u2026 You're never going to change that.",
      "Three months later, on June 27, 2024, Melissa's family and friends gathered at the courthouse for sentencing. Plote listened with little reaction as victim impact statements were read:",
      "GUS LAMESCH (in court): We lost Melissa in the prime of her life. \u2026 Melissa and Barrett should still be alive and enjoying life with her loving family.",
      "CASSIE BAAL (in court): I shouldn't have spent Thanksgiving that year feeling like there was nothing to be thankful for. \u2026 This shouldn't be real, but it is real. It is all real because one man decided to make the decision that Barrett and Melissa weren't needed or wanted.",
      "DEANNA LAMESCH (in court): None of this had to happen, all he had to do was walk away.",

      "Cayley Mandadi, 19, was a sophomore at Trinity University when she was brought to a Texas hospital on Oct. 29, 2017. She was nearly naked, bruised and not breathing. Her sometime boyfriend Mark Howerton told doctors they'd taken ecstasy at a music festival and she passed out after consensual sex in his car. She died at the hospital.",
      "In February 2018, authorities charged Howerton with Mandadi's murder, alleging her cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head. A year later, Howerton's trial ended with a hung jury.",
      "A new trial was set for 2023. Mandadi's mother Alison Steele and stepfather Lawrence Baitland believed for the second trial jurors needed more information about what happened inside Howerton's car. Steele, a scientist, and Baitland, a NASA engineer, launched their own investigation.",

      "Taylor Clement: Every single day. \u2026 She was much more of a morning person. So I would get mine first thing in the morning.",
      "But on Monday morning, Oct. 30, 2017, there was no word from Cayley.",
      "Taylor Clement: I didn't get a Snapchat at 8 o'clock in the morning, like I usually do. \u2026 That's actually how I knew something was really wrong.",

      "If confirmed by the Senate, he would replace outgoing DEA Administrator Anne Milgram, who has held the role for nearly the entirety of President Biden's term.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS affiliate\u00a0WTSP, Chronister called it \"the honor of a lifetime to be nominated,\" adding that he was \"deeply humbled by this opportunity to serve our nation.\"",
      "The DEA, which is part of the Justice Department, has approximately 10,000 employees and is tasked with enforcing America's drug laws. Among its major edicts has been addressing the opioid crisis.",

      "Prologue",
      "This book tells a story that will not happen again, because the state I lived in for thirty-five years ceased to exist in 1990. If it had been offered to a publishing house as a work of fiction, it would have been turned down, someone said to me early in 2022, a few weeks after I stepped down from the office of federal chancellor. He was familiar with such issues, and was glad that I had decided to write this book, precisely because of its story. A story that is as unlikely as it is real. It became clear to me: telling this story, drawing out its lines, finding the thread running through it, identifying leitmotifs, could also be important for the future.",
      "For a long time I couldn't imagine writing such a book. That first changed in 2015, at least a little. Back then, in the night between September 4 and 5, I had decided not to turn away the refugees coming from Hungary at the German-Austrian border. I experienced that decision, and above all its consequences, as a caesura in my chancellorship. There was a before and an after. That was when I undertook to describe, one day when I was no longer chancellor, the sequence of events, the reasons for my decision, my understanding of Europe and globalization bound up with it, in a form that only a book would make possible. I didn't want to leave the further description and interpretation just to other people.",
      "But I was still in office. The 2017 Bundestag election followed, along with my fourth period of office. In its last two years the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic was the predominant theme. The pandemic, as I said publicly on several occasions, made huge demands on democracy, on a national, European, and global level. This also prompted me to broaden my outlook and not only write about refugee policy. If I was going to do it at all, I had to do it properly, I said to myself, and if I was, then I would do it with Beate Baumann. She has been advising me since 1992, and is an eyewitness.",
      "I stepped down from office on December 8, 2021. After sixteen years I left it, as I said at the Bundeswehr's Military Tattoo in my honor a few days before, with joy in my heart. By the end I had in fact longed for that moment. Enough was enough. Now it was time to take a break and rest for a few months, leave the frantic world of politics behind me, to begin a new life in the spring, slowly and tentatively, still a public life, but not an active political one, find the right rhythm for public appearances\u2014and write this book. That was the plan.",
      "Then came February 24, 2022, Russia's attack on Ukraine.",
      "It was immediately clear that writing this book as if nothing had happened was completely out of the question. The war in Yugoslavia at the beginning of the 1990s had already shaken Europe to its core. But the Russian attack on Ukraine was a greater threat. It was a breach of international law that shattered the European peace which had prevailed since the Second World War and was based on the preservation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of its states. Profound disillusionment followed. I will write about that too. But this is not a book about Russia and Ukraine. That would be a different book.",
      "Instead I would like to write the story of my two lives, the first up to 1990 in a dictatorship and the second since 1990 in a democracy. At the moment when the first readers hold this book in their hands, the two halves are of more or less equal length. But in fact, of course, these are not two lives. In fact they are one life, and the second part cannot be understood without the first.",
      "How did it happen that, after spending the first thirty-five years of her life in the GDR, a woman was able to take over the most powerful office that exists in the Federal Republic of Germany and hold it for sixteen years? And that she left it again without having to step down during a period of office or being voted out? What was it like to grow up in East Germany as the child of a pastor, and study and work under the conditions of a dictatorship? What was it like to experience the collapse of a state? And to be suddenly free? That's the story I want to tell.",
      "Of course, my account is deeply subjective. At the same time, I have aimed for honest self-reflection. Today, I will identify my misjudgments and defend the things I think I got right. But this is not a complete account of everything that happened. Not everyone who might have expected, or who might have been expected, to appear in these pages will do so. For that I request understanding. My goal is to establish some points of focus with which I attempt to tame the sheer mass of material, and allow people to understand how politics works, what principles and mechanisms there are\u2014and what guided me.",
      "Politics isn't witchcraft. Politics is made by people, people with their influences, their experiences, vanities, weaknesses, strengths, desires, dreams, convictions, values, and interests. People who need to fight for majorities in a democracy if they want to make things happen.",
      "We can do this\u2014Wir schaffen das. Throughout the whole of my political career, no phrase has been thrown back at me with quite such virulence as this one. No phrase has been so polarizing. For me, however, it was quite an ordinary phrase. It expressed an attitude. Call it trust in God, caution, or simply a determination to solve problems, to deal with setbacks, get over the lows and come up with new ideas. \"We can do this, and if something stands in our way it has to be overcome, it has to be worked on.\" That was how I put it in my summer press conference on August 31, 2015. That was how I did politics. It's how I live. It's also how this book came about. With this attitude, which is also something learned, everything is possible, because it isn't only politics that contributes to it\u2014every individual person has a part to play.",

      "One afternoon Stafford Shurden took me through his family's land. A Taurus semiautomatic pistol rested casually on his console. His family footprint once stretched to the gates of Parchman, the infamous Gothic prison farm that serves as the Mississippi State Penitentiary, one of the worst and most feared prisons in the country. The front gate is twelve miles north of the barn.",
      "At the end of the drive we stopped at his family's old farm office, which would have been buzzing with people back when the Shurdens ran this little corner of the world. Now it's empty. He found a key on a big ring and opened the door.",
      "We stepped into the dark, silent room. The first thing Stafford did was go sit in his father's old desk chair made out of a green bucket seat from an old classic Thunderbird. He hoped the old man would be proud of him. A painting showed Black cotton pickers moving through a field with their long bags, with the Shurden Farms logo on the trailers parked around them. Stafford sighed.",
      "\"Tell me this ain't the most racist s**t you've ever seen,\" he said.",

      "There was an oil painting of a stern old woman.",
      "\"That's Grandma Shurden,\" Stafford told me. \"She had eighteen kids.\"",
      "A family crest, commissioned by Otha Shurden in 1969, has soybeans, cotton, and catfish on it. Grandma Shurden was Clint's mom, too. In a little side office was a huge map of their part of Sunflower County. It documented who owned every piece of land, divided into squares and rectangles and trapezoids, into little homesteads and big plantations. I looked down at the corner and saw the date: \"Jan 1, 1956.\"",
      "This was the first county land map made after the murder. I ran my finger along the sides of the map and found the barn: Township 22 North, Range 4 West, Section 2, West Half, measured from the Choctaw Meridian. Familiar names claimed plots all around the old Milam farm. Smaller pieces of land were marked only by initials. I found the Dougherty Bayou and all the nearby farms and then the barn. It was the only piece of dirt on the map without a name.",
      "Thomas Jefferson wrote a law that would pass Congress as the Land Ordinance of 1785. His goal was simple. He wanted the empty open space of his new country to be broken into small blocks and sold to yeoman farmers\u2014small, entirely independent (white) landowners\u2014and so he took a system invented by a military engineer named Thomas Hutchins and codified it into law. Many ancient cultures were built around the idea of shared land. America was built around the idea of owning parceled land. That foundational urge was born in the moment when Jefferson put pen to page. Yeomen weren't plantation lords like Jefferson and they weren't poor white trash. To Jefferson their protection and elevation in American life was the hill upon which this new nation would live or die. The first draft of the bill broke the country into ten\u2011mile\u2011by\u2011ten\u2011mile squares called hundreds, while a second reduced them to seven\u2011mile\u2011by\u2011seven\u2011mile squares called townships. On May 3, 1785, William Grayson of Virginia made a motion to change the seven to a six and James Monroe seconded the motion. They would send surveyors out into every bit of new territory America amassed\u2014starting with the land won from the English in the Revolutionary War\u2014and divide it into thirty\u2011six\u2011square\u2011mile blocks, which would be divided into thirty\u2011six smaller squares named sections. Each section was 640 acres, or one square mile, and the sale of all this public land would pay down the war debt of the new nation, which hadn't yet been able to agree on a way to raise money through taxes. A permanent grid appeared overnight.",
      "A central American conflict was baked into this first drawing of the new nation. Jefferson wanted the land to be settled by yeomen. But the price for the newly available land was simply too high for most farmers to pay. In the decades that followed, Alexander Hamilton's Federalist Party and Jefferson's Republican Party fought over this issue. From John Adams through Jefferson and into Madison and Monroe, the minimum purchase amount (and the price) rose and fell depending on whether those in power wanted to help capitalist landowners or small, independent farmers. The Land Law of 1800 reduced the minimum purchase to 320 acres, which was cut to 160, then again to 80, and finally, in 1832, to 40 acres. The base price was about a dollar an acre. This fight between capitalized investors and small farmers dominated the politics of the new nation and would play out brutally on the land surrounding Drew, Mississippi.",
      "The barn sits on the southwest quarter of Section 2, Township 22 North, Range 4 West, measured from the Choctaw Meridian. That's its exact legal location on Jefferson's grid: a square mile per section, thirty\u2011six sections per township, over and over again across the new nation. The thirty\u2011six square miles of Township 22 North, Range 4 West, have borne witness to the birth of the blues at the nearby Dockery Plantation, to the struggle of Fannie Lou Hamer, to the machinations of a founding family of the Klan, and to the death of Emmett Till.",
      "To get to Dockery, take a right out of Jeff Andrews's driveway, take another right on Ralph Ray Road toward the Bolivar County line, and then turn left on Dockery Road. Dockery Farms has been called the birthplace of the Delta blues by B. B. King and many others. It's not an accident then that this land fueled the first protest music. The blues came from the land around the barn. From Charley Patton, the Black grandson of a white man. Patton's music flowed from a place of rage about how he lived a small, threatened life because his grandmother was Black \u2014 \"skin the color of rape,\" the poet Caroline Randall Williams wrote. He became the first blues star, the man who taught Son House, who taught Robert Johnson, who taught Muddy Waters, who hailed from the same Delta town as Sam Cooke and Nate Dogg, all these genres making the same protest music against the same forces as Patton\u2014Delta blues or G\u2011funk, Muddy and \"I'm a full\u2011grown man\" or Sam's \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" or Ice Cube and \"F**k tha Police.\" Eazy\u2011E's grandparents ran a grocery store sixteen blocks up Broadway in Greenville from the house where J.W. Milam lived when he died.",
      "The Dockery family still owns their plantation. Now the granddaughters of the founder control the business. One of them, a distinguished elderly woman named Douglas Dockery Thomas, agreed to meet me in her New York apartment. Her building is on the Upper East Side, overlooking the Metropolitan Museum and Central Park. She's on the board at the Metropolitan Opera and is one of the central patrons of the Met. The doorman was expecting me. The elevator opened directly into her apartment, which covered an entire floor, easily more than four thousand square feet.",
      "She led me into a formal parlor with a piano under tall ceilings and crown molding. I looked down at the museum and the yellow cabs on Fifth Avenue. Hers is some of the most expensive residential real estate in the world. The final vapors of the Gilded Age moved through the empty rooms in a world where history stopped in 1929, or maybe 1955. Nothing we talk about can be on the record, she says. The family remains very private. Her son, I've read, is an incredibly successful venture capitalist, the money behind Venmo and BuzzFeed, among others. We talked about Mississippi. Our families knew each other. On a side table was a picture of her with King Charles III when he was Prince of Wales. I noticed her sharp cheekbones and delicate wrists. She loves the opera but also loves the blues and has set up Dockery as a living museum to honor her parents, Joe Rice and Keith, and the music that came to life on the family farm. Her mother especially seemed to understand that the line all white southerners need to see or be shown wasn't between good and bad, but between cowardly and brave.",
      "\"If I had not been married to Joe,\" Keith said, \"I might have been out on the streets marching with the protestors. But I was, and I didn't.\"",
      "Willie Reed stepped out of his family home for the last time on a Friday night. He moved alone into the darkness. He had been told the plan and followed it carefully. Lots of people wanted him dead. He'd dared to accuse a white man of murder. In his arms he carried a coat and an extra pair of pants. Everything else he left behind. No account survives of the feelings in that dark house, the sorrow and fear, the words spoken and unspoken. It must have felt like a scene from a different time, a man forced into exile, facing a kind of ancient judgment surely not possible in 1955. The history books say he walked six miles in the dark. Nobody knows for sure which direction but when you look at the map, and understand who lived in the houses lining the roads, there's only one route he could have taken: down the Drew\u2011Cleveland Road, now the Drew\u2011Ruleville Road, skirting the edge of Dockery Farms.",
      "I've driven that road at night, in a big, modern Chevrolet four\u2011 wheel\u2011drive, with my armor of white skin, with a .40\u2011caliber semi\u2011 automatic pistol in the glove box, and even then it's spooky. The darkness of rural Mississippi remains a physical thing, heavy and alive, a sonic experience, too, loud with bugs and birds. There is no safety outside the civilization of headlights. If someone wanted to kill you, there would be nobody to hear you scream. If someone approached, there would be no place to hide. This road was by far Reed's safest option, lined with poor Black families. He only had two other options to escape. The first, the Drew\u2011Merigold Road, would have taken him through the only real community of small, poor, white farmers in the Delta. That was suicide. He could have run into the town of Drew. Also suicide. That left Ruleville, which is 6.6 miles from his house and still risky. One of the policemen in the city of Ruleville was J.W. Milam and Roy Bryant's brother. Reed likely passed his girlfriend Ella Mae Stubbs's home. He didn't have time to tell her goodbye.",
      "A car waited in the dark at the end of the road. The driver took Reed north on Highway 61 through Cleveland and Merigold, finally reaching Mound Bayou and safety. Another car awaited him there. The man behind the steering wheel was Medgar Evers. The other passenger was Congressman Diggs. The three men drove north in Evers's Oldsmobile 88 with a big\u2011block V\u20118, which he had bought specifically to outrun the white terrorists who'd follow and chase him through the backroads of the rural state. His speedometer glowed red whenever he got over sixty miles an hour, which he did as the three men roared toward Memphis Airport. When they arrived, Diggs and Reed went inside the terminal. They probably took the 10:00 a.m. Delta\u2011C&S 686 from Memphis to Chicago, with a stop in Saint Louis, each leg exactly an hour and nine minutes. That's three hours with the layover to try to imagine what awaited them when the plane touched down. In Chicago, Diggs took Willie to Congressman William Dawson's office. Dawson had represented the South Side of Chicago since 1943. An uncle met him up there. Two strangers approached them.",
      "\"Willie?\" \"Willie Reed?\"",
      "Both Reed and his uncle felt terror. He'd already been found. The fear eased when the men introduced themselves as Chicago police officers. They'd been assigned to make sure Reed was safe in his new home. Reed struggled to focus as his uncle took him to his mother's walk\u2011up apartment at 2103 South Michigan, two blocks from what is now the Marriott Marquis, across the street from the Chess Records studio where the Rolling Stones would one day visit and find their hero Muddy Waters painting the walls of the lobby.",
      "Reporters met Reed there in the first hours of his exile. \"Everybody is scared,\" he told them. \"Why? What did we do?\" They asked him about the world he'd left behind.",
      "\"I feel kind of lonely for Ella Mae,\" he said.",
      "The next morning charitable strangers offered to write blank checks to bring Ella Mae Stubbs to Chicago. Mississippi reporters went out to the Clark Plantation and found her father, Ernest Stubbs, and asked his opinion. He said his daughter barely knew Willie Reed and that his family was perfectly happy in Mississippi.",
      "Willie Reed never saw Ella Mae Stubbs again.",
      "A Jackson Daily News reporter, Bill Spell, flew up to Chicago in a state\u2011owned airplane to \"interview\" him. The whole point was to let Willie know that Mississippi could reach him anytime it wanted. Spell would confess later in life that Senator Eastland's office was actively digging up dirt on the Till family and actually delivering prewritten hatchet jobs to the Jackson paper where he worked. The reporter, a member of the National Guard, got his commanding officer to approve a military flight to Chicago. Spell found Reed in Michael Reese Hospital, located in Bronzeville on the South Side, with what best can be described as a nervous breakdown. His room was in between the train station where Emmett's body would arrive and the little piece of sidewalk where Sonny Boy Williamson got murdered as he walked home from a gig. A month later, Reed swallowed his fear and returned to Mississippi to testify in Leflore County as a grand jury debated indicting Milam and Bryant for kidnapping. He told his story and flew back to Chicago. The grand jury declined to bring charges, just as the jury in Sumner had acquitted Milam and Bryant, and with that the legal proceedings in the case of Emmett Till ended.",
      "Reed changed his name to Willie Louis soon after. That had been his father's last name and he wanted to be anonymous again. Every day he went to work as a surgical technician in a South Side hospital, located between Michelle Obama's childhood home and the house of poet Gwendolyn Brooks. Mamie Till-Mobley, Simeon Wright, and Wheeler Parker all lost touch with him and thought he'd been killed. Willie Louis vanished into working-class Chicago. He would go many years before telling another person about what he'd heard that morning inside Leslie Milam's barn.",

    "title": "Angela Merkel on Putin, Trump, and a post-Cold War world still divided",
    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 10:44:15 -0500",
    "summary": "After a childhood behind the Iron Curtain, Angela Merkel served as Chancellor of a united Germany for 16 years, becoming the most powerful woman in the world while dealing with its most powerful men. She talks about her new book, \"Freedom: Memoirs 1954-2021.\"",
    "story": [
      "We met former German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a fitting place for her: the museum in Berlin dedicated to the Wall, that great symbol of the Cold War division between East and West. Parts of the wall have been preserved as a reminder of those hard times, especially for someone who lived through them.",
      "She said images of the wall still conjure up highly emotional memories for her.",
      "I asked, \"When you look at the wall, what comes to mind to you immediately?\"",
      "\"Between the ages of seven and 35, I had to live with this wall,\" she replied. \"I was, so to speak, behind the wall, and couldn't come to this side. And of course, that's still very moving.\"",
      "Merkel's new book, \"Freedom: Memoirs 1954-2021\" (published by St. Martin's Press), is filled with moving memories of what it was like growing up in the Communist-controlled police state that was East Germany. Her family had moved there when she was an infant because her father, a Protestant pastor, was assigned to a church there. But it was the fall of the wall that spurred her political awakening, and jump-started a career nobody would have bet on: A woman, from the East, who would not only become Chancellor of Germany, but who would hold the job for 16 years; who would be called the most powerful woman in the world, and who would deal with its most powerful men.",
      "It turns out, life in the East actually had given her one advantage for dealing with all those men in dark suits: Those bright pant suits of hers weren't an accident. \"In my book I write that maybe my love for colorful clothes is due to the fact that in the East, everything was very gray,\" she said.",
      "Merkel's uniform became part of her identity, and helped her break through the American pop-cultural barrier, on \"Saturday Night Live,\" the way few European leaders could.",
      "Merkel left power three years ago this week, and has gone into a kind of self-imposed political radio silence since then, keeping her recollections and opinions to herself.",
      "Not anymore.",
      "Among the more awkward memories: that first shocking, even embarrassing, meeting with President Donald Trump in 2017.",
      "I said, \"I think it's fair to say your most difficult relationship with an American president was with President Trump in his first term. You talk about your first encounter in the Oval Office where he refused to shake your hand, and you say that it occurred to you that he was fascinated with Putin and with politicians with authoritarian and dictatorial traits. Why did you say that?\"",
      "\"Why he didn't want to shake my hand, that, you'd have to ask him,\" Merkel replied. \"I think he often conveyed a message with a handshake. With some men he shook hands for a long time.\"",
      "\"What were you thinking? Should I reach over? Will we shake hands? Won't we shake hands? What's he trying to do?\"",
      "\"I describe it in my book because it was so interesting. I whispered to him, 'I think they want us to shake hands.' And at that moment when I said it, I noticed that he wanted to convey a message. And I was quite na\u00efve, telling him that they want us to shake hands.\"",
      "\"But did you get what he was trying to do?\" I asked. \"Did you think, Oh, he's going to play it that way, that's how we're going to do it?\"",
      "\"Yeah, that's the way it was. I left being convinced that multilateral cooperation would be difficult with Donald Trump,\" Merkel replied. \"You can make deals with Donald Trump because he always thinks in terms of advantage and disadvantage. But in my experience, win-win situations are not only good for one side, but for both sides. That's not really his way of thinking.\"",
      "Merkel's book, which is being released around the world, went to press before last month's election. In it, she wrote that she wishes \"with all my heart that Kamala Harris defeats her competitor and becomes president.\"",
      "Of the election results, she said, \"I was sad. First of all, I wanted a woman to win. I was also in favor of Hillary Clinton. And secondly, I'm closer to Kamala Harris' political conviction. But the American voters have decided, and it was a democratic election.\"",
      "Merkel has come in for her own share of criticism since she left office. Her decision to allow more than a million refugees and migrants fleeing Syria into Germany is now often cited as a reason for the rise of anti-immigrant, right-wing political parties in Europe. She says those forces were on the rise anyway.",
      "Her decision to allow the German economy to become too dependent on Russian natural gas is seen as another reason for Germany's economic decline since the flow was stopped.",
      "She says staying engaged with Vladimir Putin seemed like the right idea at the time, difficult though it was. And it didn't stop him from invading Ukraine.",
      "I asked, \"You dealt a lot with Vladimir Putin. I take it, reading between the lines of your book, that you found him a very difficult and manipulative character as well, even an intimidating character at times. Famously, you don't like dogs; he'd bring his dog to the meeting. Do you think he did that in an intimidating kind of way? And how would you suggest people deal with him, especially as things are heating up again?\"",
      "\"Without fear,\" she replied. \"Of course, there are attempts to see how people react under a certain amount of pressure. And Putin can do that, too. And with the dog he expressed exactly that. But it all depends on how I manage the situation. I'm used to political pressure since childhood, so that did not shock me.\"",
      "Despite all her experience, Merkel says she now refrains from giving advice. But she does give hints. She says that, in general, she is worried about developments in the world: \"I've always said that fear is not a good advisor. Times have become rougher. We are now sitting in a place where the world was divided in the Cold War, and then there was 1990. We had great hopes that things would become easier after the end of the Cold War. Things have not become easier.\"",

    "story": [
      "Thousands of Syrian insurgents took over most of Aleppo on Saturday, establishing positions in the country's largest city and controlling its airport before expanding their shock offensive to a nearby province. They faced little to no resistance from government troops, according to fighters and activists.",
      "A war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the insurgents led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham seized control of Aleppo International airport, the first international airport to be controlled by insurgents. The fighters claimed they seized the airport and posted pictures from there.",
      "Thousands of fighters also moved on, facing almost no opposition from government forces, to seize towns and villages in northern Hama, a province where they had a presence before being expelled by government troops in 2016. They claimed Saturday evening to have entered the city of Hama.",
      "Assad's forces caught by surprise",
      "The swift and surprise offensive is a huge embarrassment for Syria's President Bashar Assad and raises questions about his armed forces' preparedness. The insurgent offensive launched from their stronghold in the country's northwest appeared to have been planned for years. It also comes at a time when Assad's allies were preoccupied with their own conflicts.",
      "In his first public comments since the start of the offensive, released by the state news agency Saturday evening, Assad said Syria will continue to \"defend its stability and territorial integrity against terrorists and their supporters.\" He added that Syria is able to defeat them no matter how much their attacks intensify.",
      "Turkey, a main backer of Syrian opposition groups, said its diplomatic efforts had failed to stop government attacks on opposition-held areas in recent weeks, which were in violation of a de-escalation agreement sponsored by Russia, Iran and Ankara. Turkish security officials said a limited offensive by the rebels was planned to stop government attacks and allow civilians to return, but the offensive expanded as Syrian government forces began to retreat from their positions.",
      "The insurgents, led by the Salafi jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and including Turkey-backed fighters, launched their shock offensive on Wednesday. They first staged a two-pronged attack in Aleppo and the Idlib countryside, entering Aleppo two days later and securing a strategic town that lies on the highway that links Syria's largest city to the capital and the coast.",
      "By Saturday evening, they seized at least four towns in the central Hama province and claimed to have entered the provincial capital. The insurgents staged an attempt to reclaim areas they controlled in Hama in 2017 but failed.",
      "Syrian forces prepare a counterattack",
      "Syria's armed forces said in a statement Saturday that to absorb the large attack on Aleppo and save lives, it redeployed troops and equipment and was preparing a counterattack. The statement acknowledged that insurgents entered large parts of the city but said they have not established bases or checkpoints. Later on Saturday, the armed forces sought to dispel what it said were lies in reference to reports about its forces retreating or defecting, saying the general command was carrying out its duties in \"combatting terrorist organizations.\"",
      "The return of the insurgents to Aleppo was their first since 2016, following a grueling military campaign in which Assad's forces were backed by Russia, Iran and its allied groups.",
      "The 2016 battle for Aleppo was a turning point in the war between Syrian government forces and rebel fighters after 2011 protests against Assad's rule turned into an all-out war. After appearing to be losing control of the country to the rebels, the Aleppo battle secured Assad's hold on strategic areas of Syria, with opposition factions and their foreign backers controlling areas on the periphery.",
      "The lightning offensive threatened to reignite the country's civil war, which had been largely in a stalemate for years.",
      "Late on Friday, witnesses said two airstrikes hit the edge of Aleppo city, targeting insurgent reinforcements and falling near residential areas. The Observatory said 20 fighters were killed.",
      "Insurgents raise flag over Aleppo citadel",
      "Insurgents were filmed outside police headquarters, in the city center, and outside the Aleppo citadel, the medieval palace in the old city center, and one of the largest in the world. They tore down posters of Assad, stepping on some and burning others.",
      "The push into Aleppo followed weeks of simmering low-level violence, including government attacks on opposition-held areas.",
      "The offensive came as Iran-linked groups, primarily Lebanon's Hezbollah, which has backed Syrian government forces since 2015, have been preoccupied with their own battles at home. A ceasefire in Hezbollah's two-month war with Israel took effect Wednesday, the same day that Syrian opposition factions announced their offensive. Israel has also escalated its attacks against Hezbollah and Iran-linked targets in Syria during the last 70 days.",
      "Speaking from the heart of the city in Saadallah Aljabri square, opposition fighter Mohammad Al Abdo said it was his first time back in Aleppo in 13 years, when his older brother was killed at the start of the war.",
      "\"God willing, the rest of Aleppo province will be liberated\" from government forces, he said.",
      "There was light traffic in the city center on Saturday. Opposition fighters fired in the air in celebration but there was no sign of clashes or government troops present.",
      "Journalists in the city filmed soldiers captured by the insurgents and the bodies of others killed in battle.",
      "Abdulkafi Alhamdo, a teacher who fled Aleppo in 2016 and returned Friday night after hearing the insurgents were inside, described \"mixed feelings of pain, sadness and old memories.\"",
      "\"As I entered Aleppo, I kept telling myself this is impossible. How did this happen?\"",
      "Alhamdo said he strolled through the city at night visiting the Aleppo citadel, where the insurgents raised their flags, a major square and the university of Aleppo, as well as the last spot he was in before he was forced to leave for the countryside.",
      "\"I walked in (the empty) streets of Aleppo, shouting, 'People, people of Aleppo. We are your sons,'\" he told The Associated Press in a series of messages.",

      "Aleppo residents reported hearing clashes and gunfire but most stayed indoors. Some fled the fighting.",
      "Schools and government offices were closed Saturday as most people stayed indoors, according to Sham FM radio, a pro-government station. Bakeries were open. Witnesses said the insurgents deployed security forces around the city to prevent any acts of violence or looting.",
      "The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Friday Aleppo's two key public hospitals were reportedly full of patients while many private facilities closed.",
      "In social media posts, the insurgents were pictured outside of the citadel, the medieval palace in the old city center, and one of the largest in the world. In cellphone videos, they recorded themselves having conversations with residents they visited at home, seeking to reassure them they will cause no harm.",
      "The Syrian Kurdish-led administration in the country's east said nearly 3,000 people, most of them students, had arrived in their region after fleeing the fighting in Aleppo, which has a sizeable Kurdish population.",

      "Although her name has not been released by authorities, two people familiar with the matter identified the woman to CBS News Saturday as 57-year-old Svetlana   Dali.",
      "The woman has a driver's license showing she is a Philadelphia resident. She is in the U.S. on a green card, according to a person familiar who did not immediately know what her native country was. The French Ministry of the Interior identified her as a Russian national.",
      "The situation initially unfolded Tuesday, when the woman boarded Delta Flight No. 265 from JFK Airport to Paris without a boarding pass. The flight was not sold out, and she was discovered when a flight attendant became concerned that the woman was making frequent and lengthy visits to various lavatories aboard the Boeing 767-400ER, according to a source familiar with the incident.",
      "French police came aboard the plane after it landed and took her into custody.",
      "At this time, U.S. federal authorities do not plan to charge her with a federal crime, one person familiar with the matter told CBS News. She may, however, face state criminal charges in New York, possibly a state count of criminal trespassing.",
      "Passenger Rob Jackson, who shot video of French authorities coming onto the plane after it landed in Paris, told CBS News he noticed the flight attendants behaving oddly as the flight was descending.",
      "\"I heard them saying, like, we have a passenger who we think was hiding in the lavatory during takeoff,\" Jackson said. \"She does not have a seat. She did not have a boarding pass. And basically, she's a stowaway.\"",
      "A Transportation Security Administration source told CBS News that the woman went through an advanced imaging technology body scanner at a checkpoint in JFK Airport after somehow appearing to evade the document and ID check portion of the TSA process. Her bags were also scanned for prohibited items before she went to the gate and snuck onto the flight, the source said.",
      "A TSA spokesperson confirmed in a statement that the woman \"without a boarding pass was physically screened without any prohibited items\" and then \"bypassed two identity verification and boarding status stations and boarded the aircraft.\"",
      "After getting through TSA security, it's unclear how exactly the woman boarded the plane without showing a boarding pass or passport to Delta staff.",
      "French law enforcement and the TSA are separately investigating. The woman could be subject to a civil penalty or fine for bypassing the document check process.",

    "summary": "The Canadian prime minister earlier cautioned that imposing sweeping tariffs on Canadian products would only raise prices for Americans and hurt American businesses.",
    "story": [
      "Canadian Prime Minister\u00a0Justin Trudeau\u00a0flew to Florida to meet with President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate, where they held a \"very productive meeting.\" It came in the wake of Trump's threat to impose tariffs on goods coming from Canada.",
      "Trudeau dined with Trump at Mar-a-largo Friday night, according to senior sources who spoke to CBC News on condition they not be named due to the sensitivity of the trip. The sources said the meeting was pushed for by Canadian officials, the Canadian broadcaster said.",
      "Trudeau's plane landed at Palm Beach International Airport at about 5:30 p.m. local time. A smiling Trudeau declined comment upon returning to his West Palm Beach hotel late Friday from Mar-a-Lago. The Trump transition team did not comment on the meeting when reached by CBS News.",
      "Joining Trump and Trudeau at dinner were Howard Lutnick, Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump's pick to lead the Interior Department, Mike Waltz, Trump's choice to be his national security adviser, and the three men's wives, a person familiar with the dinner plans who was not authorized to speak publicly and did so on condition of anonymity told the Associated Press.",
      "Also attending the dinner, the person told the AP, were Republican Senator-elect David McCormick of Pennsylvania, and his wife Dina Powell, a former deputy national security adviser under Trump, as well as Katie Telford, Trudeau's chief of staff.",
      "On Saturday, while leaving a hotel in West Palm, Trudeau told reporters that \"it was an excellent conversation\" with Trump the night before. He did not elaborate further and would not comment on questions about whether the tariffs were part of the conversation or about his relationship with the president-elect.",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he had a \"very productive meeting\" with Trudeau during which they discussed \"many important topics that will require both Countries to work together to address.\" For issues in need of such cooperation, Trump cited fentanyl and the \"Drug Crisis that has decimated so many lives as a result of Illegal Immigration,\" fair trade deals \"that do not jeopardize American Workers\" and the U.S. trade deficit with its ally to the north.",
      "\"I made it very clear that the United States will no longer sit idly by as our Citizens become victims to the scourge of this Drug Epidemic caused mainly by the Drug Cartels, and Fentanyl pouring in from China. Too much death and hardship!\" Trump said. \"Prime Minister Trudeau has made a commitment to work with us to end this terrible devastation of U.S. Families. We also spoke about many other important topics like Energy, Trade, and the Arctic. All are vital issues that I will be addressing on my first days back in Office, and before.\"",
      "The meeting also came after Trudeau earlier Friday cautioned that if Trump follows through on this threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products, he would be raising prices for Americans and hurting American businesses.",
      "Trump\u00a0has threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if the countries don't stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across southern and northern borders. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products\u00a0entering the U.S.\u00a0from Canada and\u00a0Mexico\u00a0as one of his first executive orders.",
      "\"It is important to understand that Donald Trump, when he makes statements like that, he plans on carrying them out. There's no question about it,\" Trudeau said to reporters in Prince Edward Island in Atlantic Canada earlier Friday.",
      "\"Our responsibility is to point out that he would not just be harming Canadians, who work so well with the United States, but he would actually be raising prices for American citizens as well and hurting American industry and business,\" he added.",
      "Trudeau said Trump got elected because he promised to bring down the cost of groceries, but now he's talking about adding 25% to the cost of all kinds of products, including potatoes from Prince Edward Island.",
      "Those tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump's team negotiated during his first term. Trudeau noted they were able to successfully re-negotiate the deal, which he calls a \"win-win\" for both countries.",
      "\"We can work together as we did previously,\" Trudeau said.",
      "Although Trump once called Trudeau \"weak\" and \"dishonest\" during his first term, ties between the two countries have remained among the closest in the world. Trudeau is the first leader from the Group of Seven countries to visit Trump since the Nov. 4 election.",
      "Trump aide Corey Lewandowski, speaking on Fox News Friday night, said that he was \"certain\" that Trudeau \"is going to come down and have a conversation with the president and say, 'Sir, what can we do to keep this border open, what can we do to keep goods flowing? We know we have problems we are here to fix it.'\"",
      "Trump made the tariff threat Monday while railing against an influx of illegal migrants, even though the numbers at the Canadian border pale in comparison to the southern border.",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone \u2014 and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian one between October 2023 and September 2024.",
      "Trump also railed about fentanyl from Mexico and Canada, even though seizures from the Canadian border are few in comparison to the Mexican border. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",
      "Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but they are ready to make new investments in border security.",
      "\"We're going to work together to meet some of the concerns,\" Trudeau said. \"But ultimately it is through lots of real constructive conversations with President Trump that I am going to have, that will keep us moving forward on the right track for all Canadians.\"",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday she is confident that\u00a0a tariff war with the United States\u00a0will be averted. Trump posted on social media that he had spoken with her and she had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States.",
      "When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.",
      "Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $2.7 billion worth of goods and services cross the border each day.",
      "Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.",

      "In the spring of 1944, U.S. Army Air Force Tech. Sgt. Sanford G. Roy, of Chattanooga, Tennessee, was assigned to the 732nd Bombardment Squadron in the European Theater, according to a news release from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. Roy and several other airmen were aboard the B-24H Liberator \"Little Joe\" on a bombing mission to Brunswick, Germany on April 8. The plane was shot down by German forces and other airmen flying near the aircraft did not report seeing any crew members exiting \"Little Joe\" before it crashed. His name was engraved on the Walls of the Missing at the Netherlands American Cemetery.",
      "Though military members saw the incident, the crash site could not be located during the war. The remains of Roy and eight other crew members were listed as unaccounted for after the war. In 1946, the American Graves Registration Command began investigating bomber losses like the one that Roy died in in the region. Those efforts still failed to find any crash or burial sites associated with the crew of Little Joe.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 10:34:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.S. is among 175 nations haggling over a treaty to reduce the vast quantity of plastic pollution that ends up in our food, water and even our bodies.",
    "story": [
      "Delegates from 175 countries have been meeting this week in Busan, South Korea, in an attempt to negotiate a legally binding treaty to address global plastic pollution. The gathering marks the fifth and final phase of multiyear talks of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution (INC-5), with a decision expected on a treaty when the summit ends on Sunday.",
      "\"We have a historic moment to end the world's plastic pollution crisis and protect our environment, our health, and our future,\" Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Program, told attendees at the start of the week's negotiations, calling it a \"moment of truth\" for the delegations, and the planet.",
      "The talks have been marred by a wide gap in opinions between delegations from small, often developing nations, and more advanced economies \u2014 and some major global corporations whose presence is, in itself, controversial.",
      "The nonprofit Center for International Environmental Law said Wednesday that fossil fuel and chemical industry lobbyists at INC-5 collectively formed the single largest delegation. The 220 registered corporate lobbyists at the summit outnumber all the delegates representing European Union nations combined.",
      "\"Their strategy is designed to preserve the financial interests of countries and companies who are putting their fossil-fueled profits above human health, human rights and the future of the planet,\" said Delphine Levi Alvares, CIEL's global petrochemicals campaign manager.",
      "What's the goal of INC-5?",
      "The goal of the summit is to finalize a legally binding treaty to reduce the amount of plastic pollution that enters the environment and address the scourge of waste already clogging the world's waterways and landfills and contaminating everything from the food and water we consume to our arteries.",
      "The INC-5 delegations were tasked with defining reduction targets, determining how to regulate hazardous waste and chemicals and outlining criteria to manage the entire life cycle of plastics, from production to disposal.",
      "If they do come to an agreement and ratify a new treaty, then it will be adopted Sunday and future meetings of the group will be held to ensure signatory countries are complying.",
      "What's at stake?",
      "There's little dispute that something must be done to tackle plastic pollution, but how to do it remains contentious.",
      "One of the solutions discussed this week has been a potential cap on plastic production, but the idea has proven deeply unpopular among nations whose economies still lean heavily on the production of plastics and fossil fuels, which are essential to making plastic, including China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States.",
      "Another topic under negotiation is whether to impose an outright ban on certain chemicals used in some plastics that are known to be toxic to the environment and dangerous to human health. There is historical precedent for such focused bans, including the decades-old Montreal Protocol, which saw the production of ozone-depleting chemicals including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) barred universally.",
      "Island nations and developing countries are \u2014 just as with climate change \u2014 among those most directly impacted by plastic pollution, but least responsible for producing the waste.",
      "Some of these countries say a plastic pollution treaty is vital to preserve their fragile ecosystems and public health.",
      "Speaking on behalf of the Small Islands Developing States group at the talks, Penivao Moealofa, of the small Pacific island nation of Tuvalu, said it was \"already a challenge to manage our own plastic waste, and it is an injustice to us to continue to manage others' plastic waste, especially when we contribute to less than 1.3% of the total global plastic waste.\"",
      "If policies are not implemented to change things, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says \"annual plastics production, use and waste generation are projected to increase by 70% in 2040 compared to 2020,\" when the world churned out roughly 480 million tons of new plastic products.",
      "Where do different countries stand on plastic pollution?",
      "A group of 68 countries or blocs, including Canada, the EU, Mexico and Australia, have come to be known as the High Ambition Coalition (HAC). Their leaders have backed the goal of stopping all new plastic pollution from entering the environment by 2040, and they believe countries that create the most plastic, including the U.S., should pay to transition the global economy away from the reliance on new plastics.",
      "In a joint statement for INC-5, the HAC highlighted the importance of creating global rules to ensure products are designed with circularity in mind. Circularity is the concept in sustainability of reusing and repurposing products, rather than using and then discarding them, to reduce the amount of waste.",
      "The petrochemical industry has been broadly supportive of a treaty, but it firmly opposes production caps and would prefer to rely on other solutions, such as recycling. But as CBS News has previously reported, recycling many plastics is incredibly challenging, expensive, and has not been scaled up to anywhere near the level that would make it a viable solution to the problem.",
      "Scientists have suggested that, given the pace at which new plastic products are being manufactured, recycling won't be sufficient to combat its impact, and reduced production should be the first priority.",
      "In August, Reuters reported a shift in U.S. government policy to support a global treaty calling for a reduction in plastic production, but three months later, nonprofit news website Grist reported the Biden administration was backtracking on that support ahead of INC-5.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 10:12:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Members of Parliament approved the so-called assisted dying bill by a vote of 330 to 275, signaling their approval in principle for the bill. The vote sends the bill to further scrutiny in Parliament.",
    "story": [
      "British lawmakers gave initial approval Friday to a bill to help terminally ill adults end their lives in England and Wales.",
      "After an impassioned debate, members of Parliament approved the so-called assisted dying bill by a vote of 330 to 275.",
      "The vote came after hours of debate \u2014 emotional at times \u2014 that touched on issues of ethics, grief, the law, faith, crime and money. Hundreds of people on both sides of the issue gathered outside Parliament.",
      "Supporters said the law would provide dignity to the dying and prevent unnecessary suffering, while ensuring there are enough safeguards to prevent those near the end of their lives from being coerced into taking their own life. Opponents said it would put vulnerable people at risk, potentially coerced, directly or indirectly, to end their lives so they don't become a burden.",
      "Backers of the bill told heart-wrenching stories about constituents and family members who suffered in the final months of their lives and dying people who committed suicide in secret because it is currently a crime for anyone to provide assistance.",
      "\"Let's be clear, we're not talking about a choice between life or death, we are talking about giving dying people a choice about how to die,\" the bill's main sponsor, Kim Leadbeater, said in the opening speech in a packed chamber.",
      "She conceded that it's not an easy decision for lawmakers but that \"if any of us wanted an easy life, they're in the wrong place.\"Danny Kruger, who led the argument against the bill, said he believes Parliament can do \"better\" for terminally ill people than a \"state suicide service\" and that the role of legislatures is to offer safeguards for the most vulnerable.",
      "\"We are the safeguard, this place, this Parliament, you and me,\" he said. \"We are the people who protect the most vulnerable in society from harm and yet we stand on the brink of abandoning that role.\"",
      "Those opposed spoke of the danger that vulnerable, elderly and disabled people could be coerced into opting for assisted dying to save money or relieve the burden on family members. Others called for the improvement of palliative care to ease suffering as an alternative.",
      "Danny Kruger, who led the argument against the bill, said he believes Parliament can do \"better\" for terminally ill people than a \"state suicide service\" and that the role of legislatures is to offer safeguards for the most vulnerable.",
      "\"We are the safeguard, this place, this Parliament, you and me,\" he said. \"We are the people who protect the most vulnerable in society from harm and yet we stand on the brink of abandoning that role.\"",
      "Although the bill was proposed by a member of the ruling center-left Labour Party, it was an open vote with alliances formed that bring together those who are usually political foes.",
      "At its heart, the bill would allow adults over the age of 18 who are expected to have fewer than six months to live to request and be provided with help to end their life, subject to safeguards and protections. They would have to be capable of taking the fatal drugs themselves.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has previously supported assisted dying, said the government will remain neutral and he wouldn't reveal how he would vote. Some members of his cabinet had said they would support the bill, while others were against it. Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the main opposition Conservative Party, said she would vote against it.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction. More than 500 British people have ended their lives in Switzerland, where the law allows assisted dying for nonresidents.",
      "Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves health care practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances.",

      "For nearly three decades, Jude Law has made quite a name for himself as one of Hollywood's leading actors. Throughout his career, however, he's faced a number of challenges \u2014 both personally and professionally.",
      "In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, the 51-year-old British actor \u2014 who is currently starring in the new Disney+ series, \"Star Wars: Skeleton Crew\" \u2014 opened up about the \"uncertainties\" of Hollywood and explained why he doesn't have any regrets.",
      "\"No, [I don't have regrets]. Not really. I mean, I just don't think you can spend your time looking back on life like that,\" said Law. \"You live and you learn, and part of being in a career in a creative business is that you are really learning on a daily basis because you are making different things, several different things over a short period of time with very different people, with different hopes and aspirations.\"",

      "\"One minute you can be in a low-budget indie film, the next minute you're in a tentpole kind of franchise like ['Star Wars'], and they have different demands and challenges, and you've got to be open to learning, open to failing, picking yourself up and getting on with it,\" he added.",
      "In a recent interview with GQ Magazine UK, Law opened up about his 2004 romantic comedy \"Alfie,\" calling it a \"bad move\" on his part. The film made only $35 million worldwide on a reported $60 million production budget, according to Variety.",
      "JUDE LAW CONFIRMS HE'S NOW A FATHER OF 6",
      "\"I was in a really strong position [at that time] because I\u2019d just had another [Oscar] nomination on the back of\u00a0\u2018Cold Mountain,'\" Law said. \"For\u00a0\u2018Alfie\u2019\u00a0to be the film I chose to do quite soon after that, I think was a bad move. I just felt it hadn\u2019t elevated [the material] and felt a little light, a little too cheesy. I think it was made for too much money, and I was probably paid too much money, which I underestimated at the time. I kicked myself that I\u2019d done something that was leaning into the heartthrob and the charismatic lead and it hadn\u2019t worked.\"",
      "Despite the hiccup, Law told Fox News Digital he looked on it as a learning experience.",
      "The British actor said he's learned a lot over the past three decades.\u00a0 (Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images)",
      "\"It just wasn't for my taste and the film I thought it was going to be,\" he said. \"I put undue pressure on it, or we put undue pressure on it with the budget, and you live and learn. And so, to me, the fact that it didn't make the money back shifted my career somewhat or slightly. Hindsight's sometimes a good thing, sometimes not a good thing, but it just sat in a complicated part of me, I suppose my relationship with it, but really it's more aesthetics. I mean, I love that people like it and if they like it, it just didn't quite hit the note that I hoped it would. That's all.\"",

      "\"I really got the concept I really liked,\" he told Fox News Digital of his decision to take on the role. \"I thought it was a refreshing perspective on this much-loved universe, and I love that it connected in a way to the innocent or inspired boy. I was watching the first ['Star Wars'] film in the late '70s. To take that, and make the protagonists of our story, that was just beautiful. And then they had this wonderful character for me who was complicated, contradictory, different things to different people.\"",

      "Regarding his time filming the project, Law said, \"It was a lovely experience, all in all.\"",
      "When it comes to his personal life, the actor \u2014 who's been nominated for various Oscars and Golden Globe Awards throughout his career \u2014 has made it a point to remain as private as possible.",
      "\"There\u2019s huge amounts of me that no one knows about, that I\u2019ve never given in to reveal, or have any interest in revealing,\" Law told GQ. \"And it gets frustrating sometimes, because I\u2019ve been in the public eye for nearly 30 years and I feel like there are certain perceptions that I can\u2019t really change [that] people have of me because of narratives that have been written, or rehashed stories from decades ago that are constantly poked at.

      "Dr. Marcus Collins, author of \u2018For the Culture\u2019 and marketing professor at the University of Michigan, explained why nostalgic TV shows give people comfort and appeal to modern audiences.",
      "As much as there are popular new shows popping up on streaming services almost daily, many viewers still like to tune into classic series, from the 1960s to the 2000s.",
      "According to streaming data from late October shared in The Hollywood Reporter, two of the top 10 shows streamed included \"Lost,\" which debuted 20 years ago in 2004, and \"Grey\u2019s Anatomy,\" which originally began in 2005 and is currently in its 21st season.",
      "\"The reason so many older television shows are doing so well on streaming, such as \u2018Lost,\u2019 \u2018Grey's Anatomy\u2019 and many others, is that I think there's a certain sense of nostalgia for a more innocent time, given how busy people are and how complicated the world has become,\" Rob Weiner, a pop culture librarian at Texas Tech University, told Fox News Digital.",

      "In late October, \"Lost\" and \"Grey's Anatomy\" were two of the top 10 shows watched on streaming services. (Getty Images)",
      "\"But there's also the issue of quality. A lot of these television shows from the past. Many of them still hold up,\" Weiner continued, citing series like \"M*A*S*H,\" \"The Andy Griffith Show,\" and even the animated Loony Tunes. \"People seem to want to identify with something that has that innocence to it, if you will.\"",
      "\"There's a bit of nostalgia that happens. People who go back and watch shows or rewatch shows from the past, there's also the sense of sort of reliving a time that you didn't live and you heard things about,\" Dr. Marcus Collins, author of \"For the Culture\" and marketing professor at the University of Michigan, said.",
      "Collins noted his own children have been watching '90s sitcoms like \"Family Matters\" and \"Full House,\" explaining that \"it feels like sort of teleporting back to a time where things were \u2018simpler\u2019 or where things were, like, similar but yet different. And I think that nostalgia, plus this novelty for new viewers, make these shows quite compelling, especially considering the fact that there's less scripted television available like it was, maybe 10, 15 years ago.\"",

      "Another often cited reason people are tuning into older shows is simply the volume of material available.",
      "Lara Rosales, senior writer for Tell-Tale TV, told Fox News Digital, \"We come from a TV period in which seasons lasted mostly 22 to 24 episodes, and they were longer seasons. We've got shows with, like, 10 seasons or more, and that gave viewers a bunch of episodes to choose from.\"",

      "She continued, \"Even the filler episodes, when you get holiday episodes, like Halloween, Christmas, Thanksgiving, all those episodes that sort of maybe don't drive the storyline to a certain point, but they allow viewers to get to know the characters better, to connect with them and not just give a bunch of information in a short amount of time.\"",
      "\"Nowadays we get shows, particularly on streaming services, where they have less seasons. Some shows don't even make it to a second season and they only have, like, eight to 10 episodes. So owners and writers want to put all the information out there. So there's a lot of details in a short amount of time, and that sometimes can be overwhelming, which will push viewers to revisit the series, but maybe not as often as older series that just feel like comfort, and you don't have to really be paying attention to every detail and you sort of get to unplug from reality and just enjoy the show,\" said Rosales.",

      "Weiner said the shorter, denser seasons can \"sometimes be exhausting\u2026 where you have to see every single episode.\"",
      "\"So there's something to, conceptually, I think to these older shows, whether it was an innocent time or not \u2014 these shows kind of portray more of an innocent time, and the nuclear family and things that we're all striving for in today's conflicted world. So, they provide a means of escape from their busy lives to something where they can kind of turn their brain off and just enjoy,\" he said.",
      "Classic shows are also finding new life on social media, via YouTube recaps or even TikTok, where users sometimes watch entire episodes or even movies in clips as short as one minute-long.",
      "\"The magic of TikTok in that sense is that you're scrolling through your page\u2026 and then you have a scene from a movie or a TV show that immediately catches your attention because they cut the scenes in a sense that will immediately get the audience's attention or the viewers as they're scrolling,\" Rosales said.",

      "She added, \"The themes continue to resonate even with younger generations. And I feel like a lot of the way in which TV was made and how it was edited a few years back was probably more like storytelling and not just like flashes of advertisement and just watch this and watch that.\"",
      "\"I think it's no surprise that we'd also see it in a video modality, especially considering how much content we take in through video just happens to be on different platforms, but the modality is still very much the same.

      "Renewed interest in older shows has paid off for both the streaming services and the actors, as well.",
      "Last year, the USA Network series \"Suits,\" which aired from 2011-19 (and happened to star a pre-royal marriage Meghan Markle), surged in popularity when it was added to Netflix and Peacock, reportedly reaching 45 billion streams on both platforms combined.",
      "That surge eventually led to a spinoff series, \"Suits LA,\" being announced, which is scheduled to premiere in February on NBC.",
      "\"Suits\" had nine seasons with an average of 16 episodes each, just shy of the longer seasons that experts cited as being appealing to viewers. But even those six extra episodes proved to be a huge draw, and are a potential piece of guidance as streamers and networks produce new shows.",

      "MEGHAN MARKLE'S 'SUITS' SPURS POSSIBLE SPIN-OFF: 'EVERYONE IS GLUED TO THE ROYAL REBEL STORYLINE'",
      "\"The longer the season is, the more people can get into the story,\" Rosales said. \"And I feel like viewers have sort of a fear that [if] they get into a new show, it will immediately get canceled\u2026 and they're like, \u2018Okay, I'll just wait until it's done, and binge-watch it if it gets another season.\u2019 But then that second season might not come, and they're missing [out] on a great show. So I feel like believing in the old-school formula of making more episodes and giving shows a chance to grow is definitely what they should go for. Believing that the show will get somewhere and not just immediately canceling after a first season will definitely be what helps the shows grow and give viewers that feeling that old-school shows are giving them.\"",
      "\"I think it creates a really interesting provocation for showrunners, so that, you know, do we create shows because of their fiduciary opportunity? Or do we create shows for the consumer, which lead to financial gain? I think shortcutting the content impacts the immediate bottom line [and] ultimately shortcuts the consumer,\" Collins said.",
      "The stars of these series also see personal benefit in a boost in relevancy when their shows trend on streaming networks and social media.",

And those that are alive, especially if you know that there is a particular show that they were in is doing really well on streaming, they can go to these popular culture cons and give out autographs, give speeches and be recognized for their work\u2026 And I think that that's a very fulfilling experience for the stars. They may not be getting any money from or much money from the streaming, but at least they're back in the public eye and people are interested in them and their lives,\" Weiner said.",

      "\"In a way, we're living in the \u2018Golden Age of Television\u2019 because we have so many options,\" Weiner said. \"And in another way, that's very daunting and difficult. But it also provides a way to kind of choose your own path. What do you want to be invested in? And people coming back to these old television shows from the early 2000s, \u201890s, \u201980s, \u201870s and the \u201960s\u2026 a lot of that TV was very good. And very dramatic.

      "\"That nostalgia that comes from things that are familiar but yet foreign because we haven't visited them in a while, it's very heartwarming,\" Collins said. \"Nostalgia comes from German roots and nostalgia used to be considered a disease, one that was lived in the past to something that we now consider as something nourishing, to feel nostalgic and warm and fuzzy about a thing. And that psychological pull can lead us into new spaces, leads the spaces that we've been before, and ultimately provide a ton of value for those consuming it.\""

      "\"When used long-term, laxatives can cause significant harm to your digestive system and overall health,\" he told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"Add these things on a daily basis, and I promise this will help you gently get the bad stuff out and move you into a much healthier, stronger gut state,\" he said.",
      "1. Increase fiber intake",
      "Fiber is critical to digestive health, according to Gioffre.",
      "\"When we have more fiber-rich foods, it's like brushing the inner walls of our intestines \u2014 and that's going to help us remove the constipation and get to where we want to go,\" the doctor said.",
      "Constipation affects 42 million Americans each day.",
      "Some of his suggested fiber-rich foods are quinoa, wild rice, sweet potatoes, root vegetables, and squashes like winter squash and spaghetti squash.",

      "\"When you drink this on an empty stomach, it's going to go into all the little nooks and crannies of your gut \u2026 and it's going to help you start to detoxify and gently give you that \u2018internal shower\u2019 effect.\"",
      "2. Reduce inflammation",
      "\"At the end of the day, we don't die of old age \u2014 we die of inflammation,\" Gioffre cautioned.",
      "The doctor compared the gut to a \"big, hollow tube.\"",
      "\"When it's open, you\u2019re good. When you're inflamed, not so good.\"",
      "Suggestions for fiber-rich foods include quinoa, wild rice, sweet potatoes, root vegetables, and squashes like winter squash and spaghetti squash. (iStock)",
      "Some plant-based foods that lower inflammation include chia seeds, flax seeds, hemp seeds, avocado and coconut oil.",

      "HOLIDAY GATHERINGS CAN LEAD TO STRESS EATING: TRY THESE 5 TIPS TO CONTROL IT",
      "For those who eat animal products, the doctor recommends wild-caught salmon, mackerel, trout, anchovies and sardines.",
      "He also offers a recipe for detox tea on the Alkamind website, which includes turmeric, ginger, pepper, lemon and his \"Acid-Kicking Greens.\" (His website is getoffyouracid.com.)",

      "\"Magnesium-rich powerhouses relax your intestinal muscles, soften stools and keep things moving, all while feeding your healthy gut bacteria.\" (iStock)",
      "The doctor recommends consuming magnesium-rich foods, including leafy greens like spinach, kale and chard, as well as green juice, green smoothies and green soups.",

      "A high-quality magnesium supplement can also combat this deficiency and give the body the support it needs, he added.",
      "\"You can also do an Epsom salts bath, which is magnesium sulfate,\" he added, or apply magnesium lotion to the skin.",
      "4. Stay hydrated",

      "\"Combining proper hydration with regular movement creates a powerful, drug-free strategy to support digestive health and prevent constipation.\"",

      "\"It can also increase your happiness, improve your relationships and give you a boost in mental strength that you'll likely need during the day.\"",
      "2. Don\u2019t skip breakfast",
      "It might seem wise to forgo the meal leading up to Thanksgiving, with the idea of \"making room\" for the main food event, but experts say that\u2019s not a good idea.",
      "\"When you skip breakfast or lunch, you tend to be ravenous by the time you do eat, and that sets you up for overeating as you overindulge,\" Shelley Balls, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Consumer Health Digest based in Wyoming, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Instead, she recommends eating a balanced breakfast so you feel more satisfied throughout the day.",
      "\"When Thanksgiving dinner rolls around, you'll have more control of what and how much you choose to eat.\"",
      "3. Choose foods wisely",
      "Among the many options on the Thanksgiving table, some choices are better than others.",
      "\"Have a little bit of everything (because that's tradition), but tread lightly around the charcuterie board \u2014 and when you go for seconds, cut down on the butter, cream and fats,\" advised Dr. Michael Schopis, a New York gastroenterologist.",
      "\"Some patients have trouble digesting certain carbohydrates, which can lead to excessive bloating and gas, causing pain related to functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome,\" a doctor cautioned. (iStock)",

      "\"Plan to fill half the plate with fruits and veggies and create a balance between proteins, fruits, fiber and sweets,\" she suggested to Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Also, don\u2019t be afraid to add variety. Savoring the different colors, flavors and textures will enhance the meal.\"",
      "4. Practice mindful eating",
      "\"Chew thoroughly, savor the flavors, notice the food\u2019s appearance and aroma and engage in conversation with family and friends to slow down,\" Jennifer Wilcox, a Fay dietitian based in Chicago, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Choose to speak about things you have in common and reminisce over good memories,\" an expert recommended. (iStock)",
      "\"A slower pace of eating will help improve digestion and help you recognize comfortable fullness.\"",
      "Another reason to slow down is that the faster you eat (and the less you chew), the more stomach acids have to work to break down foods, which leads to gas, bloating and reflux, Schopis added.",
      "5. Drink water with dinner",
      "This tip comes from Christine Byrne, a registered dietitian and the owner of Ruby Oak Nutrition in Raleigh, North Carolina.",
      "GIVING THANKS CAN MAKE YOU HAPPIER AND HEALTHIER, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"Keeping alcohol to a minimum will help you feel much better while you eat and afterward,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Because alcohol is a toxin, your body (particularly your liver) prioritizes breaking it down and getting it out of your system,\" she went on. \"That means digesting other food gets put on hold while the alcohol is processed.\"",
      "\"If you can, stick to water while you eat, and alternate boozy beverages with non-alcoholic ones,\" a nutritionist recommended. (iStock)",
      "As a result, you could feel uncomfortable for hours after the meal, Byrne said.",
      "\"If you can, stick to water while you eat, and alternate boozy beverages with non-alcoholic ones.\"",
      "6. Set boundaries",

      "\"Choose to speak about things you have in common and reminisce over good memories,\" Amodio recommended.",
      "Some other ideas include bringing old photo albums, playing board games and taking breaks throughout the day by stepping into another room as needed.",
      "7. Take guilt off the menu",
      "\"Remember that Thanksgiving is just one day and guilt is not a food group,\" said Elizabeth Harris, a registered dietitian in Maryland.",
      "\"Consider how you want to feel after your holiday meal and do your best to walk your choices backwards from there.\"",
      "\"Consider how you want to feel after your holiday meal and do your best to walk your choices backwards from there,\" an expert advised. (iStock)",
      "And if you miss the mark, it\u2019s not the end of the world, she noted.",
      "\"You get another chance at your very next meal to practice making feel-good choices that better support your needs.\"",
      "8. Make time to relax",
      "\"Amid the cooking, hosting and socializing, carve out small moments to recharge,\" suggested Morin.",

      "His decisive victory in November added further pressure on Merchan to dismiss the charges.",
      "Last week, Merchan granted Trump's request to file a motion to dismiss the charges, giving the president-elect's legal team until Dec. 2 to submit the motion for dismissal\u2014and giving Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and his team of prosecutors until Dec. 9 to respond.",
      "Merchan also adjourned the sentencing date for Trump from the schedule, which Trump spokesperson and incoming White House communications director Steven Cheung describing it as a \"decisive win\" for the president-elect.",
      "Still, the trial dominated news headlines throughout the 2024 campaign, including Trump's repeated characterizations that the case was politically motivated and that the presiding judge was \"corrupt.\"",
      "Federal cases in D.C., Florida",
      "Special Counsel Jack Smith moved to drop two federal cases against president-elect Donald Trump this week\u2014 acknowledging Trump's return to the White House, and long-held Justice Department policy that precludes the department from investigating a sitting president.",
      "Smith was tapped by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2022 to investigate both the alleged effort by Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election, as well as Trump's keeping of allegedly classified documents at his residence in Florida after leaving the White House in 2020.",
      "Prosecutors are guided by an Office of Legal Counsel memo first filed in 2000, which upholds a Watergate-era argument that asserts it is a violation of the\u00a0separation of powers doctrine for the Justice Department to investigate a sitting president. Such proceedings, the memo states, would \"unduly interfere in a direct or formal sense with the conduct of the Presidency.\"",
      "In their filing, Smith and his team made clear that their winding down of both cases is based solely on these protections afforded sitting presidents, rather than a reflection of the cases themselves. \"That prohibition is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government\u2019s proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Government stands fully behind,\" prosecutors said in a filing.",
      "Trump, however, took to social media to revel in the outcome. \"I persevered, against all odds, and WON,\" he said in a post on Truth Social.",
      "Supreme Court expands presidential immunity",
      "The Supreme Court ruled in July that Trump should be granted absolute immunity from prosecution for actions taken while exercising any of his \"core constitutional powers\" as president. The 6-3 decision, which split justices along party lines, expanded the notion of presidential immunity not only in Trump's case, but for past and future presidents as well.",
      "A presumption of immunity also applies to other actions taken while holding office, the justices said.",
      "Still, the decision did not specify whether a president is to be afforded the same level of constitutional protection for state convictions, however, and the matter has never been tested in court.",

It also argued that the giveaways violated consumer protection laws in Pennsylvania, citing \"deceptive\" and \"misleading\" statements Musk made about the nature of the contest.",
      "Krasner's office and Musk's attorneys sparred over whether the case should be held in federal or state court, and when the proceedings should take place (Musk lost his bid to have the case heard in federal court).",

      "Fox News national correspondent Matt Finn reports on how border officials in El Paso, Texas, are installing razor wire fencing on \u2018Special Report.\u2019",
      "In the past couple of years the Texas National Guard and state authorities have placed over 100 miles of razor wire at some of the most critical migrant crossing points along the southern border. The state, which makes up over 60 percent of the U.S. border with Mexico, has spent well over $10 million erecting and maintaining these border barriers as part of its larger multi-billion-dollar border enforcement campaign \"Operation Lonestar.\"",
      "This week, a federal appeals court ruled against the Biden administration\u2019s attempt to block Texas from continuing to place walls of razor wire \u2013 also called concertina or \"c-wire\" \u2013 along the border. This comes after U.S. Border Patrol agents under the Biden administration cut down Texas\u2019 wire on a 26-mile stretch of the border in September 2023.",
      "Earlier this year, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, said that \"Biden should be thanking Texas, not obstructing our efforts to secure the border.\"",

      "Andrew Arthur, a law and policy expert at the Center for Immigration Studies, says the answer is an emphatic \"Yes.\"",
      "He pointed to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection that shows illegal migrant encounters in Texas\u2019 five border sectors dropped by nearly two-thirds in January after the state finished placing wire.",
      "Arthur told Fox News Digital that Texas began placing wire fortifications in May 2023 after the COVID-era measure Title 42 expired. Then, after the migrant surge in December, Texas deployed additional guard personnel, state troopers and resources to the border.",
      "\"Based on the numbers that we're looking at here, it is most definitely effective,\" he said.",

      "While effective, razor wire is not without drawbacks. More than a traditional border wall, wire needs to be constantly monitored. It also requires regular upkeep and additional wire being laid down after old wire is damaged or destroyed.",
      "\"It's a temporary solution, because you're going to have to replace the concertina wire that they have and, at some point, they're not going to be able to keep sending wave after wave of troopers, because a lot of those guys are hundreds of miles from their homes, because Texas is a big state,\" he explained. \"When I was embedded with a trooper down there, he was from Abilene, which is nowhere near the border, and he had been there for six weeks.\"",

      "\"In El Paso, nearly our entire border has been fortified by layers of concertina wire, including part of our border with New Mexico,\" he explained. \"While the numbers of border deaths along the whole border appear to have gone down over the past year, in El Paso they have increased. That increase has been sharp over the past couple years and coincides with the presence of the Guard and the concertina wire, because it is forcing border crossers just to the west of the city, where they die in the desert or crossing the river.\"",
      "He called for the federal government to finally step in and \"assert its supremacy over managing migration at the border and fix our overall system.\"",
      "\"More people are dying here than ever before,\" he said. \"The longer we wait, states will continue to engage in uncoordinated and irresponsible enforcement actions on their own, unnecessarily putting lives at risk and needlessly diverting millions of dollars in taxpayer resources.\"",

She also reported that with the job as the campaign\u2019s national press secretary, she became accustomed to Trump's \"sleep schedule\" \u2013 which has famously only consisted of roughly four or five hours of rest before getting to work \u2013 and joined him at rallies across the nation and at the campaign\u2019s headquarters in Florida.",

      "President-elect Trump has promised to launch a historic mass deportation program next year. He has expressed openness to declaring a national emergency and using military assets in order to get it done. His team have already started looking at how to expand detention near major metropolitan areas.",
      "Trump's border czar, Thomas Homan, has promised that national security and public security threats will be the priority, but no illegal immigrant is off the table. The Trump administration increased deportations significantly up until 2019 before COVID-19 hit the U.S., so it is expected to move in that direction again.",
      "Trump may need to rally Congress for additional resources, a task made easier by Republican control of the House and Senate, and will need to overcome potential lawsuits filed against any policies he introduces.",
      "At the congressional level, expect a push for a sweeping bill like H.R.2, the Republican border bill passed in 2023 that would limit asylum significantly while providing additional resources at the border.",
      "Officials in multiple Democratic states have already previewed their resistance to the deportation push by the Trump administration. Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said recently he was prepared to go to jail over his opposition to Trump\u2019s deportation plan.",

      "Mexico plays a crucial role in securing the U.S.-Mexico border, with lower levels of encounters at the U.S. border often coinciding with crackdowns at Mexico\u2019s southern border.",
      "That was on display in 2024, as numbers lowered at the border after Biden administration officials met with Mexican officials in December 2023. The two countries had previously come to an agreement by which the U.S. would allow in migrants via parole programs, while Mexico would consequently accept a certain number of non-Mexican returns back from the U.S.",
      "But with President-elect Trump having promised to end those programs, the extent to which Mexico will continue to co-operate remains unclear.",

      "Now, Republicans hold the House and Senate, but by thin margins. So it is unclear if Trump will ever see a sweeping bill similar to the House Republicans' border bill that passed the chamber in 2023 come to his desk.",
      "Trump can do a great deal by executive action, but his mass deportation plan will require additional funding from Congress. The extent to which Congress acts on those requests could determine how successful that effort, along with additional security at the southern border to stop migrants from entering the U.S. in the first place, will be.",
      "",
      "While illegal immigration is in the spotlight after the historic crisis at the southern border, it will likely be a key issue in the next administration, with some keen for additional restrictions on not only the use of humanitarian parole but also visas like the H-1B visa tech worker program and the H-2A agricultural worker program.",
      "Additionally, the administration may attempt to re-implement its 2019 public charge rule, which limited legal immigrants from receiving green cards if they have used some forms of welfare and are deemed to be likely to be reliant on welfare in the future.

      "Scammers have various methods when it comes to getting their hands on your phone number. You might think, \"Well, what's the big deal? Isn't it easy to find someone's number these days, no matter what?\" Yes. And if you've already had your fair share of telemarketers call you, maybe you feel like you've got it under control.",
      "The problem is that scammers with the right knowledge and the wrong intentions can wreak havoc just by having your phone number in their possession.",
      "Once they do, they can use it to trick you in all sorts of ways.",
      "The good news is that by familiarizing yourself with their tactics, you can be one step closer to preventing yourself from falling victim to them. Here's what you need to know.",

      "9 ways you can get scammed if your phone number falls into the wrong hands",
      "In today\u2019s digital age, your phone number is more than just a way for friends and family to reach you. It can be a gateway for scammers to access your personal information and wreak havoc on your life. From\u00a0phishing attempts to extortion, the risks are numerous and varied. Here are nine ways scammers can exploit your phone number if it falls into the wrong hands:",
      "Scammers can also use your phone number to launch rather easy\u00a0phishing attacks. They might send text messages or make calls posing as your bank or a popular online service that you subscribe to. The goal is to call you and trick you into providing login credentials, credit card details or other personal information, which they can then use for fraudulent activities. And once they have all your other information, they can do a lot more damage just by having your phone number as that initial segue.",
      "In some cases, scammers use your phone number for extortion or blackmail. They may claim to have compromising information about you and demand payment to keep it private. By contacting you directly, they can apply continuous pressure, making their threats seem more real and immediate.",
      "One unique way they do this to target elderly people is by pretending to be your grandchild or another relative in distress. The scammer often claims that your grandchild is in an emergency situation \u2014 such as needing bail money or medical assistance \u2014 and urgently requests financial help. With AI voice cloning technology, they may even be able to use your grandchild's voice. This emotional manipulation usually gets the victim to pay up.",
      "This one may not be as dramatic, but your phone number can be sold to\u00a0robocall and spam message services. These automated systems bombard you with unwanted calls and texts, often promoting scams or fraudulent products. While these may seem like minor annoyances, they can lead to bigger scams if you engage with the messages or follow their instructions. Hang up on them.",
      "HOW TO STOP ANNOYING ROBOCALLS",
      "Illustration of a scammer with cash in his hand\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Phone number spoofing is a common tactic where scammers disguise their caller ID to appear as a trusted contact by calling from what appears to be a familiar number as it may have the same area code where you live, an area code where your friends or family live or even the actual phone number of someone close which you can recognize.",
      "This makes it more likely that you'll answer the call, giving them the opportunity to deceive you into revealing personal information or transferring money. This is, of course, the case when phone spoofing is used against you. But in situations where they use YOUR phone number, they can be scamming those close to you without you even knowing!",
      "With these phone spoofing tactics, scammers can use your phone number to\u00a0impersonate government officials, such as IRS agents or Social Security administrators. They may call you claiming there\u2019s an urgent issue, like unpaid taxes or suspicious activity involving your Social Security number. This ploy often involves threats of legal action or arrest to pressure you into providing sensitive information or making immediate payments.",
      "Instead of pretending to be from a government agency, another trick is for scammers to try their luck by posing as a representative from a utility company, like an electric or water company. Scammers will claim that you have an overdue invoice and threaten to cut off your service unless you pay immediately. Using your phone number, they can contact you repeatedly, making the scam seem more legitimate (and pressing).",
      "SIM swapping or a\u00a0port-out scam is when scammers transfer your phone number to a new SIM card in their possession. By convincing your mobile carrier to reroute your number, they can receive all your calls and messages, including those containing two-factor authentication codes. This allows them to bypass security measures and take over your online accounts.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "With SIM swapping techniques/port-out, scammers can also use your phone number as a key to access sensitive data stored in your online accounts. By initiating password resets and intercepting verification codes sent via SMS, they can gain unauthorized access to your email, social media and banking accounts, leading to significant personal and financial damage.",
      "Finally, scammers can use all the tactics above to not only access the accounts you already have but also create fake online accounts in your name. These accounts can be used for a variety of malicious purposes, such as spreading malware, launching further scams or conducting identity theft. The presence of your phone number makes these accounts appear more legitimate, increasing the chances of deceiving others.",

      "How to protect yourself from these scams",
      "To protect your phone number from falling into the hands of scammers, here\u2019s what you can do:",
      "1. Be cautious about sharing your phone number publicly: Avoid posting your phone number on public forums, websites or social media platforms where it can be easily accessed by scammers.",
      "2. Limit exposure of your phone number on social media and other online platforms:\u00a0Use privacy settings to restrict who can see your contact information. Most social media platforms and online services offer privacy settings that allow you to control who can view your personal information. Make sure to review and adjust these settings regularly. Only share your phone number with trusted contacts.",
      "3. Consider using a secondary number for online registrations and transactions:\u00a0Services like Google Voice can provide you with a secondary number that you can use for online activities, keeping your primary number private.",
      "4. Monitor your accounts regularly for unusual activity: Check your bank accounts, email and other online accounts for any signs of unauthorized access or suspicious activity.",
      "5. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Use two-factor authentication apps instead of SMS-based verification where possible:\u00a0Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides an extra layer of security that is more difficult for scammers to bypass compared to SMS-based verification.",
      "7. Use an identity theft protection service: Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "8. Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with the information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Contact your mobile carrier to alert them of the scam calls, especially if they come from the same number. Your carrier may be able to block the number or provide additional security measures.",
      "Consider changing your phone number if the issue persists: If scam calls continue despite your efforts, changing your phone number may be the best solution.",
      "Report any suspicious activity to the appropriate authorities:\u00a0Contact your local law enforcement or consumer protection agency to report scams and seek advice on further actions.",
      "Consider placing fraud alerts on your accounts:\u00a0Fraud alerts can help protect your credit and financial accounts from unauthorized access.",
      "Monitor your phone for unusual calls or messages: Keep an eye out for any unexpected calls or messages, and do not respond to them.",
      "Check your phone bill for unauthorized charges:\u00a0Regularly review your phone bill to ensure there are no unexpected charges, which could indicate that your number has been used fraudulently.",

      "Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier has the latest on regulatory uncertainty amid AI development on 'Special Report.'",
      "An increasing number of companies are using artificial intelligence (AI) for everyday tasks.\u00a0Much of the technology is helping with productivity and keeping the public safer. However, some industries are pushing back against certain aspects of AI. And some industry leaders are working to balance the good and the bad.",
      "\"We are looking at critical infrastructure owners and operators, businesses from water and health care and transportation and communication, some of which are starting to integrate some of these AI capabilities,\" said U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly. \"We want to make sure that they're integrating them in a way where they are not introducing a lot of new risk.\"",
      "US AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY TESTS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: 'A LOT OF POTENTIAL'",
      "Consulting firm Deloitte recently surveyed leaders of business organizations from around the world. The findings showed uncertainty over government regulations was a bigger issue than actually implementing AI technology. When asked about the top barrier to deploying AI tools, 36% ranked regulatory compliance first, 30% said difficulty managing risks, and 29% said lack of a governance model.",
      "Easterly says despite some of the risks AI can pose, she said she is not surprised that the government has not taken more steps to regulate the technology.",
      "\"These are going to be the most powerful technologies of our century, probably more,\" Easterly said. \"Most of these technologies are being built by private companies that are incentivized to provide returns for their shareholders. So we do need to ensure that government has a role in establishing safeguards to ensure that these technologies are being built in a way that prioritizes security. And that's where I think that Congress can have a role in ensuring that these technologies are as safe and secure to be used and implemented by the American people.\"",
      "An increasing number of companies are using AI for everyday tasks. (iStock)",
      "Congress has considered overarching protections for AI, but it has mostly been state governments enacting the rules.",
      "\"There are certainly many things that are positive about what AI does. It also, when fallen into the hands of bad actors, it can destroy [the music] industry,\" said Gov. Bill Lee, R-Tenn., while signing state legislation in March to protect musicians from AI.",
      "The Ensuring Likeness Voice and Image Security Act, or ELVIS Act, classifies vocal likeness as a property right. Lee signed the legislation this year, making Tennessee the first state to enact protections for singers. Illinois and California have since passed similar laws. Other states, including Tennessee, have laws that determine names, photographs and likenesses are also considered a property right.",
      "\"Our voices and likenesses are indelible parts of us that have enabled us to showcase our talents and grow our audiences, not mere digital kibble for a machine to duplicate without consent,\" country recording artist Lainey Wilson said during a congressional hearing on AI and intellectual property.",

      "Wilson argued her image and likeness were used through AI to sell products that she had not previously endorsed.",
      "\"For decades, we have taken advantage of technology that, frankly, was not created to be secure. It was created for speed to market or cool features. And frankly, that's why we have cybersecurity,\" Easterly said.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has cracked down on some deceptive AI marketing techniques. It launched \"Operation AI Comply\" in September, which tackles unfair and deceptive business practices using AI, such as fake reviews written by chatbots.",
      "\"I am a technologist at heart, and I am an optimist at heart. And so I am incredibly excited about some of these capabilities. And I am not concerned about some of the Skynet things. I do want to make sure that this technology is designed and developed and tested and delivered in a way to ensure that security is prioritized,\" Easterly said.",
      "A close-up of the icon of the ChatGPT artificial intelligence chatbot app logo on a cellphone screen.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Chatbots have had some good reviews. Hawaii approved a law this year to invest more in research utilizing AI tools in the health care field. It comes as one study finds, OpenAI\u2019s chatbot outperformed doctors in diagnosing medical conditions. The experiment compared doctors using ChatGPT with those using conventional resources. Both groups scored around 75% accuracy, while the chatbot alone scored above 90%.",
      "AI isn\u2019t just being used for disease detection, it\u2019s also helping emergency crews detect catastrophic events. After deadly wildfires devastated Maui, Hawaii state lawmakers also allocated funds to the University of Hawaii to map statewide wildfire risks and improve forecasting technologies. It also includes $1 million for an AI-driven platform. Hawaiian Electric is also deploying high-resolution cameras across the state.",

      "California and Colorado have similar technology. Within minutes, the AI can detect when a fire begins and where it may spread.",
      "AI is also being used to keep students safe. Several school districts around the country now have firearm detection systems. One in Utah notifies officials within seconds of when a gun might be on campus.",

Maryland\u2019s commission will determine whether to use school construction funding to build the systems. Massachusetts members will look at risks associated with the new technology.",
      "\"We want to use these capabilities to ensure that we can better defend the critical infrastructure that Americans rely on every hour of every day,\" Easterly said.",
      "The European Union passed regulations for AI this year. It ranks risks from minimal, which have no regulations, to unacceptable, which are banned. Chatbots are classified as specific transparency and are required to inform users they are interacting with a machine.

This massive thermokarst depression \u2013 a fancy term for a giant permafrost-thaw sinkhole \u2013 is growing at an astonishing rate of 35 million cubic feet each year. To put that into perspective, it's like carving out a small town's worth of earth annually. Currently stretching about 0.6 miles long and 0.5 miles wide at its widest point, this behemoth shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, it's speeding up, driven by a vicious cycle of warming temperatures and melting ice. This study was published in the\u00a0journal Geomorphology.",

      "Despite its name, permafrost isn't actually permanent. It's ground that's remained at or below freezing for at least two years. When this frozen soil thaws, it can't support the weight above it, leading to collapse and the formation of these massive \"slumps.\" The Batagaika crater is a prime example of this process in overdrive. As the permafrost melts, it exposes more soil to sunlight, which then melts more permafrost. It's a feedback loop that's difficult to break, especially in our warming world.",

The steep walls of this mega-slump reveal permafrost layers estimated to be 650,000 years old. That's older than our species. But with ancient ice comes ancient dangers. Scientists have already revived a 48,500-year-old \"zombie virus\" from Arctic permafrost, and there's concern about what other long-dormant pathogens might be awakening. It's not just a plot from some sci-fi movie anymore. It's a real consideration for modern science and medicine.",

According to recent studies, this single mega-slump is responsible for releasing 4,000 to 5,000 tons of organic carbon every year. That's equivalent to the annual emissions of about 1,000 cars. This release of carbon, previously locked away in the frozen ground, further contributes to global warming, potentially accelerating the very process that created the crater in the first place.",

As our planet continues to warm, more of these massive permafrost thaw features are likely to appear. While some might see the crater as a tourist attraction \u2013 and indeed it has become one \u2013 it's crucial to recognize it as a warning sign. The \"Gateway to Hell\" is more than just a catchy nickname; it's a portal into a possible future where rapid environmental changes reshape our world in ways we're only beginning to understand. The question remains: Will we heed the warning signs and take action, or will we continue to watch as more gateways open across our warming world?",

      "1. Watch out for red flags:\u00a0Some telltale signs of an impersonation scam include requests for account or payment information and creating a false sense of urgency. Amazon will never ask for your password, payment or bank transfer through phone, email or any external website. Scammers might reference a purchase (real or fake), a giveaway, a prize or claim that \"your account is locked,\" urging you to click a link, make a payment or buy a gift card.",
      "2. Verify the email: For any questions related to an order, always check your order history on Amazon.com or via the \"Amazon Shopping\" app. Only legitimate purchases will appear in your order history. If you are ever unsure about the legitimacy of an email, go to Amazon\u2019s website or app to access the Message Center and review authentic communications.",
      "In addition, you should always check the sender\u2019s email address by hovering over the \"From\" name and verify it\u2019s a genuine Amazon email, which will come from \"@amazon.com.\"",

      "3. Beware of phishing links: Avoid clicking on random links, especially in messages about shopping deals, order confirmations or account issues. Scammers often use fake links to mimic legitimate retailers and steal your information.",

      "Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Don\u2019t fall for \"too good to be true\" offers: Scammers often lure victims with irresistible deals, such as huge discounts on popular products or \"exclusive\" offers. If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is. These offers might be tied to fake websites or phishing attempts designed to steal your personal and financial details. Always double-check the legitimacy of any deal before making a purchase. If you\u2019re unsure, visit the official Amazon site or app to search for the product and compare prices.",
      "5. Use a personal data removal service: Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams during the busy holiday season.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6. Report suspicious activity: If you encounter an impersonation scam, your best course of action is to report it to Amazon. Knapp says,\u00a0\"The more consumers report scams to us, the better our tools get at identifying bad actors so that we can take action against them and protect consumers. If consumers suspect that they have encountered a scam, they can report suspicious communications to us at amazon.com/ReportAScam, so that we can protect their accounts and refer bad actors to law enforcement to help keep consumers safe.\"",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers will do their best to ruin your holiday season, but most of their tactics can be easily avoided with the right tools and a little common sense. Be cautious of unsolicited texts, emails or phone calls offering deals, discounts or asking for your personal information. If you're shopping on Amazon, track everything through the Amazon app and reach out to their customer support for any concerns or questions.",

      "Many of us use Spotify every day, whether to listen to songs, podcasts or audiobooks. Some of us create playlists of our favorite songs, while others save playlists made by others.",
      "In case you didn\u2019t know, Spotify allows you to create public playlists that anyone can save and listen to. You\u2019d think this is a harmless feature, but spammers have found a way to misuse it.",

      "How the Spotify scam works",
      "As reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer, this scam works by misusing Spotify\u2019s popularity and trustworthiness. Scammers exploit Spotify playlists by injecting targeted keywords, such as \"free download,\" \"crack\" or \"warez,\" into titles and descriptions.",
      "These keywords are designed to align with popular search terms. Since Spotify\u2019s web player pages are indexed by search engines like Google, these spammy results appear in user searches, driving traffic to their links. For example, a Spotify playlist titled \"Sony Vegas Pro 13 Crack\u2026\" was found promoting \"free\" software sites in its title and description, directing users to questionable external links.",
      "The scam isn\u2019t limited to playlists. It extends to podcasts as well. Scammers create podcasts with multiple short episodes, typically under 20 seconds, using synthesized speech to direct listeners to click links in the description for free content. These podcasts often target users searching for pirated ebooks, audiobooks or game cheats. While the content may appear legitimate at first glance, clicking on the links often results in being redirected to unsafe pages that further exploit users.",

      "4.3 MILLION AMERICANS EXPOSED IN MASSIVE HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT DATA BREACH",
      "The end goal",
      "The main goal of this scam is to use Spotify\u2019s trusted reputation and search engine visibility to get people to click on shady links and visit sketchy websites. Scammers make money through fake ad clicks, bogus surveys and affiliate links, while also spreading malware by tricking users into downloading harmful software or extensions.",
      "They also try to steal personal info through fake sign-up forms or phishing pages, which can lead to identity theft or be sold to others. By using Spotify\u2019s indexed pages, they boost the search rankings of their spam sites, reaching more people. Some of these sites even run extra scams like fake crypto giveaways or phishing attempts to grab even more money or data from unsuspecting users.",

      "1. Avoid clicking on suspicious links: Be cautious when you come across playlists or podcasts with titles like \"Sony Vegas Pro 13 Crack\" or other promises of free software, audiobooks or game cheats. These often include links in the description that redirect to unsafe sites hosting malware, adware or phishing pages.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "2. Stick to official sources: Always download software, eBooks or other digital content from trusted official websites or reputable platforms. If you see a Spotify playlist or podcast offering \"free\" versions of paid content, it\u2019s likely a scam. Cross-check the legitimacy of the content through known channels instead of relying on unverified links.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords: Create complex and unique passwords for your Spotify account and avoid using personal information like birthdays or pet names. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Be skeptical of synthesized speech and short episodes: Many scam podcasts feature short episodes (10-20 seconds) with synthesized speech directing you to click on a link in the description. These are a common tactic used to trick users into visiting unsafe pages. If the content feels automated, vague or overly promotional, it\u2019s best to avoid it.",
      "5. Verify curator credentials: Check the credentials of playlist curators. Legitimate curators usually have a verifiable online presence. If you can't find any information about them, it's best to avoid engaging with them.",
      "6. Recognize phishing attempts: Be cautious of emails claiming to be from Spotify that ask you to confirm account details or click on suspicious links. These are often phishing attempts designed to steal your credentials.",
      "7. Report and block suspicious content: If you come across playlists or podcasts that seem fraudulent or inappropriate,\u00a0report them directly to Spotify. Use Spotify\u2019s reporting tools to flag content that violates its platform rules. Blocking suspicious accounts or playlists also ensures you won\u2019t accidentally interact with them in the future, and reporting helps Spotify improve its filtering and moderation systems.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers will use any means possible to trick you. In the past, we\u2019ve seen bad actors weaponize\u00a0Google search results with malicious websites that install malware when links are clicked on. There have also been plenty of\u00a0SEO scams targeting users. Companies like Spotify need to implement measures to prevent their platforms from being misused by scammers. Google also has a responsibility to ensure the quality of its search results. Just because a webpage comes from a well-known organization doesn\u2019t mean it deserves to rank highly on the search results pages.",

      "One of the latest gift card tricks involves tampering with the gift cards on the display racks at retail stores. Scammers will record the activation code on the card or place a custom barcode sticker over the real barcode, which allows them to secretly load the cash onto their own card immediately after you purchase the gift card. This means that when you or your recipient try to use the gift card, it will be empty or invalid.",
      "Check the packaging of the gift card before buying it. Look for signs of tampering, such as the wrapping being torn or resealed or stickers placed over the barcode or card number.

      "Another common gift card trick scammers use involves impersonating someone you know or trust, such as a family member, a romantic interest, a company or the government. Scammers will contact you by phone, text, email or social media and create a fake story or emergency that requires you to send them money urgently.",
      "They will ask you to buy a gift card or multiple gift cards and then send them a photo of the card or the numbers on the back of the card. Once they have the gift card information, they will disappear with your money and cut off contact.",

      "A very popular gift card trick this holiday season\u00a0involves phishing, which is a type of online fraud that tries to trick you into revealing your personal or financial information. Scammers will send you an email, text or pop-up message that looks like it comes from a legitimate company, such as a retailer, bank or\u00a0tech support service.",
      "They will claim that there is a problem with your account, your order, your device or your security and that you need to verify your identity, update your information or fix an issue. They will then ask you to click on a link, open an attachment or call a number and then request that you pay them with a gift card or provide them with your gift card information.",
      "Never click on links, open attachments or call numbers from unsolicited messages, as they may lead to fake or malicious websites or software. Don\u2019t provide any personal or financial information, such as your passwords, PINs, account numbers or gift card numbers, to anyone who contacts you unexpectedly.",
      "Don\u2019t trust messages that create a sense of urgency, pressure or fear, as they are designed to make you act without thinking. If you have any doubts about the legitimacy of a message, contact the company directly using a verified website, phone number or email address.",
      "Using antivirus protection will help to protect you against scammers and hackers who try to steal your money and personal information using gift card tricks, especially\u00a0through phishing. The best way to protect yourself from clicking on any malicious links, fake websites, phishing emails and text messages is to have strong\u00a0antivirus protection installed and actively running on all your devices.

      "This gift card trick involves loyalty programs, which are rewards programs that offer you points, discounts or freebies for being a loyal customer. Scammers will pretend to be representatives of a loyalty program that you are a member of or that you are eligible to join.",

      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Be wary of any unsolicited offers or notifications that claim that you have won something, especially if you don\u2019t remember entering or signing up for anything. Don\u2019t pay any money or fees to receive a prize, as legitimate loyalty programs will never ask you to do that. Don\u2019t provide any personal or financial information, such as your passwords, account numbers or gift card numbers, to anyone who contacts you unexpectedly.",
      "Don\u2019t trust messages that create a sense of excitement, curiosity or greed, as they are designed to make you act impulsively. If you have any doubts about the legitimacy of a message, contact the loyalty program directly using a verified website, phone number or email address.",

Victims are lured into providing their gift card numbers and PINs under the guise of verifying their balance. Once the information is entered, scammers can drain the funds from the card almost immediately.",
      "To avoid this scam, always use official websites or apps from reputable retailers to check your gift card balance. Be wary of unsolicited calls or messages asking for your gift card information, especially if they claim to be from a legitimate company.

    "story": [
      "Kurt Knutsson explains how to safeguard retirement accounts from cyber threats with a VPN: encryption, anonymity, secure access.",
      "Protecting your financial future goes beyond smart investing and saving. It's crucial to safeguard your retirement accounts from cyber threats. While many believe that using\u00a0public Wi-Fi to check their 401(k) or IRA is harmless, the reality is that without proper protection, you could be putting your hard-earned savings at risk. Let's explore why using a VPN (virtual private network) is essential for securing your retirement accounts and how you can implement this extra layer of security.",

      "A woman using a VPN on her tablet (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms: IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from their server network, effectively preventing websites and cyber criminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cellphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Understanding the risks",
      "When you access your retirement accounts online, especially through public Wi-Fi networks, you're potentially exposing sensitive financial information to cybercriminals. These hackers can intercept your data, steal your login credentials and potentially drain your accounts. What's more concerning is that retirement accounts are often less frequently monitored than regular bank accounts, making them an attractive target for cybercriminals.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cellphone and a laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST ANTIVIRUS FOR PCS, MACS, IPHONES AND ANDROIDS \u2013 CYBERGUY PICKS",
      "Why a VPN is crucial for protecting your retirement accounts",
      "By creating an encrypted tunnel for your internet traffic, a VPN makes it extremely difficult for hackers to intercept your sensitive data. Here's a deeper look at why VPNs are indispensable for safeguarding your retirement accounts:",
      "VPNs employ military-grade encryption protocols, such as AES-256, to scramble your data. This means that even if a cybercriminal manages to intercept your information, it would appear as an indecipherable jumble of characters. For your retirement accounts, this translates to an extra layer of security for your login credentials, account numbers and financial transactions.",
      "By masking your IP address and replacing it with one from their servers, VPNs make it significantly harder for malicious actors to track your online activities. This anonymity is crucial when accessing financial accounts, as it prevents cybercriminals from identifying you as a high-value target based on your browsing habits or the financial institutions you visit online.",
      "The ability to check your accounts while traveling or using\u00a0public Wi-Fi is convenient but risky. A VPN provides a secure connection, essentially creating a protected tunnel between your device and the financial institution's servers. This is particularly important for retirement accounts, which may not have the same level of fraud protection as checking or savings accounts.\u00a0However, check if your retirement fund platform permits VPN usage, as some might flag it as unusual activity.",
      "VPNs are excellent safeguards against man-in-the-middle attacks, where hackers position themselves between you and the website you're trying to access. By encrypting your data from end to end, VPNs make it nearly impossible for attackers to insert themselves into your connection and steal your information.",
      "If you're traveling abroad and need to access your U.S.-based retirement accounts, some financial institutions may block access from foreign IP addresses. A VPN allows you to connect through a U.S.-based server, ensuring you can manage your accounts securely from anywhere in the world.",

      "7) Be wary of phishing attempts: Don't click on suspicious links or provide personal information in response to unsolicited emails.

    "summary": "Brazil&apos;s Federal Police in November formally accused former President Jair Bolsonaro and more than 30 other people of attempting a coup to keep him in office.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Brazil's Federal Police in late November formally accused far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro and 36 others of planning a coup to keep him in office. The agency described a multistep scheme, substantiated by evidence and testimony, in an 884-page report.",
      "The plan included systematically sowing distrust of the electoral system among the populace, drafting a decree to give the plot a veneer of legal basis, pressuring top military brass to go along with the plan, and inciting a riot in the capital.",
      "CONSERVATIVE BRAZILIANS LAUD ELON MUSK AT RALLY IN SUPPORT OF BOLSONARO",
      "Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet will now decide whether to formally charge the accused parties, toss the investigation or request more testimony to understand each person\u2019s participation in different parts of the alleged plot before deciding who stands trial on which counts. Bolsonaro and his main allies have denied any wrongdoing or involvement and accuse the authorities of political persecution.",
      "Former President Jair Bolsonaro arrives to speak with the press after being formally charged by the federal police with attempted coup, at the airport in Brasilia, Brazil, Monday, Nov. 25, 2024.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Eraldo Peres)",
      "Here is a breakdown of the plan's key elements as laid out in the report and how they are supposedly connected.",
      "Sowing doubt about Brazil\u2019s voting system",
      "Police allege that efforts to disseminate fake news about Brazil\u2019s electronic voting system began in 2019, Bolsonaro\u2019s first year in office, but were conducted more strategically and intensively as his 2022 reelection bid drew near.",
      "Police say so-called \"digital militias\" comprised of thousands of social media accounts linked to pro-Bolsonaro propaganda, as well as other prominent right-wing influencers and politicians, spread propaganda claiming the voting system could be tampered with. Bolsonaro also openly expressed admiration for Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship (1964-1985), which he claimed saved the country from communism.",
      "The narrative of an impending illegitimate election defeat helped Bolsonaro rally tens of thousands of supporters to multiple street demonstrations and also muster many to set up camp outside military barracks and headquarters to pressure leaders.",
      "Three months before the election, Bolsonaro invited dozens of diplomats to the presidential palace for a nationally televised meeting in which he presented supposed vulnerabilities of the voting system, without providing any evidence.",
      "Following Bolsonaro\u2019s loss in 2022 to leftist Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Bolsonaro's Liberal Party questioned results at the country's top electoral court, arguing voting devices made in specific years could have permitted fraud. The electoral court swiftly dismissed the claims.",
      "\"They spread false studies on the vulnerabilities of the electronic voting machines through the Liberal Party, in an attempt to create a factual basis for a presidential decree\" that would set the coup in motion, the report says.",
      "A draft decree to set the coup in motion",
      "In January 2023, Brazilian police found a draft decree in the home of Bolsonaro\u2019s former justice minister Anderson Torres. It was one of many versions drafted either at the far-right leader's behest or with his knowledge, police say. The former president presented the document, unsigned, to the commanders of the three divisions of the armed forces on Dec. 7, seeking their support.",
      "Investigators say the draft decree shows Bolsonaro and his allies sought to create a committee to probe alleged fraud and crimes in the October 2022 vote, so they could later suspend the powers of the nation\u2019s top electoral court and possibly convene a new election.",
      "The navy\u2019s commander was ready to comply with the decree, but army and air force leaders objected to any plan that would prevent Lula's inauguration, the report said. Those refusals are why the plan did not go ahead, according to witnesses who spoke to investigators.",
      "Many legal experts including say evidence that former president presented the draft to military leaders and supported for different versions of the document are very damaging.",
      "\"(The goal) was to unduly intervene in elections,\" said Luiz Henrique Machado, a law professor at the IDP university in the capital Brasilia. \"In Brazil, it is the electoral prosecutors' office and the top electoral court that have the final word about electoral legislation.\"",
      "In an interview with website UOL published Thursday, Bolsonaro said he discussed with military leaders moves including decreeing a state of emergency and other exceptional measures that would have suspended the rule of law for the public good. He said such measures are provided for by the constitution, so there is nothing unseemly about evaluating those options.",
      "\"What is being said is absurd. For my part, there has never been any discussion of a coup,\" Bolsonaro told journalists in Brasilia on Monday.",
      "Plan to assassinate the president-elect",
      "On Nov. 19, Brazil's Federal Police arrested four army special operations officers and a federal police officer accused of plotting in 2022 to assassinate Lula, vice-president-elect Geraldo Alckmin and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. The arrested men were all mentioned in a police report that was unsealed later.",
      "The assassination plan sought to leave Bolsonaro's ticket as the only remaining valid one in the 2022 runoff, police say. As for de Moraes, he led a five-year probe into fake news and threats against Supreme Court justices, which has led some far-right allies and supporters being barred from social media and even imprisoned. In early 2023, he presided over the nation\u2019s top electoral court when it declared Bolsonaro ineligible for office until 2030 over abuse of power related to a meeting he convened with foreign ambassadors to spread lies about the voting system.",
      "Gen. Walter Braga Netto, Bolsonaro\u2019s 2022 running mate and former defense minister, greenlit the assassination plan at a meeting with the plotters inside his home, investigators added. Federal Police portray the retired general as one of the plot's leaders, also involved in pressuring military leaders to sign onto the coup.",
      "Braga Netto said in a statement on Tuesday that he never plotted a coup. He added that several of the documents seized from one of his aides, including \"writings, drafts and media reports\" were \"preparatory material to answer media requests and to prepare for testimony in congressional hearings.\"",
      "The police report contains no indication that any attempt to assassinate Lula or Alckmin was put into motion. However, investigators found messages and documents indicating that the plotters were monitoring and following de Moraes at the time.",
      "Police said they found evidence that retired Brig. Gen. M\u00e1rio Fernandes, one of the officers arrested who had been serving as interim general secretary of the presidency, also visited the protest camps outside military installations, including at the army headquarters in Brasilia. Investigators said they have evidence that he gave instructions and financial support to the protesters.",
      "Jan. 8 uprising",
      "Federal Police linked Bolsonaro and some of his top ministers to the Jan. 8, 2023 riot in which supporters of the former president, many of whom had been camped outside army headquarters for months, ransacked the Supreme Court, Congress and presidential palace in Brasilia.",
      "The protesters had pleaded for the armed forces to keep the leftist leader out of office and their uprising \u2014 which came after Lula was sworn in \u2014 was an attempt to force military intervention and oust the new president, police say.",
      "The riot appears in the report as one of several \"other actions to pressure the army commander to join the coup d\u2019etat.\" Police also say that Brig. Gen. Fernandes sent a message in November 2022 to Gen. Marco Ant\u00f4nio Freire Gomes, then the Army's commander, discussing the need for a \"triggering event\" for a coup.",
      "Defendants, including Bolsonaro, have argued that the riot was an isolated event, and many legal experts have noted that the report's evidence of a connection between it and a broader plot is tenuous.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"It is clear that the alleged coup plotters had contacts with people camped outside military barracks, people who were there on Jan. 8. But how much of that contact was transformed into planning, coordination, stimulus for those people to take public buildings that day? That is to be debated, it is going to be discussed in the process and the collection of more evidence,\" said Jo\u00e3o Pedro P\u00e1dua, a professor of criminal law proceedings at the Universidade Federal Fluminense in Rio de Janeiro.",
      "Bolsonaro left for the United States days before Lula\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 1, 2023 and stayed there three months, keeping a low profile. The police report alleges he was avoiding possible imprisonment related to the coup plot and awaiting the fallout from the uprising."

      "Gorinov was first convicted in July 2022, when a Moscow court sentenced him to seven years in prison for \"spreading false information\" about the Russian army at a municipal council meeting.

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Ireland is voting Friday in a parliamentary election that will decide the next government \u2014 and will show whether Ireland bucks the global trend of incumbents being ousted by disgruntled voters after years of pandemic, international instability and cost-of-living pressures.",
      "Polls opened at 7 a.m.. (0700GMT), and Ireland\u2019s 3.8 million voters are selecting 174 lawmakers to sit in the Dail, the lower house of parliament.",
      "2,000-YEAR-OLD FIG UNEARTHED IN IRELAND MARKS \u2018OLDEST EXAMPLE OF AN EXOTIC FRUIT\u2019 DISCOVERED IN THE AREA",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the parties, the issues and the likely outcome.",
      "Who\u2019s running?",
      "The outgoing government was led by the two parties who have dominated Irish politics for the past century: Fine Gael and Fianna Fail. They have similar center-right policies but are longtime rivals with origins on opposing sides of Ireland\u2019s 1920s civil war.",
      "After the 2020 election ended in a virtual dead heat they formed a coalition, agreeing to share Cabinet posts and take turns as taoiseach, or prime minister. Fianna Fail leader Miche\u00e1l Martin served as premier for the first half of the term and was replaced by Fine Gael\u2019s Leo Varadkar in December 2022. Varadkar unexpectedly stepped down in March, passing the job to current Taoiseach Simon Harris.",
      "Opposition party Sinn Fein achieved a stunning breakthrough in the 2020 election, topping the popular vote, but was shut out of government because Fianna Fail and Fine Gael refused to work with it, citing its leftist policies and historic ties with militant group the Irish Republican Army during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland.",
      "Under Ireland\u2019s system of proportional representation, each of the 43 constituencies elects multiple lawmakers, with voters ranking their preferences. That makes it relatively easy for smaller parties and independent candidates with a strong local following to gain seats.",
      "Presiding officer Caroline Sharkey and Garda Ronan Steede look after a ballot box that is taken by boat to the Island of Gola as voters go to polls the for the 2024 General Election in Ireland, Friday, Nov. 29, 2024. (AP Photo/Peter Morrison)",
      "This election includes a large crop of independent candidates, ranging from local campaigners to far-right activists and reputed crime boss Gerry \"the Monk\" Hutch.",
      "What are the main issues?",
      "As in many other countries, the cost of living \u2014 especially housing \u2014 has dominated the campaign. Ireland has an acute housing shortage, the legacy of failing to build enough new homes during the country\u2019s \"Celtic Tiger\" boom years and the economic slump that followed the 2008 global financial crisis.",
      "\"There was not building during the crisis, and when the crisis receded, offices and hotels were built first,\" said John-Mark McCafferty, chief executive of housing and homelessness charity Threshold.",
      "The result is soaring house prices, rising rents and growing homelessness.",
      "After a decade of economic growth, McCafferty said \"Ireland has resources\" \u2014 not least 13 billion euros ($13.6 billion) in back taxes the European Union has ordered Apple to pay it \u2014 \"but it is trying to address big historic infrastructural deficits.\"",
      "Tangled up with the housing issue is immigration, a fairly recent challenge to a country long defined by emigration. Recent arrivals include more than 100,000 Ukrainians displaced by war and thousands of people fleeing poverty and conflict in the Middle East and Africa.",
      "This country of 5.4 million has struggled to house all the asylum-seekers, leading to tent camps and makeshift accommodation centers that have attracted tension and protests. A stabbing attack on children outside a Dublin school a year ago, in which an Algerian man has been charged, sparked the worst rioting Ireland had seen in decades.",
      "Unlike many European countries, Ireland does not have a significant far-right party, but far-right voices on social media seek to drum up hostility to migrants, and anti-immigrant independent candidates are hoping for election in several districts. The issue appears to be hitting support for Sinn Fein, as working-class supporters bristled at its pro-immigration policies.",
      "What\u2019s the likely outcome?",
      "Opinion polls suggest voters\u2019 support is split into five roughly even chunks \u2014 for Fine Gael, Fianna Fail, Sinn Fein, several smaller parties and an assortment of independents.",
      "Fine Gael has run a gaffe-prone campaign, Fianna Fail has remained steady in the polls and Sinn Fein says it has momentum, but is unlikely to win power unless the other parties drop their opposition to working with it.",
      "Analysts say the most likely outcome is another Fine Gael-Fianna Fail coalition, possibly with a smaller party or a clutch of independents as kingmakers.",
      "\"It\u2019s just a question of which minor group is going to be the group that supports the government this time,\" said Eoin O\u2019Malley, a political scientist at Dublin City University. \"Coalition-forming is about putting a hue on what is essentially the same middle-of-the-road government every time.\"",
      "When will we know the results?",
      "Polls close Friday at 10 p.m. (2200GMT), when an exit poll will give the first hints about the result. Counting ballots begins on Saturday morning. Full results could take several days, and forming a government days or weeks after that.",

      "Harris, who cast his vote in Delgany, south of Dublin, said Irish voters and politicians have \"got a long few days ahead of us.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 10:08:30 -0500",
    "summary": "After 14 months of war between Israel and Hezbollah, a cease-fire went into effect this week amid allegations that the truce happened due to pressure put on Israel despite denials from the administration.",
    "story": [
      "Amos Hochstein, special presidential coordinator for Global Infrastructure and Energy Security, says the Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire agreement is comprehensive on 'Your World.'",
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 Amid the start of a cease-fire on Wednesday between Israel and the Iranian regime-backed Hezbollah terrorist movement in Lebanon, some leading Republican lawmakers accused President Biden of browbeating Israel into a temporary suspension of the war as the Jewish state staged a near-takedown of the terror group's leadership and military structure.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reached the Litani River in Lebanon on Tuesday. A key war goal for the IDF is to push Hezbollah forces north of the Litani River. Under the\u00a0cease-fire deal, Hezbollah is required to move its forces north of the Litani, which in some places is about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the border.",
      "Yet, the reported threat of Biden imposing a weapons embargo on Israel pulled the plug on Israel\u2019s penetration of Hezbollah-controlled territory in southern Lebanon, according to regional experts and several lawmakers.",

      "\"The cease-fire agreement does not diminish what Israel managed to achieve in short order against Hezbollah. Within two months, it dismantled its infrastructure along the border, decapitated its entire senior command structure, destroyed a large percentage of its arsenal, and killed and injured thousands of its fighters,\" Tony Badran Levant, analyst and news editor at Tablet Magazine, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Describing the move by former officials from the Obama administration who now work in the Biden administration, he said, \"What the Obama-Biden team did on their way out was to coerce the Israelis, reportedly with the threat of an arms embargo at the Security Council, into signing onto Obama\u2019s vision for the U.S. role in Lebanon, which is part of his broader pro-Iran realignment. This is the downside of the agreement: it consolidates this Obama framework that should have been dismantled \u2014 and that\u2019s separate from the tactical and strategic gains that Israel achieved on the battlefield. Rather, this pertains to U.S. policy and how the Obama-Biden team used Israel to lock in their regional preferences.\"",
      "He continued, \"The deal puts the incoming Trump administration and the Israelis in a weird situation, not just because it saddles the new administration with Obama\u2019s preferences in Lebanon \u2014 including hundreds of millions in additional aid to the Lebanese Armed Forces \u2014 but also it makes the U.S. an arbiter for Israeli action against Hezbollah moving forward and the possibility for friction that may create between the Trump administration and Israel.",
      "U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein speaks during a press conference after meeting with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri in Beirut on March 4. (Reuters/Mohamed Azakir/File Photo)",
      "\"Meanwhile, the Obama-Biden team have set their structure in place. If the incoming administration keeps it, that would be great for the Democrats, who will pick it up on the other end and expand on it. In any case, they have a document \u2014 a bilateral side agreement \u2014 that will be there for a future Democratic administration,\" he warned.",
      "Amos Hochstein, the presidential envoy who brokered the deal, told Israel's Channel 12 evening news anchor Yonit Levi that he had informed President-elect Trump's team about the tenets of the deal \"because it's very important for them to understand and support it, because they are going to have to carry it forward and implement as they took office in just a few weeks.\"",
      "Echoing Badran's warning, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas., noted in a statement that \"I am deeply disturbed both by reports that Obama-Biden officials exerted enormous pressure on our Israeli allies to accept this cease-fire and by how those officials are characterizing Israel's obligations. This pressure and these statements are further efforts to undermine Israel and constrain the incoming Trump administration. Obama-Biden officials pressured our Israeli allies into accepting the cease-fire by withholding weapons they needed to defend themselves and counter Hezbollah, and by threatening to facilitate a further, broader, binding international arms embargo through the United Nations.\"",

It's only that we didn't threaten it\u2026 literally the topic never came up, so, I don't even know how to answer the question any other way. It is completely new to me. And none of us has heard of this before.\"",
      "Backing this up in his interview with Israel's Ch. 12, Hochstein also denied the Biden administration threatened Israel over use of its U.N. Security Council veto if it did not sign the deal, saying, \"There was no such discussion at any point,\" adding that \"it never came up.\"",

      "Trump has not detailed steps he would take to secure the hostages' release from the terrorist network, though on Tuesday he signed a memorandum of understanding that should enable him to begin accessing intelligence regarding the hostages \u2013 a process that traditionally happens weeks prior to when Trump signed the document.",
      "While some Republicans, including those whom Trump has tapped for top jobs in his administration, like Florida Sen.\u00a0 Marco Rubio, have been in communication with the hostage families, the president-elect has not yet made contact with them, according to the parents of Omer and Itay.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 00:16:31 GMT",
    "summary": "President Joe Biden has decided to issue a pardon for his son Hunter and is expected to announce it Sunday night, according to a senior White House official with direct knowledge of the decision.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden has decided to issue a pardon for his son Hunter and is expected to announce it Sunday night, according to a senior White House official with direct knowledge of the decision.",
      "The decision marks a reversal for the president, who has repeatedly said he would not use his executive authority to pardon his son or commute his sentence. The pardon comes ahead of Hunter Biden\u2019s Dec. 12 sentencing for his conviction on federal gun charges. Hunter Biden also is set to be sentenced in a separate criminal case on Dec. 16, after pleading guilty in September on federal tax evasion charges.",
      "The pardon is expected to cover both Hunter Biden\u2019s gun charges conviction and guilty plea.",
      "The senior White House official said Biden decided over this weekend to grant his son a pardon and began to inform his senior aides on Sunday.",
      "Using his pardon power to assure Hunter Biden does not spend time in jail comes as the 82-year-old president is near the end of his term in the White House and has no future election to face. In recent months Biden has said he would not pardon his son or commute his sentence.",
      "\u201cI will not pardon him,\u201d the president said of his son in June after a jury found him guilty on three federal gun charges.",
      "President Biden has discussed issuing a pardon for his son with some of his closest aides since at least Hunter Biden\u2019s conviction in June, two people with direct knowledge of the discussions about the matter said. They said a decision was made at the time for the president to publicly say he would not pardon his son even though doing so remained on the table.",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters earlier this month that the president\u2019s position has not changed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been asked that question multiple times. Our answer stands which is \u2018no,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Asked Monday if the president is still committed to not issuing clemency for his son, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said: \u201cThe president has spoken to this.\u201d When pressed on whether Biden\u2019s position has changed, Bates replied, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to add what he said already.\u201d",
      "First lady Jill Biden has also said her husband would not pardon their son.",
      "\u201cJoe and I both respect the judicial system, and that\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d Jill Biden said in an interview with NBC News in June.",
      "Hunter Biden\u2019s criminal trial in June was the first involving the child of a sitting president.",
      "If Hunter Biden had been pardoned after the conclusion of that trial, the move would have ignited a political firestorm for his father, who was campaigning for re-election. Republicans have for years attacked Hunter Biden over his foreign business dealings and accused him and the president of corruption. They\u2019ve also argued that Hunter Biden was receiving special treatment by the Justice Department because of his father\u2019s political power.",
      "GOP criticism reached a crescendo in July 2023 when Hunter Biden entered a plea deal with federal prosecutors on the tax and gun charges, which collapsed after a judge raised questions about it. That development led to Attorney General Merrick Garland\u2019s appointment a couple weeks later of the U.S. attorney investigating Hunter Biden, David Weiss, as a special counsel.",
      "President Biden dropped out of the presidential race in July, but a pardon before Tuesday\u2019s election also could have generated political blowback on the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris after she took his place on the Democratic ticket.",
      "Together, the 12 counts Hunter Biden is convicted of or pled guilty to carry a maximum prison sentence of 42 years. But the maximum sentences typically aren\u2019t given out for convictions of these crimes. The Justice Department has said, for instance, that while the tax charges carry a maximum sentence of 17 years in prison, sentences are typically less than that.",
      "Biden was asked during an interview in June if he would rule out a pardon for his son, and answered, \u201cYes.\u201d",
      "Days later after Hunter Biden was convicted on federal gun charges by a jury in his hometown of Wilmington, DE, President Biden issued a statement saying he would respect the outcome. He then told reporters he would abide by the jury\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m extremely proud of my son Hunter,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe has overcome an addiction. He\u2019s one of the brightest, most decent men I know, and I am satisfied that I\u2019m not going to do anything. I said I abide by the jury decision. I will do that, and I will not pardon him.\u201d",
      "Neil Eggleston, who served as White House Counsel to President Obama, told NBC News he would advise Biden to pardon his son, though he has not been contacted or consulted by the current White House regarding any pardon preparations.",
      "\u201cIf I were his White House counsel, I would encourage him to pardon his son, Hunter,\u201d Eggleston said. \u201cThe clemency power has few limitations and certainly would extend to a Hunter Biden pardon.\u201d",
      "Eggleston\u2019s opinion that the president should pardon his son echoes other former Justice Department and White House officials previously involved in presidential pardons who told NBC News that they thought Biden should exercise this power in advance of the incoming Trump administration."

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 20:16:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Sen. Mike Rounds on Sunday expressed support for FBI Director Christopher Wray, just one day after President-elect Donald Trump said he would nominate Kash Patel to lead the agency.",
    "story": [
      "GOP Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., on Sunday expressed support for FBI Director Christopher Wray, just one day after President-elect Donald Trump said he would nominate Kash Patel to lead the agency as Wray\u2019s replacement.",
      "After Watergate, FBI directors have typically served 10-year terms to deter the bureau from being seen as a political tool for the president. Wray was previously nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate in 2017, so Trump would need to fire Wray or Wray would have to voluntarily step down before 2027 for Patel to take over.",
      "\u201cChris Wray, who the president nominated the first time around \u2014 I think the president picked a very good man to be the director of the FBI when he did that in his first term,\u201d Rounds said during an interview on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen we meet with him behind closed doors, I\u2019ve had no objections to the way that he\u2019s handled himself, and so I don\u2019t have any complaints about the way that he\u2019s done his job right now,\u201d Rounds added about Wray.",
      "Still, Rounds said that he would evaluate Patel and Trump\u2019s other Cabinet nominees fairly during the Senate\u2019s \u201cadvise and consent\u201d process. Patel will have to be confirmed by a majority vote of the full Senate after he is formally nominated, something that cannot happen until after Trump is inaugurated in January.",
      "\u201cThe president has the right to make nominations, but normally, these are for a 10-year term,\u201d Rounds said. \u201cIf he does [nominate Patel], just as with anybody who is nominated for one of these positions, once they\u2019ve been nominated by the president, then the president gets, you know, the benefit of the doubt on the nomination, but we still go through a process, and that process includes advice and consent.\u201d",
      "Rounds' colleague Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, didn't share Rounds' concerns, saying Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that he expects Patel to be confirmed.",
      "\"Listen, I think Kash Patel is a very strong nominee. I think the entire slate of Cabinet nominees President Trump has put forward is very strong,\" Cruz said. \"I believe every one of these Cabinet nominees is going to be confirmed by the Senate. I think Kash Patel is going to be confirmed by the Senate.\"",
      "Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who is in line to chair the Judiciary Committee in the next Congress, came out forcefully against Wray's tenure as FBI director Sunday morning but stopped short of endorsing Patel's nomination, writing on X that Wray \"failed at [the] fundamental duties\" of his position atop the FBI and that it's time to \"chart a new course [for] transparency and accountability at FBI.\"",
      "\"Kash Patel must prove to Congress he will reform &restore public trust in FBI,\" Grassley added.",
      "Representatives for the Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Rounds\u2019 remarks.",
      "Earlier Sunday, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan declined to share his thoughts about Patel but told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that \u201cwe, the Biden administration, adhere to the long-standing norm that FBI directors serve out their full terms, because the FBI director is a unique player in the American government system. They\u2019re appointed for 10-year terms, not terms just for the duration of a given president.\u201d",
      "Sullivan noted that Biden allowed Wray to serve throughout his administration, even though he was a Trump appointee.",
      "\u201cThe current FBI director, Chris Wray, was actually appointed by Donald Trump. Joe Biden didn\u2019t fire him. He relied upon him to execute his responsibilities as the director of the FBI and allowed him to serve out the fullness of his term,\u201d Sullivan added.",
      "In a statement Sunday, Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., echoed Sullivan's concerns, saying, \"We already have a FBI Director, Christopher Wray, and his term does not expire until 2027.\"",
      "Durbin went on to blast Trump, saying, \"President-elect Trump knows this, because he nominated Director Wray in 2017 after he fired the previous Director, James Comey, another lifelong Republican who failed Trump\u2019s loyalty test. President Biden kept Director Wray in office because the FBI is supposed to be insulated from partisanship.\"",
      "He also called on the Senate to vote against confirming Patel, saying in the statement, \"Now, the President-elect wants to replace his own appointee with an unqualified loyalist. The Senate should reject this unprecedented effort to weaponize the FBI for the campaign of retribution that Donald Trump has promised.\u201d"

Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., on Sunday said he is supportive of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s plans to impose tariffs on imports from a number of nations, including Canada and Mexico, pointing to the long history of the U.S. using trade as a \u201cstrategic tool\u201d for decades.",

      "Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., on Sunday said he is supportive of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s plans to impose tariffs on imports from a number of nations, including Canada and Mexico, pointing to the long history of the U.S. using trade as a \u201cstrategic tool\u201d for decades.",
      "\u201cAccess to our economy is a privilege,\u201d Hagerty said during an interview with moderator Kristen Welker on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cIf you think about it, we\u2019ve made access to this economy a strategic tool ever since World War II.\u201d",
      "\u201cRight now, the United States has the most open market of any major economy in the world. We need to take a very hard look at countries that don\u2019t have our best interests at heart, countries that are allowing our borders to be violated, and use those tariffs as a tool to achieve our ends,\u201d Hagerty added.",
      "His comments come as Trump spent the last week announcing that he would seek to impose 25% tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico and that he would impose 100% tariffs on imports from BRICS countries if they sought to create their own currency to trade in.",
      "The threats prompted a flurry of reactions from world leaders, including a phone call between Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and a visit to Mar-a-Lago from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "Hagerty backed Trump\u2019s strategy with Canada and Mexico, saying that the two nations are engaging in \u201cbehavior\u201d that is \u201cletting fentanyl flood into our border,\u00a0that is allowing people to flood into our country, millions of people, undocumented, illegal people.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt needs to stop, and President Trump is going to use every lever at his disposal to do it. And I think it\u2019s absolutely appropriate to use tariffs as one of those tools. It\u2019s a major tool,\u201d Hagerty added.",
      "Minutes after Hagerty appeared on the program, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., also spoke to \u201cMeet the Press\u201d about Trump\u2019s tariff proposals,  blasting them as \u201ca distraction.\u201d",
      "\u201cDonald Trump has no idea how to use tariffs in order to create American jobs,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe tariffs are a distraction from what the real agenda is going to be, to be able to use government in order to dramatically increase the wealth of his Cabinet and the friends of that Cabinet.\u201d",
      "Hagerty also spoke about two of Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks who have raised concerns from some senators, including Kash Patel, a former Trump administration official whom Trump chose Saturday to lead the FBI, and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, whom the president-elect tapped for director of national intelligence.",
      "Hagerty praised Patel, who has little experience in federal law enforcement, telling Welker, \u201cThere are serious problems at the FBI. The American public knows it. They expect to see sweeping change, and Kash Patel is just the type of person to do it.\u201d",
      "The senator also addressed concerns about Gabbard, who revealed in 2017 that she had a secret meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during a visit to the region, a meeting that\u2019s under renewed scrutiny as a rebel offensive takes place in Aleppo.",
      "Gabbard, who served in Congress as a Democrat, has also been accused of parroting Russian propaganda.",
      "Hagerty dismissed concerns about Gabbard, saying he plans to vote for her anyway.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not familiar with the meetings that she\u2019s had, and I certainly don\u2019t have to agree with every point of every one of President Trump\u2019s nominees, but I am here to support them,\u201d he said."

      "As the Texas State Board of Education prepared to vote last month on whether to allow public school districts to opt in to a new elementary school curriculum featuring Bible-based lessons, board member Staci Childs asked her pastor for prayer.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d think that learning some things about the Bible on a historical account is not necessarily bad. But if I\u2019m saying less Christianity, what kind of Christian am I?\u201d Childs said last week. \u201cThis was conflicting for me.\u201d",
      "The material won narrow approval in a Republican-led 8-7 vote, although three Republican members, including Childs, joined the four Democrats on the board in opposition.",
      "\u201cIn the law, there is a clear separation of church and state,\u201d Childs, an attorney who represents the Houston area on the board, said of her decision.",
      "If the constitutionality of mixing religious doctrine with public school education had seemed to be largely decided, with U.S. Supreme Court rulings in the 1960s and \u201980s limiting how religious activity and teachings can be enforced, a wave of new laws and mandates in states, particularly in the South, is stirring debate and testing the bounds of what may be legally permissible.",
      "Officials, educators and parents in those states are now being confronted by what, if any, amount of religious-infused lessons they want children to have access to at a time when many conservative Christians have been emboldened by President-elect Donald Trump and embraced the ideology of Christian nationalism, which considers the Bible a key facet of America\u2019s history and tradition.",
      "\u201cBible wins in Texas!\u201d Jonathan Saenz, president of Texas Values, a conservative and religious think tank, posted on X after the school board\u2019s curriculum vote. \u201cLiberal efforts to Target, Deny & Ban the Bible\u2019s influence on English literature/history FAILS!!\u201d",
      "Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican, responded on X that the approval of the curriculum, known as the \u201cstate-developed\u201d Bluebonnet Learning, \u201cwill ensure all students are receiving appropriate grade-level instruction and is an important step to boosting student outcomes statewide.\u201d",
      "School districts won\u2019t be forced to introduce the curriculum in their kindergarten through fifth-grade classrooms, but if they choose to do so, they would earn a financial incentive of $60 per child beginning next year.",
      "While the material itself mentions other religions, including Judaism and Islam, the Bible-related lessons and Christianity are more prominent, said Mark Chancey, a religious studies professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. That\u2019s problematic, he added.",
      "\u201cWhen a public school plays religious favorites by emphasizing Christianity more than any other tradition, and by teaching about Christianity in a way that\u2019s likely to promote encouragement of Christianity\u2019s religious claims, then that violates all of our religious freedom,\u201d Chancey said on NBC News Now.",
      "Although the material is optional, Childs believes it may still be challenged in court.",
      "Litigation is already playing out in other states that have recently adopted Bible-based rules in schools.",
      "In Louisiana, a law set to go into effect on Jan. 1 that would require all public K-12 schools and colleges to display posters featuring the Ten Commandments was temporarily blocked after a group of parents sued in federal court. The state is appealing and arguments are expected in January.",
      "This year, Oklahoma\u2019s top education official began ordering public schools with students in grades five through 12 to incorporate the Bible into lesson plans. State Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters, a Republican, has purchased 500 Bibles and asked for $3 million from the state to buy copies for every classroom.",
      "A group of parents filed a lawsuit in October challenging the state, arguing the mandate violates the Oklahoma Constitution.",
      "Plaintiff Erika Wright, the founder of the Oklahoma Rural Schools Coalition and a mother of three children,\u00a0said the state, which is consistently at the bottom of nationwide educational rankings, needs to prioritize the basics and leave discussing religion to families at home.",

      "Walters has suggested teachers who don\u2019t want to comply may lose their licenses.",
      "In a recent interview with NBC News, the former high school history teacher said he believes the requirements would \u201cabsolutely\u201d hold up if the litigation were to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority.",
      "\u201cWe want our kids to understand American exceptionalism, what made America great,\u201d Walters said, adding: \u201cYou can be offended by Christianity, you can not agree with Christianity, but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to take Christianity out of American history. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen the left do.\u201d",
      "State officials like Walters have relied on national Republican leaders to show support for their initiatives. Trump on social media endorsed Louisiana\u2019s Ten Commandments law as the \u201cfirst major step in the revival of religion,\u201d while last year,\u00a0House Speaker Mike Johnson decried people\u2019s understanding of the separation of church and state as a \u201cmisnomer,\u201d saying on CNBC after he had prayed on the House floor that the founders \u201cdid not want the government to encroach upon the church \u2014 not that they didn\u2019t want principles of faith to have influence on our public life. It\u2019s exactly the opposite.\u201d",
      "While the words \u201cseparation of church and state\u201d are not written explicitly in the Constitution, legal scholars say the phrase refers to the establishment clause in the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from validating an official religion or favoring one over another.",
      "Joshua Blackman, a\u00a0constitutional law professor\u00a0at the South Texas College of Law Houston, said public schools that explicitly teach how Christianity or any religion is the \u201cone true faith\u201d will fall afoul of the Constitution. But, he said, arguments could be made that \u201cpassive\u201d actions, such as having a Bible in the classroom or the Ten Commandments on the wall, could be viewed as acceptable if \u201cyou don\u2019t have to do something with it.\u201d",
      "Rachel\u00a0Laser, the president of\u00a0Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a nonprofit advocacy organization supporting the lawsuits in Louisiana and Oklahoma, agreed that teaching about the Bible or religion has a place in the correct context. Older students, she said, can question and discern what they are taught, but younger students are more impressionable.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with teaching a comparative religion class,\u201d Laser said. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem when you teach one religion as truth or give preference, including preference of religion over nonreligion.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, lawmakers and school officials in other states are reviewing religion-related proposals that may not be considered as extreme as requiring Bibles in classrooms but are still drawing scrutiny.",
      "A bill being debated in Ohio could mandate that all school districts make policies allowing for students to be released during the school day for religious instruction.",
      "In Florida, school boards are considering whether to allow volunteers to serve as chaplains or religious representatives for willing students after a law was passed this year.",
      "Childs, the Texas State Board of Education member, sees the current push for increased religious influence in public schools as concerning, as it comes amid a dialing back of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at companies and institutions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s ironic that we\u2019re OK with one group, but you don\u2019t want your kids exposed to others,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere\u2019s the lesson in that?\u201d"

      "The magic of \u201cWicked\u201d has been spoiled for some moviegoers, who say too many people are taking photos and recording videos during their screenings.",
      "While it used to be taboo to take a phone out during a movie, the once-derided act has become commonplace in recent years. The release of the musical adaptation has once again renewed debate over movie theater etiquette.",
      "One thread from a moviegoer racked up millions of views on X after the user encouraged people to show their photos from their \u201cWicked\u201d screenings. While some people obliged, others shamed them for distracting from the film.",
      "Phone use in theaters has been a growing issue since pandemic restrictions were lifted. Some believe the behavior is a result of years of interacting primarily through social media, which has led users to prioritize capturing content instead of living in the moment.",
      "Social media has become a \u201cpart of our identity,\u201d said Sara Cureton, an assistant professor at Colorado Technical University who teaches psychology and social media. She said many people use social media \u201cto be seen, whether your social media audience is just your family and friends or you\u2019re more broadly an influencer with thousands of followers.\u201d",
      "Cureton said posting photos from a \u201cWicked\u201d screening signals that \u201cI was here, I was doing this opening weekend.\u201d",
      "Some social media users who took photos during their screenings argued that a quick picture wasn\u2019t especially intrusive.",
      "But taking a phone out and posting a picture from the theater takes away from the shared experience audiences have watching a movie together. Cureton said phones are \u201cimpacting behavior etiquette, including becoming a distraction, violating boundaries in shared spaces.\u201d Many have begun to prioritize their own individual experiences at the expense of the collective.",
      "\u201cBy and large, moviegoing is a beloved media and cultural tradition, and a lot of people will say it\u2019s sacred,\u201d Cureton said. \u201cThe people who are probably getting upset at the sharing of these title cards or these movie experiences are probably steeped in that tradition of moviegoing.\u201d",

      "A week of major movie releases has propelled this holiday stretch to the highest-grossing Thanksgiving weekend ever at the box office.",
      "First, viewers packed theaters to sing with the witches of Oz and watch a vengeful gladiator face the horrors of the ancient Roman Colosseum. Then, they returned to the big screen to follow Moana\u2019s treacherous seafaring journey.",
      "The trio contributes to an estimated Thanksgiving weekend total of a whopping $420 million, according to box office data from Comscore \u2014 surpassing the previous record of $315.6 million set in 2018, led by the releases of \u201cRalph Breaks the Internet,\u201d \u201cCreed II\u201d and \u201cFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot only did we surpass the previous records for Thanksgiving,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst at the company.  \"This sets a completely new standard for what is possible over the Thanksgiving holiday for movie theaters.\"",
      "He added that \u201cMoana II\u201d in particular blew past box office experts\u2019 predictions by nearly $100 million.",
      "Grossing $221 million across North America since its Wednesday release, \u201cMoana 2\u201d has shattered box office records with the biggest five-day opening of all time \u2014 including the biggest Thanksgiving debut ever. The film soared past the previous five-day opening record of $204.6 million for \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie,\u201d and nearly doubled the $15 million Thanksgiving Day record formerly set by \u201cFrozen 2.\u201d",
      "Set in ancient Polynesia, the sequel to Disney\u2019s 2016 \u201cMoana\u201d follows Moana, the daughter of an island chief, as she leaves her home of Motunui to break a Polynesian god\u2019s curse and save her people.",
      "Disney Entertainment co-chairman Alan Bergman said in a statement that the film has \u201cfar surpassed our high expectations this weekend and is a testament to the phenomenon that \u2018Moana\u2019 has become.\u201d",
      "Universal\u2019s \u201cWicked\u201d and Paramount\u2019s \u201cGladiator II\u201d continued to rake in revenue throughout Thanksgiving weekend, with \u201cWicked\u201d grossing an estimated $117.5 million and defying gravity to become the highest-grossing Broadway adaptation of all time domestically. \u201cGladiator II\u201d also contributed $44 million to domestic box office earnings over the five-day period.",
      "Both films, released on Nov. 22 ahead of Thanksgiving week, have prompted widespread comparisons to last summer\u2019s \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d phenomenon, when \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d created an unprecedented box office event as well as a cultural moment unlike any other. Fans online quickly dubbed \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d\u2019s double feature \u201cGlicked.\u201d",
      "The lively Broadway show tunes of \u201cWicked,\u201d starring Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba and Ariana Grande as Glinda, contrasted with Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cGladiator II,\u201d an action-packed film with swords, violent battles and ancient warfare. The counterprogramming, combined with a buildup of social media buzz, boosted initial turnout in theaters \u2014\u00a0and they both continued to dominate the box office past the double feature release.",
      "Then \u201cMoana II\u201d opened on what Dergarabedian described as a \u201cperfect\u201d release date: the day before Thanksgiving, just as children are getting out of school and families are gathering.",
      "\u201cJust that one-two punch of family moviegoing excitement created by the \u2018Glicked\u2019 marketing hook, and then followed up by \u2018Moana II,\u2019 was an unbeatable combination,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cThis will lead into a really strong home stretch for movie theaters.\u201d"

      "The Summary",
      "The recent flurry of solar storms suggests the sun is in a period of maximal activity as part of its 11-year cycle.The active period is likely to continue over the next year, so more auroras could be in store. Next month, NASA will get an up-close view of the solar activity as the Parker Solar Probe makes its closest-ever approach to the sun.",
      "The recent flurry of solar storms suggests the sun is in a period of maximal activity as part of its 11-year cycle.",

      "Next month, NASA will get an up-close view of the solar activity as the Parker Solar Probe makes its closest-ever approach to the sun.",
      "The sun is awake.",
      "In recent months, Earth\u2019s star has ramped up activity, with giant flares erupting off the surface and belching streams of plasma and charged particles into space. Several of the solar storms have been aimed at our planet, and they triggered severe geomagnetic storms and supercharged dazzling displays of the northern lights.",
      "The sun\u2019s flurry of outbursts, coming after years of relative quiet and calm, is a sure sign that the star has entered a busy phase of its natural cycle, according to experts: solar maximum.",
      "The active period is likely to continue over the next year, which means more solar storms and spectacular auroras could be in store.",
      "\u201cThis is definitely the season for big solar storms,\u201d said Kelly Korreck, a program scientist in the heliophysics division at NASA. \u201cI expect we will see the skies lit up with auroras again.\u201d",
      "Later this month, NASA will get an up-close view of the high solar activity as the agency\u2019s Parker Solar Probe makes its closest-ever approach to the sun on Dec. 24.",
      "The spacecraft is on a path to swoop within 3.86 million miles of the solar surface \u2014 closer than any other human-made object in history. It is expected to fly through plumes of the sun\u2019s plasma and potentially dive into active regions of the star.",
      "\u201cIf you think of an American football field, and Earth is on one side and the sun is on the other, this is like going to the sun\u2019s 4-yard line,\u201d Korreck said.",
      "The Parker Solar Probe launched in 2018 on a mission to study the sun\u2019s atmosphere, an ultrahot region known as the corona. Last month, the car-size spacecraft flew by Venus in a maneuver that will help slingshot it near the sun.",
      "Korreck said the probe\u2019s close encounter could yield especially valuable insights if there are active sunspot regions \u2014 temporary features that appear as dark blemishes on the sun\u2019s surface \u2014 along its path. Such observations could help researchers better understand how the sun\u2019s activity waxes and wanes.",
      "The solar cycle generally lasts around 11 years, as the sun transitions from periods of low to high magnetic activity. As the star moves out of its calm phase \u2014\u00a0solar minimum \u2014 and reaches the height of the solar cycle, its magnetic poles flip, ushering in solar maximum, when activity is heightened and eruptions become more frequent and intense.",
      "The main way scientists can tell that the sun has reached its maximum is by monitoring sunspot formation. As the sun spins, its magnetic field becomes roiled, warping and tightening in some areas, Korreck said. That's what creates the sunspots that appear in telescope images as dark patches.",
      "\u201cThe sun is a magnetic ball, but because it doesn\u2019t move as a solid object, its magnetic field gets all twisted up as it turns,\u201d Korreck said.",
      "The number of those sunspots steadily increases as the star moves toward solar maximum. Once there is a notable decline, researchers can define the start and end of the active period.",
      "In some sunspot areas, the magnetic field can be about 2,500 times stronger than Earth\u2019s magnetic field, according to NASA. Over time, sunspots can release enormous amounts of pent-up magnetic energy in the form of solar storms.",
      "Two major solar storms this year \u2014 one in May and another in early October \u2014 stunned skywatchers as far south as Texas and Alabama with night skies painted in bright pink, green and purple hues. The event in May was the strongest geomagnetic storm to hit Earth in two decades, according to NASA.",
      "Auroras occur when clouds of charged particles that spew from the sun during solar storms slam into Earth\u2019s magnetic field and interact with atoms and molecules in the planet\u2019s upper atmosphere. The colorful displays are a beautiful byproduct of that process, typically visible only at high latitudes. But during periods of intense solar activity, the lights can wander much farther south than usual.",
      "But there can be negative consequences, as well. Strong geomagnetic storms can cause problems for astronauts in space, along with GPS systems and satellites in orbit."

      "TikTok is defending itself in federal court over legislation President Joe Biden signed in April that would ban TikTok if it doesn\u2019t sell itself to an American owner by the time Trump takes office.",
      "Further complicating matters for TikTok is the fact that Trump has reversed his public stance on the app as he has announced Cabinet picks with a wide array of views about it.",
      "In 2020, he tried to ban it outright with an executive order that was struck down in the courts. At the time, teen TikTok users claimed to have coordinated lower turnout at one of Trump\u2019s rallies by reserving seats they had no intention to fill. This March, Trump acknowledged that he believes TikTok is a \u201cnational security threat\u201d but said a ban would double business for Meta\u2019s Facebook, which he calls the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d",
      "In June, Trump started his own TikTok account, which now has over 14.6 million followers, the most of any U.S. politician, although he hasn\u2019t posted since Election Day. In a Truth Social post in September, he said he would \u201csave TikTok in America\u201d if he was elected.",
      "If Trump sticks to his word, he could be TikTok\u2019s best chance to avoid a ban. But that\u2019s not a sure thing \u2014 most of Trump\u2019s Cabinet and other administration picks who have spoken about the app\u2019s future have strongly encouraged a ban, with a few who have large TikTok and other social media followings opposing one.",
      "Project 2025, the conservative playbook outlining plans for the administration, refers to TikTok as \u201ca tool of Chinese espionage\u201d that should be \u201coutlawed.\u201d In his goals outlined for the Federal Communications Commission in Project 2025, Trump\u2019s choice for FCC chair, Brendan Carr, wrote that one of his main priorities is \u201creining in\u201d big tech, including banning TikTok.",
      "During his campaign, Trump disavowed Project 2025, a project led by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, after it became a central subject of Democratic attacks. However, at least three of his staff picks contributed to or wrote sections of Project 2025, and his transition staffers are pulling from its personnel database, according to a person familiar with the situation.",
      "In the foreword to Project 2025, Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts writes that TikTok and other social media platforms \u201care specifically designed to create the digital dependencies that fuel mental illness and anxiety, to fray children\u2019s bonds with their parents and siblings. Federal policy cannot allow this industrial-scale child abuse to continue.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s pick for head of the CIA, John Ratcliffe, whose nomination requires Senate confirmation, is another author of Project 2025. He plans to devote even more resources to countering China. \u201cTikTok is a national security threat,\u201d Ratcliffe told Fox Business in 2022, agreeing with the host that the U.S. should \u201ckick out\u201d TikTok.",
      "Most Trump allies who oppose TikTok have cited claims of Chinese government influence over American users, which TikTok denies. Politicians on both sides of the aisle have also referred to TikTok as a national security threat and a way for the Chinese government to get data on Americans, while its proponents have argued that such data is accessible with or without TikTok.",
      "Even as some members of Trump\u2019s incoming administration have advocated banning TikTok, other members have become rising TikTok stars, including Vice President-elect JD Vance, who has over 2 million followers, and press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who has posted only one video (following the popular \u201cday in the life\u201d format in October) and has 36,000 followers. But Leavitt has also spoken out against the platform.",
      "\u201cAs a generation Z American, I can tell you all my friends, my colleagues, my former classmates are on TikTok. It is the main source of news for the majority of American youth, and it is truly the bane of our society right now,\u201d Leavitt said last December on Fox Business.",
      "Referring to the Chinese Communist Party, she said: \u201cIt is owned by the CCP. They are pushing algorithms that are very damaging to the intellectual curiosity and to the ideology of young Americans today.\u201d",
      "Sebastian Gorka, a Newsmax host and the incoming deputy assistant to the president, described TikTok as a \u201cCCP instrument,\u201d \u201ca way to collect data from Americans, including children, and then exploit it for the purposes of the world\u2019s largest communist regime,\u201d on his show in April 2023.",
      "\u201cPeople want to ban it, especially on the right,\u201d he added.",
      "Awaiting Senate confirmation to join Trump\u2019s Cabinet are former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, his pick for director of national intelligence, who has over 1 million TikTok followers, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump\u2019s choice for health and human services secretary, who has over 3 million followers. They have both publicly criticized the legislation that would force a sale of TikTok or lead to a U.S. ban.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled \u2014 the TikTok ban is not about China harvesting your data. That\u2019s a smoke screen,\u201d Kennedy wrote on X in April, adding that he would file a lawsuit challenging the ban on constitutional grounds.",
      "\u201cCongress and the administration don\u2019t understand that TikTok is an entrepreneurial platform for thousands of American young people,\u201d Kennedy went on to write, adding that U.S. data is harvested outside TikTok and that the company \u201cisn\u2019t even majority Chinese-owned.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey want to screw them over just so they can pretend to be tough on China,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Gabbard told podcast host Joe Rogan in May that she opposed the legislation to force a sale \u201con the grounds of free speech and civil liberties,\u201d arguing that it would give the president unilateral power to declare a country a foreign adversary and ban any app the country owned a majority stake in.",
      "\u201cMaybe they\u2019re just going after the ones they can\u2019t actually control and intimidate into doing their work for them,\u201d\u00a0 she said.",
      "Kennedy also spoke to TikTok users about the legislation during a livestream on the platform in June, calling it \u201cperverse,\u201d \u201ctwisted\u201d and unconstitutional and characterizing it as private property seizure and a violation of free speech. He said young people should be encouraged to pursue entrepreneurship through monetized content and marketing on TikTok, not have it taken away.",
      "\u201cI have an account on TikTok. It\u2019s important for me to be able to communicate with people on TikTok. There\u2019s a lot of content on TikTok I disagree with, but that\u2019s what democracy is about,\u201d Kennedy said. In the same appearance, he said he disagreed with the government\u2019s decision to ban the Russian propaganda network RT.",
      "TV personality Mehmet Oz, Trump\u2019s pick to direct the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has 1.1 million TikTok followers, and he uses the platform\u2019s TikTok Shop feature to earn commissions on health and wellness products he advertises from a company he advises.",
      "Vivek Ramaswamy, who Trump has said will work alongside X owner Elon Musk in newly created government efficiency advisory roles, has over 855,000 TikTok followers. Ramaswamy flip-flopped on TikTok when he ran his own presidential campaign in 2023. In between two Iowa campaign stops, Ramaswamy went from calling TikTok \u201cdigital fentanyl\u201d to joining it at the advice of Jake Paul, the controversial boxer and YouTube star.",
      "\u201cIn retrospect, it was a little bit of an old-fashioned decision to say that there\u2019s an entire mode of communicating with young people that I was going to turn off,\u201d Ramaswamy said, although he has continued to say the app could have a worrying impact on young teens.",
      "Musk, who doesn\u2019t have a public-facing account, opposes a ban. \u201cIn my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,\u201d Musk posted in April. \u201cDoing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.\u201d",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported that TikTok CEO Shou Chew has reached out to Musk since the election, looking for insight into Trump\u2019s administration and tech policy.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy don\u2019t need to be confirmed by the Senate, because their roles aren\u2019t official government positions, although Trump said they will work to inform the Office of Management and Budget.",
      "Trump\u2019s incoming national security adviser, Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., voted in support of the bill to force a sale of TikTok and advocated for a ban. In February, after Biden\u2019s campaign joined TikTok, Waltz told Fox News the campaign should be \u201cashamed.\u201d He suggested the Chinese Communist Party could stage \u201celection interference\u201d on TikTok.",
      "\u201cIt is long overdue,\u201d Waltz said about a ban. \u201cWe should not allow our greatest adversary to access 150 million Americans and their data.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhy is it OK to ban TikTok on all government devices because it\u2019s essentially a spyware tool ... but it\u2019s OK to have it on our kids\u2019 phones, monitoring everything they look at?\u201d Waltz asked on Fox Business in July 2023. \u201cWe would have never allowed this in the Cold War with the Soviet Union, and we shouldn\u2019t be allowing it now.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of state, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has been advocating against TikTok since the company first merged with the app Musical.ly in 2019. He co-introduced legislation to ban TikTok from government devices in 2021 and in all of the U.S. in 2022, supported Trump\u2019s executive order to ban TikTok and called the legislation that would force a sale to an American owner \u201ca huge step toward confronting Beijing\u2019s malign influence.\u201d",
      "After Trump was elected, Rubio said he would defer to him on TikTok, although he still had concerns about the \u201cvulnerability it poses.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the president, so if that\u2019s what he wants to do, he also has the power to do it,\u201d Rubio said.",
      "In late 2022, Trump\u2019s pick for homeland security secretary, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, and his choice for interior secretary, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, both banned TikTok from state-owned devices.",
      "In an interview with Fox News in March, Noem said TikTok is \u201cowned by the Chinese Community Party. Their No. 1 desire is to destroy America, so that is why we should be alarmed at the amount of influence they have in this country.\u201d She said TikTok was released at the same time as the Covid-19 pandemic was (it was actually released in the U.S. in August 2018) to \u201cinfluence our youth.\u201d",
      "Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, R-Ore., Trump\u2019s pick for labor secretary, and Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., his choice for ambassador to the United Nations, both voted in favor of the bill that would force a sale to an American owner.",
      "\u201cI have consistently said that Tik Tok is a national security threat,\u201d Stefanik said in a statement in March. \u201cWe cannot allow our adversaries to build an arsenal of data on American citizens that can be used to exploit and weaponize them.\u201d",
      "Former Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., Trump\u2019s pick for veterans affairs secretary, told Newsmax in March 2023 that he opposed TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership but that the legislative path to ban it was a \u201ctough decision,\u201d creating a potential path to government overreach. \u201cWe really don\u2019t need the government getting into that, and that\u2019s the problem,\u201d Collins said.",
      "Trump\u2019s choice for surgeon general, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, a family and emergency medicine doctor and Fox News medical contributor, has personally advocated for a ban \u2014 not just on TikTok but on all social media for children.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, social media should be banned to all teens and young children, because it\u2019s done nothing but harm,\u201d she said on Fox News."

    "title": "Upcoming Supreme Court decision could transform transgender health care",
    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 10:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments Wednesday on a case focused on restrictions to transgender care. The decision could have broad impacts for years to come.",
    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court will consider a law restricting transition-related health care for minors for the first time Wednesday, and legal experts say the court\u2019s decision could affect access to transition-related care nationwide for both minors and adults for decades to come.",
      "The key legal question the court will consider is whether a Tennessee law that bars puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery for trans minors discriminates on the basis of sex.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal argue that it does, because it prohibits such care only as treatment for gender dysphoria. The law makes exceptions for minors who need the treatments for other reasons. Puberty blockers, for example, can be used to treat children who experience precocious, or early, puberty, and physicians can still perform surgery on infants who are born with sex characteristics that fall outside the standard male or female binary.",
      "Just days after the ACLU filed suit against Tennessee\u2019s law in April 2023, the Justice Department intervened and filed its own complaint against the law, arguing that it discriminates against trans youths on the basis of sex and transgender status in violation of the 14th Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court granted the Biden administration\u2019s appeal of a 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision upholding Tennessee\u2019s law. The court won\u2019t consider the part of the law that bans surgery, which wasn\u2019t covered by the lower court\u2019s injunction.",
      "In his reply brief to the Supreme Court, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti argued that the law doesn\u2019t discriminate based on sex but rather \u201cdraws a line between minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes\u201d and that \u201cboys and girls fall on both sides of that line.\u201d The attorney general\u2019s office also argues that there is uncertainty around the risks and benefits of transition care for minors and that the state is allowed to pass legislation in an effort to protect minors.",
      "Harleigh Walker, 17, a trans girl in Auburn, Alabama, said she\u2019s worried about how the court\u2019s decision could affect her future. Since Alabama\u2019s ban on transition-related care for minors took effect in January, Walker and her father, Jeff, have had to travel 200 miles to another state, where Walker will sometimes sit in the car or in a hotel room to do a telehealth visit so she can continue receiving estrogen.",
      "Walker plans to attend college out of state, because Alabama\u2019s law applies to anyone under 19, the state\u2019s age of majority, so Walker wouldn\u2019t be able to receive care in the state until her sophomore year.",
      "\u201cWhenever this legislation was introduced in Alabama and state legislatures across the country, it was obviously a huge shock, and it had a lot of unsafety and uncertainty, but I knew that I was still safe under the general umbrella of the United States of America, and I could go to another state that has more of an open mind about trans people and access to health care, but with Trump being elected and this Supreme Court decision \u2026 it\u2019s horrifying that there\u2019s a possibility that this could affect health care access for transgender adults,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt\u2019s scary to think that I won\u2019t be safe for the rest of my life in this country, and I hope that that\u2019s not the case.\u201d",
      "Trans youths, their families and providers of transition-related care have told NBC News that state restrictions on such care have created a confusing patchwork of laws across the country that has led many families to have to travel out of their home states for care. As a result, legal experts say, the court\u2019s decision could determine what access to such care looks like for years to come not only for minors but also for adults because of some of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s proposed policies.",
      "\u201cThe reason that transgender people\u2019s health care is now protected under the Affordable Care Act is because there is a broad recognition that denying it would be unlawful sex discrimination under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Shannon Minter, the legal director at the National Center for Lesbian Rights, an LGBTQ legal advocacy group. \u201cSo if the court says no, excluding this care is not discriminatory, then that would really gravely endanger our coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d",
      "The legal landscape leading up to the case",
      "Last year, three trans youths, their parents and a doctor asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block Tennessee\u2019s law, which took effect in July 2023 but includes a provision that allows doctors to wean youths off of medication for nine months until March 31, 2024.",
      "One of the plaintiffs, a 15-year-old trans girl referred to as L.W. in the lawsuit, said last year that she\u2019s fighting the law because \u201cI know how important this care is for tens of thousands of transgender youth like me.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt scares me to think about losing the medication that I need, and if this law continues, my family may have to leave Tennessee \u2014 the place I have lived and loved my entire life,\u201d she said, adding that she doesn\u2019t know where her family could go given how many states have passed similar legislation.",
      "The ACLU and Lambda Legal noted in their petition to the Supreme Court that circuit courts have become split on the restrictions. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked a law in Arkansas, while the 6th and 11th circuits have allowed laws in Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama and Florida to take effect.",
      "Twenty-three states restrict puberty blockers, hormone therapy or surgery for trans minors; 18 of those measures have been challenged in court, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank.",
      "As of April, an estimated 113,900 trans youths lived in states that have restricted transition-related care for minors, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law.",
      "Many families with trans kids have had to work around care restrictions to continue care for their children. Some families have left their home states entirely. Others, like the Walkers, travel hundreds of miles to access care.",
      "Dr. Izzy Lowell, founder and director of the telehealth clinic QueerMed, serves trans teens and adults nationwide. She said her clinic has seen an increase in minor patients since the restrictions on transition care began taking effect, particularly across the South. She estimates that the clinic serves 800 to 1,000 minor patients and that 80% to 90% of them live in states that restrict care for minors.",
      "Patients in states with restrictions who have the resources to travel can go to states without such laws for telehealth appointments with the clinic, which is governed by the laws of the states patients are physically in during the appointments, Lowell said.",
      "\u201cA lot of my job right now is travel agent,\u201d Lowell said. She talks with nearly every patient about where they live, what states they can and can\u2019t travel to or when they might be on vacation or even on layovers at airports in other states. For example, she said, the clinic saw a patient who was on a layover at Boston Logan International Airport.",
      "She said the effects of the care restrictions have been really difficult for patients.",
      "\u201cI think in medicine in general, we underestimate the really significant health risks of stress, and this is stress times 10,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s being openly hated, discriminated against. People are fearful, truly fearful for themselves and for losing treatment, which is devastating, life-threatening for people.\u201d",
      "The election and Trump\u2019s promises to bar trans health care for minors nationwide and prohibit Medicaid from covering trans care have increased that fear, she said. The clinic\u2019s new patient registrations increased from an average of 10 to 15 per week to 250 on Nov. 6, the day after the election, and 150 on Nov. 7, she said. In the following week, it averaged 50 new registrations per day.",
      "Regardless of the outcome of the Supreme Court case, Lowell said, her plan is to never stop providing transition-related care \u201cto the full extent that it\u2019s legal,\u201d even in the face of increasing backlash.",
      "An arsonist destroyed Lowell\u2019s practice based in Georgia last year, and she said the FBI is investigating the incident as a hate crime.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way to plan ahead for this, other than to keep going and do everything we can for people for as long as we can,\u201d she said. \u201cWe won\u2019t stop until we absolutely have to.\u201d"

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 13:07:18 GMT",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump announced he would pick Kash Patel, the former chief of staff to to the acting secretary of defense during the first Trump administration, to serve as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Saturday he would pick Kashyap \"Kash\" Patel, a 44-year-old loyalist with little management experience in federal law enforcement, to serve as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.",
      "\"Kash is a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People,\" Trump wrote in a post to Truth Social. \"He played a pivotal role in uncovering the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, standing as an advocate for truth, accountability, and the Constitution.\"",
      "Patel, who will have to win Senate confirmation to become FBI director, has earned a reputation as an extreme Trump loyalist who has spread baseless \"deep state\" conspiracy theories and called for a purge of perceived Trump enemies from the FBI.",
      "\"It is the honor of a lifetime to be nominated by President Trump to serve as Director of the FBI,\" Patel said in a statement. \"Together, we will restore integrity, accountability, and equal justice to our justice system and return the FBI to its rightful mission: protecting the American people.\"",
      "The nomination of Patel, who worked as a federal prosecutor in Washington and a public defender in Florida, is likely to again put pressure on Senate Republicans who signaled earlier this month they would reject Matt Gaetz as Trump's pick for attorney general.",
      "Gaetz, a firebrand Trump loyalist with no experience as a prosecutor, was criminally investigated on allegations of sex trafficking but was never charged. Gaetz has denied the allegations.",
      "A former senior law enforcement official who interacted with Patel in the past said he was not qualified for the position.",
      "\"It's ridiculous. He's arguably the least qualified person ever nominated for a senior position in federal law enforcement,\" said the former official, who asked not to be named citing fears of retaliation from Trump. \"I don't know anything significant that he achieved at the DOJ. He was not well regarded as a prosecutor.\"",
      "During the closing months of Trump's first term, Trump also proposed that Patel run the FBI. William Barr, the attorney general at the time, vehemently objected and Trump dropped his plan.",
      "\"Patel had virtually no experience that would qualify him to serve at the highest level of the world's preeminent law enforcement agency,\" Barr later wrote in his memoir.",
      "Patel has promoted the falsehood that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump as well as the baseless conspiracy theory that federal bureaucrats in the \"deep state\" tried to overthrow the former president.",
      "In an interview last year with longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon, Patel vowed to go after judges, lawyers and journalists who, in Patel\u2019s view, had improperly investigated Trump and stolen the 2020 election.",
      "\u201cWe will follow the facts and the law and go to courts of law and correct these justices and lawyers who have been prosecuting these cases based on politics,\u201d Patel said.",
      "\u201cWe will go out and find the conspirators, not just in government but in the media \u2014 yes, we\u2019re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,\u201d Patel added.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s criminally or civilly, we\u2019re going to figure that out \u2014 but yeah, we\u2019re putting you all on notice,\u201d he added. \"We're actually going to use the Constitution to prosecute them for crimes they said we have always been guilty of but never have.\"",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court and dozens of federal judges appointed by Republicans and Democrats dismissed Trump's claims that the 2020 election was stolen. And former FBI and DOJ officials have repeatedly dismissed the \"deep state\" claims as false and politically motivated conspiracy theories.",
      "They note that special counsel John Durham's yearslong investigation into the FBI's Trump-Russia probe produced no criminal charges against senior officials. And they say a purge of FBI officials deemed disloyal to Trump is designed to intimidate anyone who dares investigate the conduct of Trump or other officials in his second administration.",
      "Trump's nomination of Patel also flouts a post-Watergate norm that FBI directors serve 10-year terms. The goal of the practice is to ensure that the FBI is seen as not serving the political interests of a specific president. The current FBI director, Christopher Wray, is scheduled to complete his 10-year term in 2027.",
      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Sunday raised that issue, pointing out that Wray was nominated by Trump during his first term.",
      "\"The Biden administration adhered to the long-standing norm that FBI directors serve out their full terms because the FBI director is a unique player in the American government system,\" Sullivan said during an interview on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\"",
      "\"So that's how we approach things. And we would like to ensure that the FBI remains an independent institution insulated from politics,\" Sullivan added.",
      "After Trump's announcement, the FBI said in a statement, \"Every day, the men and women of the FBI continue to work to protect Americans from a growing array of threats. Director Wray's focus remains on the men and women of the FBI, the people we do the work with, and the people we do the work for.\"",
      "Echoing Trump's 'deep state' claims",
      "Patel first gained favor with Trump in 2017 as a staffer on the House Intelligence Committee for then-Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif.",
      "Trump and his allies viewed the FBI investigation into Russia's interference in the election \u2014 and Moscow's outreach to members of the Trump campaign in 2016 \u2014 as an attempt to sabotage his presidency. Former FBI officials have said they launched the probe because they viewed Russia\u2019s activities as a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "Patel drafted a memo that accused the FBI of making mistakes in how it obtained a warrant to conduct surveillance of former Trump 2016 campaign adviser Carter Page. Many of the memo's assertions were later disproven.",
      "An inspector general report found significant faults with the FBI's surveillance during the Russia investigation but also found no evidence that federal authorities had acted in a politically partisan way.",
      "At the end of Trump's first term, Patel served in Trump's White House National Security Council, briefly as an adviser to the acting director of national intelligence and as chief of staff to Defense Secretary Chris Miller.",
      "Trump also suggested that Patel serve as the deputy CIA director. Then-CIA Director Gina Haspel, a career intelligence officer, threatened to resign if Patel was installed.",
      "\"It was a fairly conspiratorial environment at that point,\" recalled Marc Short, who served as chief of staff to then-Vice President Mike Pence.",
      "In a memoir Patel published last year, \u201cGovernment Gangsters,\u201d he called for replacing \u201canti-democratic\u201d civil servants in law enforcement and intelligence with \u201cpatriots.\u201d Trump praised the book, saying, \"We will use this blueprint to help us take back the White House and remove these Gangsters from all of Government!\"",
      "In an interview earlier this year on a YouTube show hosted by former Navy Seal Shawn Ryan, Patel said he would \u201cshut down\u201d the bureau\u2019s headquarters building in Washington, D.C., and \u201creopen it the next day as a museum of the \u2018deep state.\u2019\u201d",
      "A 'wizard' defending 'King Donald'",
      "Patel joined Trump on the 2024 campaign and has promoted his memoir, a film adaptation of the memoir and a line of children's books featuring him as a \"wizard\" defending \"King Donald.\"",
      "He has touted his charity, the Kash Foundation, as a way of helping the needy and providing legal defense funds to whistleblowers and others.",
      "According to\u00a0tax filings\u00a0for 2023, revenue for the foundation increased to $1.3 million last year, compared with $182,000 in 2022, with much of the money coming from donations. The foundation listed expenses of $674,000, with about $425,000 spent on advertising and marketing.",
      "Patel has also\u00a0endorsed on Truth Social \"Warrior Essentials,\" an anti-vaccine diet supplement that he said would \"reverse\" the effects of vaccines.",
      "In his memoir, Patel recounts how after law school he dreamed of landing a job with a law firm and a \"sky-high salary\" but that \"nobody would hire me.\" Instead, he became a public defender in Miami.",
      "Regarding his time as a Justice Department prosecutor, Patel has claimed he was the \"lead prosecutor\" for a federal case against a Libyan accused of taking part in the lethal 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi.",
      "\"I was the Main Justice lead prosecutor for Benghazi,\" Patel said in his YouTube interview with Ryan. But the Justice Department's 2017 announcement that the Libyan had been charged in the attack and of his conviction in a 2019 federal trial do not list Patel as the lead prosecutor or as part of the prosecution team.",
      "A former senior federal law enforcement official who served under Trump during his first term said that the Patel and Gaetz nominations were signs of Trump's disdain for the DOJ and FBI and both agencies' efforts not to be used to settle political scores.",
      "\"He's just going to run roughshod over them. He's thumbing his nose at the DOJ and FBI with these nominations,\" said the former official, who asked not to be named due to fear of retaliation by Trump. \"He's going to effect his will regardless of our norms.\""

    "published": "Sat, 30 Nov 2024 22:04:47 GMT",
    "summary": "In a post on Truth Social Saturday, President-elect Donald Trump said he would impose a 100% tariff on the BRICS geopolitical coalition of non-Western countries if the group moves away from trading using the U.S. dollar.",
    "story": [
      "In a post on Truth Social Saturday, President-elect Donald Trump said he would impose a 100% tariff on the BRICS geopolitical coalition of non-Western countries if the group moves away from trading using the U.S. dollar.",
      "\u201cThe idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWe require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey can go find another \u2018sucker!\u2019 There is no chance that the BRICS will replace the U.S. Dollar in International Trade, and any Country that tries should wave goodbye to America,\u201d the president-elect added.",
      "The BRICS alliance is a coalition of non-Western countries that convened for the first official BRIC summit in 2009, with Brazil, Russia, India and China joining the informal group. South Africa joined a year later, cementing the BRICS name.",
      "At a 2023 summit, the group expanded for the first time in over a decade, inviting Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "At the same summit, the issue of \u201cde-dollarization,\u201d or reducing the influence of the U.S. dollar in global trade, gained steam, though it\u2019s not a new idea for the group.",
      "Experts are skeptical that BRICS would succeed in creating its own currency for global trade, pointing to infighting between the member nations and major differences in the way the countries run their economies and financial institutions.",
      "Still, some members of BRICS are among the U.S.\u2019 largest trading partners, including India and China.",
      "According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the U.S.\u2019 goods-and-services trade with China totaled an estimated $758.4 billion in 2022 and the goods-and-services trade between the U.S. and India totaled an estimated $191.8 billion in 2022.",
      "Representatives for the BRICS countries\u2019 embassies in the U.S. did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "This is Trump\u2019s second time this week threatening to raise tariffs on outside nations.",
      "On Monday, the president-elect wrote in a post on Truth Social that he planned to impose a 25% tariff on products imported from Mexico and Canada. He argued that the purpose of the tariff would be to curb the fentanyl crisis.",
      "In the same post, he threatened to slap a 10% tariff on China, writing, \u201cI have had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States \u2014 But to no avail. Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America.\u201d",
      "On Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau traveled to West Palm Beach to meet with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort.",
      "On Saturday, in a separate social media post, Trump called their conversation \u201cvery productive.\u201d",
      "Trump added, \u201cI made it very clear that the United States will no longer sit idly by as our Citizens become victims to the scourge of this Drug Epidemic, caused mainly by the Drug Cartels, and Fentanyl pouring in from China. Too much death and hardship! Prime Minister Trudeau has made a commitment to work with us to end this terrible devastation of U.S. Families.\u201d",
      "In a letter sent to Trump Tuesday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum wrote that \u201cmigration and drug consumption in the United States cannot be addressed through threats or tariffs.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat is needed is cooperation and mutual understanding to tackle these significant challenges. For every tariff, there will be a response in kind, until we put at risk our shared enterprises,\u201d she added.",
      "Sheinbaum and Trump spoke over the phone on Wednesday, but the conversation spurred a \u201che said, she said\u201d controversy over whether Sheinbaum had agreed to stop immigration from Mexico into the U.S., something Trump alleged she did.",
      "In her own recollection of the conversation, Sheinbaum wrote on X that \u201cI explained to him the comprehensive strategy that Mexico has followed to address the migration phenomenon, respecting human rights. We reiterate that Mexico\u2019s position is not to close borders but instead build bridges between government and people.\u201d"

    "published": "Sat, 30 Nov 2024 12:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Polls weren\u2019t perfect in 2024, but they were more right than wrong \u2014 especially given the polling industry\u2019s challenges and recent misses.",
    "story": [
      "With nearly all the ballots now counted in the 2024 election, we can fully evaluate the performance of the national and battleground polls this cycle.",
      "The verdict: They weren\u2019t perfect, but they were more right than wrong \u2014 especially given the polling industry\u2019s challenges and recent misses.",
      "Let\u2019s start with the presidential horse race numbers. The\u00a0final national NBC News poll\u00a0had Donald Trump and Kamala Harris tied at 49% each, while the national\u00a0RealClearPolitics average\u00a0of the two-way contest was Harris 48.7%, Trump 48.6%. And\u00a0The New York Times\u2019 average\u00a0was Harris 49%, Trump 48%.",
      "The actual result in the popular vote as it currently stands, which you can expect to change slightly amid the very last counting of ballots: Trump 49.9%, Harris 48.3%.",
      "The 2024 national polls \u2014 on average \u2014 slightly overstated support for Harris and understated it for Trump. But they did turn in one of the best performances in presidential polling over the past decade, according to historical data from\u00a0the Pew Research Center.",
      "It was certainly better than polling\u2019s big miss in 2020.",
      "The battleground state polls also weren\u2019t far off the mark, either, although their misses were slightly larger than what we saw in the national polling.",
      "If there\u2019s a perception the polls were wrong in 2024, it\u2019s due\u00a0less to the actual level of polling error and\u00a0more to the mistaken impression that political horse race polls can be precise measurements \u2014 for example, that 49%-48% or 50%-48% results can\u00a0perfectly\u00a0predict who\u2019s going to win a contest\u00a0and by how much.",
      "Given polls\u2019 margins of error, historically low response rates when reaching voters, different assumptions about the electorate and, yes, past polling misses, expecting that kind of precision from political polls has become\u00a0a fool\u2019s errand.",
      "In other words, all that those 49%-48% and 50%-48% results can tell us is that the race is close.",
      "And that\u2019s\u00a0exactly\u00a0what the presidential election proved to be nationally and in the key battlegrounds.",
      "What else the polls got right",
      "Beyond signaling that the 2024 presidential election was competitive and uncertain, the polls nailed the political atmospherics that shaped the contest.",
      "That included an electorate that mostly saw the nation headed in the wrong direction,\u00a0with\u00a0an incumbent president, Joe Biden, whose approval rating was stuck in the low 40s \u2014 a\u00a0historical\u00a0danger zone for the party controlling the White House.",
      "As it turns out, the NBC News Exit Poll\u00a0found\u00a073% of voters saying they were angry or dissatisfied with the country\u2019s direction, and only 40% approved of Biden\u2019s job\u00a0performance.",
      "Additionally, the polls foretold many of the key demographic trends that ended up defining the 2024 election, including Trump\u2019s gains with Latino voters.",
      "The\u00a0NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC Latino poll\u00a0was among the surveys\u00a0showing\u00a0those Trump gains\u00a0well\u00a0before the election.\u00a0Many polls also caught on early to Biden and Democrats\u2019 relative struggles with young voters compared to other recent elections, particularly among young men.",
      "Another thing the polls got mostly right in the 2024 election were Democratic downballot candidates who had been\u00a0consistently overperforming\u00a0Biden (when he was in the race) and then Harris (once she became the nominee), as well as Republican downballot candidates who had been underperforming Trump in the polls.",
      "That dynamic played out in the election, with Democratic Senate candidates winning in\u00a0four states \u2014\u00a0Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin \u2014 despite Harris\u00a0losing\u00a0in those same states.",
      "What the polls got wrong",
      "But the polls, including the\u00a0NBC News survey, erred in overstating the size of the gender gap when it came to Harris\u2019 support among female voters and Trump\u2019s backing among men.",
      "According to the\u00a0exit poll, Harris won female voters by 8 points, and Trump won men by 13 points \u2014 a 21-point gender gap that was consistent with recent presidential elections. That was smaller than the 30-point-plus gender gap that the NBC News poll had been showing.",
      "(That said, there\u00a0was\u00a0a massive gender gap when combined with race and education, with Harris winning white women with college degrees by 16 points, and with Trump winning white men without college degrees by 40 points \u2014 a whopping 56-point gap\u00a0in the margin between those two different groups.)",
      "And most significantly, the polls once again understated Trump\u2019s support, albeit by a smaller amount than they did in 2020. That came despite polling outfits recalibrating and\u00a0using new weighting methods in\u00a0their polls in an attempt not to miss Trump\u2019s voters.",
      "Still, this was the first presidential cycle where many polls showed Trump either ahead or essentially tied \u2014 which wasn\u2019t the case in 2016 or 2020,\u00a0even though that\u2019s how those elections turned out in many contests.",
      "The mixed record on party ID",
      "One of the biggest divides in the 2024 polling were the national polls (including NBC,\u00a0CNBC\u00a0and The Wall Street Journal) showing Republicans with an advantage in party identification, versus other national polls that had Democrats with the lead in party ID.",
      "It was the latter group of polls that usually showed Harris ahead of Trump, although within the margin of error.",
      "But in the end, Republicans indeed enjoyed the advantage in party ID, according to the exit poll.",
      "That was a major story in the 2024 election: There were more self-identified Republican voters than Democratic voters."

      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Some Black Friday deals ended on Nov. 29, but many run through the weekend and even through Cyber Monday. Most retailers host their sales through the Cyber Five, meaning the five days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday. That said, the strongest overall deals usually end once Cyber Monday is over on Dec. 2.",
      "Prices for already on-sale products likely won't drop any lower on Cyber Monday. Retailers might add new deals to their offerings, but the selection is largely a repeat of Black Friday. Because of this, I wouldn\u2019t recommend holding out for Cyber Monday sales. If the current deal price fits within your budget, it\u2019s best to purchase it as soon as you find it \u2014 waiting could mean it sells out.",
      "Cyber Monday takes place every year on the Monday after Thanksgiving. It's historically the biggest and most profitable day for online shopping of the year.",
      "Cyber Monday 2024 is on Monday, Dec. 2. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday are no longer just 24-hour events \u2014 brands have morphed their holiday sales into weeks of doorbuster deals.",
      "How I found the best Black Friday deals",
      "All of my recommendations above are based on NBC Select\u2019s previous coverage and reporting. I also included products the NBC Select staff tested, including Wellness Award, Travel Award, Pet Award, Bed & Bath Award and Giftable Tech Award winners. All the deals I recommend are at least 20% off and highly rated with at least a 4.0-star average rating from hundreds of reviews. When possible, I ran deals through price trackers like CamelCamelCamel to ensure products are at their lowest price in at least three months.",
      "Why trust NBC Select?",
      "I\u2019m a reporter at NBC Select who\u2019s covered Black Friday and Cyber Monday since 2020. I\u2019ve reported on the history of these holidays and spoken to experts about what you should buy and skip during major shopping events, like today\u2019s. For this story, since not all Black Friday deals are worth it, I sifted through hundreds of on-sale products to find the best ones actually worth buying across key categories, like tech, travel, home, and kitchen.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 00:16:31 GMT",
    "summary": "President Joe Biden has decided to issue a pardon for his son Hunter and is expected to announce it Sunday night, according to a senior White House official with direct knowledge of the decision.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden has decided to issue a pardon for his son Hunter and is expected to announce it Sunday night, according to a senior White House official with direct knowledge of the decision.",
      "The decision marks a reversal for the president, who has repeatedly said he would not use his executive authority to pardon his son or commute his sentence. The pardon comes ahead of Hunter Biden\u2019s Dec. 12 sentencing for his conviction on federal gun charges. Hunter Biden also is set to be sentenced in a separate criminal case on Dec. 16, after pleading guilty in September on federal tax evasion charges.",
      "The pardon is expected to cover both Hunter Biden\u2019s gun charges conviction and guilty plea.",
      "The senior White House official said Biden decided over this weekend to grant his son a pardon and began to inform his senior aides on Sunday.",
      "Using his pardon power to assure Hunter Biden does not spend time in jail comes as the 82-year-old president is near the end of his term in the White House and has no future election to face. In recent months Biden has said he would not pardon his son or commute his sentence.",
      "\u201cI will not pardon him,\u201d the president said of his son in June after a jury found him guilty on three federal gun charges.",
      "President Biden has discussed issuing a pardon for his son with some of his closest aides since at least Hunter Biden\u2019s conviction in June, two people with direct knowledge of the discussions about the matter said. They said a decision was made at the time for the president to publicly say he would not pardon his son even though doing so remained on the table.",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters earlier this month that the president\u2019s position has not changed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been asked that question multiple times. Our answer stands which is \u2018no,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Asked Monday if the president is still committed to not issuing clemency for his son, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said: \u201cThe president has spoken to this.\u201d When pressed on whether Biden\u2019s position has changed, Bates replied, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to add what he said already.\u201d",
      "First lady Jill Biden has also said her husband would not pardon their son.",
      "\u201cJoe and I both respect the judicial system, and that\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d Jill Biden said in an interview with NBC News in June.",
      "Hunter Biden\u2019s criminal trial in June was the first involving the child of a sitting president.",
      "If Hunter Biden had been pardoned after the conclusion of that trial, the move would have ignited a political firestorm for his father, who was campaigning for re-election. Republicans have for years attacked Hunter Biden over his foreign business dealings and accused him and the president of corruption. They\u2019ve also argued that Hunter Biden was receiving special treatment by the Justice Department because of his father\u2019s political power.",
      "GOP criticism reached a crescendo in July 2023 when Hunter Biden entered a plea deal with federal prosecutors on the tax and gun charges, which collapsed after a judge raised questions about it. That development led to Attorney General Merrick Garland\u2019s appointment a couple weeks later of the U.S. attorney investigating Hunter Biden, David Weiss, as a special counsel.",
      "President Biden dropped out of the presidential race in July, but a pardon before Tuesday\u2019s election also could have generated political blowback on the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris after she took his place on the Democratic ticket.",
      "Together, the 12 counts Hunter Biden is convicted of or pled guilty to carry a maximum prison sentence of 42 years. But the maximum sentences typically aren\u2019t given out for convictions of these crimes. The Justice Department has said, for instance, that while the tax charges carry a maximum sentence of 17 years in prison, sentences are typically less than that.",
      "Biden was asked during an interview in June if he would rule out a pardon for his son, and answered, \u201cYes.\u201d",
      "Days later after Hunter Biden was convicted on federal gun charges by a jury in his hometown of Wilmington, DE, President Biden issued a statement saying he would respect the outcome. He then told reporters he would abide by the jury\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m extremely proud of my son Hunter,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe has overcome an addiction. He\u2019s one of the brightest, most decent men I know, and I am satisfied that I\u2019m not going to do anything. I said I abide by the jury decision. I will do that, and I will not pardon him.\u201d",
      "Neil Eggleston, who served as White House Counsel to President Obama, told NBC News he would advise Biden to pardon his son, though he has not been contacted or consulted by the current White House regarding any pardon preparations.",
      "\u201cIf I were his White House counsel, I would encourage him to pardon his son, Hunter,\u201d Eggleston said. \u201cThe clemency power has few limitations and certainly would extend to a Hunter Biden pardon.\u201d",
      "Eggleston\u2019s opinion that the president should pardon his son echoes other former Justice Department and White House officials previously involved in presidential pardons who told NBC News that they thought Biden should exercise this power in advance of the incoming Trump administration."

      "A week of major movie releases has propelled this holiday stretch to the highest-grossing Thanksgiving weekend ever at the box office.",
      "First, viewers packed theaters to sing with the witches of Oz and watch a vengeful gladiator face the horrors of the ancient Roman Colosseum. Then, they returned to the big screen to follow Moana\u2019s treacherous seafaring journey.",
      "The trio contributes to an estimated Thanksgiving weekend total of a whopping $420 million, according to box office data from Comscore \u2014 surpassing the previous record of $315.6 million set in 2018, led by the releases of \u201cRalph Breaks the Internet,\u201d \u201cCreed II\u201d and \u201cFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot only did we surpass the previous records for Thanksgiving,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst at the company.  \"This sets a completely new standard for what is possible over the Thanksgiving holiday for movie theaters.\"",
      "He added that \u201cMoana II\u201d in particular blew past box office experts\u2019 predictions by nearly $100 million.",
      "Grossing $221 million across North America since its Wednesday release, \u201cMoana 2\u201d has shattered box office records with the biggest five-day opening of all time \u2014 including the biggest Thanksgiving debut ever. The film soared past the previous five-day opening record of $204.6 million for \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie,\u201d and nearly doubled the $15 million Thanksgiving Day record formerly set by \u201cFrozen 2.\u201d",
      "Set in ancient Polynesia, the sequel to Disney\u2019s 2016 \u201cMoana\u201d follows Moana, the daughter of an island chief, as she leaves her home of Motunui to break a Polynesian god\u2019s curse and save her people.",
      "Disney Entertainment co-chairman Alan Bergman said in a statement that the film has \u201cfar surpassed our high expectations this weekend and is a testament to the phenomenon that \u2018Moana\u2019 has become.\u201d",
      "Universal\u2019s \u201cWicked\u201d and Paramount\u2019s \u201cGladiator II\u201d continued to rake in revenue throughout Thanksgiving weekend, with \u201cWicked\u201d grossing an estimated $117.5 million and defying gravity to become the highest-grossing Broadway adaptation of all time domestically. \u201cGladiator II\u201d also contributed $44 million to domestic box office earnings over the five-day period.",
      "Both films, released on Nov. 22 ahead of Thanksgiving week, have prompted widespread comparisons to last summer\u2019s \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d phenomenon, when \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d created an unprecedented box office event as well as a cultural moment unlike any other. Fans online quickly dubbed \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d\u2019s double feature \u201cGlicked.\u201d",
      "The lively Broadway show tunes of \u201cWicked,\u201d starring Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba and Ariana Grande as Glinda, contrasted with Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cGladiator II,\u201d an action-packed film with swords, violent battles and ancient warfare. The counterprogramming, combined with a buildup of social media buzz, boosted initial turnout in theaters \u2014\u00a0and they both continued to dominate the box office past the double feature release.",
      "Then \u201cMoana II\u201d opened on what Dergarabedian described as a \u201cperfect\u201d release date: the day before Thanksgiving, just as children are getting out of school and families are gathering.",
      "\u201cJust that one-two punch of family moviegoing excitement created by the \u2018Glicked\u2019 marketing hook, and then followed up by \u2018Moana II,\u2019 was an unbeatable combination,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cThis will lead into a really strong home stretch for movie theaters.\u201d"

      "Bode, who portrays the character Nessarose, the younger sister of Cynthia Erivo\u2019s Elphaba, posted a five-minute long video to her TikTok slamming the slew of negative comments she\u2019s received since the film premiered on Nov. 22.",
      "Despite enjoying seeing the outpouring of the love for the movie, Bode said there were reactions that made her feel \u201ca bit uncomfortable.\u201d",
      "In the video, Bode, who uses a wheelchair in real life and on screen, acknowledged that she is biased when it comes to her feelings about her own character. She said it was \"totally fine\" to make jokes about Nessarose\u2019s actions or personality because she is a fictional character.",
      "But, Bode explained, she was not okay with \u201caggressive comments and jokes about Nessa\u2019s disability,\u201d calling the messages \u201cdeeply uncomfortable because disability is not fictional.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, me, Marissa, is the person that is still disabled and in a wheelchair,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so it is simply a low hanging fruit that too many of you are comfortable taking.\u201d",
      "She continued, noting that in addition to her character, she's heard ableist jokes about herself. \u201cBefore even being cast in \u2018Wicked,\u2019 I had received comments just as me, Marissa,\u00a0not Nessa, around the words of \u2018Stand up for yourself,\u2019 \u2018I guess you can\u2019t stand him,\u2019 etc.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen these jokes are being made by non-disabled strangers with a punchline of not being able to walk, it very much feels like laughing at, rather than laughing with,\u201d she added.",
      "Bode said the most frustrating part about acknowledging such comments was how scared she was to voice her opinion.",
      "\u201cThese comments do not exist in a vacuum,\u201d she said. \u201cAggressive comments of wanting to cause harm and push Nessa out of her wheelchair, or that she deserves her disability are two very gross and harmful comments that real disabled people, including myself, have heard before.\u201d",
      "The actor noted that she has seen the repercussions that her peers have experienced when they have called out ableism.",
      "\u201cThese disabled creators\u2019 comments are flooded with ableist comments,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhen speaking on ableism, they\u2019re told to just take a joke and that they\u2019re asking for too much, and to stop complaining, to the point where some of my disabled peers have needed to take a break online for their own mental well being.\u201d",
      "Bode then implored those listening not to dismiss the feelings of others, but rather \u201clisten to the people or to the person that it is affecting and how it makes them feel.\u201d",
      "\u201cThankfully, I\u2019m at a place in my life today where I can recognize these jokes about disability are made out of ignorance,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say the same about Marissa 10 years ago, and it would have affected younger me a lot more, and I\u2019m worried that a younger version of myself is somewhere on the internet and is harmed by these comments.\u201d",
      "She concluded her message with a lesson she learned from \u201cWicked,\u201d adding, \u201cLastly, I want to say one of the major themes within \u2018Wicked\u2019 is having the ability to listen and to understand one another, and I truly hope that is something a lot of you can practice more and take with you.\u201d",
      "Bode made her feature film debut in the John M. Chu directed movie. The actor, who hails from Wisconsin, performed in plays in middle school and high school before she attended the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Los Angeles in order to study acting.",
      "Before landing the role of Nessarose, she worked as an after-school art teacher and mentor, telling TODAY.com that she felt \u201cbeyond privileged and lucky\u201d to be cast in \u201cWicked\u201d one year after she graduated from college. (Universal Pictures is owned by TODAY.com\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re not represented a lot and you don\u2019t see yourself, you still have \u2014 or at least I did have \u2014 a little bit of, \u2018I know what I\u2019m capable of. I know that I can act. I know other disabled talent that can act and can model,\u2019\u201d she explained. \u201cBut how much of the industry is willing to go for that and is willing to seek out disabled people and willing to listen? That was the one thing that I definitely bumped into.\u201d",

      "The \"Love Actually\" star was put on the spot on \"The Graham Norton Show\" when she was asked to show off a unique skill: playing music on her teeth.",
      "This was a high-stakes request since host Graham Norton was asking Knightley to perform a song from music legend Cher, who was also a guest on his show.",
      "Without hesitation, Knightley agreed and proceeded to pluck the chorus to \"Believe\" on her teeth to which a shocked, and clearly impressed Cher interjected, \"She's hitting the notes.\"",
      "\"I did it!\" Knightley responded, turning to Cher.",
      "The two shared a laugh and Cher asked Knightley how she knows which teeth will produce which tones.",
      "\"I don't know,\" Knightley told the singer. \"I learned to do it as a kid because there was somebody \u2014 there was a kid at school who was cool and he could do it.\"",
      "This wasn't the first time the actor has shown off her special talent on TV.",

    "story": [
      "While the rest of the world was waiting to see if Taylor Swift would make it to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas from her \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert in Tokyo to watch Travis Kelce, two women were invested in this year\u2019s game for a different reason.",
      "On Super Bowl Sunday, Samantha DiPippo,\u00a0Hallmark\u2019s senior vice president for programming, was at a watch party texting friends and fellow Hallmark executives.",
      "Their eyes were on the Kansas City Chiefs, a centerpiece of the NFL season if not for a star player\u2019s new courtship with the world\u2019s biggest pop performer, then for entering their fourth Super Bowl in five seasons. Those folks at Hallmark, a mainstay for romance lovers, had some ideas. Could another Lombardi Trophy for the Chiefs help bring those ideas to fruition?",
      "They were about to see \u2014 and the game was a nail-biter. The San Francisco 49ers held on to an early lead, 10-3, going into halftime. After Kansas City pulled ahead in the third quarter, the score was tied 19-19 by the fourth, sending the championship game into overtime.",
      "DiPippo\u2019s phone was blowing up with messages from her team. Then, thanks to the \u201cpower of the Chiefs,\u201d and, she says, \u201ca little bit of magic,\u201d Kansas City won 25-22 after a touchdown pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes to wide receiver Mecole Hardman.",
      "\u201cCandice (DiLavore, senior manager at Hallmark) and I are just texting back and forth thinking, \u2018I hope this happens. I hope this happens,\u2019\u201d DiPippo recalls.",
      "\u201cAs it got closer and closer, I was like, \u2018Are we making a movie?\u2019\u201d",
      "The answer to that question became a resounding yes. That movie is Hallmark\u2019s \u201cHoliday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story,\u201d premiering Saturday, Nov. 30. The movie airs at 8 p.m. ET on Hallmark Channel.",
      "The film was shot over a period of about 15 days on location in Kansas City, including three days at Arrowhead Stadium.",
      "As it got closer and closer, I was like, \u2018Are we making a movie?\u2019\u201d",
      "Hallmark executive Samantha DiPippo",
      "TODAY visited the set of the film in July to meet the stars and see Jenna Bush Hager make her film debut with a cameo. This was all while witnessing firsthand the hundreds of extras, dozens of Christmas trees and four football fields worth of lights to make, in the words of DiPippo, \u201cthe largest movie that Hallmark Channel\u2019s ever done.\u201d",
      "A match made in Hallmark heaven",
      "\u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d was announced in June as part of Hallmark\u2019s 2024 \u201cCountdown to Christmas\u201d lineup, which included a new partnership between the Chiefs and Hallmark.",
      "You\u2019re forgiven if you thought this movie would follow the true-to-life plot laid out by Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s romance, though.",
      "For the uninitiated, the Swift-Kelce timeline looks like this: In September 2023, Swift attended a Chiefs home game after rumors that Swift and tight end Travis Kelce were an item. Kelce notably had attended her \u201cEras Tour\u201d show in Kansas City just months before, and after the concert, used his podcast to tell the world that he tried (and failed) to give Swift his number.",
      "The rest, as many know, is history.",
      "Though Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s story produced an audience with an appetite for more football romance, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d isn\u2019t about a player and a pop star (Lifetime has that movie, and it's full of references to Swift); this follows a Chiefs employee and an NFL super fan.",
      "The screenwriter of \u201cHoliday Touchdown,\u201d Julie Sherman Wolfe, who\u2019s written more than 20 films for Hallmark, says she\u2019s always wanted to write \u201ca big football movie.\u201d The offer for this project came just a week after the Super Bowl, when her team, the 49ers, experienced that crushing defeat.",
      "When tackling the script, Wolfe says she leaned into her own family\u2019s unique superstitions and traditions.",
      "\u201cIt really was coming from a place in my heart about what we love the most about the game. I guess I would love people to know that you don\u2019t have to be a Chiefs fan to enjoy this movie,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThe Chiefs are in the movie, and it is about them, but it\u2019s about more than that. It\u2019s about things that are bigger than a team. It\u2019s about your team.\u201d",
      "\u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d first introduces Alana (Hunter King) and her family of Chiefs super fans who run a merch store. In comes Derrick (Tyler Hynes), who\u2019s in charge of fan engagement for the Chiefs and oversees the annual fan of the year contest (which is real, by the way). Alana\u2019s family is, of course, in the running.",
      "Though Wolfe says one doesn\u2019t have to love the Chiefs to appreciate the movie, its cameos will elate those who do: NFL mom Donna Kelce, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid and players Mecole Hardman, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and George Karlaftis all appear.",
      "The film even took inspiration from a real job in the Chiefs org. Jayne Martin has been the vice president of fan experience for 23 seasons. She says she is \u201cbridging the gap between the team and our fans.\u201d",
      "In March, Wolfe spoke with Martin to go over the premise of the storyline. They touched on Martin\u2019s job responsibilities and walked through potential scenarios that the film\u2019s leading man might encounter.",
      "\u201cIt was very important for (Wolfe) to ensure that the narrative was realistic,\u201d Martin says.",
      "Wolfe also brought aspects of her own football fandom to the plot. Alana\u2019s last name, Higman, came from her friend\u2019s maiden name, in honor of her family of Chiefs fans. Derrick\u2019s last name meanwhile is Young \u2014 a nod to the Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl competitors.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s for Steve Young from the 49ers,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cI had to put something in there.\u201d",
      "Then there\u2019s the Higmans\u2019 lucky Chiefs hat, which drives a subplot. Alana\u2019s family has a superstition: The Chiefs only go to the Super Bowl when that old beanie is worn by a family member on Christmas. Derrick doesn\u2019t believe it though \u2014 so when the hat goes missing, things go awry.",
      "Originally, Wolfe\u2019s draft referenced a vintage Chiefs baseball hat. After they sent a couple pages of the script to the Chiefs, DiPippo recalls one of the team\u2019s executives saying, \u201cI\u2019m reading this, and I\u2019m just thinking of my grandpa. My grandfather had a vintage Chiefs winter hat, and he would wear it all the time while he was shoveling snow, and that\u2019s my memory of him.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reading it, I\u2019m in my kitchen crying, and I text one of our other execs, and I said, \u2018It\u2019s a winter hat now, it\u2019s a winter hat now!\u2019\u201d DiPippo says.",
      "The Taylor Swift of it all",
      "It\u2019s undeniable that NFL experienced in 2023 season what has been dubbed the \u201cTaylor Swift effect,\u201d or the increase in exposure and female audience that follows the famous singer.",
      "\u201cThe magic, the romance of the Taylor Swift and Kelce union really got people in that romance mood \u2014 and romance plus football, right?\u201d Wolfe says.",
      "Exactly. For Hallmark, project ideas really started flowing in December 2023, after a pair of commercials leaned into just that.",
      "The first was a Hallmark ad, which aired Christmas Day on ESPN and stars Wolfe herself. In it, she sits at her computer as if typing a screenplay and lists the many ways the 2023 NFL season played out like a Hallmark movie, from \u201cincredible stories\u201d to \u201cunexpected romance.\u201d",
      "Then in January, the Chiefs released a postseason commercial titled \u201cFalling for Football,\u201d which is framed as a spoof trailer for a Hallmark-esque film about a diehard NFL fan who works at a Chiefs gift shop. (Sound familiar?) Hynes plays that fan, and Donna Kelce notably makes a cameo.",
      "DiPippo says the ESPN ad was a \u201cgreat catalyst\u201d to \u201cHoliday Touchdown.\u201d Then \u201cFalling for Football,\u201d which she calls a \u201clittle bit of a love letter to Hallmark,\u201d helped inspire the premise of the movie.",
      "Hynes says that when the Chiefs approached him for the \u201cFalling for Football\u201d commercial, it felt a little more \u201ctongue in cheek.\u201d But starring in \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d required him to treat the type of film spoofed in the commercial with integrity.",
      "\u201cThis is a legitimate Hallmark movie that is filled with all the heart, sincerity, warmth and joy that these movies always have,\u201d says Hynes, who has been in more than 15 Hallmark films, including six in the 2024 season.",
      "Martin says Chiefs fan demographics have changed since Swift first appeared at Arrowhead Stadium and is now about 57% female. \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d is an example of an attempt to reach and engage that new audience with the Chiefs and the NFL as a whole, Martin says.",
      "\u201cI honestly feel like everything about this movie was meant to happen when it happened.\u201d",
      "Screenwriter Julie Sherman Wolfe",
      "Though DiPippo believes Hallmark\u2019s partnership with the Chiefs could have happened without Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s 100% a pure Hallmark movie at heart,\u201d she says \u2014 Wolfe believes\u00a0a little of fate was still at play.",
      "\u201cI honestly feel like everything about this movie was meant to happen when it happened. It was meant to be,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThey got the right people and the right time and Travis and Taylor, and everything happened the way it was meant to happen for this movie.\u201d",
      "While appearing on TODAY Nov. 27, Hynes said it's \"impossible\" for the Swift-Kelce inspiration \"to not find its way into the movie.\"",
      "\"We're telling a multigenerational family story,\" he said. \"It feels like something quintessentially Hallmark while still servicing the people who want to see a big football movie.\"",
      "Christmas in July",
      "While \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d strays from Kelce and Swift's relationship, being part of the film is surreal for star Hunter King, who identifies as a Swiftie and has her own \u201cinvisible string\u201d connection to it all.",
      "Kelce and Swift\u2019s storybook romance notably started after he attended an \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert in Kansas City. On July 7, King attended a Kansas City show with her sister, actor Joey King, who appeared in Swift\u2019s \u201cMean\u201d music video in 2011, then in \u201cI Can See You\u201d almost 13 years later. At that July 7 concert, Joey King joined Swift onstage.",
      "\u201cThe day that we started filming I think was almost exactly a year later,\u201d Hunter King says. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Wait a second. It really is a full circle moment for me.\u2019\u201d",
      "The production kicked off shrouded in secrecy. Casting was \u201cincredibly difficult,\u201d DiPippo says, because they couldn\u2019t share many details about the project, and \u201ceverything had NDAs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the most secretive we\u2019ve ever had to be on any project,\u201d DiPippo says.",
      "So when production started up around Kansas City in July, it drew a crowd. In addition to Arrowhead Stadium, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d was filmed in the suburb of Independence, Missouri. The local pizzeria Square Pizza was transformed into a fictional barbecue restaurant called Norma & Nic\u2019s, managed by Donna Kelce\u2019s character. Inside, garlands with red ornaments bordered the ordering counter. Chiefs memorabilia hung on the walls, and wreaths decorated every door.",
      "The entire production involved about two dozen Christmas trees used in rotation \u2014 including 18 used in one day \u2014 as well as more than 400 yards of lights of \u201cevery color ornament bulb you can imagine,\u201d according to Daniel King, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u2019s\u201d production designer.",
      "Most behind the scenes were met with challenges, like set decorator Christi Whiteley, who was in charge of decorating and re-decorating up to 20 trees over the course of a few days, and property master Hunter Nelson, who made sure edible props like holiday meals and gingerbread houses were preserved at certain temperatures.",
      "And speaking of temperatures \u2014 the July heat was a hurdle for everyone.",
      "At Arrowhead, about 1,000 extras filmed inside the stadium, wearing parkas, scarves and other winter gear as the temperature reached 99 degrees, though felt more like 102, according to the Weather app.",
      "Hunter King filmed the Arrowhead Stadium scenes with an ice pack in her pants, a neck fan and an undershirt fan. On a discomfort scale of 1 to 10, Hunter King says filming in the sun felt like a 9.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s mostly the sweaters and then the coat over it, and in this heat and in the humidity, that\u2019s what really, really cranks it up a notch,\u201d she says.",
      "The heat didn\u2019t deter fans, though. At one point, while filming in Independence, there were about 70 people watching and standing in the sun, DiPippo recalls.",
      "\u201cThey were coming in Chiefs gear. There were kids, there were grandparents. It was just so cute to see how excited they were just because we\u2019re filming in their town,\u201d she says.",
      "TODAY\u2019s Jenna Bush Hager, who makes a cameo as a sports journalist, wore a heavy wool coat paired with a sweater-like tank top and white trousers. While rehearsing her scene on the field of Arrowhead, crew members held up umbrellas for the actors. One of the director\u2019s last calls before \u201caction\u201d was the cue to put on jackets. The first thing each actor did after hearing \u201ccut\u201d was rip those coats off.",
      "Chiefs players Mecole Hardman, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and George Karlaftis appear in the film during a game scene, so they got to dress in their Chiefs uniforms.",
      "And luckily for Andy Reid, the head coach\u2019s cameo only took about 15 minutes to film.",
      "Before he left Arrowhead after delivering his lines, Reid told Jenna that he never would have imagined his stadium as the setting for not one, but now two love stories.",
      "He adds, \u201cWhere we\u2019re at in today\u2019s world, this is a healthy thing.\u201d"

      "Lifetime's \"Christmas in the Spotlight,\" which premiered on the network Nov. 23, is seemingly inspired by the popular couple.",
      "The film focuses on mega pop-star Bowyn Sykes (Jessica Lord), who has blond hair, bright red lips and often sports a cat-eye. Bowyn is at the height of her career, focused on making music her fans love, baking for fun and not looking for a new boyfriend after being tired of only dating \u201cserious actors and indie rockers.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Drew \"Gonzo\" Gonville (Laith Wallschleger) is one of the best wide receivers in the league who, from the outside, seems like a playboy, but he really loves hanging out with his family and niece.",

      "The movie's writer Eirene Tran Donohue told USA Today that after seeing Swift cheering on Kelce during a football game, she thought, \"This could be a rom-com.\"",
      "\"I was like, \u2018Christmas and Taylor Swift?' These are the two great loves of my life,\" she said.",

      "Arrowhead is also notably the name of the Kansas City Chiefs' stadium, and the place where Swift and Kelce went public with their relationship.",

      "In \"Christmas in the Spotlight,\" Bowyn and Drew meet backstage at one of her concerts. Drew then attempts to get Bowyn\u2019s attention after their brief meet up backstage by inviting her to a game over social media.",

      "On their first date, which just so happens to be in Bowyn's private jet, the two have a myriad of song lyric interactions relating to Swift's \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.\" Bowyn says, \"I'm a tough kid.\" Then, Drew notes, \"You look like you\u2019re having the time of your life.\"",
      "Newscasters in the film are also given seemingly Swift inspired names: Chad Marcus (\"Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus\") and Aimee Hannah (\"Thank You Aimee\").",

      "The couple breaks up, but the world is still unaware they were ever together. While Bowyn privately mourns the relationship, the media begins speculating when she will release her next \"catchy break up\" song.",
      "Angry at the media and missing Drew, Bowyn decides to show up at his game and surprise him, sitting in his family box. (Swift and Kelce famously went public after she attended the Chiefs-Bears matchup at Arrowhead Stadium Sept. 24, 2023. She's since become a fixture in the box at Chiefs home games.)",
      "In the film, Drew, who initially wasn't having a great game, immediately turns it around after seeing Bowyn. After he scores a touchdown, Drew strikes Kelce's signature archer pose, which Swift has also made on stage during her aptly-titled song, \"The Archer.\"",

      "While initially heartbroken, Drew finally believes Bowyn after his brother (also a football player) and sister-in-law show him the full video, proving she tried to defend him.",
      "This moment could be a reference to the phone call audio Kim Kardashian leaked in 2016 between Swift and Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, over the rapper using her name in his song \"Famous.\" The footage caused the internet to turn on Swift, beginning the #TaylorSwiftIsOverParty trending hashtag. In 2020, the full, unedited clip was released online.",
      "After the truth is revealed, Drew resigns himself to thinking Bowyn is out of his league.",
      "Before Drew's football game and a Christmas gala he was supposed to host (notably featuring Bowyn as a guest performer), his niece gives him a friendship bracelet for good luck, spelling out an indecipherable mix of letters.",

      "(While Swift never confirms the inspiration for her songs, fans speculate that her songs \"The Alchemy\" and \"So High School\" are about Kelce.)",

      "Nevertheless, she gives a speech declaring her love in the hopes he is watching a livestream of her performance. (During each \"Eras Tour\" show, fans can often find a livestream on social media of the show filmed by a concert attendee.)",

      "\"I will always be your biggest cheerleader,\" he says, tying back to Swift's \"You Belong With Me\" once more, before asking her, \"Are we doing this?\"",

      "BEIRUT \u2014 Iran has thrown its support behind Syria's government after thousands of insurgents took control of the country's second-largest city of Aleppo and seized nearby towns and villages in a swift and surprise offensive.",
      "\u201cWe firmly support the Syrian army and government,\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was quoted as saying by the state-run IRNA news agency, before he set off for Syria\u2019s capital Damascus on Sunday. \u201cThe Syrian army will once again be victorious over these terrorist groups as in the past,\u201d he added.",
      "His comments came after the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based war monitor, reported that insurgents led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham had seized control of Aleppo International Airport.",
      "The Observatory said that fighters from the group posted pictures from the airport that would mean it\u2019s the first international airport to be controlled by insurgents. The rebels now control \u201cthe majority of\u201d Aleppo after forcing the governor, police and security branches to retreat from the city center, it added.",
      "Russian and Syrian jets responded by striking the rebel-held city of Idlib on Sunday, according to the Observatory and the Syrian state-run news network Al-Ikhbariyah, in a second day of intensive bombing aimed at pushing back the insurgents.",
      "At least 347 fatalities, including 40 civilians, have been reported during the clashes, according to the war monitoring group, which relies on a network of on-the-ground information sources. Five children and three women were among the civilians killed by bombardment and airstrikes, it added.",
      "National security adviser Jake Sullivan told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the U.S. has designated Hayat Tahrir al-Sham a \u201cterrorist enemy, so we have concerns, obviously, about that group.\u201d He also called for \u201cthe full implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions that can bring a measure of peace and stability to Syria.\u201d",
      "The fighting further exacerbates Syria\u2019s humanitarian crisis, already one of the world\u2019s worst after 13 years of civil war, which began in 2011 as a protest movement against Assad\u2019s authoritarian rule but has since killed an estimated half-million people.",
      "The offensive raises questions about the preparedness of Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s armed forces. In his first public comments released by the state news agency Saturday evening, Assad said Syria will continue to \u201cdefend its stability and territorial integrity against terrorists and their supporters.\u201d Syria is able to defeat them no matter how much their attacks intensify, he added.",
      "The Observatory reported Sunday that his forces were sending \u201clarge reinforcements and drawing a defensive line around several cities and villages\u201d in the Hama Governorate, which sits to the south of Aleppo.",
      "Iran\u2019s renewed commitment to Assad underscores the geopolitical stakes in the conflict and exposes a complex web of rivalries, factions and foreign interventions that ensure Syria\u2019s turmoil persists.",
      "While Assad controls roughly 70% of Syrian territory, the remaining areas are held by a mix of opposition groups, Kurdish forces and countries like the U.S. and Turkey.",
      "Tehran sees Syria as a critical part of its regional strategy, providing a land corridor to Hezbollah in Lebanon and a front against Israeli influence.",
      "Iran\u2019s support for Assad mirrors that of Russia, which helped to turn the tide of the war during 2016\u2019s battle for Aleppo between Syrian government forces and rebel fighters. The victory helped Assad to secure his hold on strategic areas of Syria, with opposition factions and their foreign backers controlling areas on the periphery.",
      "Moscow\u2019s intervention also secured its military presence in Syria, including the naval base at Tartus, while bolstering Assad\u2019s grip on power.",
      "A main backer of Syrian opposition groups, Turkey said in recent weeks its diplomatic efforts had failed to stop government attacks on opposition-held areas. These were in violation of a de-escalation agreement it sponsored along with Russia and Iran.",
      "However, its primary focus is undermining Kurdish-backed rebel groups near its borders. Ankara has said Syrian Kurdish fighters are an extension of the separatist Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), which has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since the 1980s \u2014 a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people.",
      "The U.S., for its part, opposes Assad, opposes Russia and opposes Iran, but has allied itself with Syrian Kurdish forces despite their fight against the United States\u2019 NATO ally Turkey.",
      "Sullivan said it was \u201cno surprise\u201d that rebels have tried to take advantage of the main players backing the Syrian government, because Iran, Russian and Hezbollah have been distracted by other conflicts.",
      "Inside Aleppo, schools and government offices were closed Saturday as most people stayed indoors, according to Sham FM radio, a pro-government station, although bakeries were open.",
      "The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Friday that Aleppo\u2019s two key public hospitals were reportedly full of patients, while many private facilities were closed.",

      "City have conceded at least twice in each of their last six games \u2014 the first time that\u2019s happened since May 1963. They\u2019re leaking goals, struggling for confidence and aging superstars returning from injury are rusty.",
      "Many point to the loss of exceptional defensive midfielder Rodri, who was just named the best player on the planet but suffered a season-ending knee injury in September. That is a big part of it but a team that has been imperious for so long shouldn\u2019t capitulate like this because one player is out. A perfect storm of bad luck, big mistakes and father time is threatening to capsize what is arguably the greatest team in English soccer history.",
      "Will superstar Mohamed Salah stay at Liverpool? Or lead a 'Last Dance' style exodus?",
      "I was one of a handful of journalists to chat with Salah about his much-debated future last weekend as he scored twice late on to lead Liverpool to a comeback 3-2 win at Southampton.",
      "\u201cWell, we are almost in December and I haven\u2019t received any offers yet to stay at the club. I\u2019m probably more out than in,\u201d Salah said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to retire soon so I\u2019m just playing, focusing on the season and I\u2019m trying to win the Premier League and hopefully the Champions League as well. I\u2019m disappointed but we will see.\u201d",
      "Salah is Liverpool\u2019s all-time leading Premier League goalscorer. He\u2019s been sensational this season and the talisman in Liverpool\u2019s return to being a perennial challenger for all of soccer\u2019s top trophies.",
      "But Salah, 32, is out of contract this summer, along with Liverpool\u2019s captain Virgil van Dijk, 33, who is one of the best defenders of all-time, and Trent Alexander-Arnold, 26, one of the greatest products of Liverpool\u2019s youth system who has won everything in the game along with Salah and Van Dijk over the past seven years. Salah is to Liverpool what Michael Jordan was to the Chicago Bulls. Van Dijk is Rodman. Alexander-Arnold is Pippen.",
      "That these three stars are out of contract this summer, while Liverpool are having one of their best-ever starts to a season, is puzzling for most Liverpool fans.",
      "Salah\u2019s comments over the last week cranks up the pressure on Liverpool\u2019s owners, the Fenway Sports Group (FSG) who also own the Boston Red Sox, to give these three superstars huge new contracts. That isn\u2019t necessarily going to happen due to Liverpool\u2019s wage structure, league-imposed spending limits, the age of Salah and Van Dijk, and the direction Michael Edwards, who has just returned to Liverpool as their new Chief Executive of Football, wants to go in.",
      "Salah, and either Van Dijk or Alexander-Arnold, could still stay at Liverpool after adding a few more winners\u2019 medals around their neck this season. But surely not all three. This situation has a very \u201cLast Dance\u201d feel about it."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 The countryside came to the capital as thousands of farmers packed into London streets around Britain\u2019s Parliament to protest changes to tax rules.",
      "Some drove tractors, others brought hay bales, many carried signs saying \u201cno farms, no food.\u201d All were protesting against the new Labour government\u2019s decision to tax inherited agricultural property.",
      "\u201cBritish farmers make less than 1% profit,\u201d Tom Bradshaw, the president of the National Farmers Union (NFU), said in a statement to NBC News shortly after last week\u2019s protests. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the money in the bank to pay this proposed family farm tax.\u201d",
      "It was the first major demonstration in London since Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s center-left Labour government took power in July. Rachel Reeves, his finance minister, announced the changes, which are set to come into effect in April 2026, in her annual budget last month.",
      "Similar to estate tax in the U.S., inheritance tax in the U.K. is charged at 40% on the property, possessions and money of someone who has died, above a threshold of 325,000 pounds, or around $410,000. A spousal exemption means married couples and civil partners can pool their allowances to pass on up to $1.2 million to their heirs tax-free.",
      "But under the current rules, land holdings used for crops or rearing animals, plus farm buildings, cottages and houses, have been handed down through the generations without the need to pay the tax, meaning together the total value of a tax-free inheritance could be around $3.77 million.",
      "From April 2026, farms worth more than $1.3 million will face a 20% tax when they are passed on to the next generation, half the usual rate.",
      "Defending the changes, which supporters say will recoup money from wealthy people who have bought up agricultural land as an investment and driven up the cost of farmland, Starmer said at the Group of 20 summit in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro last week that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of farms would be \u201cunaffected\u201d by the taxation changes.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.K.\u2019s Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) also said in a statement that \u201caround 500 claims of Agricultural and Business Property Relief each year will be impacted,\u201d figures that were \u201cbased off actual claims data.\u201d",
      "A separate report published Monday by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent economics research institute, also said that \u201csignificantly less than 500 estates per year\u201d will be affected by the changes.",
      "But the NFU, along with the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), a membership organization representing land, property and businesses owners, have estimated that tens of thousands more will be affected.",
      "\u201cMinisters claim the inheritance tax cap hits only the rich, but it could put 70,000 farms \u2014 big and small \u2014 at risk. All will be questioning their future, and whether they\u2019ll have one to pass on,\u201d CLA President Victoria Vyvyan said in a statement.",
      "Noting the disparity between the government\u2019s figure and its own, on its website the CLA said it was \u201clooking at the impact on farms over a generation, whereas the government\u2019s figure is only looking at a single year. We are not \u2014 claiming that 70,000 farms will shut down or have to pay the tax a year.\u201d The website defines a generation as 40 years.",
      "The NFU pointed NBC News to a Nov. 21 report it produced with economists who formerly worked for Britain\u2019s Treasury and Office for Budget Responsibility that says around 75% of commercial family farms would be required to pay the tax.",
      "The protest in London was supported by JCB, which manufactures a wide range of farming equipment and machinery for construction. After giving its employees the day off to join the demonstrations, the company said in a statement that it was \u201ccrucial that food from Britain feeds our nation as not all the food we need can come from abroad.\u201d",
      "Despite the gray skies and wet weather, those who did join witnessed scenes similar to those seen in other European cities, where roads have been snarled by farmers protesting a variety of issues including grain prices and European Union farming policies.",
      "But while some of the protests on the continent turned violent, in London the mood was much more jovial as\u00a0children on toy tractors pedaled around Parliament Square after a rally addressed by speakers including former \u201cTop Gear\u201d TV host and celebrity farmer Jeremy Clarkson.",
      "While some promised to escalate the protests unless the hike is removed, Starmer\u2019s government, which won a large majority in July\u2019s general election, looks set to stand firm.",
      "\u201cOur commitment to our farmers is steadfast \u2014 we have committed \u00a35 billion to the farming budget over two years, including more money than ever for sustainable food production,\u201d the Defra spokesperson said.",
      "Environment Minister Steve Reed also told reporters last week that the government was \u201ctaking decisions because they\u2019re in the interest of every part of the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be sorry for trying to make this country\u2019s economy work and our public services work again,\u201d he said."

      "The 13-year civil war in Syria has roared back into prominence\u00a0with a surprise rebel offensive\u00a0on Aleppo, one of Syria\u2019s largest cities and an ancient business hub. The push is among the rebels\u2019 strongest in years in a war whose destabilizing effects have rippled far beyond the country\u2019s borders.",
      "It was the first opposition attack on Aleppo since 2016, when a brutal air campaign by Russian warplanes helped Syrian President Bashar Assad retake the northwestern city. Intervention by Russia, Iran and Iranian-allied Hezbollah and other groups has allowed Assad to remain in power, within the 70% of Syria under his control.",
      "The surge in fighting has raised the prospect of another violent front reopening in the Middle East, at a time when U.S.-backed Israel is fighting Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both Iranian-allied groups.",
      "Robert Ford, the last-serving U.S. ambassador to Syria, pointed to months of Israeli strikes on Syrian and Hezbollah targets in the area, and to Israel\u2019s ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon this week, as factors providing Syria\u2019s rebels with the opportunity to advance.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some of the key aspects of the new fighting:",
      "Why does it matter?",
      "Assad has been at war with opposition forces seeking his overthrow for 13 years, a conflict that\u2019s killed an estimated half-million people. Some 6.8 million Syrians have fled the country, a refugee flow that helped change the political map in Europe by fueling anti-immigrant far-right movements.",
      "The roughly 30% of the country not under Assad is controlled by a range of opposition forces and foreign troops. The U.S. has about 900 troops in northeast Syria, far from Aleppo, to guard against a resurgence by the Islamic State. Both the U.S. and Israel conduct occasional strikes in Syria against government forces and Iran-allied militias. Turkey has forces in Syria, as well, and has influence with the broad alliance of opposition forces storming Aleppo."

      "BEIRUT \u2014 Islamist rebels breached neighborhoods in Syria\u2019s second-largest city of Aleppo and clashed with government military forces after detonating two car bombs Friday. The incident, reported by a leading war monitoring group and The Associated Press, has renewed international attention on a country wracked by civil war and extremism for\u00a0more than a decade.",
      "The Syrian Observatory of Human Rights, the monitoring organization, said fierce clashes were underway between the attacking insurgents and regime troops. The fighting is a significant escalation since rebels launched a surprise offensive Wednesday, seizing towns and villages as they advanced toward Aleppo.",
      "The breach marked the first time opposition forces besieged the city since 2016, when they were driven out of Aleppo\u2019s eastern neighborhoods during a military operation in which Syrian troops were supported by Russia and Iran. Four years ago, a ceasefire brought an end to the most intense violence, but the new push from rebels has upended a period of relative calm.",
      "The rebels appear to have gained momentum by the diminished strength of Iran-backed groups such as Hezbollah throughout the region, illustrating how the conflicts in the Middle East feed off one another.Witnesses who spoke to The Associated Press said Aleppo residents were fleeing from areas on the western edge amid missiles and exchanges of gunfire. The AP said an insurgent commander posted a recorded message on social media urging the city\u2019s residents to cooperate with the rebels. The rebels are led by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS.",
      "Syrian armed forces were repelling attacks, the\u00a0Syrian Defense ministry said\u00a0Friday, adding government forces involved in combat operations were able to regain control over some areas.",
      "\"Our armed forces have inflicted heavy losses on the attacking organizations, resulting in hundreds of deaths and injuries among the terrorists,\" Syria's general command of the army and armed forces said in a statement translated by NBC News. \"Dozens of vehicles and armored carriers have been destroyed, and we have successfully shot down and destroyed seventeen drones.\"",
      "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of on-the-ground information sources, said at least 121 people have been killed since the start of HTS\u2019 shock offensive, including at least 20 civilians.",
      "Syrian state media reports cited by the AP said insurgent-fired projectiles struck student accommodations at Aleppo\u2019s university in the city center, killing four people, including two students.",
      "The Syrian civil war started in early 2011 with a wave of protests against the authoritarian rule of President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, bolstered by arms shipments from Iran and Russia, cracked down forcefully on the popular uprisings, setting off a spiral of violence and fueling an aggressive insurgency.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 British lawmakers voted on Friday in favor of a landmark bill that would for the first time help terminally ill adults end their lives.",
      "The initial parliamentary vote in favor \u2014 330 for and 275 against \u2014 starts months of debate and possible changes to the bill as it works through the House of Commons and the upper house of Parliament, the House of Lords.",
      "If eventually passed, it will see the U.K. follow other countries such as Canada and Australia, as well as some U.S. states, and represent one of the most significant social reforms in a generation.",
      "The bill would allow mentally competent adults in England and Wales with fewer than six months to live to request and receive help to end their lives.",
      "Assisted suicide is currently illegal in Britain and carries a prison sentence of up to 14 years. That same sentence will remain for anyone found guilty of tricking, pressuring or coercing someone into making the choice if the bill is ultimately passed.",
      "Debate around the contentious bill, which will continue to be discussed in Parliament in the run up to the vote, has prompted an uncommon outpouring of politicians\u2019 emotions and moral persuasions in a political system where voting usually happens along party lines.",
      "It has drawn comment from former prime ministers, religious leaders, judges and doctors, and shone a light on one of the few issues \u2014 birth and taxes perhaps being the only other two \u2014 that happen to everyone. The outcome of the vote looks to be uncertain given how many members of parliament have expressed their ambivalence on the issue.",
      "Those in favor of the bill say such a law would relieve the unnecessary suffering of those with terminal illness and provide dignity and agency in a situation where the two are in short supply. Opponents say it could put the country on a slippery slope and place vulnerable people, such as the elderly or handicapped, at risk or put them under pressure to end their lives in order to not burden their loved ones.",
      "Kim Leadbeater, an MP for the ruling Labour Party, proposed the bill, arguing it has \u201cthree layers of scrutiny.\u201d Two independent doctors and a judge will be needed to sign off on any decision before the state allows a patient end their life.",
      "One example of a similar law put forward by detractors of the bill is that of Canada, where government figures show that 4% of deaths are due to patients opting to end their lives. Euthanasia, which is also allowed in Canada and Netherlands and allows for doctors to give lethal injections, is different from assisted suicide and is not being debated in the U.K.",
      "A 2023 government report showing figures from 2022 showed a 30% jump in the number of people choosing to end their lives, with more than a third of the 13,000 exercising their right saying their decision was partly due to feeling like a burden on loved ones. Canada currently plans to extend the law in 2027 to those whose sole underlying condition is related to mental health.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been lots of assurances about safeguards,\u201d Gordon Macdonald, CEO of advocacy group Care Not Killing told Reuters. \u201cBut in every jurisdiction in the world where it\u2019s happened, the safeguards have been removed or eroded over time.\u201d",
      "Even so, the U.K. bill has broad public support \u2014 a poll conducted last week by YouGov showed that 73% of the British public back the bill as opposed to 13% who said they don\u2019t.\u00a0While the current prime minister Keir Starmer has previously opposed assisted dying, he has not said how he plans to vote Friday.",
      "Terminally ill broadcasting veteran Esther Rantzen, 84, has stage four cancer and has long supported a change in the law.\u00a0\u201cIf I want assisted death, which I do because I want to have the choice, I will have to go to Switzerland\u2026 to achieve that,\u201d she told Sky News.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m fortunate because I can afford to go,\u201d she added, \u201cbut for all the hundreds of thousands of people in the future who can\u2019t afford that and who want to die in their own homes surrounded by the people they love\u2026 they will have the choice if this law is changed and that would be a very good change.\u201d",
      "Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown and three of his Conservative successors \u2014 Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss \u2014 have all publicly come out against the bill. But former-Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron this week said that he had reversed his opposition to the U.K. bill.",
      "Writing in The Times of London newspaper, Cameron said the bill specifically excludes mental health or disability grounds and that the safeguards contained in the bill will allow it to meaningfully reduce human suffering.",
      "Cameron also refuted arguments \u2014 such as the one posed by the current health secretary Wes Streeting \u2014 that the expense and additional administration could add to pressure on the country\u2019s beleaguered National Health Service. The former prime minister wrote that the bill would apply to a very small number of cases and that \u201cthe NHS exists to serve patients and the public, not the other way around.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Starbucks, one of the world\u2019s most recognizable, if sometimes tedious, symbols of global capitalism, has a knack for choosing unique spots to open coffee shops. A 1,200-year-old castle in Prague houses one, an ancient former mosque in Cordoba another, and a decommissioned\u00a0power station in London a third.",
      "Its latest new venture is a foray into the last frontier of the Cold War \u2014 even as tensions between South Korea and its hermetic neighbor to the north have risen in recent years.",
      "As of Friday, visitors to Aegibong Peace Ecopark near Gimpo, South Korea, can take in the views across the demilitarized zone and the North Korean border.",
      "Baek Hea-soon woke up at 4 a.m. on Friday and traveled from the nearby city of Gimpo \u2014 30 miles northwest of Seoul \u2014 to be one of the first in a line of hundreds outside the coffeehouse\u2019s latest outpost.",
      "\u201cI wish I could share this tasty coffee with the people living in North Korea right in front of us,\u201d\u00a0Baek, 48, told Reuters, as she observed the front line of a conflict that has technically not ended. The two Koreas are still at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.",
      "Tensions between the two Koreas are clear to see.",
      "Last month, Pyongyang blew up sections of inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the border as part of its push to scrap its long-standing goal of unification. North Korea has also this year sent thousands of balloons attached to bags of trash, old batteries and manure across the border, with one landing in Seoul\u2019s presidential compound.",
      "Still, the heavily militarized border that bisects the Korean peninsula has long been an unlikely draw for foreign and local tourists, and now Gimpo is getting in on the action.",
      "Along with the Starbucks, the city has launched a new public bus line that will take tourists to the park, once they have passed through a military checkpoint.",
      "\u201cPeople used to think of this area near the North Korean border as a dark and gloomy place,\u201d Kim Byung-soo, mayor of Gimpo, told NBC News. \u201cBut now \u2026 this place could now become an important tourist destination for security [and] peace that can be seen as young, bright and warm.\u201d",
      "As the mayor spoke, customers took pictures of the Starbucks logo on their mugs against the backdrop of the north. The coffeehouse\u2019s patrons can see a North Korean village on Songaksan Mountain, as well as the environmental preservation area that the civilian-free DMZ is home to.",
      "For some customers, enjoying a cup of joe while overlooking fields and a North Korean village is calming \u2014 even if Kim Jong Un has repeatedly threatened to send nuclear weapons across the border.",
      "\u201cHaving a cup of coffee here, I feel like I can look at North Korea, a nation divided from us, with a bit more calm and peace of mind,\u201d 80-year-old Vietnam War veteran Lim Jong-chul told NBC News. \u201cBefore, the concept of security felt rigid and tense, but now, with this cafe here, it feels more peaceful and reassuring.\u201d"

      "Tech billionaire Elon Musk is already huge in China \u2014 but now his 76-year-old mother is a rapidly rising star there as well.",
      "Maye Musk, a model and dietitian, has been a frequent visitor to China since last year, gaining a big online following from a Chinese public curious to know more about the woman who raised their business idol while becoming a celebrity in her own right as a \u201csilver-haired influencer.\u201d",
      "During her travels, she makes a point of supporting her son\u2019s business interests, noting in social media posts how many Teslas she sees on Chinese roads even as the U.S. electric vehicle maker faces growing competition from domestic rivals such as BYD.",
      "She is also full of praise for the country.",
      "\u201cChina is so advanced in roads, tunnels, buildings, infrastructure, and ports,\u201d she wrote on her son\u2019s social media platform X in October. \u201cAlways impressed when I visit.\u201d",
      "Musk told Women\u2019s Wear Daily in February that she visited 12 Chinese cities last year for speaking engagements and modeling. Speaking to the publication in New York, she brushed off the idea that Chinese tensions with the U.S. might dampen her travel there.",
      "\u201cWhen I go to China, everybody\u2019s happy, friendly and fun,\u201d she said. \u201cEven with my friends here, they all want to visit China now.\u201d",
      "Musk has quickly amassed a substantial number of followers on Chinese social media, including about 575,000 on Xiaohongshu, China\u2019s equivalent of Instagram, and 355,000 on Douyin, China\u2019s equivalent of TikTok.",

      "The book traces Musk\u2019s \u201cunconventional career path,\u201d Dudarenok said, as well as her struggle to provide for her three children as a single mother after divorcing their father, Errol Musk, at age 31.",
      "\u201cShe basically did it her way,\u201d Dudarenok said. \u201cThat was one message that resonated very strongly.\u201d",
      "The other appeal, she said, \u201cwas that people wanted to figure out, how do you actually give birth [to] and raise billionaires?\u201d",
      "The book has found an audience among working women in China, who are increasingly resistant to social pressure to get married and have children, even as the Chinese government clamps down on the feminist movement and says it is up to them to boost the national birth rate.",
      "\u201cA must-read for all girls! Thank you for showing us the resilience and strength of women,\u201d one Xiaohongshu user wrote.",
      "Though much of the initial interest in Maye Musk came because of Elon, \u201cshe is really becoming kind of her own personality,\u201d Dudarenok said.",
      "Older Chinese, who in the past would have devoted all their spare time and money to their grandchildren and other family members, have in recent years realized \u201cthat they have this whole life ahead of them, 20, 30 years ahead,\u201d Dudarenok said.",
      "\u201cThey have hobbies, they look after themselves in terms of fashion, nutrition, skin care and whatnot,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they love to see those role models of somebody who is aging gracefully.\u201d",
      "For Musk, that means appearing on magazine covers and lots of opportunities to endorse products. She has walked the runway for Chinese apparel brand JNBY and appeared at an event in Shanghai this year for the sportswear brand Fila.",
      "She is also a global brand ambassador for Chinese mattress brand AISE Baobao, attending a store opening in Shanghai this month, and has appeared in smartphone advertisements for Chinese consumer electronics manufacturer Oppo.",
      "Her popularity in China could come in handy for her son. Though Elon Musk is still widely admired, Dudarenok said there has been a \u201ccooling off\u201d in public opinion since he financially backed the campaign of President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to be tough on China.",
      "Given his close ties to Trump \u2014 who has asked Musk to head up a new \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d \u2014 Musk could take part of the blame if U.S.-China relations deteriorate under the new administration.",
