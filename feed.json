      "Lucinda Williams isn\u2019t easily intimidated, but it would be hard for any musician not to shudder at the task before her",
      "Lucinda Williams isn't easily intimidated, but it would be hard for any musician not to shudder at the task before her.",
      "The mission? Record an album of Beatles songs \u2014 only one of the best-known catalogs in popular music \u2014 in the same London studio where most of the originals were made. She and her band had just three days.",
      "The result, \u201cLucinda Williams sings the Beatles from Abbey Road,\u201d becomes public on Friday. It's the seventh in her series of \u201cLu's Jukebox\u201d projects and the first one that will be made available on streaming services.",
      "The Nashville-based singer-songwriter delivers her take on 12 Beatles songs, most of them from the band's later period. She takes on hits like the Paul McCartney ballads \u201cLet it Be\u201d and \u201cThe Long and Winding Road,\" while also choosing the more obscure \u201cWhite Album\u201d cuts \u201cYer Blues\u201d and \u201cI'm So Tired.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt felt like the Holy Grail,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is where the Beatles recorded. And we're going to go in there where they made all of these majestic, classic, amazing songs?\u201d",
      "Abbey Road was the idea of her manager-husband, Tom Overby, and they blocked out a small amount of time before a British tour earlier this year. Her Beatles fan producer, Ray Kennedy, said he believed Williams was the first major artist to use the London studio to remake the band's work.",
      "And, yes, it was intimidating. Fortunately, it was a modern, working studio and did not feel like working in a museum. One quirk was the control room was on a different floor than where the musicians were, and Williams repeatedly climbed the stairs to hear playbacks. \u201cThe engineers all looked at me, like, \u2018what are you doing here,'\u201d she said.",
      "Stripping down songs for the band to build up again revealed complexities they hadn't anticipated. She particularly enjoyed John Lennon's \u201cYer Blues.\u201d \u201cThe depth and the edginess and the grittiness of it kind of surprised me,\" she said.",
      "They stuck to the basics of her rock band's sound. The orchestral flourishes of \u201cThe Long and Winding Road,\u201d for example, are replaced by an organ and pedal-steel guitar.",
      "\u201cMy greatest fear was, I didn't want to sound like a cover band doing Beatles songs,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd everyone I've talked to about it said you don't have to worry about that, that you achieved your goal of staying true to the songs while still sounding like you.\u201d",
      "During the pandemic, Williams made six \u201cLu's Jukebox\u201d projects, themed in-studio concerts. They included Tom Petty and Bob Dylan songs, albums of Southern soul, '60s country classics and holiday music. She made a disc of Rolling Stones material only days before having a stroke in November 2020.",
      "Sold largely by mail order, they haven't been available to stream, although a spokesperson said they're likely to be made available in that format in the future."

      "ATLANTA -- The long-running gang and racketeering trial that led Atlanta rapper Young Thug to plead guilty in October ended on Tuesday with the last two defendants found not guilty of racketeering, murder and gang-related charges.",
      "Deamonte Kendrick, who raps as Yak Gotti, was acquitted of all charges and Shannon Stillwell was found guilty only of gun possession. The verdicts came nearly two years after jury selection began and a year after opening statements in a trial plagued with problems.",
      "The original, sweeping indictment used song lyrics and social media posts as evidence and charged 28 people with conspiring to violate Georgia\u2019s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Young Thug, a Grammy-winning artist whose real name is Jeffery Williams, was set free on probation after he pleaded guilty in October to gang, drug and gun charges.",
      "Kendrick and Stillwell were charged in a 2015 drive-by shooting outside an Atlanta barbershop that killed Donovan Thomas Jr., also known as \u201cBig Nut,\u201d who prosecutors said was in a rival gang. Stillwell also was charged with fatally shooting Shymel Drinks at a red light in 2022, allegedly in retaliation for the killings days earlier of two associates in a gang known as YSL, which prosecutors said was co-founded by Young Thug.",
      "Stillwell was sentenced to the 10-year maximum for possessing a firearm as a convicted felon previously convicted of a felony involving a gun, with credit for the two years he already served and the balance to be served on probation.",
      "Nine of the defendants, including the rapper Gunna, accepted plea deals before the trial began, and four more pleaded guilty during the trial, in October. Charges against 12 others remain pending. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case. That left Kendrick and Stillwell, both of whom were stabbed while in jail \u2014 Stillwell last year and Kendrick on Sunday.",
      "Tuesday's verdicts were a major setback for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Critics had criticized her use of the state\u2019s anti-racketeering law, which she also used to bring charges against President-elect Donald Trump for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "\u201cWe always respect the verdict of a jury,\u201d said Jeff DiSantis, a spokesperson for Willis.",
      "Defense attorneys said the state relied on faulty evidence \u2014 song lyrics, cherry-picked social media posts and unreliable witness testimony \u2014 to create a misleading narrative about young men who turned to music to escape economic hardship and difficult pasts.",
      "The jury's decision left Kendrick\u2019s mom, Tasha Kendrick, in tears.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just thankful for a lot of things right now,\u201d she said. \u201cMy emotions are all over the place right now.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Williams and two others founded Young Slime Life in association with the national Bloods gang in 2012. The 33-year-old artist also has a record label called Young Stoner Life. Deamonte Kendrick is featured on two of the most popular songs from the label\u2019s compilation album Slime Language 2, \u201cTake It to Trial\u201d and \u201cSlatty,\u201d as well as Young Thug\u2019s \u201cSlime Sh-t,\" which prosecutors presented as evidence.",
      "Williams entered a risky \u201cblind\u201d plea \u2014 meaning he pleaded guilty without an agreement on his sentence \u2014 in October. Williams\u2019 lawyer said he felt like they were winning, but the rapper complained that sitting in court felt like \u201chell\u201d and wanted to go home to his family. Judge Paige Reese Whitaker let him out of jail on probation with tight restrictions, including a 10-year ban from metro Atlanta except for certain occasions.",
      "The trial shook Atlanta\u2019s rap scene. Williams grew up in an Atlanta housing project and became a highly successful artist who added his own melodic twist to the modern Southern trap sound he helped popularize.",
      "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Ural Glanville was removed from the case in July after he met with prosecutors and a state witness without defense attorneys present. Kendrick\u2019s attorney Doug Weinstein said defendants got a \u201cfair trial\u201d once Whitaker took over. Among other things, she reprimanded the prosecution for being disorganized and not sharing evidence.",
      "During closings, Stillwell\u2019s defense attorney Max Schardt sought to cast doubts on the gang investigators and other state witnesses. Several alleged YSL members testified they had lied to police to stay out of prison. Schardt said officers had threatened them with long prison sentences if they didn\u2019t say the right thing.",
      "Prosecutors said those witnesses were honest with police but lied on the stand, in front of the people they had \u201csnitched\u201d on. They said their statements were corroborated by other evidence such as songs and social media posts where they said defendants were \u201cbragging about murder.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors threw together lyrics, social media posts and irrelevant evidence to \u201csee what sticks,\u201d Weinstein argued, but did not prove they were connected to a criminal enterprise.",
      "While defendants did commit crimes in the past, Schardt said during closings, it was to make money for themselves in communities stripped of economic opportunity \u2014 not to advance a gang. And music let some of them move on.",
      "\u201cAs a whole, we know the struggles that these communities have had,\u201d Schardt said. \u201cA sad, tacit acceptance that it\u2019s either rap, prison or death.\u201d",
      "Both defense attorneys said Kendrick and Stillwell have other pending charges but hope to get them released from jail as soon as possible.",
      "Stillwell is not \u201cblind to the fact that he is getting a second chance at life,\" Schardt said.",
      "Weinstein said Kendrick, who is close friends with Young Thug, was laser-focused on his music career before the state pulled him back into the criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so happy that he can kind of draw a line in the sand now,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cAll of this is behind him. He can get on with his life and not worry about this nonsense.\u201d",

      "Forty years ago, on Dec. 8, 1984, one of the largest manhunts in FBI history came to an explosive end on Whidbey Island in Puget Sound",
      "Forty years ago, on Dec. 8, 1984, one of the largest manhunts in FBI history came to an explosive end on Whidbey Island in Puget Sound. The person they were after was Robert Jay Mathews, the leader of a white supremacist group committing armed robberies to finance plans to overthrow the government. The standoff lasted more than 30 hours.",
      "It\u2019s a dramatic episode in history that\u2019s chronicled in the new film \u201cThe Order,\u201d in theaters Friday, a 1970s-styled thriller starring Jude Law as an FBI agent who connects the dots of the violent crimes arising in the Pacific Northwest and Nicholas Hoult as the enigmatic Mathews. The group, responsible for the murder of Jewish radio talk show host Alan Berg, and that infamous showdown, also continues to resonate with some on the far right, who make pilgrimages to Whidbey Island this time of year for \u201cMartyr\u2019s Day.\u201d",
      "Neither the English stars nor the Australian director Justin Kurzel were familiar with the history of the group when they first read Zach Baylin\u2019s script, based on Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt\u2019s nonfiction book \u201cThe Silent Brotherhood.\u201d But it felt full of potential for an entertaining, complex movie, with car chases, bank heists, shootouts and pathos.",
      "\u201cIt just reminded me of the great old heist films from the '70s, with a Sidney Lumet, William Friedkin kind of feel about it,\u201d Kurzel said. \u201cEven though it\u2019s a period film, it\u2019s so incredibly present and sort of dangerously still relevant.\u201d",
      "That relevance would soon become even clearer. Three months after Kurzel got the script, he watched the Capitol riot unfold on Jan. 6, 2020, and spotted someone holding a copy of \u201cThe Turner Diaries,\u201d one of Mathews' major inspirations. And yet it would be an uphill battle to get the film both made and into theaters, now a semi-miracle for an independent production.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always been a battle to get this kind of film made. You really need to find champions for it,\u201d said Law, who also signed on to produce with his company Riff Raff. \u201cThe historical story is all wrapped up in this film in a genre. It\u2019s got a very crowd-pleasing energy to it. It\u2019s edge of your seat, cat and mouse. It harkens back to those incredibly successful films in the \u201870s and \u201980s that people would go to and be seen as kind of blockbusters \u2026 it\u2019s funny that those films don\u2019t always necessarily get the budget they should nowadays.\u201d",
      "One of Law\u2019s favorite qualities of the script was that it was written with neither empathy for nor judgement of Mathews or his followers. But that\u2019s not to say that bringing him to life was straightforward. For Hoult, it was a daunting task.",
      "\u201cTo play a character like that, you have to try and understand them as best as possible,\u201d Hoult said. \u201cTo do that, you have to figure out their way of living and also what made them the way they are. That means taking in a lot of the information that they would have taken in that shaped their ideology and beliefs, which is a horrible place to go to because it\u2019s not stuff that you necessarily want filling your every day and to have those thoughts flowing through your head.\u201d",
      "But Hoult felt safe with Kurzel, a director he\u2019d worked with on \u201cThe True History of the Kelly Gang.\u201d He was also looking forward to collaborating with Law, though they weren\u2019t exactly hanging out during the shoot. Kurzel asked Law and Hoult to stay away from one another until their characters meet in the film to add a dynamism to that scene.",
      "\u201cIt was an adrenaline that you can\u2019t fake,\u201d Hoult said.",
      "Unbeknownst to Hoult, Kurzel also told Law to follow him around one day in Calgary \u2014 a tactile assignment that he knows sounds a little crazy but that sometimes unlocks real things for actors.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t hugely eventful,\u201d Law laughed, but he saw its benefits. \u201cJustin writes up for his actors manifestos and sets them tasks. He\u2019s not precious about it. He says, do it or don\u2019t do it. I think we both found them really interesting and really helpful ways in to just kind of embodying these people that you\u2019ve got to become.\u201d",
      "As with all independently made films, they didn\u2019t always have the time or money they would have liked, but they made it work.",
      "\u201cEach bank heist or armored truck robbery was basically done in a day,\u201d Hoult said. \u201cThe speed you\u2019re going and the frantic energy of that is helpful for creating what ends up on the screen, the chaos of that.\u201d",
      "And up until the last minute, they were even contemplating rewriting the famous final showdown. There was a total fire ban in Alberta because of wildfires, but it lifted just in time.",
      "\u201cWe were very lucky,\u201d Kurzel said of the showstopper moment.",
      "The film premiered earlier this year at the Venice Film Festival and has since played at several others, which has allowed everyone the rare privilege of seeing many responses to what they\u2019ve made. And it's been overwhelmingly positive.",
      "\u201cThis has happened before, that you make something you believe in, you love it and it just disappears or no one gets it. And you realize so much of it has to do with timing and impact,\u201d Law said. \u201cBut it feels like people really appreciate what we\u2019ve tried to do, and they really get it.\u201d"

      "It is an ambitious social experiment of our moment in history",
      "It is an ambitious social experiment of our moment in history \u2014 one that experts say could accomplish something that parents, schools and other governments have attempted with varying degrees of success: keeping kids off social media until they turn 16.",
      "Australia's new law, approved by its Parliament last week, is an attempt to swim against many tides of modern life \u2014 formidable forces like technology, marketing, globalization and, of course, the iron will of a teenager. And like efforts of the past to protect kids from things that parents believe they're not ready for, the nation's move is both ambitious and not exactly simple, particularly in a world where young people are often shaped, defined and judged by the online company they keep.",
      "The ban won't go into effect for another year. But how will Australia be able to enforce it? That's not clear, nor will it be easy. TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram have become so ingrained in young people's lives that going cold turkey will be difficult.",
      "Other questions loom. Does the ban limit kids' free expression and \u2014 especially for those in vulnerable groups \u2014 isolate them and curtail their opportunity to connect with members of their community? And how will social sites verify people's ages, anyway? Can't kids just get around such technicalities, as they so often do?",
      "This is, after all, the 21st century \u2014 an era when social media is the primary communications tool for most of those born in the past 25 years who, in a fragmented world, seek the common cultures of trends, music and memes. What happens when big swaths of that fall away?",
      "Is Australia's initiative a good, long-time-coming development that will protect the vulnerable, or could it become a well-meaning experiment with unintended consequences?",
      "The law will make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that social media companies have to be held accountable, which is what Australia is trying to do,\u201d said Jim Steyer, president and CEO of the nonprofit Common Sense Media.",
      "Leaders and parents in countries around the world are watching Australia\u2019s policy closely as many seek to protect young kids from the internet's dangerous corners \u2014 and, not incidentally, from each other. Most nations have taken different routes, from parental consent requirements to minimum age limits.",
      "Many child safety experts, parents and even teens who have waited to get on social media consider Australia's move a positive step. They say there\u2019s ample reason to ensure that children wait.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s most important for kids, just like adults, is real human connection. Less time alone on the screen means more time to connect, not less,\" said Julie Scelfo, the founder of Mothers Against Media Addiction, or MAMA, a grassroots group of parents aimed at combatting the harms of social media to children. \u201cI\u2019m confident we can support our kids in interacting in any number of ways aside from sharing the latest meme.\u201d",
      "The harms to children from social media have been well documented in the two decades since Facebook\u2019s launch ushered in a new era in how the world communicates. Kids who spend more time on social media, especially when they are tweens or young teenagers, are more likely to experience depression and anxiety, according to multiple studies \u2014 though it is not yet clear if there is a causal relationship.",
      "What's more, many are exposed to content that is not appropriate for their age, including pornography and violence, as well as social pressures about body image and makeup. They also face bullying, sexual harassment and unwanted advances from their peers as well as adult strangers. Because their brains are not fully developed, teenagers, especially younger ones the law is focused on, are also more affected by social comparisons than adults, so even happy posts from friends can send them into a negative spiral.",
      "Many major initiatives, particularly those aimed at social engineering, can produce side effects \u2014 often unintended. Could that happen here? What, if anything, do kids stand to lose by separating kids and the networks in which they participate?",
      "Paul Taske, associate director of litigation at the tech lobbying group NetChoice, says he considers the ban \u201cone of the most extreme violations of free speech on the world stage today\" even as he expressed relief that the First Amendment prevents such law in the United States",
      "\"These restrictions would create a massive cultural shift,\u201d Taske said.",
      "\u201cNot only is the Australian government preventing young people from engaging with issues they\u2019re passionate about, but they\u2019re also doing so even if their parents are ok with them using digital services,\" he said. \"Parents know their children and their needs the best, and they should be making these decisions for their families \u2014 not big government. That kind of forcible control over families inevitably will have downstream cultural impacts.\u201d",
      "David Inserra, a fellow for Free Expression and Technology, Cato Institute, called the bill \u201cabout as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike\u201d in a recent blog post. While Australia's law doesn't require \u201chard verification\u201d such as an uploaded ID, he said, it calls for effective \u201cage-assurance\u201d that includes an array of ways companies can estimate someone's age. He said no verification system can ensure accuracy while also protecting privacy and not impacting adults in the process.",
      "Privacy advocates have also raised concerns about the law's effect on online anonymity, a cornerstone of online communications \u2014 and something that can protect teens on social platforms.",
      "\u201cWhether it be religious minorities and dissidents, LGBTQ youth, those in abusive situations, whistleblowers, or countless other speakers in tricky situations, anonymous speech is a critical tool to safely challenge authority and express controversial opinions,\u201d Inserra said. \u201cBut if every user of online platforms must first identify themselves, then their anonymity is at risk.\u201d",
      "Parents in Britain and across Europe earlier this year organized on platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram to promise not to buy smartphones for children younger than 12 or 13. This approach costs almost no money and requires no government enforcement. In the United States, some parents are keeping kids off social media either informally or as part of an organized campaign such as Wait Until 8th, a group that helps parents delay kids' access to social media and phones.",
      "This fall, Norway announced plans to ban kids under 15 from using social media, while France is testing a smartphone ban for kids under 15 in a limited number of schools \u2014 a policy that could be rolled out nationwide if successful.",
      "U.S. lawmakers have held multiple congressional hearings \u2014 most recently in January \u2014 on child online safety. Still, the last federal law aimed at protecting children online was enacted in 1998, six years before Facebook\u2019s founding. In July, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation designed to protect children from dangerous online content, pushing forward with what would be the first major effort by Congress in decades to hold tech companies more accountable. But the Kids Online Safety Act has since stalled in the House.",
      "While several states have passed laws requiring age verification, those are stuck in court. Utah became the first state to pass laws regulating children\u2019s social media use in 2023. In September, a judge issued the preliminary injunction against the law, which would have required social media companies to verify the ages of users, apply privacy settings and limit some features. NetChoice has also obtained injunctions temporarily halting similar laws in several other states.",
      "And last May, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said there is insufficient evidence to show social media is safe for kids. He urged policymakers to address the harms of social media the same way they regulate things like car seats, baby formula, medication and other products children use.",
      "Said Scelfo: \u201cWhy should social media products be any different? Kids may try to get around the restrictions \u2014 just like they do for alcohol, tobacco or drugs \u2014 but nobody is saying that because they try, we should give them unfettered access to them. Parents cannot possibly bear the entire responsibility of keeping children safe online, because the problems are baked into the design of the products. And so we need policies that hold Big Tech accountable for ensuring their products are safe.\u201d",

      "HOUSTON -- An elaborate parody appears to be behind an effort to resurrect Enron, the Houston-based energy company that exemplified the worst in American corporate fraud and greed after it went bankrupt in 2001.",
      "If its return is comedic, some former employees who lost everything in Enron\u2019s collapse aren\u2019t laughing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty sick joke and it disparages the people that did work there. And why would you want to even bring it back up again?\u201d said former Enron employee Diana Peters, who represented workers in the company\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the history of Enron and the purported effort to bring it back.",
      "Once the nation\u2019s seventh-largest company, Enron filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer hide billions of dollars in debt or make failing ventures appear profitable. The energy company's collapse put more than 5,000 people out of work and wiped out more than $2 billion in employee pensions. Its aftershocks were felt throughout the energy sector.",
      "Twenty-four Enron executives, including former CEO Jeffrey Skilling, were convicted for their roles in the fraud. Enron founder Ken Lay\u2019s convictions were vacated after he died of heart disease following his 2006 trial.",
      "On Monday \u2014 the 23rd anniversary of the bankruptcy filing \u2014 a company representing itself as Enron announced in a news release it was relaunching as a \u201ccompany dedicated to solving the global energy crisis.\u201d It also posted a video on social media, advertised on at least one Houston billboard and a took out a full-page ad in the Houston Chronicle",
      "In the minute-long video full of generic corporate jargon, the company talks about \u201cgrowth\u201d and \u201crebirth.\u201d It ends with the words, \u201cWe\u2019re back. Can we talk?\u201d",
      "In an email, company spokesperson Will Chabot said the new Enron was not doing any interviews yet, but \"We\u2019ll have more to share soon.\u201d",
      "Signs point to the comeback being a joke.",
      "In the \u201cterms of use and conditions of sale\u201d on the company's website, it says \u201cthe information on the website about Enron is First Amendment protected parody, represents performance art, and is for entertainment purposes only.\u201d",
      "Documents filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office show College Company, an Arkansas-based LLC, owns the Enron trademark. The co-founder of College Company is Connor Gaydos, who helped create a joke conspiracy theory claiming all birds are actually government surveillance drones.",
      "Peters said she and some other former employees are upset and think the relaunch was \u201cin poor taste.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s a joke, it\u2019s rude, extremely rude. And I hope that they realize it and apologize to all of the Enron employees,\u201d Peters said.",
      "Peters, 74, said she is still working in information technology because \u201cI lost everything in Enron, and so my Social Security doesn\u2019t always take care of things I need done.\u201d",
      "\u201cEnron\u2019s downfall taught us critical lessons about corporate ethics, accountability, and the consequences of unchecked ambition. Enron\u2019s legacy was the employees in the trenches. Leave Enron buried,\u201d she said.",
      "But Sherron Watkins, Enron\u2019s former vice president of corporate development and the main whistleblower who helped uncover the scandal, said she didn\u2019t have a problem with the joke because comedy \u201cusually helps us focus on an uncomfortable historical event that we\u2019d rather ignore.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think we use prior scandals to try to teach new generations what can go wrong with big companies,\u201d said Watkins, who still speaks at colleges and conferences about the Enron scandal.",

      "LONDON -- The Princess of Wales helped kick off the emir of Qatar\u2019s trip to Britain on Tuesday as the U.K. government enlists one of the most popular royals to ensure the success of a state visit by the leader of a key ally, even as the princess recovers from cancer treatment.",
      "The event will be just one of a handful of appearances that Prince William\u2019s wife, better known as Kate, has made since she was diagnosed with cancer in March, underscoring the importance of the gas-rich gulf state that invests billions in Britain and has played a central role in ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas.",
      "William and Kate greeted Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Sheikha Jawaher bint Hamad bin Suhaim Al Thani in the morning. The couples then traveled to Horse Guards Parade in central London, where King Charles III formally welcomed the emir and Sheikha Jawaher to Britain at the start of a two-day visit that will include a trip to Westminster Abbey, a banquet at Buckingham Palace and a meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "Queen Camilla, who pulled out of Tuesday's chilly outdoor events on medical advice, told guests at a palace lunch that she had suffered from a lingering chest infection that was a form of pneumonia, Britain's Press Association reported. She added that she no longer has pneumonia, but was suffering from post-viral fatigue.",
      "Though smaller than the U.S. state of Connecticut, Qatar has the world\u2019s third-largest reserves of natural gas and is a key investor in the U.K. The Qatari Investment Authority owns the luxury retailer Harrod\u2019s and holds large stakes in British companies such as Barclays Bank and the supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s. It has also invested heavily in London real estate, including the Shard, western Europe\u2019s tallest building.",
      "But the display of pomp being rolled out for the emir sits uneasily with human rights advocates who say women and LGBTQ+ people face discrimination in Qatar, and migrant workers still haven\u2019t been compensated for \u201cegregious abuses\u201d that occurred during preparations for the 2022 soccer World Cup.",
      "\u201cHosting the royal visit without addressing these issues is tantamount to royal-washing Qatar\u2019s troubling rights record,\u201d said Yasmine Ahmed, U.K. director of Human Rights Watch.",
      "The state visit comes at the end of a difficult year for Britain\u2019s royal family.",
      "The king was sidelined for two months after it was announced in February that he had been diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer. Just a few weeks later, Kate made public her own cancer diagnosis and said that she, too, would be stepping away from public duties to focus on her treatment and recovery.",
      "While Charles returned to public duties at the end of April, Kate needed more time and her return has been slower.",
      "The princess has made only a few public appearances this year, mostly at moments of national significance. They included the king\u2019s annual birthday parade in June and the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon in July. Most recently, she took part in the annual Remembrance Day ceremonies in November to honor the nation\u2019s war dead.",
      "The princess announced in September that she had completed chemotherapy treatment.",
      "One reason the government and royal family may have asked Kate and William to play a major role in the Qatari state visit is because they have a lot in common with the emir.",
      "All three are in their early 40s and were educated at elite British prep schools. The emir and William are both graduates of the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, with the emir going on to serve in the Qatari military and William serving in both the British Army and Royal Air Force.",
      "Kate and William will join the Qatari royals and the king and queen for a carriage procession to Buckingham Palace.",
      "After lunch at the palace, the emir and Sheikha Jawaher will visit Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament.",
      "Later in the day, the king and queen will host a state banquet at Buckingham Palace.",
      "On Wednesday, the emir will visit Sandhurst, meeting with some of his former classmates and current Qatari cadets. He will also meet with RAF personnel who are providing advanced training for Qatari air force pilots.",
      "The emir will then travel to the prime minister\u2019s residence at 10 Downing Street for his meeting with Starmer.",

      "Robin Cook, the king of medical thrillers, returns with \u201cBellevue.\u201d",
      "The building on New York\u2019s East Side that used to house Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital has inspired tales of horror from the likes of H.P. Lovecraft and served as the model for Arkham Asylum in fictional Gotham City. For novelist Robin Cook, who interned there in the 1960s, it\u2019s the perfect setting for his latest medical thriller.",
      "\u201cBellevue\u201d is set in the present day, but hearkens often to the hospital\u2019s controversial and storied past. The plot centers around 23-year-old Mitt Fuller, embarking on his surgical residency at the iconic hospital. Mitt\u2019s \u201clong and impressive medical pedigree\u201d goes back more than 400 years and includes three previous surgeons and a psychiatrist. It\u2019s always been Mitt\u2019s dream to follow in his forefathers\u2019 footsteps.",
      "But this is a Robin Cook novel, so readers shouldn\u2019t be surprised that Mitt\u2019s dream slowly becomes a nightmare. Cook does a nice job of drawing readers into the tale, not horrifying them all at once. Mitt possesses a little precognitive power and can sometimes see things before they happen or sense when he\u2019s in danger. So when forceps start moving of their own accord during a procedure or sutures untie themselves, readers and Mitt get a serious case of the heebie-jeebies.",
      "Readers learn early in the story why the hospital is haunted, but dramatic irony is at play for more than a hundred pages as Mitt assembles the puzzle and unearths his family\u2019s buried secrets. Mitt\u2019s medical training and belief in science don\u2019t exactly square with a haunted hospital, but when he meets another hospital employee whose family has a history at the institution, together they put together the rest of the pieces.",
      "The denouement is jarring, but feels earned. Cook has told a tale that delivers a measure of justice for some patients, while preserving the dreadful mystique spelled out on top of the \u201cdecorative rusty wrought iron fence\u201d at the southeastern corner of First Avenue and 30th Street: B-E-L-L-E-V-U-E.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 00:58:31 -0500",
    "summary": "For the artistic and cultural elites of the West African nation of Senegal, the monthlong Dakar Biennale of Contemporary African Arts is a celebratory moment",
    "story": [
      "For the artistic and cultural elites of the West African nation of Senegal, the monthlong Dakar Biennale of Contemporary African Arts is a celebratory moment",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- For the artistic and cultural elites of Senegal, the monthlong Dakar Biennale of Contemporary African Arts is a celebratory moment.",
      "Every two years, hundreds of artists, curators and art lovers from across the world descend on the West African capital to attend the event, which was founded in 1989 by the Senegalese government and has over the decades become one of the most important showcases on the continent.",
      "Pop-up exhibitions are held in hundreds of venues, from stylish five-star hotels to local art galleries. Roads are even more crowded than usual, with traffic jams stretching out for miles along the Corniche, the city\u2019s picturesque seaside boulevard. Every night, there are music concerts, fashion shows, talks with artists and movie screenings held against the backdrop of palm trees and to the soundtrack of popping champagne bottles.",
      "But it wasn\u2019t until this year that the local artisans in the Soumbedioune crafts market, just off the Corniche and at the doorstep on the Medina working-class neighborhood, realized what the Biennale was.",
      "For years, \u201cwe saw the OFF signs, but we didn\u2019t know what was going on,\" said Ndiouga Dia, a 48-year-old leatherworker from Soumbedioune, referring to a series of events organized in parallel to the official government program, scattered all over the city. \u201cOnly the artists knew among themselves what was going on.\u201d",
      "Craftsmanship is deeply rooted in the country\u2019s culture. Senegal, like most African nations, has little capacity for industrial production, and traditionally much of its economy has relied on locally produced goods. For centuries, craftsmen played a central role in Senegalese social life, sculpting religious statues and ceremonial masks, sewing boubous (traditional colorful wide-sleeved robes), molding pottery and weaving baskets.",
      "But these days, their role is in decline. As living costs rise, many Senegalese opt for cheaper, often Chinese products. And those that can afford it buy Western clothes and furniture to mark their social status.",
      "So when two designers approached Dia, who is also the community leader of the Soumbedioune artisans, with a proposal for a joint exhibition, he didn't hesitate for a second.",
      "It felt good to be noticed and included, Dia said.",
      "Designers Kemi Bass\u00e8ne and Khadim Ndiaye asked five artisans \u2014 a sculptor, a painter, a jeweler, a leatherworker and a upholsterer \u2014 to interpret the theme of \u201chippo.\u201d",
      "They chose the theme because it was easily recognizable across Africa, they said, bringing together people from different nations who live next to the water.",
      "The exhibition, held in the central square of Soumbedioune, surrounded by artisanal boutiques and restaurants selling thieboudienne, the most famous Senegalese dish, has been a hit among locals. There are hippo earrings and a hippo necklace; a giant wooden sculpture of a sleeping hippo; and a hippo-shaped bag.",
      "Papise Kant\u00e9, a 45-year-old sculptor who created two wooden hippo statues for the exhibition, said it allowed him to tap into a more creative part of his work, instead of just producing objects that he intended to sell.",
      "\u201cI have been sculpting since I was a young child,\" said Kant\u00e9, who comes from a long line of sculptors. \u201cEvery artist wants to get better.\u201d",
      "But it also gave his work recognition.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s because of the Biennale that people know my work,\" he said. If you participate in the Biennale, he added, \u201cyou are proud.\"",
      "Bass\u00e8ne, the curator, grew up in Medina, next to Soumbedioune, but is now based in Paris. He said he wanted to bridge the divide between arts and crafts.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time in the history that artisans, especially those who are custodians of traditional craftsmanship, are invited to the Biennale,\u201d Bass\u00e8ne said. \u201cFor craftsmen in Africa, there is a natural progression towards the world of modern design.\u201d",
      "It was \u201cnormal,\u201d he said, to include artisans in the Biennale \u201cif we wanted to try to decolonize a little.\u201d",
      "This year's Biennale is being held as Senegal is undergoing profound political change, with the newly elected authorities charting a more self-reliant and pan-African course.",
      "Last month, the governing party, PASTEF, secured a resounding victory in legislative elections. Its win granted President Bassirou Diomaye Faye a clear mandate to carry out ambitious reforms promised during the campaign to improve living conditions for ordinary Senegalese \u2014 including greater economic self-reliance, revamping the fishing industry, and making maximum use of natural resources.",
      "The theme of this year's Biennale has been \u201cThe Wake,\u201d alluding to the emancipation of the African continent from its remaining dependence on former colonial powers.",
      "The new government of Senegal has \u201ca transformational agenda,\u201d said Bass\u00e8ne. \u201cI think that what we have experienced politically will impact all the social sciences and all art.\"",
      "In the meantime, the Soumbedioune artisans have big plans. Dia, the community leader, said that they are planning a collaboration with a local school to manufacture backpacks for students.",
      "His dream, he said, was to expand the production across the whole country so the Senegalese parents \u201cdo not have to buy Chinese products.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have all the know-how,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can produce more.\u201d",

      "Much can be unpredictable at the Gotham Awards, which uses small juries of insiders and film industry veterans to pick nominees and winners. But as the \u201cA Different Man\u201d ensemble, including Sebastian Stan and Adam Pearson, took the stage, writer-director Aaron Schimberg was in obvious disbelief.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I'm the only person in this room who\u2019s totally stunned,\" said Schimberg. \u201cConsidering the other nominees, I thought it would be hubris to prepare a speech.\"",
      "At a starry Gothams that drew Zendaya, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Angelina Jolie, most were expecting triumph for Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora,\u201d a comedy about a sex worker who marries the son of a Russian oligarch. It came in the lead nominee, the Cannes Palme d\u2019Or winner, and maybe a top best-picture contender at the Oscars, but went home empty-handed.",
      "Instead, the night belonged to the A24 release \u201cA Different Man,\u201d which stars Stan as a man with facial deformities who's healed of them. He's then upstaged by the character played by Pearson, who has neurofibromatosis, a condition that covers much of his face with benign skin tumors.",

But the Gothams, a black-tie affair held at Cipriani Wall Street in downtown Manhattan, tend give some sense of the flavor of the upcoming gauntlet of award-season ceremonies.",
      "How prominent politics, and the upcoming inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, might be in this year\u2019s Oscar race is one of the biggest questions as the season ramps up. On Monday, Trump's name was never uttered on stage (though Stan is in the awards mix for playing him in \u201cThe Apprentice\" ), nor were there any overtly political statements. But several winners seemed to allude to the shifting political climate.",
      "\u201cLet's keep doing the work that really matters and makes a difference,\u201d said Colman Domingo, who won best lead performance. \u201cThat's what we can do right now. That can be the light in the darkness.\u201d",
      "Domingo won for his starring role in \u201cSing Sing,\u201d the indie drama about a real prison program called Rehabilitation Through the Arts, which helps incarcerated people heal through theater productions. Clarence Maclin, one of the formerly incarcerated men who co-star in the film, won best supporting performance.

      "\u201cIf someone was going to tell me ten years ago, I was going to be here, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it,\u201d said Maclin.",
      "\u201cSing Sing,\u201d also from A24, was arguably the emotional winner of the night. The film's ensembled also accepted a tribute award. In one of the evening's most powerful speeches Sean Dino Johnson, a founding member of RTA, spoke passionately about the redemptive qualities of the arts.",
      "\u201cStanding here tonight we are proof that movies like \u2018Sing Sing\u2019 don\u2019t just entertain,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThey change lives.\u201d",

      "Black and Latino neighborhoods were most vulnerable to the retail pharmacy closures, which can chip away at already-limited care options in those communities, researchers said in a study published Tuesday in Health Affairs.",
      "The trend has potentially gained momentum since the study's timeframe, because many drugstores are still struggling. In the last three years, the major chains Walgreens and CVS have closed hundreds of additional stores, and Rite Aid shrank as it went through a bankruptcy reorganization.",
      "Drugstores have been dealing with shrinking reimbursement for prescriptions, rising costs and changing customer shopping habits. The chains have been closing money-losing stores and transferring prescription files to more profitable locations.",
      "The study found that more than 29% of the nearly 89,000 retail U.S. pharmacies that operated between 2010 and 2020 had closed by 2021. That amounts to more than 26,000 stores.",
      "Researchers using data from the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs found that the number of U.S. pharmacies had actually increased from 2010 to 2017 because of store openings, but the pace of closings picked up starting in 2018.",
      "They also highlighted which stores were more likely to close. Those include independent pharmacies, which were more likely than chain stores to be in Black, Latino and low-income neighborhoods.",
      "Pharmacies in neighborhoods with higher rates of patients on government-funded Medicaid and Medicare also were at greater risk for closing, said Dima Qato, a University of Southern California pharmacy professor who was the study's lead author. Those programs tend to reimburse less than private health insurance.",

      "Retail drugstores can be important sources for vaccinations, contraception, overdose prevention and opioid use disorder treatments, aside from prescriptions, Qato said.

      "The first court arguments over whether Missouri's sweeping abortion restrictions will fall under a new constitutional amendment are set to begin",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Abortion-rights advocates are asking a judge Wednesday to overturn Missouri\u2019s near-total ban on the procedure, less than a month after voters backed an abortion-rights constitutional amendment.",
      "Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang was set to hear arguments from Planned Parenthood and the state\u2019s Republican Attorney General\u2019s Office over whether to issue a temporary order blocking enforcement of Missouri\u2019s numerous abortion laws.",
      "\u201cIf left in place, the above-described restrictions will continue to be catastrophic for Missourians,\" lawyers for abortion-rights supporters wrote in a court brief. \"They will either prevent care altogether or severely delay or interfere with care.\u201d",
      "Missouri is one of five states where voters approved ballot measures this year to add the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "Reproductive rights advocates in Arizona on Tuesday sued to undo a 15-week abortion ban that conflicts with that state's new constitutional amendment expanding access up to fetal viability.",
      "The Missouri amendment does not specifically override any state laws. Instead the measure leaves it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional.",
      "Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, an abortion opponent, last week issued an opinion agreeing that most abortions will be legal when the amendment takes effect Thursday.",
      "But Bailey\u2019s office is still fighting for a ban on most abortions after viability, along with a number of regulations that Planned Parenthood argues made it nearly impossible to offer abortions in the state even before abortion was almost completely banned in 2022.",
      "Missouri\u2019s constitutional amendment allows lawmakers to restrict abortion after viability, with exceptions to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d",
      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Though there\u2019s no defined time frame, doctors say it is sometime after the 21st week of pregnancy.",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 19:06:23 -0500",

      "Social media users are misrepresenting a Vermont Supreme Court ruling, falsely claiming that it gives schools permission to vaccinate children even if their parents do not consent",
      "Social media users are misrepresenting a Vermont Supreme Court ruling, claiming that it gives schools permission to vaccinate children even if their parents do not consent.",
      "The ruling addressed a lawsuit filed by Dario and Shujen Politella against Windham Southeast School District and state officials over the mistaken vaccination of their child against COVID-19 in 2021, when he was 6 years old. A lower court had dismissed the original complaint, as well as an amended version. An appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was filed on Nov. 19.",
      "But the ruling by Vermont's high court is not as far-reaching as some online have claimed. In reality, it concluded that anyone protected under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, or PREP, Act is immune to state lawsuits.",
      "Here's a closer look at the facts.",
      "CLAIM: The Vermont Supreme Court ruled that schools can vaccinate children against their parents' wishes.",
      "THE FACTS: The claim stems from a July 26 ruling by the Vermont Supreme Court, which found that anyone protected by the PREP Act is immune to state lawsuits, including the officials named in the Politella's suit. The ruling does not authorize schools to vaccinate children at their discretion.",
      "According to the lawsuit, the Politella's son \u2014 referred to as L.P. \u2014 was given one dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at a vaccination clinic held at Academy School in Brattleboro even though his father, Dario, told the school's assistant principal a few days before that his son was not to receive a vaccination. In what officials described as a mistake, L.P. was removed from class and had a \u201chandwritten label\u201d put on his shirt with the name and date of birth of another student, L.K., who had already been vaccinated that day. L.P. was then vaccinated.",
      "Ultimately, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that officials involved in the case could not be sued.",
      "\u201cWe conclude that the PREP Act immunizes every defendant in this case and this fact alone is enough to dismiss the case,\u201d the Vermont Supreme Court's ruling reads. \u201cWe conclude that when the federal PREP Act immunizes a defendant, the PREP Act bars all state-law claims against that defendant as a matter of law.\u201d",
      "The PREP Act, enacted by Congress in 2005, authorizes the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to issue a declaration in the event of a public health emergency providing immunity from liability for activities related to medical countermeasures, such as the administration of a vaccine, except in cases of \u201cwillful misconduct\" that result in \u201cdeath or serious physical injury.\u201d A declaration against COVID-19 was issued on March 17, 2020. It is set to expire on Dec. 31. Federals suits claiming willful misconduct are filed in Washington.",
      "Social media users described the Vermont Supreme Court's ruling as having consequences beyond what it actually says.",
      "\u201cThe Vermont Supreme Court has ruled that schools can force-vaccinate children for Covid against the wishes of their parents,\u201d reads one X post that had been liked and shared approximately 16,600 times as of Tuesday. \u201cThe high court ruled on a case involving a 6-year-old boy who was forced to take a Covid mRNA injection by his school. However, his family had explicitly stated that they didn't want their child to receive the \u2018vaccines.\u2019\u201d",
      "Other users alleged that the ruling gives schools permission to give students any vaccine without parental consent, not just ones for COVID-19.",
      "Rod Smolla, president of the Vermont Law and Graduate School and an expert on constitutional law, told The Associated Press that the ruling \u201cmerely holds that the federal statute at issue, the PREP Act, preempts state lawsuits in cases in which officials mistakenly administer a vaccination without consent.\u201d",
      "\u201cNothing in the Vermont Supreme Court opinion states that school officials can vaccinate a child against the instructions of the parent,\u201d he wrote in an email.",
      "Asked whether the claims spreading online have any merit, Ronald Ferrara, an attorney representing the Politellas, told the AP that although the ruling doesn't say schools can vaccinate students regardless of parental consent, officials could interpret it to mean that they could get away with doing so under the PREP Act, at least when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines. He explained that the U.S. Supreme Court appeal seeks to clarify whether the Vermont Supreme Court interpreted the PREP Act beyond what Congress intended.",
      "\u201cThe Politella\u2019s fundamental liberty interest to decide whether their son should receive elective medical treatment was denied by agents of the State and School,\u201d he wrote in an email to the AP. \u201cThe Vermont Court misconstrues the scope of PREP Act immunity (which is conditioned upon informed consent for medical treatments unapproved by FDA), to cover this denial of rights and its underlying battery.\u201d",
      "Ferrara added that he was not aware of the claims spreading online, but that he \u201ccan understand how lay people may conflate the court's mistaken grant of immunity for misconduct as tantamount to blessing such misconduct.\u201d",
      "John Klar, who also represents the Politellas, went a step further, telling the AP that the Vermont Supreme Court ruling means that \u201cas a matter of law\u201d schools can get away with vaccinating students without parental consent and that parents can only sue on the federal level if death or serious bodily injury results.",

      "The women were each sentenced to four years in prison after being found guilty of selling, buying or exchanging a person for cross-border transfer, the Kandal Provincial Court said late Monday.",
      "According to the verdict, two of the four years in prison were suspended, meaning they won't have to be served unless they're found guilty of another crime.",
      "The women are held at a police hospital outside Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, and authorities have previously said they would not have to serve prison time until after giving birth.",
      "The women can appeal the verdict, said court spokesperson So Sarin. He refused to comment on how many were still pregnant, or what would happen to the babies after they have given birth.",
      "Developing countries have been popular for surrogacy because costs are much lower compared to the United States and Australia, where surrogate services could cost around $150,000.",
      "The Cambodia case was unusual because surrogates normally are employed in their own countries, not transported elsewhere.",
      "Authorities have said the business that recruited the women was based in Thailand, and that their food and accommodation in Cambodia was organized there.",
      "The women were arrested in late September in a raid on a villa in Kandal province, where authorities found 20 Filipinos and four Vietnamese.",
      "At the time the women were charged in October, Cambodia\u2019s Interior Ministry said the ringleaders had not been identified. It said, however, that it considered the women offenders who conspired with the organizers to act as surrogates and then sell the babies for money, rather than victims.",
      "Eleven of the women who were not pregnant were deported, and the 13 Filipinos were charged under a provision on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation. The law was updated in 2016 to ban commercial surrogacy after Cambodia became a popular destination for foreigners seeking women to give birth to their children.",
      "Cambodia has a bad reputation for human trafficking, especially in connection with online scams in which foreigners recruited for work under false pretenses are kept in conditions of virtual slavery and help perpetrate criminal fraud online against targets in many countries.",
      "The surrogacy business boomed in Cambodia after it was put under tight restrictions in neighboring Thailand, as well as in India and Nepal.",
      "In July 2017, a Cambodian court sentenced an Australian woman and two Cambodian associates to 1 1/2 years in prison for providing commercial surrogacy services."

      "BOISE, Idaho -- A federal appeals court on Monday ruled that most of Idaho's first-in-the-nation law that makes it illegal to help minors get an abortion without the consent of their parents can take effect while a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality continues.",
      "The decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the statute\u2019s prohibition on helping a minor get an abortion by harboring and transporting them with the intent to conceal the procedure from the minor\u2019s parents is likely to be found constitutional and can be enforced.",
      "Part of the law remains blocked, however. The court found that the law\u2019s prohibition on \u201crecruiting\u201d pregnant youth violates the First Amendment. That means prosecutors, for now, will not be able to charge a person with \u201crecruiting\u201d or influencing a minor to have an abortion.",
      "\"Encouragement, counseling, and emotional support are plainly protected speech,\u201d the court wrote, even when that speech happens in the \u201ccontext of deciding whether to have an abortion.\u201d",
      "The ruling largely reverses U.S. Magistrate Judge Debora K. Grasham's decision, which prevented the law from being enforced after opponents sued the state in the summer of 2023.",
      "Abortion is banned in Idaho at all stages of pregnancy, and the law enacted in 2023 was designed to prevent minors from getting abortions in states where the procedure is legal if they don\u2019t have their parents\u2019 permission.",
      "Supporters of the law call it an \u201cabortion trafficking\u201d ban. Opponents say it is an unconstitutional prohibition on interstate travel and free speech rights. Both sides framed Monday's ruling as a victory.",
      "\u201cThis decision is a significant victory for the plaintiffs, as it frees Idahoans to talk with pregnant minors about abortion health care,\u201d Wendy Heipt, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an emailed statement Monday.",
      "She said the plaintiffs, which include multiple advocacy groups, are also considering their appeal options.",
      "Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador in an emailed statement called the ruling a victory for the state.",
      "\u201cIdaho\u2019s laws were passed specifically to protect the life of the unborn and the life of the mother, Labrador said. \"Trafficking a minor child for an abortion without parental consent puts both in grave danger, and we will not stop protecting life in Idaho.\u201d",
      "The law makes it illegal to either obtain abortion pills for a minor or to help them leave the state for an abortion without their parents\u2019 knowledge and consent. Anyone convicted will face two to five years in prison and could also be sued by the minor\u2019s parent or guardian. A parent who raped their child will not be able to sue, though the criminal penalties for anyone who helped the minor obtain an abortion will remain in effect."

      "A Zimbabwean High Court judge has ruled that provisions of a law that deny abortion services to women raped by their husbands and girls under the age of 18 are unconstitutional",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- A law prohibiting abortion services for women raped by their husbands and girls under the age of 18 is unconstitutional, Zimbabwe\u2019s High Court has ruled.",
      "In his ruling handed down on Nov. 22 and made public this week, Judge Maxwell Takuva said since Zimbabwe\u2019s laws already criminalize marital rape and sex with a minor, victims should be allowed to abort if they become pregnant.",
      "The ruling is significant, given Zimbabwe\u2019s restrictive abortion laws that often lead women and girls into illegal and unsafe backstreet abortions that in many cases turn fatal.",
      "Abortion is allowed in very few circumstances in Zimbabwe, including such as if the pregnancy endangers the life of a woman, or if there is a risk of a physical or mental defect \u201cof such a nature that (the child) will permanently be seriously handicapped.\u201d Women can also access legal abortion services in cases of unlawful sex such as incest.",
      "Zimbabwe criminalized sex with any person below 18 in September following an earlier constitutional court ruling ordering parliament to raise the legal age of consent for sex to 18 from 16. But the highly restrictive Termination of Pregnancy Act still denied abortion services for girls under 18.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that it is torture, cruel and degrading treatment for a child to carry another child, for a child to give birth to another child or for a child to be forced to illegally abort because of cruel circumstances,\u201d said the judge.",

      "When SmileDirectClub shut down a year ago, scores of existing customers of the teeth-straightening company were left in limbo",
      "NEW YORK -- When SmileDirectClub shut down a year ago, scores of existing customers of the teeth-straightening company were left in limbo. Now, tens of thousands are set to get some relief.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James has announced that her office recovered $4.8 million to distribute nationwide to more than 28,000 consumers. SmileDirectClub illegally charged those customers after it ceased operations, James said.",
      "\u201cDental care is expensive and SmileDirectClub promised customers that they would provide affordable, quality care without the price tag, but instead, they extracted thousands of dollars from hardworking people,\" James said in a prepared statement Monday. \u201cToday, we are putting money back into people\u2019s pockets who were cheated.\"",
      "SmileDirectClub, once a publicly traded company known for selling clear dental aligners, shut its doors in December 2023 \u2014 just months after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In an abrupt move, the company canceled outstanding orders and announced that its \u201cLifetime Smile Guarantee\u201d would no longer exist. At the time, SmileDirectClub also said that \u201cSmilePay\u201d customers were expected to continue payments, causing confusion and frustration.",
      "According to James' announcement, the majority of customers paid for their aligner treatments through the \u201cSmilePay\u201d program, which generally totaled more than $2,500 between an up-front payment and following installments.",
      "After the company folded in December 2023, James' office said it received complaints from New York consumers who were told to keep paying monthly installments, despite no longer receiving treatment in return \u2014 and that it soon sent SmileDirectClub a cease-and-desist letter.",
      "In response, SmileDirectClub directed her office to HPS Investment Partners, the agent of the company's secured lenders, and SmilePay service provider Healthcare Finance Direct. The company also revised its online FAQ to remove the note about continuing payments, and instead direct customers' further questions to HFD.",
      "Monday's settlement agreement means that impacted consumers should soon see some relief, either in the form of \u201ca partial or full refund of their installment payments or a reduction of their future payment obligations,\u201d according to HFD\u2019s website.",
      "If you're eligible, the amount of money you\u2019ll get will depend on several factors. Those include the date when you first received aligners from SmileDirectClub, if your services had begun yet, as well as how much of your treatment plan was completed at the time the company ceased operations, and the outstanding balances on your account.",
      "And not all refunds will come in the form of a settlement check. Compensation will first be applied to the outstanding balance on your account \u2014 meaning that future payments, while reduced, may still remain for those who were farther along in their treatment. But consumers eligible for a refund that exceeds their outstanding account balance will see that excess amount sent back to a bank account, debit card or credit card on file. If that's unsuccessful, HFD notes, a check will be mailed out.",
      "How many people end up registering for the settlement is also a factor. Total compensation plan is capped at $4.8 million, so it\u2019s possible refunds could be slightly below or above initial estimates once all requests are in.",
      "A portion of these refunds will be automatic, but other customers will only be available to submit a request to HFD directly. The deadline to submit that request is March 31, 2025. While eligible consumers will likely be contacted by HFD via email, more information can be found of the service provider's official website.",
      "Before shutting its doors, SmileDirectClub served over 2 million people since its 2014 founding. The company once promised to revolutionize the oral-care industry by selling clear dental aligners, via mail and in major retailers, that were marketed as a faster and more affordable alternative to braces.",
      "Still, the company later proved to be unprofitable year after year. By the time SmileDirectClub filed for bankruptcy in September 2023, it reported nearly $900 million in debt.",
      "And beyond financial woes, dental associations around the world have also continued to urge caution or express opposition to direct-to-consumer aligners \u2014 what some call \u201cDIY\u201d dentistry \u2014 citing risks around services that don't require in-person visits to a dentist or orthodontist. That resulted in ample criticism around SmileDirectClub, particularly after customers saw treatments discontinued last year, although other companies still provide similar direct-to-consumer aligners today."

One person in Colorado died and four people developed a potentially life-threatening kidney disease complication.",

      "There have been no new cases reported since Oct. 21, when McDonald's pulled the Quarter Pounder off its menu in the affected states, the CDC said Tuesday. Taylor Farms initiated a voluntary recall of yellow onions on Oct. 22.",

The company found an alternate supplier and resumed selling Quarter Pounders with slivered onions at all U.S. stores last month.",
      "But the outbreak has hurt demand. In mid-November, McDonald's said it planned to spend $100 million to bring customers back to stores, including $65 million that will go directly to the hardest-hit franchisees.",

      "McDonald's also declined to comment Tuesday on legal action against the company as a result of the E. coli outbreak.",
      "Nicole and Richard West of Townsend, Montana, are suing McDonald\u2019s after their 11-month-old daughter, Logan, was hospitalized in October with E. coli poisoning. The toddler ate a few bites of her father\u2019s Quarter Pounder hamburger with onions during a family road trip on Oct. 2.",
      "She fell ill a few days later with severe vomiting and diarrhea. Her mother rushed her to the hospital, where she was found to be infected with E. coli O157:H7, which can cause life-threatening illness, particularly in young children.",
      "Richard West also fell ill but didn\u2019t seek medical attention because he was at home caring for the family\u2019s other children. He lost more than two weeks of work as a truck driver because of the outbreak and the family faces a barrage of medical expenses.",
      "Nicole West said Tuesday that Logan's health has improved but the outbreak has shaken the family\u2019s confidence in the fast-food giant.",

    "story": [
      "Reproductive rights advocates are trying to dismantle a 15-week abortion ban in Arizona that conflicts with newly expanded access establishing a fundamental right to abortion in the state",
      "PHOENIX -- Reproductive rights advocates sued Arizona on Tuesday to undo a 15-week abortion ban that conflicts with a constitutional amendment recently approved by voters to expand access up to fetal viability.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights filed the lawsuit in Maricopa County Superior Court on behalf of the local chapter of Planned Parenthood and two physicians, arguing the law interferes with pregnant Arizonans\u2019 fundamental right to abortion and individual autonomy. It\u2019s the first step in efforts to dismantle existing laws they say are too restrictive.",
      "The Republican-controlled Arizona Legislature approved the 15-week ban months before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, but it didn't go into effect until after. Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes agreed not to enforce the 15-week ban while the lawsuit plays out, spokesperson Richie Taylor said Tuesday.",
      "Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs said in a statement Tuesday that the ban should be removed from the books.",
      "\u201cArizonans made it clear that they support reproductive freedom, and there is no question that a ban with no exceptions for rape or incest should be removed from our laws,\" she said, adding that she is \"glad Arizonans are working to finish the job and enforce the constitutional protections we now enjoy.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit also seeks to undo the ban\u2019s enforcement mechanisms, which could lead to criminal charges against providers who knowingly or intentionally perform abortions beyond 15 weeks except in medical emergencies. Physicians who violate the ban could face suspension or revocation of their medical licenses.",
      "\u201cThe amendment itself does not sort of wipe the statute books clean, you know. Further action is needed in order to take that additional step to effectuate the amendment\u2019s promise,\u201d ACLU staff attorney Rebecca Chan said. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s really what this 15-week ban challenge is.\u201d",
      "Arizona was one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in the 2024 general election to add the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. Nevada voters also approved an amendment to codify its existing abortion rights in the state constitution, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "The Arizona ballot measure gained momentum after a state Supreme Court ruling in April found that the state could enforce a near-total abortion ban adopted in 1864. Some GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats to repeal the law before it could be enforced.",
      "The measure expands access to fetal viability \u2014 the point at which a fetus can survive outside the uterus. Though there\u2019s no defined time frame for viability, doctors say it\u2019s sometime after 21 weeks. It allows abortions after viability if they are necessary to protect the physical or mental health of the mother, or to save her life.",
      "Most abortions happen early in pregnancy. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 93% of them nationally in 2022 were in the first 13 weeks, though that data does not include California and some other states where advocates believe a higher proportion of abortions are performed later in pregnancy.",
      "The Nov. 25 certification of the general election opened the door for legal challenges to laws that conflict with the ballot measure, including a law that requires patients to have an ultrasound at least 24 hours before an abortion, with the option to view the image and hear an explanation of what it shows.",
      "Reproductive rights groups signaled then that they would sue over the 15-week abortion ban.",
      "\u201cClearly Planned Parenthood and ACLU and their allies have little regard for the life of an unborn child and the development of an unborn child,\" said Cathi Herrod, president of the socially conservative Center for Arizona Policy. Herrod previosly said the group would seek to intervene where appropriate.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have banned or restricted access to abortion, and abortion rights groups have pushed back.",
      "In Missouri, Planned Parenthood affiliates sued immediately after a ballot measure there passed seeking to have bans and other abortion-restricting laws invalidated. The circumstances are different there because that state has a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy and no clinics are providing it. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.",
      "Missouri\u2019s Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey wrote in an opinion that he will enforce some laws restricting abortion despite voter approval of a constitutional amendment widely expected to undo the state\u2019s near-total ban on the procedure."

      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court is hearing arguments Wednesday in just its second major transgender rights case, which is a challenge to a Tennessee law that bans gender-affirming care for minors.",
      "The justices' decision, not expected for several months, could affect similar laws enacted by another 25 states and a range of other efforts to regulate the lives of transgender people, including which sports competitions they can join and which bathrooms they can use.",
      "The case is coming before a conservative-dominated court after a presidential election in which Donald Trump and his allies promised to roll back protections for transgender people.",
      "Four years ago, the court ruled in favor of Aimee Stephens, who was fired by a Michigan funeral home after she informed its owner that she was a transgender woman. The court held that transgender people, as well as gay and lesbian people, are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace.",
      "The Biden administration and the families and health care providers who challenged the Tennessee law are urging the justices to apply the same sort of analysis that the majority, made up of liberal and conservative justices, embraced in the case four years ago when it found that \u201csex plays an unmistakable role\u201d in employers' decisions to punish transgender people for traits and behavior they otherwise tolerate.",
      "The issue in the Tennessee case is whether the law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, which requires the government to treat similarly situated people the same.",
      "Tennessee's law bans puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors, but not \u201cacross the board,\u201d lawyers for the families wrote in their Supreme Court brief. The lead lawyer, Chase Strangio of the American Civil Liberties Union, is the first openly transgender person to argue in front of the justices.",
      "The administration argues there is no way to determine whether \u201ctreatments must be withheld from any particular minor\u201d without considering the minor's sex.",
      "\u201cThat is sex discrimination,\u201d Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in her main court filing.",
      "The state acknowledges that the same treatments that are banned for transgender minors can be prescribed for other reasons. But it rejects the claim that it is discriminating on the basis of sex. Instead, it says lawmakers acted to protect minors from the risks of \u201clife-altering gender-transition procedures.\u201d",
      "The law \u201cdraws a line between minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes. And boys and girls fall on both sides of that line,\u201d Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti wrote in the state's Supreme Court brief.",
      "While the challengers invoke the 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County for support, Tennessee relies on the court's precedent-shattering Dobbs decision in 2022 that ended nationwide protections for abortion and returned the issue to the states.",
      "The two sides battled in their legal filings over the appropriate level of scrutiny the court should apply. It's more than an academic exercise.",
      "The lowest level is known as rational basis review and almost every law looked at that way is ultimately upheld. Indeed, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati that allowed the law to be enforced held that lawmakers acted rationally to regulate medical procedures, well within their authority.",
      "The appeals court reversed a trial court that employed a higher level of review, heightened scrutiny, that applies in cases of sex discrimination. Under this more searching examination, the state must identify an important objective and show that the law helps accomplish it.",
      "If the justices opt for heightened scrutiny, they could return the case to the appeals court to apply it.",
      "Gender-affirming care for youth is supported by every major medical organization, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association.",
      "But Tennessee is pointing to health authorities in Sweden, Finland, Norway and the United Kingdom that found that the medical treatments \"pose significant risks with unproven benefits.\u201d",
      "None of those countries has adopted a ban similar to the one in Tennessee and individuals can still obtain treatment, Prelogar wrote in response.",
      "The Williams family of Nashville, Tennessee are among those challenging the state law. Brian Williams said that as a result of puberty blockers and hormone treatments, his transgender daughter, L.W., is a \u201c16-year-old planning for her future, making her own music and looking at colleges.\u201d",

      "Tom Fletcher, a longtime British diplomat who took up the U.N. post last month, said his agency is asking for less money in 2025 than this year. He said it wants to show \"we will focus and target the resources we have,\u201d even as crises grow more numerous, intense and long-lasting.",
      "His agency, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, on Wednesday issued its global appeal for 2025, seeking $47 billion to help 190 million people in 32 countries \u2014 though it estimates 305 million worldwide need help.",
      "\u201cThe world is on fire, and this is how we put it out,\u201d he told reporters on Tuesday.",
      "The office and many other aid groups, including the international Red Cross, have seen donations shrink in recent years for longtime trouble spots like Syria, South Sudan, the Middle East and Congo and newer ones like Ukraine and Sudan. Aid access has been difficult in some places, especially Sudan and Gaza.",
      "The office's appeal for $50 billion for this year was only 43% fulfilled as of last month. One consequence of that shortfall was a 80% reduction in food aid for Syria, which has seen a sudden escalation in fighting in recent days.",
      "Such funds go to U.N. agencies and more than 1,500 partner organizations.",
      "The biggest asks for 2025 are for Syria \u2014 a total of $8.7 billion for needs both within the country and for neighbors that have taken in Syrian refugees \u2014 as well as Sudan at a total of $6 billion, the \u201cOccupied Palestinian Territory\u201d at $4 billion, Ukraine at about $3.3 billion and Congo at nearly $3.2 billion.",
      "Fletcher said his office needs to be \u201cruthless\u201d in choosing to reach people most in need.",
      "\u201cI choose that word carefully, because it's a judgement call \u2014 that ruthlessness \u2014 about prioritizing where the funding goes and where we can have the greatest impact,\" he said. \u201cIt's a recognition that we have struggled in previous years to raise the money we need.\u201d",
      "In response to questions about how much President-elect Donald Trump of the United States \u2014 the U.N.'s biggest single donor \u2014 will spend on humanitarian aid, Fletcher said he expects to spend \u201ca lot of time\u201d in Washington over the next few months to talk with the new administration.",
      "\u201cAmerica is very much on our minds at the moment,\" he said, acknowledging some governments \u201cwill be more questioning of what the United Nations does and less ideologically supportive of this humanitarian effort\u201d laid out in the new report.",
      "This year has been the deadliest on record for humanitarians and U.N. staff, largely due to the Middle East conflict triggered by Palestinian militants' deadly Oct. 7, 2023 attack in Israel."

      "WASHINGTON -- A majority of Supreme Court justices didn't seem convinced Monday that federal regulators misled companies before refusing to allow them to sell sweet-flavored vaping products following a surge in teen e-cigarette use.",
      "The conservative-majority court did raise questions about the Food and Drug Administration crackdown that included denials of more than a million nicotine products formulated to taste like fruit, dessert or candy. Teen vaping use has since dropped to its lowest level in a decade, but the agency could change its approach after the inauguration next month of President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to \u201csave\u201d vaping.",
      "Vaping companies have long marketed their products as a way to help adults quit traditional cigarettes, and say the FDA changed its standards with little warning as it blocked the sale of over a million new flavored products.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan, though, was skeptical.",
      "\u201cI guess I\u2019m not really seeing what the surprise is here,\u201d she said. \u201cYou knew what the FDA\u2019s point of view was ... that blueberry vapes are really problematic in terms of youth smoking.\"",
      "The FDA was slow to regulate the now multibillion-dollar vaping market, and even years into the crackdown flavored vapes that are technically illegal nevertheless remain widely available.",
      "The agency says the companies were denied because they couldn't show flavored vapes had a net public benefit, as laid out in the law. It has approved some tobacco-flavored vapes, and recently allowed its first menthol-flavored electronic cigarettes for adult smokers after the company provided data showing the product was more helpful in quitting, Deputy Solicitor General Curtis Gannon said.",
      "The issue came before the high court when the agency appealed a decision from the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals tossing out one of its denials.",
      "While other lower courts rebuffed vaping company lawsuits, the 5th Circuit sided with Dallas-based company Triton Distribution. The decision allowed the sale of e-juices like \u201cJimmy The Juice Man in Peachy Strawberry\" and \u201cSuicide Bunny Mother's Milk and Cookies\u201d which are heated by an e-cigarette to create an inhalable aerosol.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned whether the FDA process had given the companies a fair chance to make their claims, given that their businesses were at stake.",
      "Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh expressed concern about what recourse companies have if agencies issue misleading guidance, though he also elicited that the FDA wasn't required to issue the guidance it gave in the vaping case. \u201cI'm trying to figure out what the legal error is here,\u201d he said.",
      "The vaping companies, he said, can reapply for sales authorization even if they don't win in court. Triton attorney Eric Heyer said that process would take so long that the company could be forced to close.",
      "The court has overall been skeptical of the power of federal regulators, including by striking down the so-called Chevron doctrine that had judges deferring to agencies' interpretation of the law.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned whether the vaping companies wanted the court to take that concept a step further. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a reverse Chevron deference, except we're deferring to the applicant,\" she said.",
      "The court is expected to decide the case in the coming months.",

      "DeCaprio is president of Local 54 of the Unite Here union, which opposes a smoking ban on the grounds that so much business would be lost by smokers taking their money elsewhere that it could cause one or more casinos to shut down, costing thousands of workers their jobs.",

      "Attorney Nancy Erika Smith said as far back as 1993, tobacco companies targeted labor unions in the hospitality industry as potential allies to work against smoking bans in the restaurant and hospitality industries. That effort included the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, a precursor of the Unite Here union.",

      "But the pharmaceutical industry is still waiting to see whether AI can tackle its biggest challenge: finding faster, cheaper ways to develop new drugs.",
      "Despite billions poured into research, new medicines still typically take a decade or more to develop.",
      "Founded in 2018, Insitro is part of a growing field of AI companies promising to accelerate drug discovery by using machine learning to analyze huge datasets of chemical and biological markers. The South San Francisco-based company has signed deals with drugmakers like Eli Lilly and Bristol Myers Squibb to help develop medicines for metabolic diseases, neurological conditions and degenerative disorders.",
      "CEO and founder Daphne Koller spoke with the AP about what AI brings to the challenges of drug discovery. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "A: I think the problem with drug discovery is that we are trying to intervene in a system that we only slightly understand. Many of the successes that we\u2019ve seen in the last 15 to 20 years have been when we arrive at a sufficient understanding of the system so we can really design interventions to align with it.",
      "So one of the things that we try to do at Insitro is unravel the underlying complexity of heterogeneous diseases and identify new intervention modes that could help, maybe not the entire population, but perhaps just a subset of it. That way we can really identify the right therapeutic hypothesis to intervene in a particular patient population. And that, I think, is the real crux of the industry\u2019s lack of success.",
      "A: One of the things that has been happening in parallel to the AI revolution is a much quieter revolution in what I call quantitative biology, which is the ability to measure biological systems with unprecedented fidelity. You can measure systems like proteins and cells with increasingly better measurements and technology.",
      "But if you give that data to a person, their eyes will just glaze over because there\u2019s only so many cells someone can look at and only so many subtleties they can see in these images. People are just limited in their ability to perceive subtle differences.",
      "So you end up with a very reductionist view of a very complex, multifaceted system which is really important to unraveling the distinctions between patients and uncovering where an intervention really can make a difference.",
      "A: My PhD was in computer science. But I started to get into the field of machine learning in the service of biomedical problems back in 1998 or 1999.",
      "At that time, the problems that machine learning was able to tackle were, frankly, uninspiring. How inspired can you get about classifying spam versus non-spam in a dataset of email messages?",
      "I was looking for something that had more richness to it. And my first foray into this field was not because I was particularly interested in becoming a biologist, but because I was looking for more technically challenging questions. And then, as I started looking into it, I became interested in biology in its own right.",
      "A: This is probably one of the most important things we\u2019ve achieved as an organization.",
      "You can take the most sophisticated, best meaning scientists from either side and put them in the same room together and they might as well be speaking Thai and Swahili to each other.",
      "When you\u2019re an engineer, you\u2019re looking for the strongest, most consistent patterns that are going to allow you to make predictions about a majority of cells or individuals. When you\u2019re a life scientist, oftentimes you\u2019re actually looking for the exceptions because those are the threads that can lead to new discoveries.",

      "On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case involving Tennessee\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care for transgender people under age 18.",
      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting or banning such care for minors, and most of those states face lawsuits.",
      "The nation's top court will be weighing whether Tennessee\u2019s law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, requiring that people in similar circumstances be treated the same under the law. Both sides in the case claim they are acting to protect minors from harm.",
      "Gender-affirming care is supported by the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical groups. Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s typically involved:",
      "Young people who persistently identify as a gender that differs from their sex assigned at birth are often referred to clinics where teams from various medical specialties provide gender-affirming care.",
      "Such care begins with an evaluation, which can include a pediatrician and a mental health specialist who assess the degree of distress, if any, the young person is experiencing.",
      "Those who meet defined criteria may be diagnosed with what\u2019s called gender dysphoria if their distress is continuous and significant.",
      "Some young people and their families may decide to try a social transition involving a new hairstyle, clothing, name or pronouns. Experts agree that allowing children to express their gender in a way that matches their identity is beneficial.",
      "Chazzie Grosshandler, 18, of Chicago, said she was 9 years old when she told her parents she was a girl and \u201cnot just a boy who likes girly things.\u201d She started receiving care two years later.",
      "\u201cThe first-ever step of gender-affirming care for me was when I told my parents that I was a girl and that I had felt this way for a long time and that they accepted me,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people get really confused when they hear the word \u2018care\u2019 that it has to be something medical. But the truth is that it\u2019s more than just medical. It\u2019s love and acceptance.\u201d",
      "A subset of young people may be offered additional interventions such as puberty blockers to ease distress and give them time to explore their gender identity.",
      "The drugs, known as GnRH agonists, block the release of key hormones involved in sexual maturation. They\u2019ve been used for decades to treat precocious puberty, an uncommon medical condition that causes puberty to begin abnormally early.",
      "The medication starts after a young person show early signs of puberty \u2014 enlargement of breasts or testicles. This typically occurs around age 8 to 13 for those assigned female at birth and a year or two later for those assigned male at birth.",
      "The drugs can be given as injections every few months or as arm implants lasting up to a year or two. Many of the effects are reversible \u2014 puberty and sexual development resume as soon as the drugs are stopped. Researchers are exploring the effects of puberty blockers on bone development, but no research has shown an increased risk for bone fractures.",
      "Young people can stay on puberty blockers for several years.",
      "After puberty blockers, trans adolescents go through puberty either with or without hormone treatment.",
      "Some may choose to take hormones to make their bodies more closely match their gender identity. They take manufactured versions of either estrogen or testosterone \u2014 hormones that prompt sexual development in puberty. Estrogen comes in skin patches and pills. Testosterone is available in injections, implants or gels.",
      "Guidelines recommend starting these when teens are mature enough to make informed medical decisions. Many transgender people take the hormones for life.",
      "If the medication is stopped, some physical changes remain. Testosterone generally leads to permanent voice-lowering, facial hair and development of the Adam\u2019s apple. Estrogen can lead to permanent breast development.",
      "Research on long-term hormone use in transgender adults has found potential health risks including a modest risk for blood clots with estrogen and negative cholesterol changes with testosterone.",
      "Gender-affirming surgery in transgender teens is far less common than hormone treatment. When it is done among transgender youth, it\u2019s almost always breast reduction surgery in older transgender males.",
      "Even so, that type of surgery is extremely rare. Perhaps surprisingly, breast reduction among minors is most frequently performed in males who are not transgender. This is for a condition called gynecomastia, which means having more breast tissue than usual.",
      "A study looking at millions of 2019 insurance claims found 151 breast reductions performed for U.S. minors. Nearly all \u2014 97% \u2014 were not transgender.",
      "Research suggests that transgender youth are prone to stress, depression and suicidal thoughts. Some studies suggest treatment for gender dysphoria can improve young people\u2019s well-being, but some nuances remain unclear.",
      "In one study, researchers spent two years testing and tracking 315 transgender youth who received hormone therapy. Depression and anxiety symptoms eased and life satisfaction increased among those designated female at birth, but not among those designated male at birth. The researchers speculated that the youth designated male at birth might be more affected by stress from being different from most of their peers.",
      "In the same study, published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, two participants died by suicide \u2014 one after six months and the other after a year.",
      "Longer term studies on treatment outcomes are underway.",

      "The issue of transgender rights animated the presidential campaign",
      "WASHINGTON -- When the Supreme Court this week wades into the contentious issue of transgender rights, the justices will hear from an attorney with knowledge that runs deep.",
      "Chase Strangio will be the first openly transgender attorney to argue before the nation's highest court, representing families who say Tennessee\u2019s ban on health care for transgender minors leaves their children terrified about the future.",
      "Arguments in the case come amid heightened pushback to transgender rights, including a presidential campaign where Republican Donald Trump put his fierce opposition front and center.",
      "Strangio will bring months of intense legal preparation to the case as well as hard-won lessons from his own experience.",
      "\u201cI am able to do my job because I have had this health care that transformed and, frankly, saved my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a testament to the fact that we live among everyone.\u201d",
      "Strangio grew up outside of Boston and came out as trans when he was in law school. Now 42, he's an American Civil Liberties Union attorney whose legal career has included representing former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, challenging a ban on transgender people serving in the military and helping win an LGBTQ+ worker-discrimination case at the Supreme Court. He's also the father of a 12-year-old, the son of a father who supports Trump, and has a close relationship with his Army-veteran brother.",
      "He's also an advocate, speaking out as a series of U.S. states banned gender-affirming health care for transgender minors. The laws are part of a wave of restrictions on school sports participation and bathroom usage around the country. After the first openly transgender person was elected to Congress, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., declared support for restricting bathroom use to sex assigned at birth.",
      "Tennessee, meanwhile, will argue before the Supreme Court that treatments like puberty blockers and hormones carry risks for young people and its law protects them from making treatment decisions prematurely.",
      "\u201cTennessee, like many other states, acted to ensure that minors do not receive these treatments until they can fully understand the lifelong consequences or until the science is developed to the point that Tennessee might take a different view of their efficacy,\u201d state attorneys wrote in court filings.",
      "Arguing for Tennessee is state Solicitor General Matt Rice. He served in 2019 as a clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented from the transgender worker-discrimination case Strangio worked on that term. The state attorney general's office did not make Rice available for an interview ahead of arguments, but his background also includes a couple of years as a minor league baseball player for the Tampa Bay Rays before he earned his law degree from the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "The Biden administration is supporting the challenge to Tennessee's law, but the federal government\u2019s position is expected to change after Trump takes office in January. Strangio said he'll nevertheless keep advocating for transgender youth to access health care that wasn't available when he was young.",
      "\u201cMany of us think about our childhood and young adulthood as lost years, when we were just simply disembodied from our core,\u201d he said. Major medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, oppose the bans and have endorsed such care, saying it\u2019s safe when administered properly. Strangio also pointed out that many medical interventions for young people, like gastric bypass surgeries for weight loss, carry some risk and it makes sense to inform families and let them decide.",
      "\u201cThere is harm that is compounded when we are forcing young people to be denied care that their doctors and their parents and they themselves all agree they need,\u201d he said.",
      "The Supreme Court is expected to decide the case by the summer.",

    "story": [
      "As temperatures drop into the teens, Minnesotans have embraced sauna culture for warmth and community",
      "EAGAN, Minn. -- As another frigid winter settles over Minnesota with temperatures dipping into the teens, people like Ed Kranz are embracing the cold \u2014 and working up quite a sweat.",
      "Kranz and his wife, Colleen, are among Minnesotans who believe the best way to endure winter is to heat up in saunas and then cool off in their state's icy weather.",
      "On a bone-chilling Sunday morning, they set up a mobile wood-fired sauna from their business, Saunable, near a frozen lake in the Minneapolis suburb of Eagan. After about 10 minutes of sweating in the 185 degrees Fahrenheit (85 degrees Celsius) sauna they moseyed outside into the 15-degree temperatures, lingering around a fire in bathing suits before repeating the process three or four more times. One brave soul dipped into a hole in the frozen lake for a post-sauna cold plunge.",
      "Their hot-and-cold venture is common in Minnesota, where plenty of residents embrace sauna culture for warmth and community. Devotees say they are mingling Old World traditions with newfangled internet-based communities, and making social connections in a society that can feel isolating.",
      "Sauna and cold plunges go together like peanut butter and jelly, said Glenn Auerbach, a self-described sauna evangelist and the founder and editor of SaunaTimes. Auerbach started the website in 2008 to share his thoughts, research and conversations with movers and shakers in the sauna world. He and his interlocutors mull over the nitty-gritty of sauna construction, how to cultivate \u201cgood sauna vibes\u201d and the potential health benefits of the sauna lifestyle.",
      "A typical temperature to achieve the holy trinity of the sauna experience \u2014 heat, steam and ventilation \u2014 is about 180 to 200 degrees F (82-93 degrees C), a temperature that starkly contrasts Minnesota's frigid winter weather.",
      "The craftiest in the sauna community can build a facility for about $10,000, according to Auerbach. Those looking to skip the physical labor can outsource the construction. Sauna's popularity, which enthusiasts say spiked following the COVID-19 pandemic, has brought with it a rise in manufacturers selling saunas for about $30,000 to $40,000.",
      "While sauna's cultural cache may have increased in recent years, the practice long predates the Instagrammable spaces now popping up, Auerbach said.",
      "The smell of cedar wood has been lodged in Justin Juntunen's memory ever since he first stepped into his family's sauna as a child. Juntunen, the founder of Cedar and Stone Nordic Sauna, is a descendant of Finnish immigrants who came to America in the 1880s. They brought with them an appreciation for saunas and the communal values the steam-filled rooms impart to local life.",
      "People in Finland say there are more saunas than cars, Juntunen said. When immigrants like his grandfather came to Minnesota to work in the mines, mills or docks, they would often save up to build a farmhouse. But they would build a sauna first, living in the space while the house was constructed. Later, saunas would serve as informal town centers.",
      "People gossiped in saunas, they gave birth in saunas and they died in saunas, Juntunen said. The public nature of the facilities reflects the egalitarian ethos that infuses Nordic culture, and sauna culture by extension, he added.",
      "\u201cThis is a tradition that\u2019s actually for everyone,\u201d Juntunen said. \u201cMy favorite Nordic proverb is all people are created equal, but nowhere more so than in the sauna.\"",
      "In addition to a desire for in-person experiences following the COVID-19 pandemic, sauna enthusiasts say interest rose after some of the internet\u2019s most famous figures, such as podcasters Joe Rogan and Andrew Huberman, touted it.",
      "\u201cEvery big podcaster in the world discovered that you could jump in cold water and it feels kind of good. And then people click on it online,\u201d Juntunen said.",
      "In this way, technology has been a paradox for sauna culture, he added. Digital media helped sauna culture grow at the same time as saunas were billed as reprieves from the pervasive reach of technology over every facet of daily life.",
      "Either way, almost all of sauna culture's adherents say its rise is inextricably linked to a desire for community.",
      "Those who committed to building their own saunas have hosted friends, neighbors, and former high school hockey teammates over. This has created a new form of post-COVID-19 contagiousness: \u201cGood heat is contagious,\u201d Auerbach said.",
      "This core function of sauna culture spans generations. Juntunen's grandfather would rush to the sauna after work because it was the space where stories were told.",
      "\"It\u2019s a space where storytelling happens, where connection happens or silence happens,\" Juntunen said. \u201cI think that is a really beautiful example of what a sauna truly is.\u201d"

      "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional care homes, worried about abandonment and quality issues",
      "HONG KONG -- Every Wednesday, retiree Zhang Zhili travels an hour by bus to an education center, drawn by the pulsing rhythms of the African drum she plays there in a classroom filled with fellow retirees whose hands move in unison, every beat lifting her spirits.",
      "Zhang, 71, has found joy and new friends at the \u201celderly university\u201d in Beijing. Besides African drums, the former primary school teacher joins social dance classes, paying about 2,000 yuan ($280) for two courses this semester. Seeing herself standing tall in dance class boosts her confidence. After class, she hangs out with her friends.",
      "\u201cWhen we get old, what do we need?\" she said. \u201cTo love ourselves.\u201d",
      "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional nursing homes, afraid of abandonment by their families and quality issues. That's driving a boom in universities, home care services, and communities catering to older adults. Though some providers struggle to turn a profit, they persist because they see promise in the growing market.",
      "China has a rapidly aging population. Last year, about 297 million people were aged 60 or above, over one-fifth of the population. By 2035, this number is forecast to exceed 400 million, or over 30% of all Chinese.",
      "That's fueling growth in services and products aimed at older adults in what Beijing calls the silver economy, which is projected to balloon from about 7 trillion yuan (about $982 billion) currently to approximately 30 trillion yuan (about $4.2 trillion) in 2035, raising its share in the economy from about 6% to roughly 10%, Hu Zuquan, a researcher at the State Information Center, a public institution affiliated with China's main planning agency, told state media.",
      "Du Peng, dean of the school of population and health at Beijing's Renmin University, said the government is expanding basic care services to all older people who need them, moving beyond its traditional focus on those without family support. Last year, officials compiled a list of basic care services they aim to make available nationwide, including providing ability assessments for those over 65 and care training subsidies for family members of those who are disabled.",
      "Filial piety runs deep in China and most older people prefer aging at home with family after they retire, typically when they're 50 to 60 years old, one of the youngest retirement ages among the world\u2019s major economies. Many help care for their grandchildren, and for some, nursing homes are seen as a kind of abandonment, except in cases of serious disability.",
      "In January, Beijing issued new guidelines calling for expanding home care services and meal deliveries and more clothing, food and tech products tailored for older adults. They include enriching their lives through education.",
      "Home-based services offer a more affordable alternative to nursing homes, alleviating accommodation costs, Du said. Most older Chinese are relatively healthy, and these able people perhaps need richer cultural lives rather than disability care, he said.",
      "Cai Guixia, 60, said she has found fulfillment in African drumming and modeling classes. She thinks she would feel \u201cforsaken\u201d in a conventional nursing home, preferring to hire a domestic helper.",
      "Liu Xiuqin, an owner of two care homes, saw business opportunities in meeting those needs.",
      "She invested more than 800,000 yuan (about $112,000) to open a school in Beijing. Cai and Zhang are among its 150 students attending classes in dance, singing, yoga and modeling training for about 1,000 yuan ($140) per course each semester. Outside the classroom, her team organizes gatherings where students can socialize.",
      "Liu expects to break even in another year and is prepared for the wait. She believes in the market's future, given that the generation born in the 1960s and later values quality of life and health more than their parents did.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about making quick money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt requires persistence.\u201d",
      "Turning a profit is proving challenging for some silver economy businesses.",
      "In the southern city of Guangzhou, Wu Tang co-founded a school last year after his geotechnical investigation and surveying business was hit by the downturn in China\u2019s property market. His school offers courses to help people achieve some of their childhood dreams, but he has yet to cover his costs. He also faces competition from cheaper government-run courses.",
      "And there's Cui Yang, who runs a care station in Beijing, sending helpers zigzagging across the district to provide 30 yuan ($4.20) haircuts at home; accompanying people on hospital visits for 50 yuan ($7) per hour and other services. Even with government subsidies including free rent, Cui is losing money. Without the subsidies, the business would fail, she said.",
      "The struggles aren\u2019t limited to small operators.",
      "Wu Wenjing heads the home care department of a healthcare subsidiary of state-owned financial conglomerate China Everbright Group in southwest China's Chongqing. It has been in the red for 13 straight years, spending 5 million yuan (about $702,000) annually and still losing 1 million (about $140,000) a year, she said.",
      "Wu's business employs 70 workers who visit homes as caregivers, rehabilitation therapists and psychotherapists. The industry is competitive and it has a high turnover rate given the difficulties of working alone in clients\u2019 homes. Wu hopes to break even in five years, and is delighted about the government's efforts to grow the silver economy.",
      "\"The spring of China\u2019s elderly care business has finally come,\u201d she said.",
      "Various companies are looking to grab a slice of this government-backed market. Property developers like Vanke Co. and Sino-Ocean Group and insurance companies such as Taikang Insurance Group have built high-end communities for older adults with amenities such as movie-screening and mahjong rooms and dining services.",
      "China's also working to tackle the problem of dementia, providing cognitive screening tests and training staff who work in memory clinics or as social workers. Several Chinese pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working on drugs targeting Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia.",
      "Some vacant schools and kindergartens -- casualties of the country\u2019s declining birthrate -- are meanwhile being transformed into care facilities for older people.",
      "Government efforts to back the silver economy are paying off: official data showed the country had 410,000 care facilities by June, double the number in 2019.",
      "Still, questions remain about the spending power of many older Chinese.",
      "A 2021 national survey co-conducted by China's Civil Affairs Ministry found older adults had a median annual income of 11,400 yuan ($1,574). In rural areas it was less than half of that. More than one in 10 older Chinese are living in poverty, with living standards much lower in rural areas and western China, according to data from surveys conducted by Peking University.",
      "China's silver economy is still in its infancy, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis Corporate and Investment Banking.",
      "If they lack enough insurance to cover medical and other expenses, many older Chinese must set aside funds for such costs, limiting their spending capacity, he said, and it takes time to build industries producing senior-focused products and people trained to provide such services. Tax incentives and investments in training a skilled workforce would help, he said.",
      "\u201cThere are prospects here, but it seems there's still much that needs to be done,\u201d he said.",

      "Members of Parliament (MPs), who have been holding emotional meetings with constituents and searching their souls, are due to debate the issue that crosses political lines.",
      "Supporters say the law would provide dignity to the dying and prevent unnecessary suffering. Opponents say it would put vulnerable people at risk, fearing that some would be coerced to end their lives and that some elderly or disabled people may opt for death so they don't become a burden.",
      "A vote in favor of the bill would send it to another round of hearings. A vote against it would kill it.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s in the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill and the next steps:",
      "The House of Commons hasn't debated an assisted dying bill since 2015 when a similar measure failed.",
      "Debate is scheduled for five hours and more than 150 members have reportedly signed up to speak. It is expected to be followed by a close vote.",
      "Although the current bill was proposed by a member of the ruling center-left Labour Party, it is an open vote with no pressure from the government on supporting it.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has previously supported assisted dying, said the government will remain neutral and he wouldn't reveal how he would vote. Some members of his cabinet have said they will support the bill, while others are against it.",
      "Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, along with three former Conservative prime ministers \u2014 Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, and Theresa May \u2014 have publicly opposed the bill, though they are no longer in the House of Commons and can't vote. Former Tory Prime Minister David Cameron supports it.",
      "If the bill passes the first stage in the House of Commons, it will face further scrutiny and votes in both Houses of Parliament.",
      "If ultimately approved, any new law is unlikely to come into effect within the next two to three years, supporters say.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, only those over 18 years old in England and Wales and who are expected to die within six months can request assisted dying. They must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and will be required to make two separate declarations about their wish to die.",
      "Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater, who proposed the bill, said the law has robust safeguards built in and contains \u201cthree layers of scrutiny\u201d \u2014 two independent doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision.",
      "Anyone found guilty of pressuring, coercing or dishonestly getting someone to make a declaration that they wish to die will face up to 14 years in prison.",
      "Assisted suicide is currently banned in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Someone who helps a person end their life can be prosecuted and face up to 14 years in prison.",
      "The patient must self-administer the life-ending medication. No doctor or anyone else can give the medication.",
      "No health professional is under any obligation to provide assistance to the patient.",
      "Doctors who do take part would have to be satisfied the person making their declaration to die has done so voluntarily. They also must ensure the person is making an informed choice.",
      "One argument supporting the bill is that wealthy individuals can travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to go there to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones to die.",
      "Esther Rantzen, 84, a broadcaster dying of lung cancer, has urged passage of the bill so others don\u2019t have to do what she plans to do by traveling to Switzerland to legally end her life. She urged all 650 MPs to attend the hearing.",
      "\u201cThis is such a vital life and death issue, one that we the public care desperately about,\u201d Rantzen said in a public letter. \u201cIt is only right that as many MPs as possible listen to the arguments for and against, and make up your own minds, according to your own conscience, your personal thoughts and feelings.\u201d",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves healthcare practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances."

      "Under a Massachusetts law signed in 2018, the age to buy any tobacco product \u2014 including cigarettes, cigars and e-cigarettes \u2014 was raised to 21. Massachusetts also has banned the sale of all flavored tobacco products in an effort to reduce youth interest in nicotine.",
      "The new proposal, which lawmakers plan to file next year, would expand the effort to curb smoking by gradually ending all sales of nicotine and tobacco products. If the bill is approved, young people not old enough to legally purchase nicotine and tobacco would never be lawfully able to purchase them in Massachusetts, thereby creating no more new users.",
      "It would not apply to marijuana, and the cutoff date would be adjusted when passed to ensure everyone age 21 and above at that time would not be affected.",
      "Brookline, a town of about 63,000 neighboring Boston, was the first municipality in the country to adopt such a ban in 2020. Instead of raising the age for purchasing cigarettes, the bylaw blocks the sale of tobacco to anyone born on or after Jan. 1, 2000. The rule went into effect in 2021.",
      "That would mean at some point in the future no one would be allowed to buy any tobacco products in the town. The measure was challenged, but the state's highest court weighed in earlier this year, upholding the ban.",
      "Other Massachusetts cities and towns already have approved similar tobacco bans, including Malden, Melrose, Reading, Stoneham, Wakefield, and Winchester.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Jason Lewis, one of the backers of the statewide proposal, said the bill would \"save countless lives and create a healthier world for the next generation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe all know the devastating health effects of nicotine and tobacco products, especially on our youth,\" he said.",
      "Nicotine and tobacco products are addictive and can increase the risk of lung cancer, heart disease, stroke and other illnesses.",
      "Nearly 9 out of 10 adults who smoke cigarettes daily first tried smoking by age 18, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which also found that in 2024 about 2 in 5 students who had ever used a tobacco product currently used them.",
      "Peter Brennan, executive director of the New England Convenience Store and Energy Marketers Association, said the proposal would undercut small mom and pop shops that rely on cigarettes for a significant portion of their sales.",
      "It also would put stores located near neighboring states that allow the sale of cigarettes to all adults at a competitive disadvantage.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible idea,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re really just taking away adults\u2019 right to purchase a legal, age-restricted product.\u201d",
      "Taking certain rights away from some adults and not others is likely unconstitutional, he said, adding that other prohibition efforts haven\u2019t worked, like past bans on alcohol, marijuana and gambling.",
      "It's unclear how much support the proposal has in the Legislature.",
      "Massachusetts has taken other steps in recent decades to curb smoking, including raising taxes on cigarettes. Those taxes would presumably be reduced and ultimately eliminated by an incremental statewide smoking ban.",
      "Any reduction in cigarette tax revenue would be more than offset by reduced healthcare costs and other savings, Lewis said.",
      "In 2022, 10.4% of adults in Massachusetts reported smoking cigarettes, according to the state Department of Public Health.",
      "Some California lawmakers have pushed to ban all tobacco sales, filing legislation last year to make it illegal to sell cigarettes and other products to anyone born after Jan. 1, 2007.",
      "In 2022, New Zealand became the first nation to pass a law intended to impose a lifetime ban on young people buying cigarettes by mandating that tobacco can\u2019t ever be sold to anybody born on or after Jan. 1, 2009. The law was later axed.",
      "In the U.K., Prime Minister Rishi Sunak proposed raising the legal age that people in England can buy cigarettes by one year, every year until it is eventually illegal for the whole population. The proposal failed to win approval earlier this year."

      "A Zimbabwean High Court judge has ruled that provisions of a law that deny abortion services to women raped by their husbands and girls under the age of 18 are unconstitutional",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- A law prohibiting abortion services for women raped by their husbands and girls under the age of 18 is unconstitutional, Zimbabwe\u2019s High Court has ruled.",
      "In his ruling handed down on Nov. 22 and made public this week, Judge Maxwell Takuva said since Zimbabwe\u2019s laws already criminalize marital rape and sex with a minor, victims should be allowed to abort if they become pregnant.",
      "The ruling is significant, given Zimbabwe\u2019s restrictive abortion laws that often lead women and girls into illegal and unsafe backstreet abortions that in many cases turn fatal.",
      "Abortion is allowed in very few circumstances in Zimbabwe, including such as if the pregnancy endangers the life of a woman, or if there is a risk of a physical or mental defect \u201cof such a nature that (the child) will permanently be seriously handicapped.\u201d Women can also access legal abortion services in cases of unlawful sex such as incest.",
      "Zimbabwe criminalized sex with any person below 18 in September following an earlier constitutional court ruling ordering parliament to raise the legal age of consent for sex to 18 from 16. But the highly restrictive Termination of Pregnancy Act still denied abortion services for girls under 18.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that it is torture, cruel and degrading treatment for a child to carry another child, for a child to give birth to another child or for a child to be forced to illegally abort because of cruel circumstances,\u201d said the judge.",
      "The government did not mount any opposition to the case, which was brought by a women\u2019s rights group, although the ruling must still be approved by the Constitutional Court to become effective.",
      "The judge said providing access to safe and legal abortion services for underage girls \u201cis significant in light of the massive instances of teenage pregnancies in Zimbabwe, and consequently illegal teen abortions and teenage mortalities.\u201d",
      "The country of 15 million people records about 77,000 unsafe abortions annually, but many others go unreported. Many girls and women die from abortion complications each year, according to the United Nations children\u2019s agency, UNICEF.",
      "Teen pregnancies are rife in the southern African country because of lax enforcement of laws, cultural and religious practices and widespread poverty that also make it difficult for girls and women to access contraceptives and clinics.",
      "Almost one of every four girls falls pregnant between the ages of 10 and 19, according to figures by the government and UNICEF. One of every three girls is wed before age 18 in the deeply conservative southern African country where girls are usually culturally forced to marry men responsible for their unplanned pregnancies."

      "The Americans \u2014 Kurt Blair, 56, from Colorado and Carlos Romero, 50, of California \u2014 are certified alpine guides, according to the website of the American Mountain Guides Association. A statement by New Zealand's police did not name the Canadian climber, citing the need to notify his family.",
      "The men flew to a hut partway up the mountain on Saturday to begin their ascent and were reported missing on Monday when they did not arrive to meet their prearranged transport after the climb. Searchers hours later found several climbing-related items believed to belong to the men, but no sign of them, police said.",
      "Search efforts did not resume Tuesday due to deteriorating weather conditions on Aoraki, also known as Mount Cook, with heavy rain and snow forecast. Operations were unlikely to begin again until conditions improved, expected to be on Thursday.",
      "Aoraki is 3,724 meters (12,218 feet) high and is part of the Southern Alps, the scenic and icy mountain range that runs the length of New Zealand's South Island. A settlement of the same name at its base is a destination for domestic and foreign tourists.",
      "The peak is popular among experienced climbers. Its terrain is technically difficult due to crevasses, avalanche risk, changeable weather and glacier movement.",
      "More than 240 deaths have been recorded on the mountain and in the surrounding national park since the start of the 20th century."

      "According to the verdict, two of the four years in prison were suspended, meaning they won't have to be served unless they're found guilty of another crime.",
      "The women are held at a police hospital outside Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, and authorities have previously said they would not have to serve prison time until after giving birth.",
      "The women can appeal the verdict, said court spokesperson So Sarin. He refused to comment on how many were still pregnant, or what would happen to the babies after they have given birth.",

      "Opposition parties submitted the impeachment motion just hours after parliament unanimously voted to cancel Yoon's declaration, forcing him to lift martial law about six hours after it began. Impeaching Yoon requires the support of two-thirds of the National Assembly and at least six of the nine Constitutional Court justices.

      "In the late 1980s, South Korea had a series of strongmen who repeatedly invoked North Korea when struggling to control domestic dissidents and political opponents.",
      "Yoon has struggled to get his agenda through an opposition-dominated parliament while corruption scandals involving him and his wife.",
      "The opposition lambasted Yoon's actions as undemocratic. Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, called Yoon\u2019s announcement \u201cillegal and unconstitutional.\u201d",
      "The sudden declaration was also opposed by the leader of Yoon's own conservative party, Han Dong-hoon, who called the decision wrong and vowed to \u201cstop it with the people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe people will block the president\u2019s anti-constitutional step. The military must be on the side of the public in any case. Let\u2019s resolutely oppose it,\u201d Kim Dong Yeon, the opposition party governor of Gyeonggi province, which surrounds Seoul, wrote on X.",
      "Average South Koreans were in shock. Social media was flooded with messages expressing surprise and worry over Yoon\u2019s announcement.",
      "There were quick claims that the emergency declaration was linked to Yoon\u2019s political struggles.",
      "He has had little success in getting his policies adopted by a parliament that has been controlled by the opposition since he took over in 2022.",
      "Conservatives have said the opposition moves are political revenge for investigations into Lee, who is seen as the favorite for the next presidential election in 2027.",
      "Just this month, Yoon denied wrongdoing in an influence-peddling scandal involving him and his wife. The claims have battered his approval ratings and fueled attacks by his rivals.",
      "The scandal centers on claims that Yoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee exerted inappropriate influence on the conservative ruling People Power Party to pick a certain candidate to run for a parliamentary by-election in 2022 at the request of Myung Tae-kyun, an election broker and founder of a polling agency who conducted free opinion surveys for Yoon before he became president.",
      "Yoon has said he did nothing inappropriate.",
      "South Korea became a democracy only in the late 1980s, and military intervention in civilian affairs is still a touchy subject.",
      "During the dictatorships that emerged as the country rebuilt from the 1950-53 Korean War, leaders occasionally proclaimed martial law that allowed them to station combat soldiers, tanks and armored vehicles on streets or in public places to prevent anti-government demonstrations.",
      "Such scenes are unimaginable for many today.",
      "Dictator Park Chung-hee, who ruled South Korea for nearly 20 years before he was assassinated by his spy chief in 1979, led several thousand troops into Seoul in the early hours of May 16, 1961, in the country\u2019s first coup. He proclaimed martial law several times to stop protests and jail critics.",
      "Less than two months after Park\u2019s death, Maj. Gen. Chun Doo-hwan led tanks and troops into Seoul in December 1979 in the country\u2019s second coup. The next year, he orchestrated a brutal military crackdown on a pro-democracy uprising in the southern city of Gwangju, killing at least 200 people.",
      "In the summer of 1987, massive street protests forced Chun\u2019s government to accept direct presidential elections. His army buddy Roh Tae-woo, who had joined Chun\u2019s 1979 coup, won the election held later in 1987 thanks largely to divided votes among liberal opposition candidates.",

      "Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral has some surprising stories to tell before it reopens this weekend after five years of restoration",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Notre Dame Cathedral, which is set to reopen to the public on Sunday after a five-year restoration following a devastating fire, stands as a jewel of Gothic architecture, a symbol of Paris and a tourist mecca.",
      "But behind the grandeur of the cathedral, which took 182 years to build between the 12th and 14th centuries, lie some surprising stories. From medieval myths to modern-day mysteries, here are five special things to know about this Paris landmark:",
      "Notre Dame\u2019s importance goes beyond its architecture and history \u2014 it\u2019s literally the point from which all roads in France begin.",
      "In front of the cathedral, embedded in the cobblestones, lies a modest bronze-and-stone slab with the inscription \u201cpoint z\u00e9ro des routes de France,\u201d meaning \u201cstarting point of the roads of France.'' This plaque marks the starting point for measuring distances between Paris and other cities across the country.",
      "While the plaque was installed in 1924, the idea of a national \u201cground zero\u201d dates to 1769. King Louis XV envisioned a central reference for France\u2019s growing network of roads, a concept that tied the nation\u2019s geography to its heart in Paris.",
      "Those scary stone creatures on Notre Dame might seem ancient, but not all of them are what they appear. The actual gargoyles, which are monster-shaped gutters used to drain rainwater, have been around since the time of the cathedral\u2019s construction. But the dramatic, monster-like figures often depicted on postcards and movies are chimera, and they\u2019re much newer.",
      "In the 19th century, the architect Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc, who was in charge of renovating the then-decaying building, added these creatures to add to the mystique of the cathedral. Viollet-le-Duc drew inspiration from Victor Hugo\u2019s famous book \u2018\u2019The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' to create these demonic animal figures with personified expressions.",
      "How to tell them apart? Gargoyles resemble horizontal spikes coming out of the facade and have holes in their spouts to allow water to drain.",
      "During the French Revolution, which saw waves of protest against the Church, Notre Dame wasn\u2019t exactly treated like a revered cathedral. In 1793, revolutionaries stripped it of its religious symbols and renamed it \u201cNotre-Dame de la Raison\u201d (Our Lady of Reason).",
      "Instead, the cathedral hosted festivals celebrating science and Enlightenment ideas, and for a short time, it was even used as a wine warehouse.",
      "Religious services resumed in 1795, and Notre Dame regained its sacred status on the impulse of French emperor Napoleon I, who held his coronation there in 1804, immortalized in a famous painting by Jacques-Louis David.",
      "In 1792, revolutionaries also decapitated 28 statues from Notre Dame\u2019s facade, mistaking them for French monarchs. They were actually ancient kings of Judah, biblical ancestors of Jesus. The heads were thought lost forever, possibly destroyed or sold as building materials.",
      "But in 1977, workers renovating a courtyard in Paris\u2019 9th arrondissement uncovered hundreds of fragments of stone sculptures. Experts confirmed they were the missing heads of Notre Dame\u2019s kings. How they ended up buried there remains a mystery.",
      "Today, 22 of the heads have been restored and are displayed at the Cluny Museum in Paris. Their discovery is considered one of the most remarkable archaeological finds in the city\u2019s modern history.",
      "The 2019 fire that almost destroyed Notre Dame revealed a serious health risk. When the flames melted the roof, tons of toxic lead dust were released into the air and settled across Paris.",
      "The problem? Authorities discovered there were no rules to measure the danger of outdoor lead dust. This wasn\u2019t just a Paris issue \u2014 major cities like London and Rome, and even the World Health Organization, don\u2019t have guidelines for outdoor lead pollution.",
      "The Notre Dame fire highlighted a hidden problem, forcing officials to take a closer look at their safety standards. It took four months for the city to complete a deep-clean operation of the sidewalks even as tourists, residents and merchants walked streets around the cathedral daily.",

      "The incident happened in waters close to their maritime border in the Andaman Sea. One Thai trawler was captured and its crew of 31 detained, four of whom were Thai and the remainder Myanmar nationals. Thailand has a vast fishing fleet but it is largely crewed by men from poorer neighboring countries.",
      "The Thai navy acknowledged that Thai fishing boats had been in Myanmar\u2019s waters, but raised questions about the use of disproportionate force by Myanmar.",
      "An audio statement released Monday night by Myanmar\u2019s military government said that its navy had not intruded into Thai waters in seizing the Thai boat, one of five that had been fishing in its maritime territory since Friday night.",
      "The statement, read by Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, spokesperson of Myanmar\u2019s military government, confirmed that 27 Myanmar nationals and four Thai nationals, all men, were safe in captivity.",
      "Although Myanmar\u2019s military government is ostracized by many Western nations because of its suppression of democracy and poor human rights record, Thailand maintains relatively warm relations with it.",
      "Zaw Min Tun accused \u201cnation-subversive media and some online inciters\u201d of working to damage relations between the neighbors.",
      "\u201cI would like to say that there is good continuous communication between the governments and the militaries of the two sides,\u201d he said.",
      "Early this week, Myanmar\u2019s navy was accused of shooting at a Bangladeshi fishing boat in a contested area in the Bay of Bengal.",
      "Bangladeshi media reported one of six fishermen on the boat was injured by gunfire, but Myanmar\u2019s state-run media said there was no navy vessel in the area on the day of the incident."

      "Toomaj Salehi spent a little over a year in jail and faced a death sentence issued by a Revolutionary Court, which usually involves closed-door hearings and gives limited rights to those on trial. The sentencing drew international criticism and was overturned in June.",

      "He spent time in and out of jail and said in a video message that he was tortured during detention, which led to his arrest in Nov. 2023. State media at the time released a video showing him blindfolded and apologizing for his words, a statement likely to have been made under duress.",
      "UN investigators say Iran was responsible for Amini\u2019s death, and that it violently put down largely peaceful protests, killing more than 500 people and detaining over 22,000.",

      "Tommy Banks, who owns two Michelin-starred restaurants and a pub in the northern English county of Yorkshire, said a member of staff discovered the van was missing, along with its cargo of steak and ale, turkey and butternut squash pies intended for a Christmas market in the city of York. The food has been valued at 25,000 pounds ($32,000).",
      "Banks said the van was insured, but he implored the vehicle thieves not to let the food go to waste. In an Instagram video, he suggested they \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and drop the pies at a community center or other venue.",
      "In an update, Banks said police had found the van, badly damaged and with stolen license plates, in Middlesbrough, about 30 miles (50 km) from where it was taken. He said the pies were still inside but were damaged and would have to be discarded.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so much waste. It\u2019s just rubbish,\u201d Banks said in a video on Instagram. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s not a happier ending to this story.\u201d",
      "The pie heist is the latest theft of artisanal edibles to rock the U.K. food trade. In October, nearly 1,000 wheels of cloth-wrapped artisanal cheddar weighing 22 metric tons (48,488 pounds) and valued at 300,000 pounds ($390,000) were swiped from London\u2019s Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy by a con artist posing as a wholesale distributor for a major French retailer.",
      "Despite a hunt by British and international police \u2014 and an appeal by TV chef Jamie Oliver \u2014 the cheese has not been found. A 63-year-old man was arrested and questioned by police, but has not been charged."

      "Now al-Golani, 42, seeks to seize the moment yet again, leading his fighters in a stunning offensive that has put them in control of Syria\u2019s largest city, reigniting the country's long civil war and raising new questions about President Bashar Assad\u2019s hold on power.",
      "The surge and al-Golani's place at the head of it are evidence of a remarkable transformation. Al-Golani's success on the battlefield follows years of maneuvering among extremist organizations while eliminating competitors and former allies.",

The native of Syria was detained several times by the U.S. military, but remained in Iraq. During that time, al-Qaida usurped likeminded groups and formed the extremist Islamic State of Iraq, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.",
      "In 2011, a popular uprising against Syria's Assad triggered a brutal government crackdown and led to all-out war. Al-Golani's prominence grew when al-Baghdadi sent him to Syria to establish a branch of al-Qaida called the Nusra Front. The United States labeled the new group as a terrorist organization. That designation still remains in place and the U.S. government has put a $10 million bounty on him.",
      "As Syria's civil war intensified in 2013, so did al-Golani\u2019s ambitions. He defied al-Baghdadi\u2019s calls to dissolve the Nusra Front and merge it with al-Qaida's operation in Iraq, to form the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS.",
      "Al-Golani nonetheless pledged his allegiance to al-Qaida, which later disassociated itself from ISIS. The Nusra Front battled ISIS and eliminated much of its competition among the Syrian armed opposition to Assad. In his first interview in 2014, al-Golani kept his face covered, telling a reporter for Qatari network Al-Jazeera that he rejected political talks in Geneva to end the conflict. He said his goal was to see Syria ruled under Islamic law and made clear that there was no room for the country's Alawite, Shiite, Druze, and Christian minorities.",
      "In 2016, al-Golani revealed his face to the public for the first time in a video message that announced his group was renaming itself Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and cutting its ties to al-Qaida.",
      "\u201cThis new organization has no affiliation to any external entity,\u201d he said in the video, filmed wearing military garb and a turban.",
      "The move paved the way for al-Golani to assert full control over fracturing militant groups. A year later, his alliance rebranded again as HTS as the groups merged, consolidating al-Golani\u2019s power in northwest Syria\u2019s Idlib province.",
      "Afterward HTS clashed with independent Islamist militants who opposed the merger, further emboldening al-Golani and and his group as the leading power in northwestern Syria, able to rule with an iron fist.",
      "With his power consolidated, al-Golani set in motion a transformation that few could have imagined. Replacing his military garb with shirt and trousers, he began calling for religious tolerance and pluralism. He appealed to the Druze community in Idlib, which the Nusra Front had previously targeted, and visited the families of Kurds who were killed by Turkish-backed militias.",
      "In 2021, al-Golani had his first interview with an American journalist on PBS. Wearing a blazer, with his short hair gelled back, the now more soft-spoken HTS leader said that his group posed no threat to the West and that sanctions imposed against it were unjust.",
      "\u201cYes, we have criticized Western policies,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to wage a war against the United States or Europe from Syria, that\u2019s not true. We didn\u2019t say we wanted to fight.\u201d"

      "For the artistic and cultural elites of the West African nation of Senegal, the monthlong Dakar Biennale of Contemporary African Arts is a celebratory moment",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- For the artistic and cultural elites of Senegal, the monthlong Dakar Biennale of Contemporary African Arts is a celebratory moment.",
      "Every two years, hundreds of artists, curators and art lovers from across the world descend on the West African capital to attend the event, which was founded in 1989 by the Senegalese government and has over the decades become one of the most important showcases on the continent.",
      "Pop-up exhibitions are held in hundreds of venues, from stylish five-star hotels to local art galleries. Roads are even more crowded than usual, with traffic jams stretching out for miles along the Corniche, the city\u2019s picturesque seaside boulevard. Every night, there are music concerts, fashion shows, talks with artists and movie screenings held against the backdrop of palm trees and to the soundtrack of popping champagne bottles.",
      "But it wasn\u2019t until this year that the local artisans in the Soumbedioune crafts market, just off the Corniche and at the doorstep on the Medina working-class neighborhood, realized what the Biennale was.",
      "For years, \u201cwe saw the OFF signs, but we didn\u2019t know what was going on,\" said Ndiouga Dia, a 48-year-old leatherworker from Soumbedioune, referring to a series of events organized in parallel to the official government program, scattered all over the city. \u201cOnly the artists knew among themselves what was going on.\u201d",
      "Craftsmanship is deeply rooted in the country\u2019s culture. Senegal, like most African nations, has little capacity for industrial production, and traditionally much of its economy has relied on locally produced goods. For centuries, craftsmen played a central role in Senegalese social life, sculpting religious statues and ceremonial masks, sewing boubous (traditional colorful wide-sleeved robes), molding pottery and weaving baskets.",
      "But these days, their role is in decline. As living costs rise, many Senegalese opt for cheaper, often Chinese products. And those that can afford it buy Western clothes and furniture to mark their social status.",
      "So when two designers approached Dia, who is also the community leader of the Soumbedioune artisans, with a proposal for a joint exhibition, he didn't hesitate for a second.",
      "It felt good to be noticed and included, Dia said.",
      "Designers Kemi Bass\u00e8ne and Khadim Ndiaye asked five artisans \u2014 a sculptor, a painter, a jeweler, a leatherworker and a upholsterer \u2014 to interpret the theme of \u201chippo.\u201d",
      "They chose the theme because it was easily recognizable across Africa, they said, bringing together people from different nations who live next to the water.",
      "The exhibition, held in the central square of Soumbedioune, surrounded by artisanal boutiques and restaurants selling thieboudienne, the most famous Senegalese dish, has been a hit among locals. There are hippo earrings and a hippo necklace; a giant wooden sculpture of a sleeping hippo; and a hippo-shaped bag.",
      "Papise Kant\u00e9, a 45-year-old sculptor who created two wooden hippo statues for the exhibition, said it allowed him to tap into a more creative part of his work, instead of just producing objects that he intended to sell.",
      "\u201cI have been sculpting since I was a young child,\" said Kant\u00e9, who comes from a long line of sculptors. \u201cEvery artist wants to get better.\u201d",
      "But it also gave his work recognition.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s because of the Biennale that people know my work,\" he said. If you participate in the Biennale, he added, \u201cyou are proud.\"",
      "Bass\u00e8ne, the curator, grew up in Medina, next to Soumbedioune, but is now based in Paris. He said he wanted to bridge the divide between arts and crafts.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time in the history that artisans, especially those who are custodians of traditional craftsmanship, are invited to the Biennale,\u201d Bass\u00e8ne said. \u201cFor craftsmen in Africa, there is a natural progression towards the world of modern design.\u201d",
      "It was \u201cnormal,\u201d he said, to include artisans in the Biennale \u201cif we wanted to try to decolonize a little.\u201d",
      "This year's Biennale is being held as Senegal is undergoing profound political change, with the newly elected authorities charting a more self-reliant and pan-African course.",
      "Last month, the governing party, PASTEF, secured a resounding victory in legislative elections. Its win granted President Bassirou Diomaye Faye a clear mandate to carry out ambitious reforms promised during the campaign to improve living conditions for ordinary Senegalese \u2014 including greater economic self-reliance, revamping the fishing industry, and making maximum use of natural resources.",
      "The theme of this year's Biennale has been \u201cThe Wake,\u201d alluding to the emancipation of the African continent from its remaining dependence on former colonial powers.",
      "The new government of Senegal has \u201ca transformational agenda,\u201d said Bass\u00e8ne. \u201cI think that what we have experienced politically will impact all the social sciences and all art.\"",
      "In the meantime, the Soumbedioune artisans have big plans. Dia, the community leader, said that they are planning a collaboration with a local school to manufacture backpacks for students.",
      "His dream, he said, was to expand the production across the whole country so the Senegalese parents \u201cdo not have to buy Chinese products.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have all the know-how,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can produce more.\u201d",

      "The war in Sudan has created vast hunger, including famine",
      "ADRE, Chad -- For months, Aziza Abrahim fled from one village in Sudan to the next as people were slaughtered. Yet the killing of relatives and her husband's disappearance aren't what forced the 23-year-old to leave the country for good. It was hunger, she said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to eat because of the war,\u201d Abrahim said, cradling her 1-year-old daughter under the sheet where she now shelters, days after crossing into Chad.",
      "The war in Sudan has created vast hunger, including famine. It has pushed people off their farms. Food in the markets is sparse, prices have spiked and aid groups say they\u2019re struggling to reach the most vulnerable as warring parties limit access.",
      "Some 24,000 people have been killed and millions displaced during the war that erupted in April 2023, sparked by tensions between the military and a powerful paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces. Global experts confirmed famine in the Zamzam displacement camp in July. They warn that some 25 million people \u2014 more than half of Sudan\u2019s population \u2014 are expected to face acute hunger this year.",
      "\u201cPeople are starving to death at the moment ... It\u2019s man-made. It\u2019s these men with guns and power who deny women and children food,\u201d Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, told The Associated Press. Warring parties on both sides are blocking assistance and delaying authorization for aid groups, he said.",
      "Between May and September, there were seven malnutrition-related deaths among children in one hospital at a displacement site in Chad run by Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF. Such deaths can be from disease in hunger-weakened bodies.",
      "In September, MSF was forced to stop caring for 5,000 malnourished children in North Darfur for several weeks, citing repeated, deliberate obstructions and blockades. U.S. President Joe Biden has called on both sides to allow unhindered access and stop killing civilians.",
      "But the fighting shows no signs of slowing. More than 2,600 people were killed across the country in October, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, which called it the bloodiest month of the war.",
      "Violence is intensifying around North Darfur's capital, El Fasher, the only capital in the vast western Darfur region that the RSF doesn't hold. Darfur has experienced some of the war's worst atrocities, and the International Criminal Court prosecutor has said there are grounds to believe both sides may be committing war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide.",
      "Abrahim escaped her village in West Darfur and sought refuge for more than a year in nearby towns with friends and relatives. Her husband had left home to find work before the war, and she hasn\u2019t heard from him since.",
      "She struggled to eat and feed their daughter. Unable to farm, she cut wood and sold it in Chad, traveling eight hours by donkey there and back every few days, earning enough to buy grain. But after a few months the wood ran out, forcing her to leave for good.",
      "Others who have fled to Chad described food prices spiking three-fold and stocks dwindling in the market. There were no vegetables, just grains and nuts.",
      "Awatif Adam came to Chad in October. Her husband wasn't making enough transporting people with his donkey cart, and it was too risky to farm, she said. Her 6-year-old twin girls and 3-year-old son lost weight and were always hungry.",
      "\u201cMy children were saying all the time, \u2018Mom, give us food\u2019,\u201d she said. Their cries drove her to leave.",
      "As more people stream into Chad, aid groups worry about supporting them.",
      "Some 700,000 Sudanese have entered since the war began. Many live in squalid refugee camps or shelter at the border in makeshift displacement sites. And the number of arrivals at the Adre crossing between August and October jumped from 6,100 to 14,800, according to government and U.N. data., though it was not clear whether some people entered multiple times.",
      "Earlier this year, the World Food Program cut rations by roughly half in Chad, citing a lack of funding.",
      "While there's now enough money to return to full rations until the start of next year, more arrivals will strain the system and more hunger will result if funding doesn't keep pace, said Ramazani Karabaye, head of the World Food Program's operations in Adre.",
      "During an AP visit to Adre in October, some people who fled Sudan at the start of the war said they were still struggling.",
      "Khadiga Omer Adam said she doesn't have enough aid or money to eat regularly, which has complicated breastfeeding her already malnourished daughter, Salma Issa. The 35-year-old gave birth during the war's initial days, delivering alone in West Darfur. It was too dangerous for a midwife to reach her.",
      "Adam had clutched the baby as she fled through villages, begging for food. More than a year later, she sat on a hospital bed holding a bag of fluid above her daughter, who was fed through a tube in her nose.",
      "\u201cI have confidence in the doctors ... I believe she'll improve, I don't think she'll die,\" she said.",
      "The MSF-run clinic in the Aboutengue camp admitted more than 340 cases of severely malnourished children in August and September. Staff fear that number could rise. The arid climate in Chad south of the Sahara Desert means it's hard to farm, and there's little food variety, health workers said.",
      "People are fleeing Sudan into difficult conditions, said Dr. Oula Dramane Ouattara, head of MSF's medical activities in the camp.",
      "\u201dIf things go on like this, I\u2019m afraid the situation will get out of control,\" he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The number of job postings in the United States rebounded in October from a 3 1/2 year low in September, a sign that businesses are still seeking workers even though hiring has cooled.",
      "Openings rose 5% to 7.7 million from 7.4 million in September, the Labor Department said Tuesday. The increase suggests that job gains could pick up in the coming months. Still, the latest figure is down significantly from 8.7 million job postings a year ago.",

      "Taken as a whole, Tuesday's figures suggest that the job market might be stabilizing at a modest level, with hiring moderate but layoffs uncommonly low. The unemployment rate is at a low 4.1%, even though job gains slowed sharply in October, according to the monthly jobs report. The slowdown in job growth last month reflected mainly the impact of hurricanes and a strike at Boeing.",

      "Tuesday's report, known as the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, showed that overall hiring slowed in October. Total hiring slipped to 5.3 million from 5.6 million, though that decline reflected hurricane-related disruptions.",
      "The JOLTS report is separate from the monthly jobs figures, which will be released Friday. That report is forecast to show a net gain of nearly 210,000 jobs in November, up from an anemic 12,000 in October.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s report also showed that the number of Americans who quit their jobs rebounded in October to 3.4 million, after having reached a four-year low in September. An increase in quitting is a good sign for the economy, because it suggests that people are confident enough to search for new job opportunities.",
      "The Federal Reserve is watching the jobs data closely. Any sign that hiring is sharply weakening could encourage Fed officials to cut their key interest rate more quickly, to try to bolster borrowing and spending and support the economy."

      "President Joe Biden is finding ways to celebrate trains in the waning days of his presidency thousands of miles from home",
      "LUANDA, Angola -- Even in the waning days of his presidency and thousands of miles from home, U.S. President Joe Biden is finding ways to celebrate trains.",
      "Biden is using his third and final day in Angola to showcase the Lobito Corridor railway, where the U.S. and key allies are investing heavily to refurbish 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) of train lines in Zambia, Congo and Angola.",
      "The project aims to advance the U.S. presence in a region rich in cobalt, copper and other critical minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles, electronic devices and clean energy technologies. By the end of the decade, the rail line could even go a long way toward linking southern Africa's western coast with the continent's eastern edge.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m probably the most pro-rail guy in America,\u201d Biden, the first U.S. president to visit Angola, said during a speech Tuesday evening.",
      "Biden has long had the nickname Amtrak Joe for the 36 years he spent commuting by U.S. train from his home in Delaware to Washington while in the Senate. He said the Lobito Corridor constituted the largest U.S. investment in a train project outside the country.",
      "On Wednesday, Biden will fly from the capital of Luanda to Lobito on Africa's western coast to tour port facilities with Angolan President Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema, Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and Tanzanian Vice President Philip Mpango.",
      "The leaders also plan to meet with representatives from companies that stand to benefit from the corridor project, including a telecommunication firm expanding cell service in the region, a food-production firm and Acrow Bridge, a Pennsylvania company that makes prefabricated steel bridges and has a contract to deliver nearly 200 to Angola.",
      "The Biden administration says the corridor will help business interests and counter China's growing influence in Africa \u2014 in addition to satisfying a president obsessed with riding the rails.",
      "In Lobito, Biden will announce $600 million in new U.S. investment for projects associated with the corridor, which has also drawn financing from the European Union, the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, a Western-led private consortium and African banks.",
      "The administration says it currently can take cargo loads of materials about 45 days to get from eastern Congo or Zambia to the market, and usually involves going by truck to South Africa. Test loads run using the new rail corridor made the same journey in around 40 to 50 hours.",
      "China, meanwhile, already has heavy investments in mining and processing African minerals, and has used its Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure strategy to promote its economic and political influence around the world.",
      "In September, China said it had signed a deal with Tanzania and Zambia to revamp a separate railway line going east from Zambia to Tanzania\u2019s Dar es Salaam on the east coast of Africa.",
      "The countries had previously worked together to build the railway line in the 1970s, but it fell into disrepair. China\u2019s move to renovate it \u2014 announced on the sidelines of this year\u2019s China-Africa forum \u2014 is seen by some analysts as the Chinese response to the Lobito Corridor.",
      "A senior U.S. administration official called the Lobito Corridor the heart of competing with China, not as a political adversary but from a business standpoint.",
      "The idea is, rather than pumping in simple aid, Washington will attempt to grow U.S. influence by promoting projects that can spark investment and therefore help communities and countries over the long haul. The Lobito Corridor has become a model approach that the U.S. is looking to replicate in other parts of the world, said the official, who briefed reporters during Biden's Angola visit on condition of anonymity to offer project details that haven't yet been made public.",
      "The corridor won't be completed for years, meaning much of the continued work would come during the administration of Republican Donald Trump, who takes office Jan. 20. The Biden White House says that Republicans in Congress and elsewhere have supported past efforts to promote African business interests through targeted investments and that such initiatives have appealed to Trump and his key advisers in the past.",

      "The founder and former CEO of the failed cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network has pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges, admitting that he misled customers about the business",
      "NEW YORK -- The founder and former CEO of the failed cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network could face decades in prison after pleading guilty Tuesday to federal fraud charges, admitting that he misled customers about the business.",
      "Alexander Mashinsky, 58, of Manhattan, entered the plea in New York federal court to commodities and securities fraud.",
      "He admitted illegally manipulating the price of Celsius\u2019s proprietary crypto token while secretly selling his own tokens at inflated prices to pocket about $48 million before Celsius collapsed into bankruptcy in 2022.",
      "In court, he admitted that in 2021 he publicly suggested there was regulatory consent for the company's moves because he knew that customers \u201cwould find false comfort\u201d with that.",
      "And he said that in 2019, he was selling the crypto tokens even though he told the public that he was not. He said he knew customers would draw false comfort from that too.",
      "\u201cI accept full responsibility for my actions,\u201d Mashinsky said of crimes that stretched from 2018 to 2022 as the company pitched itself to customers as a modern-day bank where they could safely deposit crypto assets and earn interest.",
      "U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a release that Mashinsky \u201corchestrated one of the biggest frauds in the crypto industry\u201d as his company's assets purportedly grew to about $25 billion at its peak, making it one of the largest crypto platforms in the world.",
      "He said Mashinsky used catchy slogans like \u201cUnbank Yourself\u201d to entice prospective customers with a pledge that their money would be as safe in crypto accounts as money would be in a bank. Meanwhile, prosecutors said, Mashinsky and co-conspirators used customer deposits to fund market purchases of the Celsius token to prop up its value.",
      "Machinsky made tens of millions of dollars selling his own CEL tokens at artificially high prices, leaving his customers \u201cholding the bag when the company went bankrupt,\u201d Williams said.",
      "An indictment alleged that Mashinsky promoted Celsius through media interviews, his social media accounts and Celsius\u2019 website, along with a weekly \u201cAsk Mashinsky Anything\u201d session broadcast that was posted to Celsius\u2019 website and a YouTube channel.",
      "Celsius employees from multiple departments who noticed false and misleading statements in the sessions warned Mashinsky, but they were ignored, the indictment said.",
      "A plea agreement Mashinsky made with prosecutors calls for him to be sentenced to up to 30 years in prison and to forfeit over $48 million, which is the amount of money he allegedly made by selling his company's token.",
      "Sentencing was scheduled for April 8."

    "story": [
      "U.S. officials are urging telecommunication companies to boost network security following a Chinese hacking operation that gave officials in Beijing access to the private texts and phone conversations of Americans",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal authorities on Tuesday urged telecommunication companies to boost network security following a sprawling Chinese hacking campaign that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.",
      "The guidance issued by the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is intended to help root out the hackers and prevent similar cyberespionage in the future. Officials who briefed reporters on the recommendations said the U.S. still doesn't know the true scope of China's attack or the extent to which Chinese hackers still have access to U.S. networks.",
      "In one sign of the global reach of China's hacking efforts, the government's warning was issued jointly with security agencies in New Zealand, Australia and Canada, members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, which also includes the U.S. and Britain.",
      "Dubbed Salt Typhoon by analysts, the wide-ranging cyberespionage campaign emerged earlier this year after hackers sought to penetrate the networks of multiple telecommunications companies.",
      "The hackers used their access to telecom networks to target the metadata of a large number of customers, including information on the dates, times and recipients of calls and texts.",
      "The hackers succeeded in retrieving the actual audio files of calls and content from texts from a much smaller number of victims. The FBI has contacted victims in this group, many of whom work in government or politics, but officials said it is up to telecom companies to notify customers included in the first, larger group.",
      "Despite months of investigation, the true scale of China\u2019s operation, including the total number of victims or whether the hackers still have some access to information, is currently unknown.",
      "The FBI has said some of the information targeted by the hackers relates to U.S. law enforcement investigations and court orders, suggesting the hackers may have been trying to access programs subject to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. The law grants American spy agencies sweeping powers to surveil the communications of people suspected of being agents of a foreign power.",
      "But on Tuesday, officials said they think the hackers were more broadly motivated, hoping to burrow deeply into the nation's telecommunications systems to gain wide access to Americans' information.",
      "The suggestions for telecom companies released Tuesday are largely technical in nature, urging encryption, centralization and consistent monitoring to deter cyber intrusions. If implemented, the security precautions could help disrupt the Salt Typhoon operation and make it harder for China or any other nation to mount a similar attack in the future, said Jeff Greene, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity and one of the officials who briefed reporters Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have any illusion that once we kick off these actors they\u2019re not going to come back,\u201d Greene said.",
      "Several recent high-profile hacking incidents have been linked to China and what officials say is Beijing's effort to steal technical and government secrets while also gaining access to critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid.",
      "In September, the FBI announced that it had disrupted a vast Chinese hacking operation that involved the installation of malicious software on more than 200,000 consumer devices, including cameras, video recorders and home and office routers. The devices were then used to create a massive network of infected computers, or botnet, that could then be used to carry out other cyber crimes.",
      "In October, officials said hackers linked to China targeted the phones of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, along with people associated with Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "China has rejected accusations from U.S. officials that it engages in cyberespionage directed against Americans.",
      "On Tuesday, a spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington called the U.S. allegations \u201cdisinformation.\"",
      "China's government \u201cfirmly opposes and combats all kinds of cyber attacks,\u201d spokesperson Liu Pengyu wrote in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. \u201cThe US needs to stop its own cyberattacks against other countries and refrain from using cyber security to smear and slander China.\u201d"

      "A judge\u2019s overturning of Wisconsin\u2019s 13-year-old law that effectively ended collective bargaining for teachers and most state government employees has rekindled a battle over labor rights in a state where the first public sector unions were formed 65 y...",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A judge's overturning of Wisconsin's 13-year-old law that effectively ended collective bargaining for teachers and most state government employees has rekindled a battle over labor rights in a state where the first public sector unions were formed 65 years ago.",
      "But before unions head back to the bargaining table, more legal fights await. Here are five things to know about the law, the current challenge and what happens next:",
      "At its core, the battle is over whether tens of thousands of teachers, nurses, prison guards and other state government employees can bargain over their workplace conditions and salary.",
      "The law, known as Act 10, was enacted in 2011 and limits bargaining to only wage increases no greater than the inflation rate. That means that other issues, such as benefits, safety and working conditions, and vacations, are not negotiable.",
      "The law also requires every public sector union to vote annually on maintaining its own certification. In order to pass, at least 51% of each union's members must vote yes, not just 51% of those voting.",
      "Union members were also required to pay more for their benefits, which reduced their take home pay and effectively served as a pay cut.",
      "Supporters say the law has saved school districts and local governments billions of dollars. Opponents say the law has kneecapped unions that traditionally back Democrats and hurt workers' morale and income.",
      "Passage of the law helped ease the way for the Legislature in 2015 to approve a so-called right-to-work law that limited the power of private-sector unions.",
      "Then- Gov. Scott Walker introduced the proposal shortly after taking office in 2011. That sparked weeks of massive protests, a walkout by Democratic state senators in a failed attempt to block passage of the law, and recall elections targeting Walker and Republicans who voted for it.",
      "The fight thrust Wisconsin into the the center of the battle over union rights in the U.S. Walker rode the attention, survived the 2012 recall attempt and then mounted a campaign for president a few years later. He dropped out, though, in the fall of 2015 as Donald Trump's support grew.",
      "The battle lines then and now are largely the same. The law is opposed by Democrats and unions. It is supported by Republicans, conservative groups and powerful organizations like Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the largest business lobbying group in Wisconsin.",
      "Numerous legal challenges have been filed challenging the law in state and federal courts. None of them succeeded until now.",
      "The latest challenge was filed last year by seven unions representing teachers and other public-sector workers and three individuals.",
      "This lawsuit alleges that Act 10\u2019s exemption of some police, firefighters and other public safety workers from the bargaining restrictions violates the Wisconsin Constitution\u2019s equal protection guarantee.",
      "A similar argument was made in a federal lawsuit alleging that Act 10 violated the equal protection guarantee in the U.S. Constitution. But a federal appeals court in 2013 said the state was free to draw a line between public safety and other unions, and the following year again ruled that the law was constitutional.",
      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2014 also upheld the law as constitutional, rejecting a lawsuit brought by teachers and Milwaukee public workers. That case raised different arguments than the current lawsuit. And in 2019, a federal judge rejected a lawsuit brought by two arms of the International Union of Operating Engineers that argued the law violates free speech and free association under the First Amendment.",
      "Walker, whose legacy is largely defined by his fight with the unions, called the ruling \u201cbrazen political activism.\u201d",
      "The judge who struck down the law, Dane County Circuit Judge Jacob Frost, was appointed by Wisconsin's current governor, Democrat Tony Evers. It also appears that Frost signed the petition to recall Walker.",
      "Republican leaders of the Legislature echoed Walker's comments, decrying the ruling and calling Frost an \u201cactivist.\u201d",
      "Evers called the decision \u201cgreat news\" and said, \u201cI\u2019ve always believed workers should have a seat at the table in decisions that affect their daily lives and livelihoods.\"",
      "Unions applauded the ruling while conservative groups warned that undoing the law would dramatically increase costs on local governments, leading to service cuts and tax increases.",
      "The Legislature has appealed the case. That would typically send it to the state court of appeals, unless the unions ask the Wisconsin Supreme Court to take the case directly.",
      "Opponents of the law are anxious for the state Supreme Court to get the case while it is controlled 4-3 by liberal justices. An election in April will determine whether liberals maintain control or the court flips back to conservatives, who held sway there from before Act 10 was passed until 2023. The newly elected justice will start work next August.",
      "Even if the current court takes the case, it's unclear what justices would hear it.",
      "Justice Janet Protasiewicz, whose win last year gave liberals the majority, said during her campaign that she believes Act 10 is unconstitutional. She also said she would consider recusing herself from any case challenging the law. Protasiewicz participated in protests against the law and signed the petition to recall Walker.",
      "Conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn was Walker\u2019s chief legal counsel and had a role in drafting the Act 10 law. But during his successful run for the court in 2015, Hagedorn would not promise to recuse himself if a case challenging Act 10 came before the court."

    "story": [
      "When SmileDirectClub shut down a year ago, scores of existing customers of the teeth-straightening company were left in limbo",
      "NEW YORK -- When SmileDirectClub shut down a year ago, scores of existing customers of the teeth-straightening company were left in limbo. Now, tens of thousands are set to get some relief.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James has announced that her office recovered $4.8 million to distribute nationwide to more than 28,000 consumers. SmileDirectClub illegally charged those customers after it ceased operations, James said.",
      "\u201cDental care is expensive and SmileDirectClub promised customers that they would provide affordable, quality care without the price tag, but instead, they extracted thousands of dollars from hardworking people,\" James said in a prepared statement Monday. \u201cToday, we are putting money back into people\u2019s pockets who were cheated.\"",
      "SmileDirectClub, once a publicly traded company known for selling clear dental aligners, shut its doors in December 2023 \u2014 just months after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In an abrupt move, the company canceled outstanding orders and announced that its \u201cLifetime Smile Guarantee\u201d would no longer exist. At the time, SmileDirectClub also said that \u201cSmilePay\u201d customers were expected to continue payments, causing confusion and frustration.",
      "According to James' announcement, the majority of customers paid for their aligner treatments through the \u201cSmilePay\u201d program, which generally totaled more than $2,500 between an up-front payment and following installments.",
      "After the company folded in December 2023, James' office said it received complaints from New York consumers who were told to keep paying monthly installments, despite no longer receiving treatment in return \u2014 and that it soon sent SmileDirectClub a cease-and-desist letter.",
      "In response, SmileDirectClub directed her office to HPS Investment Partners, the agent of the company's secured lenders, and SmilePay service provider Healthcare Finance Direct. The company also revised its online FAQ to remove the note about continuing payments, and instead direct customers' further questions to HFD.",
      "Monday's settlement agreement means that impacted consumers should soon see some relief, either in the form of \u201ca partial or full refund of their installment payments or a reduction of their future payment obligations,\u201d according to HFD\u2019s website.",
      "If you're eligible, the amount of money you\u2019ll get will depend on several factors. Those include the date when you first received aligners from SmileDirectClub, if your services had begun yet, as well as how much of your treatment plan was completed at the time the company ceased operations, and the outstanding balances on your account.",
      "And not all refunds will come in the form of a settlement check. Compensation will first be applied to the outstanding balance on your account \u2014 meaning that future payments, while reduced, may still remain for those who were farther along in their treatment. But consumers eligible for a refund that exceeds their outstanding account balance will see that excess amount sent back to a bank account, debit card or credit card on file. If that's unsuccessful, HFD notes, a check will be mailed out.",
      "How many people end up registering for the settlement is also a factor. Total compensation plan is capped at $4.8 million, so it\u2019s possible refunds could be slightly below or above initial estimates once all requests are in.",
      "A portion of these refunds will be automatic, but other customers will only be available to submit a request to HFD directly. The deadline to submit that request is March 31, 2025. While eligible consumers will likely be contacted by HFD via email, more information can be found of the service provider's official website.",
      "Before shutting its doors, SmileDirectClub served over 2 million people since its 2014 founding. The company once promised to revolutionize the oral-care industry by selling clear dental aligners, via mail and in major retailers, that were marketed as a faster and more affordable alternative to braces.",
      "Still, the company later proved to be unprofitable year after year. By the time SmileDirectClub filed for bankruptcy in September 2023, it reported nearly $900 million in debt.",
      "And beyond financial woes, dental associations around the world have also continued to urge caution or express opposition to direct-to-consumer aligners \u2014 what some call \u201cDIY\u201d dentistry \u2014 citing risks around services that don't require in-person visits to a dentist or orthodontist. That resulted in ample criticism around SmileDirectClub, particularly after customers saw treatments discontinued last year, although other companies still provide similar direct-to-consumer aligners today."

      "\u201cAs President,\" he continued, \"I will block this deal from happening. Buyer Beware!!!\u201d",
      "President Joe Biden, like Trump, also opposes Nippon Steel's purchase of Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel. Biden\u2019s White House in September said that it had yet to see a report from the secretive Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which was reviewing the transaction for national security concerns. The committee, which is chaired by the treasury secretary and includes other Cabinet members, can recommend that the president block a transaction, and federal law gives the president that power.",
      "Ahead of the November election, the proposed merger carried political importance in Pennsylvania, a critical swing state that Trump eventually won. Biden publicly sided with the United Steelworkers, the labor union, in seeking to reject the deal.",
      "When he announced his opposition in a March statement, Biden said: \u201cU.S. Steel has been an iconic American steel company for more than a century, and it is vital for it to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\u201d",

      "For a second time, a Delaware judge has nullified a pay package that Tesla had awarded its CEO, Elon Musk, that once was valued at $56 billion",
      "DETROIT -- For a second time, a Delaware judge has nullified a pay package that Tesla had awarded its CEO, Elon Musk, that once was valued at $56 billion.",
      "On Monday, Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick turned aside a request from Musk's lawyers to reverse a ruling she announced in January that had thrown out the compensation plan. The judge ruled then that Musk effectively controlled Tesla's board and had engineered the outsize pay package during sham negotiations.",
      "Lawyers for a Tesla shareholder who sued to block the pay package contended that shareholders who had voted for the 10-year plan in 2018 had been given misleading and incomplete information.",
      "In their defense, Tesla's board members asserted that the shareholders who ratified the pay plan a second time in June had done so after receiving full disclosures, thereby curing all the problems the judge had cited in her January ruling. As a result, they argued, Musk deserved the pay package for having raised Tesla's market value by billions of dollars.",
      "McCormick rejected that argument. In her 103-page opinion, she ruled that under Delaware law, Tesla's lawyers had no grounds to reverse her January ruling \u201cbased on evidence they created after trial.\u201d",
      "On Monday night, Tesla posted on X, the social media platform owned by Musk, that the company will appeal. The appeal would be filed with the Delaware Supreme Court, the only state appellate court Tesla can pursue. Experts say a ruling would likely come in less than a year.",
      "\u201cThe ruling, if not overturned, means that judges and plaintiffs' lawyers run Delaware companies rather than their rightful owners \u2014 the shareholders,\u201d Tesla argued.",
      "Later, on X, Musk unleashed a blistering attack on the judge, asserting that McCormick is \u201ca radical far left activist cosplaying as a judge.\u201d",
      "Legal authorities generally suggest that McCormick\u2019s ruling was sound and followed the law. Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said that in his view, McCormick was right to rule that after Tesla lost its case in the original trial, it created improper new evidence by asking shareholders to ratify the pay package a second time.",
      "Had she allowed such a claim, he said, it would cause a major shift in Delaware\u2019s laws against conflicts of interest given the unusually close relationship between Musk and Tesla\u2019s board.",
      "\u201cDelaware protects investors \u2014 that\u2019s what she did,\u201d said Elson, who has followed the court for more than three decades. \u201cJust because you\u2019re a \u2018superstar CEO\u2019 doesn\u2019t put you in a separate category.\u201d",
      "Elson said he thinks investors would be reluctant to put money into Delaware companies if there were exceptions to the law for \u201cspecial people.\u201d",
      "Elson said that in his opinion, the court is likely to uphold McCormick's ruling.",
      "Experts say no. Rulings on state laws are normally left to state courts. Brian Dunn, program director for the Institute of Compensation Studies at Cornell University, said it's been his experience that Tesla has no choice but to stay in the Delaware courts for this compensation package.",

Tesla's share price has doubled in the past six months, Jonas wrote. At Monday\u2019s closing stock price, the Musk package is now worth $101.4 billion, according to Equilar, an executive data firm.",
      "And Musk has asked for a subsequent pay package that would give him 25% of Tesla's voting shares. Musk has said he is uncomfortable moving further into artificial intelligence with the company if he doesn't have 25% control. He currently holds about 13% of Tesla's outstanding shares."

      "The video-sharing platform is a focus of controversy in the Eastern European country after far-right outsider Calin Georgescu emerged as the frontrunner in the vote, plunging the country into turmoil amid allegations of electoral violations and Russian meddling.",
      "Among the networks that TikTok uncovered were two small groups that it disrupted on Friday, days after the first round of voting, Brie Pegum, the platform\u2019s global head of product, authenticity and transparency, told a committee.",
      "Both networks targeted Romanian users. One had only 1,781 followers and supported Georgescu, who was a little-known independent candidate until he set off shockwaves by convincingly winning the first round of voting, beating out the incumbent prime minister. The other networks supported different candidates, Pegum said.",
      "Many observers chalked up Georgescu\u2019s success to his TikTok account, which now has 5.8 million likes and 527,000 followers.",
      "He gained huge traction and popularity in the weeks leading up to the first vote. But experts suspect Georgescu\u2019s online following was artificially inflated while officials hinted that he was given preferential treatment by TikTok.",

He also questioned what the scores of Romanian content moderators were doing during the election, and compared Pegum and Greer to firefighters TikTok sent to put out a fire.",
      "\u201cThey come, they let the fire rage online for weeks, months, during an election. And then they send very nice people here into this committee to answer questions in a very polite way,\" Gotink said. \"But it is simply not convincing \u2014 and it also doesn\u2019t reflect what is happening online.\u201d",
      "According to a report by the Bucharest-based Expert Forum think tank, Georgescu's TikTok account garnered 92.8 million views primarily within the last few months, a figure that grew by 52 million views a week later, just days ahead of the first-round vote.",
      "Another TikTok account solely featuring Georgescu content, which had 1.7 million likes on the night first-round polls closed, was removed the day after voting. It had posts with Georgescu attending church, doing judo, running around an oval track, and speaking on podcasts.",
      "In an emailed statement to The Associated Press on Monday, TikTok said the account was one of \u201cmore than 150 accounts impersonating Georgescu\u201d to date that has been removed, but added: \u201cWe also removed more than 650 additional impersonation accounts belonging to other candidates.\u201d",

      "A court in Vietnam has upheld the death sentence for real estate tycoon Truong My Lan but said it could be commuted to life if she reimburses some $11 billion",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- A court in Vietnam on Tuesday upheld the death sentence for real estate tycoon Truong My Lan but said it could be commuted to life if she reimburses some $11 billion, or three-fourths of what she defrauded in the country\u2019s biggest financial crime.",
      "The scale of her fraud shocked the nation, with analysts raising questions about whether other banks or businesses had similarly erred. It has also dampened Vietnam\u2019s economic outlook and made foreign investors jittery at a time when Vietnam has been trying to position itself as a home for businesses pivoting their supply chains away from China.",
      "Lan, 67, was convicted in April of embezzlement and bribery amounting to $12.5 billion, equivalent to 3% of the country\u2019s GDP. As chairperson of the Van Thinh Phat real estate firm, the court said she illegally controlled Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank between 2012 and 2022 and allowed 2,500 loans that cost the bank $27 billion in losses.",
      "A higher court in Ho Chi Minh on Tuesday rejected her appeal of the conviction but said that her death sentence could be commuted to life if she reimburses three-fourth of the losses, working out to around $11 billion, state media reported.",
      "Her lawyers argued that she had repaid the money but the court disagreed since there were legal issues with some of the seized properties and prosecuting agencies couldn't assess their value, VN Express reported.",
      "Lan's lawyers also noted several mitigating circumstances \u2014 she had admitted guilt, showed remorse and had paid back part of the amount.",
      "\u201cI feel pained due to the waste of national resources,\u201d she said last week, according to state media.",
      "But the court said her violations had negatively impacted banking, caused public disorder and eroded people\u2019s trust, VN Express said.",
      "Under Vietnamese law, death sentences aren't immediately carried out and there is an extended legal process, said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow in the Vietnam Studies Program at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute. He added that Lan would seek another review of the case or a presidential pardon to reduce her sentence.",
      "\u201cMoreover, if she repays at least three-quarters of the misappropriated funds, the court may consider commuting her sentence to life imprisonment,\u201d he said.",
      "Her arrest was among the most high-profile in an anti-corruption drive in Vietnam that intensified after 2022. The so-called Blazing Furnace campaign touched the highest echelons of Vietnamese politics.",
      "Lan, 67, and her family had set up the Van Thing Phat company in 1992, after Vietnam shed its state-run economy in favor of a more market-oriented approach open to foreigners. The company grew into one of Vietnam\u2019s richest real estate firms, with luxury residential buildings, offices, hotels and shopping centers.",
      "This made her a key player in the country\u2019s financial industry. She orchestrated the 2011 merger of the beleaguered SCB bank with two other lenders in coordination with Vietnam\u2019s central bank. The court said that she used this to tap SCB for cash and, according to government documents, owned more than 90% of the bank while approving thousands of loans to \u201cghost companies.\u201d",
      "These loans, according to state media, found their way to her and she bribed officials to cover her tracks.",
      "The scale of the crime meant the case was split into two trials, and Lan was sentenced to another life sentence in October. At that trial, she was accused of raising $1.2 billion from nearly 36,000 investors by issuing bonds illegally through four companies, state media reported.",
      "She was also found guilty of siphoning off $18 billion obtained through fraud and for using companies controlled by her to illegally transfer more than $4.5 billion in and out of Vietnam between 2012 and 2022.",
      "Vietnam has handed down more than 2,000 death sentences in the past decade and executed more than 400 prisoners. It is a possible sentence for 14 different crimes but is typically applied for cases of murder and drug trafficking."

      "This means small businesses may end up paying more for goods and services. Small business owners say they're waiting to see what final form the tariffs take, but are bracing for higher costs that they may in turn need to pass on to consumers.",
      "Laurel Orley, cofounder and CEO of Nashville-based sprouted nut snack company Daily Crunch, said at first she didn't think the tariffs would affect her business, because she doesn't import very much. But she realized the tariffs will have a ripple effect. For example, she had planned on sourcing bags from China to save 5 cents a bag. But with the tariffs, she might need to scuttle that plan.",
      "\u201cThat was one of our big initiatives for 2025, moving all our bags to China for 15 cents a bag,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now I don\u2019t know if we can save any money on the bags when the tariffs go into effect.\u201d",
      "Warehouse prices are going up because of the expected tariffs, too, Orley said. Her warehouse provider said demand has been increasing since the tariffs were announced.",
      "\u201cAs many other companies are buying bulk inventory overseas to get ahead of tariffs, warehouse availability is becoming limited, which will increase costs for everyone,\u201d she said.",

      "She sells her products in both Canadian and U.S. retail stores, and said tariffs will affect consumers on both sides.",
      "\u201cIf you have a severe anaphylactic reaction to some type of dairy or soy and you can\u2019t find a product in the U.S. because we\u2019re the only ones that make it, it\u2019s going to be a lot more expensive for U.S. consumers,\" Bednarski-Malik said. \u201dSo I think these tariffs are really not only going to be penalizing, you know, other countries such as Canada, but also U.S. consumers.\"",
      "She's holding off on making any major changes in her business until the tariffs are finalized, but expects to see higher prices.",
      "\u201cUltimately, the consumer is going to have to pay at the end of the day because our margins are so tight beginning with our food prices, (which) have been increasing dramatically over the last few years,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there\u2019s not much margin left to keep the same price and maintain that price while incurring a 25% extra tariff on our product.\u201d"

      "Locals say the sisters would drink fruit shakes made with milk from the region\u2019s dairy farms until one of them began collecting the leftovers, turning them into creamy popsicles that became an overnight sensation.",
      "The nuns sold the popsicles in town to gather funds for the poor. But the people of Salcedo saw a business opportunity and began experimenting with new flavors and techniques, establishing a thriving popsicle industry that has made their small town famous among ice-cream lovers.",
      "However, a recent wave of power outages, triggered by a prolonged dry spell, is threatening the future of Salcedo\u2019s ice-cream industry and melting away its dreams of a more prosperous future.",
      "The daily power outages that began earlier this year and intensified in September can last up to 14 hours. They have come about due to drier than usual weather in Ecuador, which relies heavily on hydroelectric plants. During most months of the year, hydroelectric plants produce between 70% to 90% Ecuador\u2019s electricity. The nation of 17 million people invested heavily in dams over the past two decades, but it is now struggling to come up with alternatives.",
      "\u201cWe are living through the worst third-world conditions,\" said Gabriel Pumasunta, owner of the Polar Bear ice-cream factory. \u201cWe're plunged into darkness.\u201d",
      "Pumasunta, who runs the small company with his two brothers, said that if the power outages continue this month, they will have no choice but to shut down the plant.",
      "\u201cWe will have to work elsewhere,\u201d he said.",
      "Pumasunta said that power outages have halted production and storage, causing much of his product to melt.",
      "Before outages intensified in September, Polar Bear was producing 60,000 popsicles per month, Salcedo said. Now, the small company makes 10,000 popsicles per month, and it has been forced to let go of eight of its 10 employees.",
      "To stay afloat, Pumasunta has dipped into the company\u2019s savings and those of his family. He now works on the plant\u2019s machines himself, taking care of deliveries to bring down costs, while his parents have also stepped up to help.",
      "President Daniel Noboa, who was elected last year in a special election that followed the resignation of Ecuador\u2019s previous president, has not been able to solve the electricity crisis. The chamber of commerce in Guayaquil, Ecuador\u2019s largest city, estimates that power outages are generating weekly losses of $700 million for Ecuadorian businesses.",
      "Germ\u00e1n Soria, president of the association of artisanal ice-cream makers, said that before the power crisis, Salcedo had 80 small- and medium-sized ice-cream plants and three large factories. Now, 30 of these smaller plants have been forced to close.",
      "Soria\u2019s own ice-cream plant, housed in a shed behind his house, now sits empty. He said he stopped production three weeks ago and has been forced to sell some equipment, as well as a plot of land to cover his debts.",
      "He said that the outages, which occur at unexpected times, make it hard to plan production. \u201cOur clients are also less keen to buy ice-cream, because they\u2019re not sure if they can keep the popsicles from melting.\"",
      "According to local officials, the power crisis has cost 300 jobs in Salcedo, a town renowned for its fruit-flavored ice-cream, including flavors such as blackberries, and taxo, an aromatic and somewhat acidic fruit that resembles passion fruit.",
      "President Noboa has promised that power shortages in Ecuador will end this month, but analysts doubt his claim, saying the country lacks the capacity to make up for a 1,900-megawatt deficit.",
      "The Ecuadorian government has bought and rented dozens of large electric generators that run on fossil fuels and are expected to arrive in the following weeks. But as Marco Acu\u00f1a, the president of Ecuador's national guild of engineers, notes: \"They do not have the capacity to make up for the current deficit.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile in Salcedo, the collapse of the local ice-cream industry has rippled through the local economy, impacting dairy farms, fruit growers, transporters and mom-and-pop stores that specialized in selling the famous popsicles.",
      "\u201cBefore (the power cuts) we would buy up to 150 popsicles a day,\u201d said Maria Juliette L\u00f3pez, who owns a small shop on the Panamerican highway where tourists and truck drivers stop to buy snacks. \u201cNow we can only take up to 40 popsicles a day, because any product that is left over will melt\u201d when her freezer stops working, she said.",
      "While the power outages appear to be hitting small- and medium-sized producers and vendors the most, Salcedo\u2019s three largest ice-cream factories say they have also been impacted.",
      "One of those is Corp Ice-Cream, whose factory used to buzz with activity at noon, with its 35 employees working hard to produce up to 20,000 popsicles per day. But during a recent visit to the plant, there was only one employee sweeping in the dark, due to the lack of power.",
      "Paco Hinojosa, the company's manager, said Corp Ice Cream managed to stay afloat thanks to its customers in the United States, which order 120,000 popsicles per month during the summer. But the winter months bring a halt to U.S. exports, which won't resume until around March.",
      "Corp Ice Cream\u2019s sales in Ecuador have gone down by 40% since the power outages began in mid September and that is taking a toll on its suppliers. \u201cWe used to buy 2,500 liters of milk and 160 liters of cream each day,\u201d Hinojosa said. \u201cNow we have cut down our orders by half \u2014 and the same goes for fruit.\u201d",
      "Next to his desk, Hinojosa has a small altar to St. Michael the Archangel, the city\u2019s patron saint, whom he has been asking for health \u2014 and more rain.",
      "\u201cIt brings tears to your eyes to see this factory paralyzed due to the lack of electricity,\u201d he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 10:42:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Talk about taking the road less traveled",
    "story": [
      "Talk about taking the road less traveled",
      "A pair of Americans delivered command performances halfway around the world during Thanksgiving week. One was Peter Uihlein, the former U.S. Amateur champion and two-time Walker Cup player, winning by five shots in Qatar on the Asian Tour.",
      "The other was Ryggs Johnston, and well, some introductions might be in order.",
      "Don't get the idea Johnston came out of nowhere when he won the Australian Open \u2014 unless Libby, Montana, and its population of 3,725 is anyone's idea of nowhere. He was named after Mel Gibson's character in \u201cLethal Weapon.\u201d",
      "The best golfer to come out of Montana?",
      "\u201cHands down, Ryggs Johnston,\u201d Jeff Dooley said with a chuckle, because the best humor is often found in truth.",
      "Dooley is the head pro at Cabinet View Golf Club, which has 250 members who buy passes for a seven-month golf season on an 18-hole course overlooking the Cabinet Mountains, just east of Idaho and south of Canada. He watched Johnston develop and knew there was something special about the way he played, the way he scored.",
      "\u201cI've been saying for a long time, it's inevitable we're going to see Ryggs on TV in a tournament,\u201d Dooley said, perhaps not realizing that moment would keep him up past midnight to see Johnston look unflappable in his three-shot win at Kingston Heath.",
      "\u201cEverybody was just wired, all the golf pros,\" Dooley said. \u201cThere was a huge text stream going across Montana.\u201d",
      "The best in Montana at age 24? A case can be made. The most notable tour professional from Montana was Mike Grob, who won six times on the Canadian Tour and spent one full year on the PGA Tour.",
      "Five months into his professional career, in his second start as a European tour member, Johnston won golf's fifth-oldest championship at the Australian Open to get his name on the Stonehaven Cup along with Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player, and more recently Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Adam Scott.",
      "The Australian Open also was must-see TV further south in Tempe, Arizona, where Arizona State coach Matt Thurmond was never more proud.",
      "Thurmond heard all about Johnston and tried to recruit him when he was coach at Washington, only to learn about that sixth-grade project when the teacher asked students to write down their dream. Johnston's dream: \u201cGo to ASU and play golf.\u201d",
      "Thurmond was hired at Arizona State in 2016 and getting Johnston became a lot easier.",
      "Johnston never won a tournament in college but always was in the starting rotation. He was third at the NCAA Championship in 2021 as a sophomore and finished with four straight top 10s to end his career.",
      "He spent five years at Arizona State because of the COVID-19 pandemic and made good use of his time. The Pac-12 scholar-athlete of the year as a senior, Johnston is a few courses short of a Masters' degree from ASU's Thunderbird School of Global Management.",
      "He finished at No. 17 in the PGA Tour University ranking, which made him exempt for the Canada portion of the PGA Tour Americas schedule, and exempt into the second stage of PGA Tour qualifying this week.",
      "Except that Johnston won't be there, all because the Sun Devil took a pitchfork in the road that involved some of Thurmond's best coaching off the course.",
      "Johnston figured he could try all three stages of European tour Q-school and still get home in time for the second stage of PGA Tour qualifying.",
      "\u201cIt was funny because it took me forever to get him to go to the British Amateur,\u201d Thurmond said. \u201cHe always said, \u2018I\u2019m a U.S. guy.' But it slowly changed. He visited (David) Puig in Spain, played the European Amateur. But I couldn't believe it when he called. I told him why not? Give yourself a chance.\"",
      "He made it through the first stage in France with three shots to spare. He went to Spain a month later and tied for third in the second stage, and a week later sailed through 108 holes in Spain at the final stage to earn a European tour card.",
      "Two weeks later, he headed Down Under to make his European tour debut in the Australian PGA and tied for 43rd in a rain-shortened event, then went 1,100 miles down the coast to Melbourne for the Australian Open.",
      "The famed Melbourne sand belt was soaked by rain, and Johnston at this point was worn out. He played 10 out of 12 weeks in Canada. He flew to France, came home, spent two more weeks in Spain enduring the pressure of Q-school, came back home and then headed to Australia.",
      "\"I really didn\u2019t have any expectations,\u201d Johnston said, \u201cwhich probably helped me in the end.\u201d",
      "Johnston said he might not have thought about European tour qualifying if not for the encouragement of Thurmond. The coach feels Johnston knew the right path and only wanted to hear some confirmation.",
      "Either way, it couldn't have worked out any better. Instead of coming back to America for the second stage of Q-school, Johnston is at the Nedbank Challenge in South Africa, with Max Homa as the defending champion against a field that includes Will Zalatoris, Corey Conners, Thriston Lawrence and Nicolai Hojgaard.",
      "Johnston starts next year with tournaments like the Dubai Desert Classic, which features McIlroy and Jon Rahm. The victory gives him a spot in the British Open at Royal Portrush, his first major unless he can qualify for another before then.",
      "\u201cHe's come a long, long way,\u201d Thurmond said. \u201cOf all the people, to think of Ryggs being in South Africa this week blows my mind.\u201d",
      "Still to come by the of the year is a trip home to Libby, the tiny Montana town tucked in the northwest corner that is planning a homecoming for the latest Australian Open champion.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of messages from friends saying the whole town is watching,\u201d Johnston said Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s just really cool to have that kind of support, the thing that you don\u2019t see much other than from small towns.\u201d",

      "Houston\u2019s Azeez Al-Shaair was suspended by the NFL without pay for three games for repeated violations of player safety rules following his hit to the head of Jacksonville\u2019s Trevor Lawrence, which led to a concussion",
      "HOUSTON -- Houston's Azeez Al-Shaair was suspended by the NFL without pay for three games Tuesday for repeated violations of player safety rules following his violent hit to the head of Jacksonville's Trevor Lawrence, which led to a concussion.",
      "Al-Shaair's punishment was announced by NFL vice president of football operations Jon Runyan. In his letter to Al-Shaair, Runyan noted that he has had multiple offenses for personal fouls and sportsmanship-related rules violations in recent seasons.",
      "Back in the starting lineup after missing two games with a sprained left shoulder, Lawrence scrambled left on a second-and-7 play in the second quarter of Houston\u2019s 23-20 win on Sunday. He initiated a slide before Al-Shaair raised his forearm and unleashed on the defenseless quarterback.",
      "In his letter to Al-Shaair, Runyan called the hit \u201cunacceptable and a serious violation of the playing rules.\u201d",
      "\u201cVideo shows you striking the head/neck area of Jaguars\u2019 quarterback Trevor Lawrence after he clearly goes down in a feet-first slide,\" Runyan wrote. \u201cYou led with your forearm and helmet and delivered a forceful blow to the head/neck area of your opponent when you had time and space to avoid such contact.\u201d",
      "Al-Shaair is appealing the suspension, according to a person with knowledge of the decision.",
      "The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the appeal is pending.",
      "Houston general manager Nick Caserio defended Al-Shaair and said he doesn't believe the league is using consistency in issuing punishments like these.",
      "\u201cI probably speak for a lot of teams, not only the Houston Texans, but I think that\u2019s all teams ask for is consistency from the league,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d say in this situation, quite frankly, there\u2019s no consistency at all relative to the level of discipline that\u2019s been handed down.\u201d",
      "Caserio pointed to other players who have been ejected for illegal hits this season who have either not been suspended or only suspended for one game.",
      "If the suspension is upheld, Al-Shaair won't be eligible to return to Houston\u2019s active roster until after the team\u2019s Christmas Day game against the Baltimore Ravens. Al-Shaair has a base salary of $1.5 million this season, meaning it will cost him about $265,000 if the three-game suspension is upheld.",
      "Lawrence clenched both fists after the hit \u2014 movements consistent with what\u2019s referred to as the \u201cfencing response,\u201d which can be common after a traumatic brain injury. He was on the ground for several minutes as teammates came to his defense and mobbed Al-Shaair in what escalated into a brawl.",
      "As Al-Shaair was leaving the field after being ejected, fans started screaming at him. Jaguars veteran guard Brandon Scherff joined in, prompting another altercation with Al-Shaair. Texans teammate Will Anderson grabbed Al-Shaair and was escorting him off the field when a fan threw a water bottle and hit Anderson in the helmet. The fan was later ejected.",
      "Runyan also outlined Al-Shaair's behavior after the hit in announcing the suspension.",
      "\u201cAfter the illegal hit, you proceeded to engage in a brawl, which you escalated when you pulled an opponent down to the ground by his facemask,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAfter the referee announced that you were disqualified for the hit and your unsportsmanlike acts, you removed your helmet and reengaged with your opponent while walking down and across the field, which started another physical confrontation near the end zone.\u201d",
      "This is the third time this season Al-Shaair has been punished by the league. Last week, he was flagged and later fined $11,255 for a late hit out of bounds on Titans running back Tony Pollard.",
      "He was fined earlier this year after he punched Bears running back Roschon Johnson on the sideline in Week 2. That occurred during a scuffle that started after his hard shot on quarterback Caleb Williams near the sideline wasn\u2019t flagged.",
      "\u201cYour lack of sportsmanship and respect for the game of football and all those who play, coach, and enjoy watching it, is troubling and does not reflect the core values of the NFL,\" Runyan told Al-Shaair in the letter. \"Your continued disregard for NFL playing rules puts the health and safety of both you and your opponents in jeopardy and will not be tolerated.\u201d",
      "Caserio was outraged by that part of Runyan's letter.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing is the health and safety of the players and the health and well being of Trevor and hopefully Trevor is going to be OK,\u201d Caserio said. \u201cBut to speak on Azeez\u2019s intentionality about what he intended to do and some of the comments that have been made quite frankly, it\u2019s embarrassing. So we\u2019re going to support Azeez. We love everything about him. We\u2019re glad he\u2019s a part of this team.\u201d",
      "Al-Shaair apologized to Lawrence in a long post on X on Monday, where he said he didn\u2019t see Lawrence sliding until \u201cit was too late\u201d and that it happened \u201cin the blink of an eye\u201d before saying he was sorry for the hit.",
      "Jaguars coach Doug Pederson said Sunday it was a play that \u201dreally has no business being in our league,\" and said Monday that the team is considering shutting Lawrence down for the season.",
      "Former Houston Texans linebacker Denzel Perryman was suspended for three games for repeatedly violating player safety rules last November. His suspension was reduced to two games following an appeal.",
      "Kareem Jackson had a suspension for repeatedly violating player safety reduced from four games to two games last year while playing for the Denver Broncos. He was suspended again for four games later in the season and that suspension was upheld.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Two-time Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell says it was a really easy decision to sign with the World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers and the presence of three-time MVP Shohei Ohtani played a part, too.",
      "Snell was introduced Tuesday at Dodger Stadium accompanied by his agent Scott Boras. The left-hander finalized a $182 million, five-year contract last Saturday.",
      "\u201cIt was really easy just cause me and Haeley wanted to live here, it\u2019s something we\u2019ve been talking about for a while,\u201d Snell said, referring to his girlfriend. \u201cThen you look at the team. You look at what they\u2019ve built, what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s just something you want to be a part of.\u201d",
      "Last month, Snell opted out of his deal with San Francisco to become a free agent for the second consecutive offseason after he was slowed by injuries during his lone year with the San Francisco Giants.",
      "Snell gets a $52 million signing bonus, payable on Jan. 25, and annual salaries of $26 million, of which $13.2 million each year will be deferred. Because Snell is a Washington state resident, the signing bonus will not be subject to California income tax.",
      "\u201cIt just played out the way that people around me felt comfortable with, I felt comfortable with, they felt comfortable with,\u201d Snell said. \u201cWe talked and found something that could work for both of us. You want your worth, you want your respect, and you want enough time to where you can really make a name for yourself. I've made a name for myself outside of LA, but I'm going to be invested.\u201d",
      "Two-way star Ohtani, who signed a record $700 million, 10-year deal a year ago, had a historic first season with the Dodgers. He helped them win the franchise's eighth World Series while playing only as designated hitter and became MVP in the National League for the first time after twice winning the award while in the American League.",
      "\u201cIt helps with him in the lineup for sure. That\u2019s big motivation,\u201d Snell said. \u201cYou want to be around players like that when you\u2019re trying to be one of the best in the game. Yeah, it played a big part.\u201d",
      "Snell joins Ohtani and fellow Japanese right-hander Yoshinobu Yamamoto atop Los Angeles\u2019 rotation. All-Star Tyler Glasnow will be back after having his first season in LA derailed by a sprained elbow.",
      "Ohtani didn\u2019t pitch this year while recovering from right elbow surgery but is expected back on the mound in 2025.",
      "The rest of the rotation includes Tony Gonsolin, Landon Knack, Dustin May, Bobby Miller and Emmet Sheehan.",
      "\u201cI pitched on six-man, five-man, four-man rotations,\u201d Snell said. \u201cI'm good with it all as long as we have a plan, we'll execute it.\u201d",
      "Snell, who turns 32 on Wednesday, went 5-3 with a 3.12 ERA in 20 starts this year, throwing a no-hitter at Cincinnati on Aug. 2 for one of only 16 individual shutouts in the major leagues this season. He struck out 145 and walked 44 in 104 innings.",
      "He was sidelined between April 19 and May 22 by a strained left adductor and between June 2 and July 9 by a strained left groin.",
      "Snell won Cy Young Awards in 2018 with Tampa Bay and 2023 with San Diego. He is 76-58 with a 3.19 ERA in nine seasons with the Rays (2016-20), Padres (2021-23) and Giants.",
      "He has known Andrew Friedman, Dodgers president of baseball operations, since he was 18.",
      "In the aftermath of winning the World Series and discussing how the Dodgers could repeat next year, Friedman said, \u201cAll conversations kept coming back to Blake.\u201d",
      "\u201cUsually in major league free agency, you're buying the backside of a guy's career, the accomplishments that they have had,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Blake, one thing that's really exciting for us is, as much success as he's had, we feel like there's more in there.\"",
      "Snell was 2-2 against the Dodgers in his career.",

      "DENVER -- Jameis Winston had a night to remember \u2014 and one to forget.",
      "Ja\u2019Quan McMillian returned an interception 44 yards for a game-sealing touchdown with 1:48 remaining, and Denver spoiled career-best performances by Winston and former Broncos wide receiver Jerry Jeudy in beating the Cleveland Browns 41-32 on Monday night.",
      "The good for Winston: He threw for a franchise-record 497 yards and four touchdowns.",
      "The not-so-good: He tossed two interceptions that Denver returned for scores. The Broncos had three picks for 171 interception return yards against him.",
      "\u201cIt was my fault,\" Winston said. \"I\u2019ve got to play better.\u201d",
      "It was fully reminiscent of his best \u2014 and worst \u2014 year in 2019 with Tampa Bay, when he led the NFL in yards (5,109) and was second in TD passes (33) but also led the league in picks (30).",
      "\u201cI know I\u2019m better than this,\u201d Winston said. \u201cI\u2019m just praying for the Lord to deliver me from pick-6s. That's not me. Phenomenal game on offense, do some great things, but I mess it up.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Jeudy had nine catches for 235 yards \u2014 the most in NFL history by a receiver against his former team \u2014 and a TD. Jeudy, who played his first four seasons with Denver, was booed every time he caught the ball.",
      "\u201cThey only boo you,\u201d Jeudy said, \"when they know there\u2019s something great in you.\u201d",
      "Nik Bonitto intercepted Winston and took it 71 yards to the house late in the second quarter. Winston became the first NFL quarterback to throw for 400 or more yards with four or more TD passes and two pick-6s.",
      "Bo Nix finished with 294 yards passing, including a gorgeous deep ball from his own end zone that Marvin Mims Jr. hauled in for a 93-yard touchdown. Nix also threw two picks.",
      "The Broncos (8-5) enter their bye week in the seventh and final playoff spot in the AFC. Denver has a 76% probability of making the postseason, according to the NFL. The team hasn't been in the playoffs since winning the Super Bowl after the 2015 season.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect, by any means, but we were able to finish,\u201d Broncos coach Sean Payton said. \u201dBig plays \u2014 the game was full of them.\"",
      "Winston surpassed the Browns record of 457 yards passing set by Josh McCown in 2015 against Baltimore. He threw a 70-yard TD pass to Jeudy and a pair of scores to tight end David Njoku in falling to 2-3 as a starter for the Browns (3-9) since replacing an injured Deshaun Watson.",
      "Cleveland led 32-31 on Winston\u2019s 5-yard TD pass to Nick Chubb when Nix drove the Broncos to the Browns 9. On fourth-and-1, Payton lined up to go for it but changed his mind after a timeout. Wil Lutz kicked a go-ahead 27-yard field goal with 2:54 remaining.",
      "Winston and the Browns had plenty of time to drive for a winning score, but Winston's throw to Elijah Moore was late and McMillian jumped the route. He fell to the turf untouched after making the catch, got up and sprinted to the end zone.",
      "\u201cThe fact they did it twice was kind of crazy,\u201d Nix said of the interception returns. \u201cI'm over there sitting, the benches have the heaters over there, and I don't even have to move. It's pretty nice for the offense when they bail us out like that.\u201d",
      "Jeudy, a first-round draft pick in 2020, was traded to Cleveland this spring after an up-and-down four seasons with Denver. He paused at the goal line before falling backward into the end zone on his long TD catch. He also caught a 2-point conversion to pull the Browns to 28-25.",
      "\u201cWe had a plan going into it in terms of trying to get him open. I thought the plan was solid,\u201d Cleveland coach Kevin Stefanski said. \"Jerry executed the plan really well. Got him open. Jameis made some throws. It\u2019s hard in the losing effort to feel good about anything.\u201d",
      "The play by Jeudy came just 11 seconds after Nix threw a laser from about 4 yards deep in his end zone to Mims at around the 42. Mims caught it in stride, raced to the end zone and jumped into the stands to celebrate.",
      "The Broncos relied on their running game in the first half, with Javonte Williams and Michael Burton scoring short TDs. It was Burton\u2019s second rushing TD of his 10-year career.",
      "The Browns fell to 4-13 in the Mile High City. Dustin Hopkins missed a 47-yard field goal to the left on Cleveland\u2019s opening drive.",
      "Nix, who has earned the NFL Rookie of the Week three consecutive times, threw his first interception since Nov. 3. Chased by Myles Garrett, Nix tried to force a pass to Tony Franklin over the middle. Denzel Ward reached in and deflected the ball into the air and it was caught by Greg Newsome II.",
      "Winston and Jeudy got rolling early with a 44-yard completion on the Browns' first offensive play.",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 12:10:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Talks on a new collective bargaining agreement between the NHL and NHL Players' Association are set to begin in early 2025",
    "story": [
      "Talks on a new collective bargaining agreement between the NHL and NHL Players' Association are set to begin in early 2025",
      "The NHL's collective bargaining agreement does not expire until Sept. 15, 2026. That discussions are set to begin on a new deal in early 2025 is already one step ahead of where hockey has been in labor negotiations in the past.",
      "Commissioner Gary Bettman earlier this week said he expects talks with the NHL Players' Association to begin in February, around the time stakeholders are together for the 4 Nations Face-Off that stands as the latest example of collaboration in the sport. Both sides have issues to broach and changes they want, but the trajectory of the league combined with the strong working relationship between Bettman and union executive director Marty Walsh means there is reason for optimism in a sport that has had three labor stoppages in the past three decades.",
      "Bettman is in the midst of canvassing owners and general managers and Walsh his membership of over 700 players to figure out the issues that are most important to them.",
      "The salary cap system and 50/50 split of revenue that has been in place are not likely to change, and there is already an agreement in place to send NHL players to the Olympics in 2026 and 2030. That leaves a handful of topics to go over.",
      "After previous negotiations centered on how to share money, owners and players have shifted their focus to growing the revenue available to all. Revenues are setting records each season thanks to new U.S. media rights deals, with another coming to Canada in '26, and fresh sources of income like the 4 Nations event, jersey and helmet advertisements and a series of sponsorship agreements.",
      "There are still points of contention, of course.",
      "Expansion fees have gone entirely to owners, including $500 million when Vegas joined and $650 million from Seattle. Bettman has said there are no current plans to expand beyond 32 teams, but it is no secret there is interest from ownership groups in Atlanta and elsewhere, and whether that counts as hockey-related revenue \u2014 which is shared with players \u2014 could be a talking point.",
      "Hockey-related revenue, which includes ticket sales, TV money and more, is what determines the salary cap. After remaining flat and increasing minimally out of the pandemic, the cap for each team is now $88 million, with $92.5 million projected for next season.",
      "With more revenue coming in, there is debate over whether players want to push for a quicker increase in the cap, which would boost salaries for players across the league.",
      "\u201cI like smooth and steady,\u201d Bettman said Sunday in Boston. \u201cNo discussions yet, so when I say smooth and steady, that doesn\u2019t mean I have any numbers in mind and it doesn\u2019t mean the cap couldn\u2019t conceivably go up faster, but we\u2019re not anywhere near to having anything like a substantive discussion on that.\u201d",
      "Walsh said players would love to see the cap go up because \u201cit lifts everyone up.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just talking about the top, marquee players,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cIt\u2019s talking about there\u2019ll be opportunities for all other players to increase, as well. And I think that\u2019s important about the cap going up, and it\u2019s important for the revenue.\u201d",
      "The 2020 CBA extension included caps on the escrow kept from players' paychecks to even out the 50/50 split. Something like that is expected to continue as discussions heat up.",
      "\"It\u2019s just deciding what things are important to you, what things you\u2019d like to maybe be different,\u201d Washington Capitals alternate player representative Trevor van Riemsdyk said Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s a tough thing about all this is not everyone\u2019s in the same position. Some guys are in the midst of long deals, some guys are looking to get new deals, so you\u2019re going want different things.\"",
      "From a league perspective, long-term injured reserve rules and how much money teams are spending over the cap may be among the tweaks requested. Player pensions, medical care and who gets the final say on surgeries and the schedule that has a protracted preseason and hockey until late June could come up from the union side.",
      "The NHL, like other professional leagues, has a history of work stoppages. The 2004-05 lockout wiped out an entire season, and talks in 2012-13 pushed the start until January.",
      "It is hard to envision that sort of trouble this time around. The early start has led to some speculation that a new agreement could be done by late spring or early summer \u2014 more than a year before the deadline.",
      "Bettman said Walsh, a former federal labor secretary and before that mayor of Boston, \u201chas a very professional, sophisticated approach\" and understands that \"everybody does better when you collaborate.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t fiercely represent your constituents, but you pick and choose the things that are important \u2014 and the places where you can work together, you should for the greater good,\u201d Bettman said. \u201cHe gets that better than anybody I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d",
      "This will be Walsh's first CBA negotiation. Don Fehr, known for his long run heading the Major League Baseball Players Association, was the union's executive director for the 2012-13 and 2020 talks, and before that it was Bob Goodenow in 2004-05.",
      "\u201cMarty obviously has a ton of experience working with unions,\u201d van Riemsdyk said. \"He\u2019s a hard-nosed guy, he worked in Boston and we have the utmost confidence in him and his ability to portray to the owners what\u2019s most important to the players.\"",
      "Walsh said hockey has been in a transition period far enough away from bargaining talks to not have it be a day-to-day focus, and Bettman has warned against setting any sort of artificial timeline for a new deal.",
      "The NHL is also in a strong place given the quality of the game on the ice and business booming around it. It does not benefit anyone to halt that momentum.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve had probably the greatest financial year, greatest gate year, one of the greatest if not the greatest TV year as far as audience,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cGoing into collective bargaining, that\u2019s a good place to be.\u201d",

      "U.S. biathletes face \u201cmisogynistic\u201d behavior while racing and fear retaliation if they report their concerns, according to an inquiry by an independent contractor hired to assess athlete safety.",
      "The investigation of U.S. Biathlon was ordered following an Associated Press report that a female team member had been sexually harassed and abused for years while racing on the World Cup circuit.",
      "\u201cIt is very uncomfortable as a woman ... to be in that environment,\" one biathlete said in the report released Monday, which did not identify the athletes to preserve confidentiality.",
      "Many biathletes said they feared if they complained they would be denied training opportunities, financial support and selection for relay teams, according to the assessment by outside auditor Vestry Laight.",
      "The AP reported in January that a U.S. Center for SafeSport investigation found that two-time Olympian Joanne Reid had been sexually harassed by a ski-wax technician from 2016 to 2021. Wax technicians play a critical role in biathlon, which combines cross-country skiing with target shooting.",
      "SafeSport suspended the wax tech for six months and put him on probation through December. U.S. Biathlon fired him from the team and ordered the audit.",
      "Investigators interviewed athletes, parents, coaches and staff, and studied U.S. Biathlon policies as part of the review. They also sent a confidential survey to 57 biathletes who have competed since 2020.",
      "The report found the U.S. Biathlon Association code of conduct failed to provide clear examples of prohibited behavior. There was also no way to file complaints online or anonymously, making it less likely people would come forward, it said.",
      "The survey showed that while 92% of male respondents said they felt comfortable raising concerns about athlete safety, only 52% of women did. Women were far more likely to say they feared negative consequences to their careers for reporting misconduct \u2014 57% compared to 8% of men.",
      "In addition, 43% of women said they had observed conduct in violation of the USBA code in the past year, compared to 25% of men.",
      "Biathlon officials said they were adopting an \"action plan\u201d in response to the report, including workshops with staff and athletes to define core values and create a way to measure progress.",
      "\u201cWe have full confidence in the USBA leadership to implement the necessary improvements and build a culture that will enable the athletes and our community to thrive,\u201d Bob Hall, USBA board chair, told members in an email.",
      "Reid told the AP on Tuesday that she believes U.S. Biathlon\u2019s response is inadequate, calling it \"mostly a promise to develop metrics and plans, with nothing concrete that they can be held accountable to.\"",
      "She said it was \u201creally rugged\u201d to see how many women had witnessed abuse but feared reporting it.",
      "Many athletes interviewed said they feared retaliation for reporting abuse after what happened to Reid. Six months after SafeSport's investigation, U.S. Biathlon retroactively changed the criteria for being pre-qualified for the World Cup team \u2014 and Reid was bumped off. The change didn\u2019t affect the status of anyone else on the team.",
      "U.S. Biathlon CEO Jack Gierhart told the AP in January the World Cup rule change was not retaliation.",
      "SafeSport has launched a new investigation into whether Gierhart and High Performance Director Lowell Bailey retaliated against Reid by changing the qualification criteria. Gierhart said in an interview Tuesday that he could not comment on that inquiry.",
      "Athletes interviewed for the audit said the way U.S. Biathlon officials handled the Reid case made them feel powerless and unsafe.",
      "\u201cIt was clearly demonstrated by USBA that if an athlete, especially a female athlete, were to bring up this topic they would risk their spot on the team in the upcoming year,\" one athlete wrote in the survey.",

      "The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources last month passed the D.C. Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium Campus Revitalization Act on to the full Senate for approval. If passed and signed into law by the president, it would transfer the land with the husk of the former stadium and surrounding areas less than 2 miles (3.22 kilometers) east of the U.S. Capitol from the federal to the D.C. government for up to 99 years.",
      "D.C. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton called it a \u201cwin-win for the federal and D.C. governments\u201d that could \u201ctransform the campus from acres of asphalt to a complex focused on community sports, recreation, park space and cultural amenities.\u201d",

      "It is no guarantee the Commanders would build their next state-of-the-art stadium there, but getting this agreement done is one of the major steps in paving the way to making it possible to return to what had been the organization's home from 1961-96.",
      "\u201cThe Commanders have been fortunate to have interest from three incredible jurisdictions as we search for a new home and stadium,\u201d a team spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe vote ... brings us one step closer towards continuing conversations with D.C., along with Maryland and Virginia, as a potential future home for our franchise.\u201d",
      "Sites in the District, Maryland and Virginia all remain in the running for the new stadium, a process that was ongoing long before Harris' group bought the team from longtime owner Dan Snyder last year for a North American professional sports record $6.05 billion.",
      "Harris and several of his co-owners, including Mitch Rales and Mark Ein, grew up in the area and were fans of the team when it played at RFK during the glory days, which included Super Bowl titles in 1982, \u201887 and \u201991.",
      "They took control after Snyder rebranded as the Commanders, following a temporary stint as the Washington Football Team when he bowed to pressure from sponsors and activists in the summer of 2020, dropping the name the franchise was known by for nearly nine decades. It could change again, though Harris has said the old name would not return.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mon., last summer threatened to block the RFK Stadium bill until the NFL and the Commanders honor, in some form, the old Indian head logo that was designed by a member of the Blackfeet Nation in the state of Montana.",
      "Daines recently gave his blessing, saying there had been \"good faith negotiations\u201d with the league and team about using the old logo. A spokesperson for Daines said last week part of the ongoing negotiations are related to using the old logo to support Native American philanthropic causes and plans to show the logo on future merchandise.",

The Chicago street race was also interrupted by rain, making three of the biggest events of the season dampened by weather.",
      "And yet, Phelps noted that NASCAR had climbed out of 27% ratings hole by the end of the season.",
      "\u201cIf you had asked me at the beginning of the year, \u2018I will bet you that you can dig out of a 27% hole at the 500 and then two double-digital ratings declines on your next two highest rated races,\u2019 I would have said there is no way that\u2019s going to happen,\" he said. \u201cAnd we sit here for our Cup races, we are in the positive numbers.\u201d",
      "Most of the winners were familiar faces: Larson, with a series-high six wins, and Daytona 500 winner William Byron was among five drivers who scored three victories apiece this season.",
      "Logano, who won his third Cup championship, had only one regular-season victory. But he won three playoff races to become only the 10th driver in NASCAR history to win three or more Cup titles.",
      "There were some surprises, too. Chase Briscoe and Harrison Burton won the final two races of the regular season to snag the final two playoff spots in the 16-driver field. It was bittersweet for both.",
      "Briscoe represented Stewart-Haas Racing, which essentially closed at the end of the season. Burton, a first-time Cup Series winner, won in his final season with Wood Brothers Racing.",
      "Dillon earned his first victory in nearly two years with a win at Richmond Raceway that ultimately was thrown out by NASCAR because he wrecked two cars in the closing laps. There are also allegations that Richard Childress Racing bought the setup information on Dillon's car from a Joe Gibbs Racing employee. JGR has refused to comment and no formal complaint has been lodged.",
      "At the penultimate race of the season, with spots in the championship on the line, NASCAR levied heavy fines against multiple teams for cooperating with each other in order to help drivers representing the same manufacturers. NASCAR found it manipulative and said it won't rule out driver suspensions in the future.",
      "NASCAR also won't rule out taking a look at the playoff format after the title was won by Logano, who was technically eliminated from the field after the second round. But when Alex Bowman's car failed inspection following the elimination race, Logano was reinstated and went on to give Roger Penske his third consecutive Cup Series title.",
      "NASCAR was adamant the correct four drivers raced for the title \u2014 Logano, regular-season champion Tyler Reddick, Byron and 2023 champion Ryan Blaney \u2014 but said it would review the system if needed.",
      "\u201cWe are always looking if there are opportunities for us to tweak something,\u201d said Steve O'Donnell, NASCAR chief operating officer. \u201cWe are not the only sport where the best statistical team does not get to the Final Four or the Super Bowl or the World Series. We\u2019re not going to go away from playoffs. We read fans and everything. We will, as we always do, we\u2019ll absolutely look at what form the playoffs take in the offseason.\u201d",
      "NASCAR for more than two years was locked in contentious negotiations with the teams over its revenue-sharing model, based on charter agreements. A deal described by the teams as a \u201ctake-it-or-leave-it\u201d final offer was presented 48 hours before the start of the playoffs in September.",
      "Of the 15 teams that held 36 charters, 13 signed. The two that refused \u2014 23XI Racing, which is owned by NBA Hall of Famer Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin, and Front Row Motorsports, owned by businessman Bob Jenkins \u2014 are now suing NASCAR over antitrust claims.",
      "NASCAR has since revoked the charter offers to the two teams, which held two each. The charters guarantee a spot in the field in all 38 races as well as guaranteed revenue. The teams can still compete as \u201copen\u201d cars but will not have the same protections. Both teams had agreements to buy charters from Stewart-Haas Racing to expand their organizations to three cars, but NASCAR said it will not honor those transfers.",
      "The teams have asked for a December hearing in search of an injunction to clear the situation up a little bit before the charters expire at the end of this year. NASCAR on Monday asked for the suit to be dismissed outright.",
      "The ramifications are huge but it isn't clear how 23XI and Front Row can or will proceed if there isn't resolution by February. An attorney representing the teams, Jeffrey Kessler, contends the drivers and sponsors can leave both organizations if the cars aren't chartered. And, without the transfer of the SHR charters, expansion is in question even though both teams have hired drivers for 2025.",
      "It's a messy fight that will likely linger until a judge either reaches a decision or a settlement is made \u2014 and nobody knows if that will be before the preseason Clash, which will be held for the first time at Bowman-Gray Stadium in North Carolina on Feb. 2.",

      "\u201cFIFA is going to take America by storm and we\u2019re going to be right at their side,\u201d the bank\u2019s head of marketing, David Tyrie, said in a telephone interview Tuesday.",

      "FIFA has promised hundreds of millions of dollars in prize money for the 32 clubs to share but is yet to announce any broadcast deals for the month-long tournament. It is expected to land on a streaming service.",
      "\u201cYou have to think about how you are going to connect with these fans,\u201d Tyrie told the Associated Press from Boston. \u201cTV is one, sure, social media is a big avenue.",

      "Engaging Bank of America\u2019s customers and 250,000 employees are key to that strategy, Tyrie said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be for our clients, and entertainment, it\u2019s going to be for our employees in creating excitement. All of the above.\u201d",

      "U.S. officials are urging telecommunication companies to boost network security following a Chinese hacking operation that gave officials in Beijing access to the private texts and phone conversations of Americans",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal authorities on Tuesday urged telecommunication companies to boost network security following a sprawling Chinese hacking campaign that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.",
      "The guidance issued by the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is intended to help root out the hackers and prevent similar cyberespionage in the future. Officials who briefed reporters on the recommendations said the U.S. still doesn't know the true scope of China's attack or the extent to which Chinese hackers still have access to U.S. networks.",
      "In one sign of the global reach of China's hacking efforts, the government's warning was issued jointly with security agencies in New Zealand, Australia and Canada, members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, which also includes the U.S. and Britain.",
      "Dubbed Salt Typhoon by analysts, the wide-ranging cyberespionage campaign emerged earlier this year after hackers sought to penetrate the networks of multiple telecommunications companies.",
      "The hackers used their access to telecom networks to target the metadata of a large number of customers, including information on the dates, times and recipients of calls and texts.",
      "The hackers succeeded in retrieving the actual audio files of calls and content from texts from a much smaller number of victims. The FBI has contacted victims in this group, many of whom work in government or politics, but officials said it is up to telecom companies to notify customers included in the first, larger group.",
      "Despite months of investigation, the true scale of China\u2019s operation, including the total number of victims or whether the hackers still have some access to information, is currently unknown.",
      "The FBI has said some of the information targeted by the hackers relates to U.S. law enforcement investigations and court orders, suggesting the hackers may have been trying to access programs subject to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. The law grants American spy agencies sweeping powers to surveil the communications of people suspected of being agents of a foreign power.",
      "But on Tuesday, officials said they think the hackers were more broadly motivated, hoping to burrow deeply into the nation's telecommunications systems to gain wide access to Americans' information.",
      "The suggestions for telecom companies released Tuesday are largely technical in nature, urging encryption, centralization and consistent monitoring to deter cyber intrusions. If implemented, the security precautions could help disrupt the Salt Typhoon operation and make it harder for China or any other nation to mount a similar attack in the future, said Jeff Greene, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity and one of the officials who briefed reporters Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have any illusion that once we kick off these actors they\u2019re not going to come back,\u201d Greene said.",
      "Several recent high-profile hacking incidents have been linked to China and what officials say is Beijing's effort to steal technical and government secrets while also gaining access to critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid.",
      "In September, the FBI announced that it had disrupted a vast Chinese hacking operation that involved the installation of malicious software on more than 200,000 consumer devices, including cameras, video recorders and home and office routers. The devices were then used to create a massive network of infected computers, or botnet, that could then be used to carry out other cyber crimes.",
      "In October, officials said hackers linked to China targeted the phones of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, along with people associated with Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "China has rejected accusations from U.S. officials that it engages in cyberespionage directed against Americans.",
      "On Tuesday, a spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington called the U.S. allegations \u201cdisinformation.\"",
      "China's government \u201cfirmly opposes and combats all kinds of cyber attacks,\u201d spokesperson Liu Pengyu wrote in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. \u201cThe US needs to stop its own cyberattacks against other countries and refrain from using cyber security to smear and slander China.\u201d"

      "In court, he admitted that in 2021 he publicly suggested there was regulatory consent for the company's moves because he knew that customers \u201cwould find false comfort\u201d with that.",
      "And he said that in 2019, he was selling the crypto tokens even though he told the public that he was not. He said he knew customers would draw false comfort from that too.",
      "\u201cI accept full responsibility for my actions,\u201d Mashinsky said of crimes that stretched from 2018 to 2022 as the company pitched itself to customers as a modern-day bank where they could safely deposit crypto assets and earn interest.",
      "U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a release that Mashinsky \u201corchestrated one of the biggest frauds in the crypto industry\u201d as his company's assets purportedly grew to about $25 billion at its peak, making it one of the largest crypto platforms in the world.",
      "He said Mashinsky used catchy slogans like \u201cUnbank Yourself\u201d to entice prospective customers with a pledge that their money would be as safe in crypto accounts as money would be in a bank. Meanwhile, prosecutors said, Mashinsky and co-conspirators used customer deposits to fund market purchases of the Celsius token to prop up its value.",
      "Machinsky made tens of millions of dollars selling his own CEL tokens at artificially high prices, leaving his customers \u201cholding the bag when the company went bankrupt,\u201d Williams said.",
      "An indictment alleged that Mashinsky promoted Celsius through media interviews, his social media accounts and Celsius\u2019 website, along with a weekly \u201cAsk Mashinsky Anything\u201d session broadcast that was posted to Celsius\u2019 website and a YouTube channel.",
      "Celsius employees from multiple departments who noticed false and misleading statements in the sessions warned Mashinsky, but they were ignored, the indictment said.",
      "A plea agreement Mashinsky made with prosecutors calls for him to be sentenced to up to 30 years in prison and to forfeit over $48 million, which is the amount of money he allegedly made by selling his company's token.",
      "Sentencing was scheduled for April 8."

      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- TikTok took down several networks that tried to meddle in Romania's elections, executives said Tuesday as they defended the company's election integrity measures to European Union lawmakers.",
      "The video-sharing platform is a focus of controversy in the Eastern European country after far-right outsider Calin Georgescu emerged as the frontrunner in the vote, plunging the country into turmoil amid allegations of electoral violations and Russian meddling.",
      "Among the networks that TikTok uncovered were two small groups that it disrupted on Friday, days after the first round of voting, Brie Pegum, the platform\u2019s global head of product, authenticity and transparency, told a committee.",
      "Both networks targeted Romanian users. One had only 1,781 followers and supported Georgescu, who was a little-known independent candidate until he set off shockwaves by convincingly winning the first round of voting, beating out the incumbent prime minister. The other networks supported different candidates, Pegum said.",
      "Many observers chalked up Georgescu\u2019s success to his TikTok account, which now has 5.8 million likes and 527,000 followers.",
      "He gained huge traction and popularity in the weeks leading up to the first vote. But experts suspect Georgescu\u2019s online following was artificially inflated while officials hinted that he was given preferential treatment by TikTok.",
      "The controversy highlights how TikTok has become a key election tool in Romania, an EU and NATO member state that shares a long border with war-torn Ukraine.",
      "TikTok applied its \u201cglobal playbook\u201d for the Romanian election and took a local approach with staff on the ground, said Caroline Greer, the company's top lobbyist in the EU.",
      "Greer and Pegum were being grilled by EU lawmakers about Tiktok's role in the Romanian vote as well as its compliance with the 27-nation bloc's Digital Services Act, a sweeping set of regulations designed to protect users online from illegal or harmful content.",
      "Greer said TikTok deployed 95 Romanian language content moderators, worked with a fact-checking group and met with political parties and a number of different authorities including the country's electoral authority.",
      "But many lawmakers were not satisfied with their responses.",
      "\u201cThe feeling here is that we are losing patience ... and that we need more specific answers,\u201d said Dirk Gotink, a Dutch member of the European Parliament. He also questioned what the scores of Romanian content moderators were doing during the election, and compared Pegum and Greer to firefighters TikTok sent to put out a fire.",
      "\u201cThey come, they let the fire rage online for weeks, months, during an election. And then they send very nice people here into this committee to answer questions in a very polite way,\" Gotink said. \"But it is simply not convincing \u2014 and it also doesn\u2019t reflect what is happening online.\u201d",
      "According to a report by the Bucharest-based Expert Forum think tank, Georgescu's TikTok account garnered 92.8 million views primarily within the last few months, a figure that grew by 52 million views a week later, just days ahead of the first-round vote.",
      "Another TikTok account solely featuring Georgescu content, which had 1.7 million likes on the night first-round polls closed, was removed the day after voting. It had posts with Georgescu attending church, doing judo, running around an oval track, and speaking on podcasts.",
      "In an emailed statement to The Associated Press on Monday, TikTok said the account was one of \u201cmore than 150 accounts impersonating Georgescu\u201d to date that has been removed, but added: \u201cWe also removed more than 650 additional impersonation accounts belonging to other candidates.\u201d",
      "Georgescu will face reformist Elena Lasconi, of the progressive Save Romania Union party, in a presidential runoff on Sunday.",

      "QUINCY, Mass. -- As global warming fills the plankton-rich waters of New England with death traps for sea turtles, the number of stranded reptiles has multiplied over the last 20 years, filling one specialized animal hospital with the endangered creatures.",
      "The animals enter areas such as Cape Cod Bay when it is warm, and when temperatures inevitably drop, they can\u2019t escape the hooked peninsula to head south, said Adam Kennedy, the director of rescue and rehabilitation at the New England Aquarium, which runs a turtle hospital in Quincy, Massachusetts.",
      "More than 200 cold-stunned young turtles were being treated there Tuesday, Kennedy said.",
      "\u201cClimate change certainly is allowing those numbers of turtles to get in where normally the numbers weren\u2019t very high years ago,\u201d he said.",
      "Cold-stunned sea turtles, sometimes near death, wash up on Cape Cod every fall and winter. The aquarium expects the number of turtles it rescues to climb to at least 400, Kennedy said. In 2010, the average was 40, he said.",
      "High wind speeds and falling temperatures have fueled recent strandings, he said.",
      "The total five-year average of cold-stunned sea turtles in Massachusetts was around 200 in the early 2010s, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data, growing to more than 700 in recent years.",
      "All the turtles at New England Aquarium's hospital are juveniles, mostly critically endangered Kemp\u2019s ridley turtles whose migratory patterns lead to strandings here. They were being treated for maladies ranging from pneumonia to sepsis.",
      "The Kemp's \u2014 the world's smallest sea turtle \u2014 lives largely in the Gulf of Mexico and ventures into the Atlantic Ocean when juvenile. Some recent science, including a 2019 study in the journal PLoS One, says the warming of the ocean increases the chance of cold-stunning events once the turtles reach the Northwest Atlantic. Warmer seas may push the turtles north in a way that makes stranding more likely, the study said.",
      "Upon arrival, the turtles are often critically ill.",
      "\u201cThe majority of the turtles arrive with serious ailments such as pneumonia, dehydration, traumatic injuries, or sepsis,\u201d said Melissa Joblon, director of animal health at the aquarium.",
      "The turtle hospital rehabilitates the animals so they can be safely returned to the wild, sometimes locally and sometimes in warmer southern waters, Kennedy said. Around 80% survive.",
      "Some of the turtles that arrive at the hospital are green turtles or loggerheads, which are not as endangered as the Kemp's ridley, but still face numerous threats.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, getting these turtles back to the wild is what we are doing and what we want,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe want them back in the ocean.\u201d ___",

      "Finnish police says they do not suspect any criminal activity in connection with damage to two data cables running across the land border between Sweden and Finland",
      "BERLIN -- Finnish police said Tuesday that \u201cthere is no reason to suspect any criminal activity\u201d in connection with damage to two data cables running across the land border between Sweden and Finland, saying the damage was created by excavation work.",
      "The two cables were repaired Tuesday, a day after they were damaged, affecting 6,000 private customers and 100 businesses, a company providing digital infrastructure and data communication in Northern Europe said.",
      "Global Connect said the internet cables were damaged in two separate places in southern Finland on Monday.",
      "The first fiber breakage happened on Monday morning, the other one in the afternoon.",
      "\u201cDuring the night the first of the cables was repaired, so we could restore internet to approximately 95% of all the customers,\" said Global Connect\u2019s spokesman in Sweden, Niklas Ekstr\u00f6m, adding that by noon on Tuesday the second cable had also been fixed and that all customers should have internet again.",
      "Similar cable damage happens about every couple of months, but it was unusual that two cables in the same region were damaged on the same day, Ekstr\u00f6m told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from Stockholm.",
      "Finland's minister of transportation and communications, Lulu Ranne, wrote on X that \u201cauthorities are investigating the matter together with the company. We take the situation seriously.\u201d",
      "However, on Tuesday afternoon, police in Finland put out a statement saying they had investigated both incidents and that \u201cthere is no suspicion of any criminal offense in either case, as the damages were caused by excavation work.\u201d",
      "Police added they would not initiate a criminal investigation into either case.",
      "The incident comes after the rupture of two data cables on the Baltic Sea bed last month. The two, one running from Finland to Germany and the other from Lithuania to Sweden, were both damaged in Swedish waters.",
      "Finnish, Swedish and German authorities launched investigations into that incident.",
      "Germany\u2019s defense minister said at the time the damage appeared to have been caused by sabotage, though there is no proof at present.",
      "Last week, Sweden formally asked China to cooperate in explaining the rupture of the Baltic Sea data cables where a China-flagged vessel had been sighted."

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 20:02:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares is stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the carmaker that owns brands like Jeep and Ram and Citro&euml;n and Peugeot",
    "story": [
      "Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares is stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the carmaker that owns brands like Jeep and Ram and Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot",
      "NEW YORK -- Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares is stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the automaker, which owns car brands like Jeep, Citro\u00ebn and Ram, amid an ongoing struggle with slumping sales.",
      "The world\u2019s fourth-largest carmaker announced that its board accepted Tavares' resignation Sunday, effective immediately.",
      "Stellantis noted Sunday that the process of finding a new, permanent CEO is \u201cwell under way.\u201d In the meantime, the company says a new interim executive committee, led by chairman John Elkann, will be established.",
      "As head of PSA Peugeot, Tavares took control of the Netherlands-based company in January 2021 \u2014 when it merged with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, creating an automotive giant that is the parent to several well-known brands today. Beyond Jeep, Citro\u00ebn and Ram, the company portfolio includes Dodge, Chrysler, Fiat, Peugeot, Maserati and Opel.",
      "Stellantis' North American operations had been the company\u2019s main source of profits for some time, but struggles piled up this year, with the company citing rising competition and larger market changes. As a result of lofty sticker prices and fewer affordable options, many high-priced vehicles have been left unsold on dealers' lots.",
      "For its third quarter, Stellantis posted 27% plunge in net revenues, as gaps in launching new products and action to reduce inventories also slashed global shipments of new vehicles by 20%.",
      "The carmaker reported net revenues of 33 billion euros (nearly $36 billion ) in the three-month period ending Sept. 30, down from 45 billion euros in the same period last year. All regions except South America reported double-digit dips in revenues \u2014 led by North America, which plunged 42% to 12.4 billion euros ($13.1 billion).",
      "In recent months, Tavares had come under fire from U.S. dealers and the United Auto Workers union after the release of dismal financial performance reports. He also oversaw cost-cutting efforts that included delaying factory openings and laying off union workers \u2014 further straining the company's relations with the UAW, which filed several grievances against Stellantis and threatened to strike in recent months.",
      "The UAW welcomed Tavares' resignation with president Shawn Fain calling the move \u201ca major step in the right direction for a company that has been mismanaged and a workforce that has been mistreated for too long.\u201d He noted that thousands of UAW members had been calling for Tavares' firing for weeks for what Fain called the CEO's \u201creckless mismanagement of the company.\u201d",
      "\u201cTavares is leaving behind a mess of painful layoffs and overpriced vehicles sitting on dealership lots,\u201d Fain said in a statement. He added that the union looks forward to sitting down with Stellantis\u2019 new chief executive and \u201cwill keep using all means available\u201d to hold the company accountable.",
      "Beyond the U.S., Stellantis has faced pressure in Italy \u2014 where lawmakers questioned the former chief executive over the company's production plans in October, with the far-right government accusing the company of relocating assembly plants to low-cost countries. Tens of thousands of autoworkers in the country also held a one-day walkout, calling for more employment certainty and protections.",
      "In efforts to revive sales, Stellantis previously made a number of leadership changes in October, which included naming new heads of operations in North America and Europe. At the time, the company expected Tavares to step down in early 2026, closer to the end of his five-year contract.",
      "The company confirmed in September that it was searching for a CEO to eventually succeed Tavares, but it maintained those efforts were part of standard leadership transition plans.",
      "In a statement Sunday, Stellantis\u2019 senior independent director Henri de Castries said that Stellantis' success is \u201crooted in a perfect alignment\u201d between shareholders, the company's board and the CEO \u2014 but noted \u201cdifferent views\u201d had emerged in recent weeks, resulting in the decision to approve Tavares' resignation.",
      "Elkann, the chairperson of Stellantis' board, thanked Tavares for \u201chis years of dedicated service and the role he has played in the creation of Stellantis\u201d in an additional statement. He added that he looks forward to appointing a new CEO.",
      "Stellantis did not comment further beyond Sunday's release. The announcement arrived shortly after Bloomberg reported Tavares' plans to step down, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter."

      "Tired of thinking about what gifts to get everyone this year",
      "Tired of thinking about what gifts to get everyone this year? Artificial intelligence chatbots might help, but don't expect them to do all the work or always give you the right answers.",
      "Anyone scouring the internet for Cyber Monday deals is likely going to encounter more conversational iterations of the chatbots that some retailers and e-commerce sites have built to provide shoppers with enhanced customer service.",
      "Some companies have integrated models infused with newer generative AI technologies, allowing shoppers to seek advice by asking naturally phrased questions like \u201cWhat's the best wireless speaker?\u201d",
      "Retailers hope consumers use these chatbots, which are typically called shopping assistants - as virtual companions that help them discover or compare products. Prior chatbots were mostly used for task-oriented functions such as helping customers track down online orders or return ones that didn't meet expectations.",
      "Amazon, the king of online retail, has said its customers have been questioning Rufus - the generative AI- powered shopping assistant it launched this year - for information such as whether a specific coffee maker is easy to clean, or what recommendations it has for a lawn game for a child's birthday party.",
      "And Rufus, which is available for holiday shoppers in the U.S. and some other countries, is not the only shopping assistant out there. A select number of Walmart shoppers will have access this year to a similar chatbot the nation's largest retailer is testing in a few product categories, including toys and electronics.",
      "Perplexity AI added something new to the AI chat-shopping world last month by rolling out a feature on its AI-powered search engine that enables users to ask a question like \u201cWhat's the best women's leather boots?\" and then receive specific product results that the San Francisco-based company says are not sponsored.",
      "\u201cIt has been adopted at pretty incredible scale,\u201d Mike Mallazzo, an analyst and writer at retail research media company Future Commerce, said.",
      "Retailers with websites and e-commerce companies started paying more attention to chatbots when use of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence text chatbot made by the company OpenAI, went mainstream in late 2022, sparking public and business interest in the generative AI technology that powers the tool.",
      "Victoria\u2019s Secret, IKEA, Instacart and the Canadian retailer Ssense are among other companies experimenting with chatbots, some of which use technology from OpenAI.",
      "Even before the improved chatbots, online retailers were creating product recommendations based on a customer's prior purchases or search history. Amazon was at the forefront of having recommendations on its platform, so Rufus' ability to provide some is not particularly groundbreaking.",
      "But Rajiv Mehta, the vice president of search and conversational shopping at Amazon, said the company is able to offer more helpful recommendations now by programming Rufus to ask clarifying or follow-up questions. Customers are also using Rufus to look for deals, some of which are personalized, Mehta said.",
      "To be sure, chatbots are prone to hallucinations, so Rufus and most of the tools like it can get things wrong.",
      "Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, wrote in a November blog post that his firm tested Rufus by requesting gaming TV recommendations. The chatbot's response included products that were not TVs. When asked for the least expensive options, Rufus came back with suggestions that weren't the cheapest, Kaziukenas said.",
      "An Associated Press reporter recently asked Rufus to give some gift recommendations for a brother. The chatbot quickly spit out a few ideas for \u201cthoughtful gifts,\" ranging from a T-shirt and a keychain with charms to a bolder suggestion: a multifunctional knife engraved with the phrase \u201cBEST BROTHER EVER.\u201d",
      "After a 5-minute written conversation, Rufus offered more tailored suggestions - a few Barcelona soccer jerseys sold by third-party sellers. But it wasn\u2019t able to say which seller offered the lowest price. When asked during another search for a price comparison on a popular skin serum, Rufus showed the product's pre-discounted price instead of its present one.",
      "\u201cRufus is constantly learning,\u201d Amazon's Mehta said during an interview.",
      "Shop AI, a chatbot that Canadian e-commerce company Shopify launched last year, can also help shoppers discover new products by asking its own questions, such as soliciting details about an intended gift recipient or features the buyer wants to avoid. Shop AI has trouble, however, recommending specific products or identifying the lowest-priced item in a product category.",
      "The limitations show the technology is still in its infancy and has a long way to go before it becomes as useful as the retail industry - and many shoppers - wish it could be.",
      "To truly transform the shopping experience, shopping assistants will \u201cneed to be deeply personalized\u201d and be able - on their own - to remember a customer\u2019s order history, product preferences and purchasing habits, consulting giant McKinsey & Company said in an August report.",
      "Amazon has noted that Rufus' answers are based on information contained in product listings, community Q&As and customer reviews, which would include the fake reviews that are used to boost or diminish sales for products on its marketplace.",
      "The large language model that powers the chatbot was also trained on the company's entire catalog and some public information on the web, Trishul Chilimbi, an Amazon vice president who oversees AI research, wrote in the electrical engineering magazine IEEE Spectrum in October.",
      "But its unclear how Amazon and other companies are weighting different training components - such as reviews - in their recommendations, or how exactly the shopping assistants come up with them, according to Nicole Greene, an analyst at management consulting firm Gartner.",
      "Perplexity AI's new shopping feature allows users to enter search queries such as \u201cbest phone case\" and to receive answers derived from various sources, including Amazon and other retailers, such as Best Buy. Perplexity also invited retailers to share data about their products and said those that do would have an increased chance of having their items recommended to shoppers.",
      "But Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, suggested in a recent interview with Fortune magazine that he didn't know how the new shopping feature recommended products to customers. But in an interview with the AP, Chief Business Officer Dmitry Shevelenko pushed back on that characterization, saying Srinivas' comment \u201cwas probably taken out of context.\u201d",
      "The context, he said, is that with generative AI technology \u201cYou can\u2019t know in advance exactly what the output will be just based off of knowing what the inputs\u201d are from the training materials.",
      "Shevelenko said retailers and brands need to know they can't have their products recommended in Perplexity's search engine because they're \u201cjamming key words\u201d into their websites or using different techniques to show up better on search results",
      "\u201cThe way you show up in an answer is by having a better product and better features,\u201d he said.",

      "Consumers in the United States are scouring the internet for online deals as they look to take advantage of the post-Thanksgiving shopping marathon with Cyber Monday.",
      "Even though e-commerce is now part and parcel of many people's regular routines and the holiday shopping season, Cyber Monday \u2014 a term coined in 2005 by the National Retail Federation \u2014 has become the biggest online shopping day of the year, thanks to the deals and the hype the industry has created to fuel it.",
      "Adobe Analytics, which tracks online shopping, expects consumers to spend a record $13.2 billion on Monday, 6.1% more than last year. That would make it the season's \u2014 and the year's \u2014 biggest \u2014 shopping day for e-commerce.",
      "Online spending is expected to peak between the hours of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. Monday night, per Adobe \u2014 reaching an estimated $15.7 million spent every minute.",
      "For several major retailers, a Cyber Monday sale is a dayslong event that began over the Thanksgiving weekend. Amazon kicked off its sales event right after midnight Pacific time on Saturday. Target's two days of discount offers on its website and app began overnight Sunday. Walmart rolled out its Cyber Monday offers for Walmart+ members on Sunday afternoon and opened it up to all customers three hours later, at 8 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "Consumer spending for Cyber Week \u2014 the five major shopping days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday \u2014 provides a strong indication of how much shoppers are willing to spend for the holidays.",
      "Many U.S. consumers continue to experience sticker shock following the period of post-pandemic inflation, which left prices for many goods and services higher than they were three years ago. But retail sales nonetheless have remained strong, and the economy has kept growing at a healthy pace.",
      "At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies have been rising. More shoppers than ever are also on track to use \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d plans this holiday season, which allows them to delay payments on holiday decor, gifts and other items.",
      "Many economist have also warned that President-elect Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs next year on foreign goods coming into the United States would lead to higher prices on everything from food to clothing to automobiles.",
      "The National Retail Federation expects holiday shoppers to spend more this year both in stores and online than last year. But the pace of spending growth will slow slightly, the trade group said, growing 2.5% to 3.5% \u2014 compared to 3.9% in 2023.",
      "A clear sense of consumer spending patterns during the holiday season won\u2019t emerge until the government releases sales data for the period. But some preliminary data from other sources shows some encouraging signs for retailers.",
      "Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, notes that discounts from Thanksgiving onward have \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d \u2014 and online spending throughout Cyber Week is on track to cross a record $40 billion mark combined.",
      "U.S. shoppers spent $10.8 billion online on Black Friday, a 10.2% increase over last year, according to Adobe Analytics. That's also more than double what consumers spent in 2017, when Black Friday pulled in roughly $5 billion in online sales. Consumers also spent a record $6.1\u202fbillion online on Thanksgiving Day, Adobe said. And on Saturday and Sunday, shoppers spent another $10.9 billion online, up 5.8% over last year.",
      "Adobe reported Monday that as of 6:30 p.m. ET, shoppers had spent $8.7 billion\u202fon the online shopping holiday. When the final tally is in, Adobe expects consumers will have spent between\u202f$13.2 billion\u202fand\u202f$13.5 billion\u202ffor the day, making Cyber Monday the biggest online shopping day of the year__and of all time, Adobe said.",
      "Meanwhile, software company Salesforce, which also tracks online shopping, estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $17.5 billion in the U.S. and $74.4 billion globally. And Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks in-person and online spending, reported that overall Black Friday sales excluding automotive rose 3.4% from a year ago. The retail sales indicator, which is not adjusted for inflation, showed online sales jumped by double digits, while in-store purchase rose a modest 0.7%.",
      "E-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $5 billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached $4.6 million per minute \u2014 with top categories by volume including clothing, cosmetics and fitness products, according to the Canadian company.",
      "Toys, electronics, home goods, self-care and beauty categories were among the key drivers of holiday spending on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, according to Adobe. \u201cHot products\u201d included Lego sets, espresso machines, fitness trackers, makeup and skin care.",
      "Other data showed physical stores saw fewer customers on Black Friday, underscoring how the huge crowds that were once synonymous with the day after Thanksgiving are now more than happy to shop from the comfort of their homes.",
      "RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in stores, reported that its early data showed store traffic on Friday was down 3.2% in the U.S. compared to last year, with the biggest dip happening in the Midwest.",
      "Sensormatic Solutions, which also tracks store traffic, said its preliminary analysis showed retail store traffic on Black Friday was down 8.2% compared to 2023.",
      "Grant Gustafson, head of retail consulting and analytics at Sensormatic Solutions, noted that in-store traffic was getting spread across multiple days since many retailers offered generous discounts before and after Black Friday.",
      "\u201cSome of the extended Black Friday promotions really ended up leading to a little bit of a softer day-of traffic than expected,\u201d Gustafson said.",
      "While physical items like toys and electronics are always popular around the holidays, experts note that consumers have turned to more \u201cexperience-driven spending\u201d in recent years, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic waned.",
      "Jie Zhang, a marketing professor at the University of Maryland\u2019s Robert H. Smith School of Business, told The Associated Press ahead of the post-Thanksgiving shopping weekend that he expected shoppers to \u201cindulge themselves a bit more\u201d when it comes to \u201cself-gifting,\u201d increasing interest in categories like self care.",
      "Adobe notes that shoppers are also buying higher-ticket items this season \u2014 with consumers opening their wallets to invest or \u201ctrade up\u201d to more premium versions of products like electronics, appliances and sporting goods.",
      "Brie Carere, executive vice president and chief customer officer at FedEx, cited strong shipping volume for Thanksgiving weekend, and CyberMonday has had a good start. She anticipated that FedEx\u2019s shipping volume on the online shopping holiday will be slightly up over the 19 million items shipped a year ago on the holiday.",
      "But she said the truncated season \u2014 there are five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day \u2014 is making it harder for her retail customers to forecast.",
      "In fact, Carere said only four of FedEx\u2019s top 20 holiday e-commerce customers got their shipping predictions correct for the week before the Thanksgiving weekend. And she also noted that while FedEx predicts low single-digit percentage growth in shipping volume each day, she thinks that many retail customers will see a decline for the overall holiday period because of the truncated season.",
      "\u201cI do think that we\u2019re going to see some retailers be disappointed in their volume numbers,\u201d she said.",
      "Carere also doesn\u2019t anticipate much of a lull in shipping between Thanksgiving weekend and last two weeks before Christmas because of the shorter season.",
      "Jim Katsafanas, president of U.S. Small Business Sales, UPS, agreed, noting last week \u201cwe are going to see a pretty consistent surge of volume right through the end. \u201d",

    "story": [
      "As temperatures drop into the teens, Minnesotans have embraced sauna culture for warmth and community",
      "EAGAN, Minn. -- As another frigid winter settles over Minnesota with temperatures dipping into the teens, people like Ed Kranz are embracing the cold \u2014 and working up quite a sweat.",
      "Kranz and his wife, Colleen, are among Minnesotans who believe the best way to endure winter is to heat up in saunas and then cool off in their state's icy weather.",
      "On a bone-chilling Sunday morning, they set up a mobile wood-fired sauna from their business, Saunable, near a frozen lake in the Minneapolis suburb of Eagan. After about 10 minutes of sweating in the 185 degrees Fahrenheit (85 degrees Celsius) sauna they moseyed outside into the 15-degree temperatures, lingering around a fire in bathing suits before repeating the process three or four more times. One brave soul dipped into a hole in the frozen lake for a post-sauna cold plunge.",
      "Their hot-and-cold venture is common in Minnesota, where plenty of residents embrace sauna culture for warmth and community. Devotees say they are mingling Old World traditions with newfangled internet-based communities, and making social connections in a society that can feel isolating.",
      "Sauna and cold plunges go together like peanut butter and jelly, said Glenn Auerbach, a self-described sauna evangelist and the founder and editor of SaunaTimes. Auerbach started the website in 2008 to share his thoughts, research and conversations with movers and shakers in the sauna world. He and his interlocutors mull over the nitty-gritty of sauna construction, how to cultivate \u201cgood sauna vibes\u201d and the potential health benefits of the sauna lifestyle.",
      "A typical temperature to achieve the holy trinity of the sauna experience \u2014 heat, steam and ventilation \u2014 is about 180 to 200 degrees F (82-93 degrees C), a temperature that starkly contrasts Minnesota's frigid winter weather.",
      "The craftiest in the sauna community can build a facility for about $10,000, according to Auerbach. Those looking to skip the physical labor can outsource the construction. Sauna's popularity, which enthusiasts say spiked following the COVID-19 pandemic, has brought with it a rise in manufacturers selling saunas for about $30,000 to $40,000.",
      "While sauna's cultural cache may have increased in recent years, the practice long predates the Instagrammable spaces now popping up, Auerbach said.",
      "The smell of cedar wood has been lodged in Justin Juntunen's memory ever since he first stepped into his family's sauna as a child. Juntunen, the founder of Cedar and Stone Nordic Sauna, is a descendant of Finnish immigrants who came to America in the 1880s. They brought with them an appreciation for saunas and the communal values the steam-filled rooms impart to local life.",
      "People in Finland say there are more saunas than cars, Juntunen said. When immigrants like his grandfather came to Minnesota to work in the mines, mills or docks, they would often save up to build a farmhouse. But they would build a sauna first, living in the space while the house was constructed. Later, saunas would serve as informal town centers.",
      "People gossiped in saunas, they gave birth in saunas and they died in saunas, Juntunen said. The public nature of the facilities reflects the egalitarian ethos that infuses Nordic culture, and sauna culture by extension, he added.",
      "\u201cThis is a tradition that\u2019s actually for everyone,\u201d Juntunen said. \u201cMy favorite Nordic proverb is all people are created equal, but nowhere more so than in the sauna.\"",
      "In addition to a desire for in-person experiences following the COVID-19 pandemic, sauna enthusiasts say interest rose after some of the internet\u2019s most famous figures, such as podcasters Joe Rogan and Andrew Huberman, touted it.",
      "\u201cEvery big podcaster in the world discovered that you could jump in cold water and it feels kind of good. And then people click on it online,\u201d Juntunen said.",
      "In this way, technology has been a paradox for sauna culture, he added. Digital media helped sauna culture grow at the same time as saunas were billed as reprieves from the pervasive reach of technology over every facet of daily life.",
      "Either way, almost all of sauna culture's adherents say its rise is inextricably linked to a desire for community.",
      "Those who committed to building their own saunas have hosted friends, neighbors, and former high school hockey teammates over. This has created a new form of post-COVID-19 contagiousness: \u201cGood heat is contagious,\u201d Auerbach said.",
      "This core function of sauna culture spans generations. Juntunen's grandfather would rush to the sauna after work because it was the space where stories were told.",
      "\"It\u2019s a space where storytelling happens, where connection happens or silence happens,\" Juntunen said. \u201cI think that is a really beautiful example of what a sauna truly is.\u201d"

      "Antitrust enforcers with the Federal Trade Commission have opened a wide-ranging investigation into Microsoft\u2019s business practices, starting off a big legal project that an incoming Trump administration must take up or abandon",
      "Antitrust enforcers with the Federal Trade Commission have opened a wide-ranging investigation into Microsoft's business practices, starting a big legal project that an incoming Trump administration must take up or abandon.",
      "The FTC is investigating Microsoft's cloud computing business and related product lines such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, according to a person who was not authorized to discuss details of the investigation publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
      "It's the latest action of more than three years of aggressive antitrust enforcement shepherded by FTC Chair Lina Khan, who was elevated to lead the agency by President Joe Biden after he came into office pledging tougher scrutiny of monopolistic behavior by Big Tech companies.",
      "Khan's FTC already lost one antitrust fight with Microsoft last year when a federal judge declined to block its $69 billion takeover of video game company Activision Blizzard.",
      "This case would go deeper into the core of Microsoft's business in a way the company hasn't experienced in the U.S. since its antitrust showdown with the Justice Department in the 1990s.",
      "Microsoft declined to comment. Bloomberg News first reported about the investigation last week.",
      "The case will only move forward if President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the FTC decides to continue the investigation and take it to court. Some analysts are expecting a lighter approach to the tech industry under Trump, though incoming Vice President JD Vance has praised Khan's work.",
      "A number of other tech-related antitrust matters are also in play, including the Department of Justice's investigation into chipmaker Nvidia and its push to break up Google \u2014 possibly spinning off the Chrome web browser \u2014 after a federal judge ruled Google maintained an illegal monopoly for the last decade."

      "NEW YORK -- Just over a month after Ernst & Young resigned as its public accounting firm, Super Micro Computer says a review committee has found no evidence of fraud or misconduct among the server maker\u2019s leadership.",
      "Super Micro is also searching for a new chief financial officer and appointing other executives per recommendations from the committee, which began its review several months ago \u2014 after EY communicated concerns over issues like transparency, internal control related to financial reporting and integrity of management while conducting its first audit for the company.",
      "Additional information that emerged during this review eventually led EY to resign as Super Micro's public accountant in October. Super Micro, which disagreed with EY's decision, later appointed BDO as its new independent auditor last month.",
      "Super Micro announced that the committee, formed by the board as well as external counsel, completed its review on Monday. The company said that the conclusions EY laid out in its resignation \u201cwere not supported by the facts\u201d found in this probe \u2014 maintaining that there was no evidence of misconduct.",
      "As a result, Super Micro does not expect past financial reports to be restated. Shares for Super Micro climbed over 20% Monday morning.",
      "Beyond the findings of this review, Super Micro also laid out plans to appoint new leadership, which it says follow recommendations from the committee. Super Micro disclosed that it has begun looking for a new CFO, with David Weigand continuing in the role until the board names a successor. The company also said it would be \u201caccelerating its search\u201d for a chief compliance officer and for a general counsel.",

      "It's been a tumultuous year for Super Micro \u2014 and EY's resignation wasn't the first time its accounting practices have come into question. Back in August, short-selling firm Hindenburg Research released a report alleging ample accounting manipulation at the company, pointing to \u201cglaring accounting red flags\u201d and evidence of undisclosed transactions. It also accused Super Micro of rehiring top executives that were directly involved in a 2018 scandal. At the time, Super Micro said it would not comment \u201con rumors and speculation.\u201d",
      "Following these accusations, The Wall Street Journal and others reported that the Justice Department was beginning a probe into Super Micro, citing people familiar with the matter.",
      "Super Micro has been among tech companies recently riding a the artificial intelligence wave. In August, Super Micro reported fourth-quarter revenue of $5.31 billion, a more than 143% increase over the $2.18 billion it reported in the same quarter of 2023."

    "story": [
      "Scientists and culture experts in New Zealand have begun the first-ever dissection of a spade-toothed whale, the world's rarest whale species",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- It is the world\u2019s rarest whale, with only seven of its kind ever spotted. Almost nothing is known about the enigmatic species. But on Monday a small group of scientists and cultural experts in New Zealand clustered around a near-perfectly preserved spade-toothed whale hoping to decode decades of mystery.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how extraordinary it is,\u201d said a joyful Anton van Helden, senior marine science adviser for New Zealand\u2019s conservation agency, who gave the spade-toothed whale its name to distinguish it from other beaked species. \u201cFor me personally, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Van Helden has studied beaked whales for 35 years, but Monday was the first time he has participated in a dissection of the spade-toothed variety. In fact, the careful study of the creature -- which washed up dead on a New Zealand beach in July \u2014 is the first ever to take place.",
      "None has ever been seen alive at sea.",
      "The list of what scientists don\u2019t know about spade-toothed whales is longer than what they do know. They don\u2019t know where in the ocean the whales live, why they\u2019ve never been spotted in the wild, or what their brains look like. All beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers don\u2019t know how the spade-toothed kind processes its food. They don\u2019t know how this one died.",
      "Over the next week, researchers studying the 5-meter (16-foot) -long male at an agricultural research center near the city of Dunedin hope to find out.",
      "\u201cThere may be parasites completely new to science that just live in this whale,\u201d said van Helden, who thrilled at the chance of learning how the species produces sound and what it eats. \u201cWho knows what we\u2019ll discover?\u201d",
      "Only six other spade-toothed whales have ever been found, but all those discovered intact were buried before DNA testing could verify their identification.",
      "New Zealand is a whale-stranding hotspot, with more than 5,000 episodes recorded since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation. The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand\u2019s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile\u2019s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986.",
      "DNA sequencing in 2002 proved that all three specimens were of the same species \u2014 and that it was distinct from other beaked whales. But researchers studying the mammal couldn\u2019t confirm whether the species was extinct until 2010, when two whole spade-toothed whales, both dead, washed up on a New Zealand beach. But none has been studied before.",
      "On Monday, the seventh of its kind, surrounded by white-aproned scientists who were measuring and photographing, appeared relatively unblemished, giving no clue about its death. Researchers pointed out marks from cookiecutter sharks \u2014 normal, they said, and not the cause.",
      "The dissection will be quiet, methodical and slower than usual, because it is being undertaken in partnership with M\u0101ori, New Zealand's Indigenous people. To M\u0101ori, whales are a taonga -\u2013 a precious treasure -\u2013 and the creature will be treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor.",
      "Members of the local iwi, or tribe, will be present throughout the dissection and consulted at each turn, allowing them to share traditional knowledge and observe customs, such as saying a karakia -\u2013 a prayer -\u2013 over the creature before the study begins.",
      "\u201cAccording to our beliefs and our traditions, this whale is a gift of Tangaroa, deity of the ocean,\u201d said Tumai Cassidy from the local people Te R\u016bnanga \u014ct\u0101kou. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for us to respect that gift and to honor the whale.\u201d",
      "The iwi will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale at the end of the dissection, before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts, using a CT scan taken of the whale\u2019s head this week.",
      "\u201cIt all builds a richer picture for that species but also tells us how it interacts with our oceans,\u201d Cassidy said.",
      "It\u2019s thought that spade-toothed whales live in the vast Southern Pacific Ocean, home to some of the world\u2019s deepest ocean trenches. Beaked whales are the ocean's deepest divers for food, and the spade-toothed may rarely surface, adding to its mystery.",
      "The assembled scientists on Monday included a few who had traveled from abroad to see the whale, which was put in refrigerated storage after its discovery.",
      "\u201cWhat we are interested in is not only how these animals died, but how they lived,\u201d said Joy Reidenberg, a comparative anatomist from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. \u201cIn discovering how they live, we are hoping to find discoveries that we can apply back to the human condition.\u201d"

      "DOVER, Del. -- A Delaware judge has reaffirmed her ruling that Tesla must revoke Elon Musk\u2019s multibillion-dollar pay package",
      "Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick on Monday denied a request by attorneys for Musk and Tesla\u2019s corporate directors to vacate her ruling earlier this year requiring the company to rescind the unprecedented pay package.",
      "McCormick also rejected an equally unprecedented and massive fee request by plaintiff attorneys, who argued that they were entitled to legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $5 billion. The judge said the attorneys were entitled to a fee award of $345 million.",
      "The rulings came in a lawsuit filed by a Tesla stockholder who challenged Musk\u2019s 2018 compensation package.",
      "McCormick concluded in January that Musk engineered the landmark pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent. The compensation package initially carried a potential maximum value of about $56 billion, but that sum has fluctuated over the years based on Tesla\u2019s stock price.",
      "Following the original court ruling, Tesla shareholders met in June and ratified Musk\u2019s 2018 pay package for a second time, again by an overwhelming margin.",
      "Defense attorneys then argued that the second vote makes clear that Tesla shareholders, with full knowledge of the flaws in the 2018 process that McCormick pointed out, were adamant that Musk is entitled to the pay package. They asked the judge to vacate her order directing Tesla to rescind the pay package.",
      "McCormick, who seemed skeptical of the defense arguments during an August hearing, said in Monday\u2019s ruling that those arguments were fatally flawed.",
      "\u201cThe large and talented group of defense firms got creative with the ratification argument, but their unprecedented theories go against multiple strains of settled law,\u201d McCormick wrote in a 103-page opinion.",
      "The judge noted, among other things, that a stockholder vote standing alone cannot ratify a conflicted-controller transaction.",
      "\u201cEven if a stockholder vote could have a ratifying effect, it could not do so here due to multiple, material misstatements in the proxy statement,\u201d she added.",
      "Musk expressed his disagreement with the ruling in a post on X, the social media platform he owns. \u201cShareholders should control company votes, not judges,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Meanwhile, McCormick found that the $5.6 billion fee request by the shareholder\u2019s attorneys, which at one time approached $7 billion based on Tesla\u2019s trading price, went too far.",
      "\u201cIn a case about excessive compensation, that was a bold ask,\u201d McCormick wrote.",
      "Attorneys for the Tesla shareholder argue that their work resulted in the \u201cmassive\u201d benefit of returning shares to Tesla that otherwise would have gone to Musk and diluted the stock held by other Tesla investors. They value that benefit at $51.4 billion, using the difference between the stock price at the time of McCormick\u2019s January ruling and the strike price of some 304 million stock options granted to Musk.",
      "While finding that the methodology used to calculate the fee request was sound, the judge noted that the Delaware\u2019s Supreme Court has noted that fee award guidelines \u201cmust yield to the greater policy concern of preventing windfalls to counsel.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fee award here must yield in this way, because $5.6 billion is a windfall no matter the methodology used to justify it,\u201d McCormick wrote. A fee award of $345 million, she said, was \u201can appropriate sum to reward a total victory.\u201d",
      "The fee award amounts to almost exactly half the current record $688 million  in legal fees awarded in 2008 in litigation stemming from the collapse of Enron."

      "Two company executives, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, will act as interim co-CEOs while the company searches for a replacement for Gelsinger, who also stepped down from the company's board.",
      "The departure of Gelsinger, whose career spanned more than 40 years, underscores the turmoil at Intel. The company was once a dominant force in the semiconductor industry but has been eclipsed by rival Nvidia, which has cornered the market for chips that run artificial intelligence systems.",
      "Gelsinger started at Intel in 1979 and was its first chief technology officer. He returned to the company as chief executive in 2021.",
      "Gelsinger said his exit was \u201cbittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI can look back with pride at all that we have accomplished together. It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics.\u201d",
      "Zinsner is executive vice president and chief financial officer at Intel. Holthaus was appointed to the newly created position of CEO of Intel Products, which includes the client computing, data center and AI groups.",
      "Frank Yeary, independent chair of Intel's board, will become interim executive chair.",
      "\u201cPat spent his formative years at Intel, then returned at a critical time for the company in 2021,\u201d Yeary said in a statement. \"As a leader, Pat helped launch and revitalize process manufacturing by investing in state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing, while working tirelessly to drive innovation throughout the company.\u201d",
      "Gelsinger's departure comes as Intel\u2019s financial woes have been piling up. The company posted a $16.6 billion loss and halted its dividend in the most recent quarter, and its shares have fallen by about 60% since he took over as CEO. Gelsinger announced plans in August to slash 15% of its huge workforce \u2014 or about 15,000 jobs \u2014 as part of cost-cutting efforts to to save $10 billion in 2025.",
      "Nvidia\u2019s ascendance, meanwhile, was cemented earlier this month when it replaced Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.",
      "Unlike some of rivals, Intel manufactures chips in addition to designing them. Under Gelsinger, the company has been working to build up its foundry business making semiconductors in the U.S. designed by other firms, in a bid to compete with rivals such as market leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. or TSMC.",
      "Intel has benefited from tens of billions of dollars that the administration has pledged to support construction of U.S. chip foundries and reduce reliance on Asian suppliers, which Washington sees as a security weakness.",
      "After taking over as CEO, Gelsinger unveiled plans to build a $20 billion chipmaking facility in central Ohio, and poured billions more into expanding in Europe, where leaders were also worried about dependence on Asia.",
      "The Biden administration had said it would give Intel up to $8.5 billion in federal funding for semiconductor plants around the country, but last week it trimmed that amount, according to three people familiar with the grant who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Shares of the Santa Clara, California, company jumped in early trading Monday but ended the day down 0.5%.",

      "Closing arguments have begun in the trial of a tech consultant in the stabbing death of Cash App founder Bob Lee in San Francisco last year",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Closing arguments began on Monday in the trial of a tech consultant in the 2023 stabbing death of Cash App founder Bob Lee in San Francisco, an event that shocked the broader tech community whose members mourned the loss of an entrepreneur they called charismatic and kind.",
      "San Francisco prosecutors say Nima Momeni stabbed Lee three times after hearing that Lee's drug dealer friend plied Momeni's younger sister with GHB and other drugs and sexually assaulted her.",
      "\u201cOne person called 911 pleading for help, saying somebody stabbed me,\u201d said Dane Reinstedt, assistant district attorney, adding that the other person never called police or told anyone what happened that night until the trial.",
      "Defense attorneys will make their closing arguments Tuesday in a trial that started Oct. 14. Prosecutors will then have a chance to respond to the defense\u2019s closing.",
      "Defense attorneys say Lee, 43, was on a multi-day drug bender of cocaine and ketamine that made him agitated and violent, and that he attacked the defendant with a knife. They said Momeni was forced to use his Krav Maga martial arts skills in the early morning hours of April 4, 2023, after making a \u201c bad joke \u2033 that upset Lee \u2014 and did not realize he had stabbed him.",
      "Momeni faces 26 years to life if convicted of murder. He has pleaded not guilty in a case so high profile that San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins stepped into the room Monday for part of the closing.",
      "The trial has been emotionally taxing for family members of both men. Mahnaz Tayarani, mother of the defendant, has sat on one side of the court room while Lee\u2019s father, brother and ex-wife sat on the other.",
      "The prosecution on Monday started its closing argument with a 911 call in which Lee could be heard asking repeatedly for help. Lee's ex-wife, Krista Lee, cradled her daughter Scout as the 16-year-old wept on her mother's shoulder. They left the room. The Lees have two children.",
      "Reinstedt on Monday mocked Momeni\u2019s defense as he walked jurors through weeks of evidence.",
      "He said Momeni was furious with Lee for introducing Khazar Momeni, with whom he was friends, to a drug dealer who gave her GHB, known as a date-rape drug, hours before the stabbing. They say Momeni grilled Lee earlier in the evening about what happened to his sister at the drug dealer\u2019s apartment and sent text messages saying that the two men were creeps and sexual predators.",
      "Then, Momeni met up with Lee at his sister\u2019s condo, took a paring knife from her kitchen set, drove Lee to a secluded area by the Bay Bridge and stabbed him three times, Reinstedt said.",
      "\u201cThat protectiveness of the defendant\u2019s little sister is what led to all of this,\u201d Reinstedt said.",
      "Surveillance video shows the two men leaving the posh condo of Khazar Momeni around 2 a.m. and getting into Momeni\u2019s BMW. Other surveillance then shows them getting out of the car in an isolated section of the city by the Bay Bridge.",
      "Momeni testified he stopped his car after going over a pothole that caused Lee to spill the beer he was holding. Momeni said he then cracked a joke suggesting Lee should spend his last night visiting the city with family instead of trying to find a strip club to keep the party going.",
      "That\u2019s when Lee suddenly pulled a knife out of his jacket pocket, Momeni said. He said Lee later walked away, showing no signs he was injured.",
      "\u201cI was scared for my life,\u201d Momeni said in earlier testimony that was at times rambling and contentious.",
      "Reinstedt said Momeni's story made no sense given Lee's peaceful nature. He said Momeni never called police to report Lee's alleged attack or even after he learned Lee had died of stab wounds on the street where he had last seen him.",
      "The prosecutor said the puncture wounds were clean, clear and deep, and not the result of any kind of self-defense tussle, he said. Just about all of the DNA \u2014 99% \u2014 found on the handle of the knife belonged to Momeni, the prosecutor said.",
      "Video of the two men by the bridge is grainy, but Reinstedt said it clearly showed Momeni's figure lunging repeatedly at Lee. There was no deflecting and redirecting of any knife in Lee's hand, he said.",
      "Reinstedt also showed video of Momeni and Lee leaving the condo, Lee's jacket flapping to show there was no knife hidden inside.",
      "Lee was found staggering on a deserted downtown San Francisco street at 2:30 a.m., dripping a trail of blood and calling for help. He later died at a hospital.",
      "Lee\u2019s death stunned the tech community as fellow executives and engineers penned tributes to his generosity and brilliance. He was chief product officer of cryptocurrency platform MobileCoin when he died."

    "story": [
      "Positioned along the seismically active Ring of Fire, Indonesia and the Philippines have the second and third highest installed geothermal energy capacity in the world, after the United States",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Providing round-the-clock energy, using minimal space and considered a clean source of power \u2014 geothermal energy seems like an ideal option for countries like Indonesia and the Philippines, where the potential is high, and governments are seeking to transition away from highly polluting fossil fuels.",
      "Yet most of the potential of geothermal energy, created by harnessing heat produced by the earth from underground reservoirs of hot water to power turbines that generate electricity, remains untapped in these countries and across the world \u2014 as financial, regulatory and community roadblocks have stalled growth.",
      "More readily available financing and domestic regulatory changes are starting to address these barriers, but experts say more should be done to unlock the vast clean energy source trapped just beneath the Earth\u2019s surface.",
      "Countries with high geothermal potential \u2014 such as the United States, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 are usually located close to tectonically active regions where hot water or steam is naturally carried to the Earth\u2019s surface through volcanic activity, or can be accessed by shallow drilling.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re essentially standing on our own sun, which we can get clean, reliable energy from,\u201d said Marit Brommer, CEO of the International Geothermal Association based in Germany.",
      "Experts also laud geothermal plants for their ability to operate continuously to meet the minimum level of power demanded around-the-clock, unaffected by weather, with long lifespans and minimal maintenance.",
      "As countries shift towards renewable and cleaner energy, geothermal use is expected to grow: In Southeast Asia, geothermal power generation is expected to increase tenfold from 2020 to 2050, reaching 276 million megawatt-hours, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "With their steaming volcanoes and bubbling lakes, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 two archipelagic Southeast Asian countries located on the seismically active \u201cRing of Fire\u201d \u2014 are the second and third-largest users of geothermal energy in the world, with some of the highest geothermal energy potential. The U.S. is number one.",
      "Yet Indonesia uses less a tenth of its gargantuan reserves, making up 6% of its power supply. In the Philippines, about 8% of geothermal capacity has been developed, constituting 14.6% of the country's energy use, the country's largest source of renewable energy.",
      "Both countries plan to expand use of geothermal energy as they transition away from fossil fuels: Indonesia aims to increase the share of geothermal power generation by at least 8% by 2030, making it the second-largest renewable energy source after hydropower. The Philippine government is targeting several projects to boost geothermal capacity by adding nearly 1.5 gigawatts, nearly doubling its current use.",
      "But the exploratory stage of geothermal development \u2014 when companies do tests and drilling to confirm the size, temperature, pressure, and potential production rates of sites \u2014 is expensive and risky. That makes it hard to attract finance for development, said Shigeru Yamamura, an energy specialist at the Asia Development Bank.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the most difficult part of developers, because (financially) they cannot take 100% of the exploration risk themselves,\u201d Yamamura told The Associated Press.",
      "Climate finance for geothermal development is limited for most Southeast Asian nations, accounting for only 9% of finance available for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \u2014 a political and economic bloc of ten states in the region, which includes Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "A 2024 ASEAN energy report said \u201cblended finance\u201d using both public and private sources, grants and green bonds could help bridge the gap.",
      "The Philippine government has announced green energy auction schemes for geothermal energy and is preparing a \u201csmart green grid plan\u201d that prioritizes renewable energy \u2014 vital to enable private developers to get financing from banks. This signals progress in policy support for investment, Yamamura said.",
      "Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has focused on geothermal as part of the country's energy transition. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources says it's working to shorten permitting times and considering ways to increase rates of return on investments in geothermal projects. The state electric utility, Perusahaan Listrik Negara, also said it's committed to ramping up geothermal energy development.",
      "The World Bank is providing a $150 million loan to scale up Indonesian investments in geothermal energy by reducing the risks of early-stage exploration. The Green Climate Fund and the Clean Technology Fund are providing a $127.5 million.",
      "Even when finance is secured, community pushback can slow development.",
      "In Indonesia, residents of villages have protested projects, citing safety and environmental concerns: Several geothermal sites in Indonesia have had deadly gas leaks in the past five years.",
      "Some Indonesian communities don't understand what geothermal energy is and how they could benefit from its development, said Timothy Ravis, a doctoral student in global development at Cornell University.",
      "Protests at geothermal sites in the Philippines have led at least one company to pay royalties to Indigenous groups worried about land degradation caused by geothermal development.",
      "Governments and businesses should work to gain the consent of communities near projects to help ensure they succeed, said Brommer.",
      "\u201cWe need to show that this development benefits all people, not just a company,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's not about being a good neighbor, it's about being the best neighbor and really working with communities to respect their concerns.\"",

    "story": [
      "Ultra low-cost online retailers Temu and Shein are giving Western retailers a run for their money this holiday shopping season",
      "Shopping on Temu can feel like playing an arcade game. Instead of using a joystick-controlled claw to grab a toy, visitors to the online marketplace maneuver their computer mouses or cellphone screens to browse colorful gadgets, accessories and trinkets with prices that look too good to refuse.",
      "A pop-up spinning wheel offers the chance to win a coupon. Rotating captions warn that a less than $2 camouflage print balaclava and a $1.23 skeleton hand back scratcher are \u201cAlmost sold out.\u201d A flame symbol indicates a $9.69 plush cat print hoodie is selling fast. A timed-down selection of discounted items adds to the sense of urgency.",
      "Welcome to the new online world of impulse buying, a place of guilty pleasures where the selection is vast, every day is Cyber Monday, and an instant dopamine hit that will have faded by the time your package arrives is always just a click away.",
      "By all accounts, we\u2019re living in an accelerating age for consumerism, one that Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein, its fierce rival, supercharged with social media savvy and an interminable assortment of cheap goods, most shipped directly from merchants in China based on real-time demand.",
      "The business models of the two platforms, coupled with avalanches of digital or influencer advertising, have enabled them to give Western retailers a run for their money this holiday shopping season.",
      "Software company Salesforce said it expects roughly one in five online purchases in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada to be made through four online marketplaces based or founded in Asia: Shein, Temu, TikTok Shop - the e-commerce arm of video-sharing platform TikTok - and AliExpress.",
      "Analysts with Salesforce said they are expected to pull in roughly $160 billion in global sales outside of China. Most of the sales will go to Temu and Shein, a privately held company which is thought to lead the worldwide fast fashion market in revenue.",
      "Lisa Xiaoli Neville, a nonprofit manager who lives in Los Angeles, is sold on Shein. The bedroom of her home is stocked with jeans, shoes, press-on nails and other items from the ultra-fast fashion retailer, all of which she amassed after getting on the platform to purchase a $2 pair of earrings she saw in a Facebook ad.",
      "Neville, 46, estimates she spends at least $75 a month on products from Shein. A $2 eggshell opener, a portable apple peeler and an apple corer - both costing less than $5 - are among the quirky, single-use kitchen tools taking up drawer space. She acknowledges she doesn\u2019t need them because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t even cook like that.\u201d Plus, she\u2019s allergic to apples.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t eat apples. It will kill me,\u201d Neville said, laughing. \u201cBut I still want the coring thing.\u201d",
      "Shein, now based in Singapore, uses some of the same web design features as Temu\u2019s, such as pop-up coupons and ads, to persuade shoppers to keep clicking, but it appears a bit more restrained in its approach.",
      "Shein primarily targets young women through partnerships with social media influencers. Searching the company's name on video platforms turns up creators promoting Shein's Black Friday sales event and displaying the dozens of of trendy clothes and accessories they got for comparatively little money.",
      "But the Shein-focused content also includes videos of TikTokers saying they're embarrassed to admit they shopped there and critics lashing out at fans for not taking into account the environmental harms or potential labor abuses associated with products that are churned out and shipped worldwide at a speedy pace.",
      "Neville has already picked out holiday gifts for family and friends from the site. Most of the products in her online cart cost under $10, including graphic T-shirts she intends to buy for her son and jeans and loafers for her daughter. All told, she plans to spend about $200 on gifts, significantly less than $500 she used to shell out at other stores in prior years.",
      "\u201cThe visuals just make you want to spend more money,\u201d she said, referring to the clothes on Shein's site. \u201cThey're very cheap and everything is just so cute.\u201d",
      "Unlike Shein, Temu's appeal cuts across age groups and gender. The platform is the world\u2019s second most-visited online shopping site, software company Similarweb reported in September. Customers go there looking for practical items like doormats and silly products like a whiskey flask shaped like a vintage cellphone from the 1990s.",
      "Temu advertised Black Friday bargains for some items at upwards of 70% off the recommended retail price. Making a purchase can quickly result in receiving dozens of emails offering free giveaways. The caveat: customers have to buy more products.",
      "Ellen Flowers, 36, a lifestyle blogger who lives in Dallas, recently decided to pair a $3,500 dining table with $25 dining chairs from Temu to save money. She's also purchased clothes from Temu. The quality or fit wasn't always always great, so Flowers donated some unwanted pieces to thrift stores to avoid paying return shipping fees that would cost almost as much as the clothes.",
      "Flowers planned to buy stocking stuffers on Temu as well as baubles for an ornament-swapping party in early December. She also wanted to buy necklaces and bracelets for an activity at her 5-year-old niece's upcoming birthday party.",
      "\u201cI love buying my nieces presents,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cSince they\u2019re young, they don\u2019t need the Louis Vuitton handbag. I can give them a cute handbag from Temu. Then they\u2019ll lose interest in a month and I\u2019ll buy them another one.\u201d",
      "Despite their rise, Temu and Shein have proven particularly ripe for pushback. Last year, a coalition of unnamed brands and organizations launched a campaign to oppose Shein in Washington. U.S. lawmakers also have raised the possibility that Temu is allowing goods made with forced labor to enter the country.",
      "More recently, the Biden administration put forward rules that would crack down on a trade rule known as the de minimis exception, which has allowed a lot of cheap products to come into the U.S. duty-free. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to slap high tariffs on goods from China, a move that would likely raise prices and across the retail world.",
      "Both Shein and Temu have set up warehouses in the U.S. to speed up delivery times and help them better compete with Amazon, which is trying to erode their price advantage through a new storefront that also ships products directly from China.",
      "Meanwhile, Temu is onboarding Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that would allow the company to not be as exposed to changes around the de minimus trade rule, said Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse.",
      "The change comes as both Shein and Temu are attempting to expand beyond the bargain-hungry shoppers who popularized their platforms. Temu is allowing sellers to ship products to customers from local U.S. warehouses and says the move will allow it to sell larger items like furniture as it expands its selection of big-ticket items.",
      "Meanwhile, American children's clothing retailer The Children\u2019s Place signed a deal last month to distribute its products through Shein\u2019s platform. Last year, Shein went into business with women's fashion retailer Forever 21. It has been working to recruit other brands and reportedly has hopes of getting listed on the London Stock Exchange."

      "\"If President Yoon does not step down immediately, we will immediately begin impeachment proceedings in accordance with the will of the people,\" the opposition Democratic Party said in a statement. \"We will fight to the end together with all the people to protect the democracy and constitutional order of the Republic of Korea.\"",
      "The president said as he declared martial law that the measure would be necessary due to the actions of the Democratic Party, a liberal coalition that Yoon accused of controlling parliament, sympathizing with North Korea and paralyzing the government.",
      "The declaration included banning political activities, including rallies and protests. Yoon also called for a stop to the \"dissemination of fake news\" and the manipulation of public opinion. All press would have been controlled by the state under the declaration.",
      "The move sparked protests and -- just hours after the declaration -- the National Assembly voted early Wednesday morning local time to demand that the president lift the martial law order. A majority of parliament voted to lift the decree requiring that it then be lifted, under the South Korean constitution.",
      "Following the National Assembly's vote, Yoon said he withdrew the troops that had been deployed to carry out martial law and \"will lift martial law as soon as we have a quorum in the cabinet.\"",

      "China likely stole information from more than 1 million customers.",
      "A recently discovered Chinese hacking and espionage campaign scooped up data on hundreds of thousands of American mobile phone users, likely stealing information about more than 1 million customers, ABC News has learned.",
      "Sources familiar with the investigation gave ABC News a detailed sense of the vast scope of what U.S. officials are calling a major intelligence gathering operation by China, exploiting weaknesses in the communications networks of the nation's top telecommunications companies.",
      "In a briefing on Tuesday, FBI and Homeland Security's cyber officials said that the Chinese were able to steal a \"large amount of data\" -- officially acknowledging for the first time that China was able to determine who thousands of mobile phone users were talking to, when they spoke and where they were communicating from.",
      "China initially appeared to have focused on a huge swath of mobile phone users in the national capital region. The people who briefed ABC News declined to provide numbers, but ABC News was able get more detailed information through a number of interviews.",
      "The Chinese hackers were then able to narrow their focus and zero in on the specific communications of a smaller number of important, high profile Americans and, in some cases, China was able to obtain audio calls from that smaller group of victims and review their text messages.",
      "ABC News has learned that among those targeted were some top government officials in the Biden administration, with sources telling ABC News this includes at least one cabinet secretary and a top White House Homeland Security Adviser.",
      "Although it is not clear how deep the spying went on specific targets, sources tell ABC News that a number of those high ranking government officials and high profile Americans have been informed that they were potential victims.",
      "ABC News has previously reported that President-elect Donald Trump, Vice President-elect JD Vance, some staff of Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, one of Trump\u2019s defense attorneys, Todd Blanche, and leaders in both political campaigns were targeted.",
      "Officials in the Tuesday briefing admitted they cannot say with certainty that China hackers have been fully kicked out of these telecommunications networks and acknowledged they are still trying to understand the scope of this activity.",
      "Multiple sources have warned that the scope and scale of the operation continues to widen, with one official telling ABC News that this is not over.",
      "The investigation has revealed that China\u2019s campaign exploited U.S. computer routers serving telecom corporations, giving them the gateway to the phone numbers of significant numbers of customers of Verizon, AT&T, Lumen Technologies and other telecommunications companies.",
      "ABC News previously reported that the operation had gone undetected for many months, and was perhaps carried on for more than a year.",
      "A recent statement by FBI and Homeland Security officials also revealed that China also got access to some data about some sensitive warrants the Department of Justice has been pursuing, with sources telling ABC News that there is a fear of China using the data to figure out some of the people who federal authorities are investigating and, in some cases, monitoring.",
      "Much of the Tuesday briefing centered on how Chinese hackers compromised the system by exploiting existing basic gaps in security and confirmed that federal authorities have given industry leaders a list of remedies to detect and prevent ongoing attacks as well as recommendations on how to root the hackers out.",

      "\"The story of Angola and the United States holds a lesson for the world: two nations with a shared history in evil of human bondage, two nations on opposite sides of the Cold War defining struggle in the late part of the 20th century,\" Biden said. \"And now two nations standing shoulder to shoulder, working together every day for the mutual benefit of our people.\"",
      "\"It's a reminder that no nation need be permanently the adversary of another testament to the human capacity for reconciliation and proof that from every -- from the horrors of slavery and war, there is a way forward,\" Biden added.",

      "As President-elect Donald Trump fills out his Cabinet and chooses his closet advisers ahead of Inauguration Day, many African American leaders are asking why more Black people haven't been appointed to key positions.",
      "ABC News spoke to more than a half dozen longtime and new African American conservatives and Republicans within Trumpworld, in and outside of Washington.",
      "Last month, the president-elect appointed Scott Turner, who was executive director of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council during Trump's first term, to serve as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
      "One area of frustration for many Black Republicans was speculation that if Trump did nominate an African American to his administration, it would be at HUD, the department that has had the most Black secretary appointments of any.",
      "One Black Southern Republican told ABC News, \"Why is every Black person given HUD?\" adding that it was \"the literal Black job of the administration.\"",
      "ABC News reached out to Trump\u2019s transition team for comment on his selections but did not get a reply.",
      "Six African Americans have served as HUD secretaries, including Robert Weaver, the first. His appointment in 1966 by President Lyndon B. Johnson also made him the first African American appointed to a Cabinet-level position.",
      "The first African American woman to serve in a presidential cabinet was Patricia Roberts Harris, who was the first African American Health and Human Services director and later HUD secretary. She served under President Jimmy Carter.",
      "Former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce was the only Black Cabinet official in the Ronald Reagan administration. Dr. Ben Carson at HUD was Trump's sole Black cabinet member in his first term.",
      "In mid-November, Carson posted that he was \"excited to speak with President Trump about how I will continue to advance the America First agenda, and I am meeting with him in the near future.\"",
      "\"However, contrary to reports, I will not be serving as the Surgeon General,\" he said.",
      "The departments of Treasury and Interior remain the only departments that have never had a Black secretary.",
      "Another key position Black conservatives believe needs to be filled by an African American is assistant to the president, a senior-level role within the White House. Trump previously appointed Omarosa Manigault Newman, a contestant on his \"The Apprentice\" TV series, as the sole Black assistant to the president.",
      "\"I do think if you're really talking about Black influence inside the White House, does Trump want his only legacy of having the only AP for two terms be Omarosa?\" one Black Republican strategist asked.",
      "After Newman's departure, Ja'Ron Smith served as a special assistant on legislative affairs before rising to deputy assistant to the president for domestic policy. Ashley Bell, a prominent Black Republican, served as a White House adviser on entrepreneurship and a regional administrator for the Small Business Administration. Bell's former boss is former SBA Administrator Linda McMahon, who Trump announced as his pick for the Department of Education. McMahon also is co-chair of the Trump-Vance transition team.",
      "Some of the former president's most ardent defenders have grown restless with the lack of Black appointees, as Trump selected several others who would be firsts in those positions. If confirmed, Sen. Marco Rubio would be the first Hispanic secretary of state; Scott Bessent would be the first openly gay Treasury secretary; and Tulsi Gabbard will be the first Asian American and youngest-ever director of national intelligence.",
      "\"I can't tweet that we need more Black conservatives because the left will attack me saying it's a DEI hire,\" the southern Republican said.",
      "However, one Black Republican operative told ABC News it is still very early when it comes to appointments.",
      "\"The Republican Party has never really fallen into the category of 'representation matters.' Our strength comes from diversity, but that is not our bumper sticker slogan. We're not going to nominate Black folks for the sake of nominating Black people,\" the Republican operative said.",
      "The operative noted that Black Republicans have made strides in leadership across the country. Sen. Tim Scott will chair the National Republican Senatorial Committee; Rep. Byron Donald is speculated as possibly running for governor or U.S. Senate in Florida; and Winsome Sears is seeking to become the first Black female governor in the country in Virginia.",
      "Donalds on CNN last month took aim at President Joe Biden\u2019s focus on diversity within his administration when asked about the lack of diversity among Trump\u2019s nominees, saying \u201cif you look at how the Democrats filled Joe Biden's cabinet, they wanted to have a piece of every identity. But did they get the job done? Did they actually serve the interest of the American people?\"",
      "\"What Donald Trump's election is about, is bringing competency and reality back to D.C. in the White House, regardless of their race, regardless of their religion, regardless of their creed.\" the Florida congressman added.",
      "Although some Black leaders inside and out of politics are highly qualified, another barrier that Black conservatives face is added scrutiny because of their dual identity.",
      "Dedrick Asante-Muhammad, president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a non-partisan organization that studies diversity in government and congressional staff, said that the Trump administration differs vastly from past Republican administrations.",
      "\"Trump isn't a traditional Republican, he doesn't use traditional Republican institutions in the same way that past presidential candidates have, so there isn't a kind of pipeline, long-term relations,\" Asante-Muhammad said.",
      "\"Being a part of Trumpworld isn't easy. It is almost a personal blacklist thing in the outside world. So it is risky, in my opinion, to be a part of this organization for Black people that may want to be a part of the cause, but it's not worth their bottom dollar,\" one Black Republican strategist added.",
      "\"When Black people are put underneath this microscope of being Trump-affiliated, they look past your color and you are public enemy number one,\" a Black Republican operative said.",
      "The Republican strategist said Black Republicans face a different set of expectations -- they don't necessarily thrive in spaces that are massively disruptive, such as the second Trump term.",
      "\"I don't think disruption really leans into our skillset the way things are currently set up, we have to play things a little bit differently. There's no Black Republican version of Matt Gatez. They don't last,\" the strategist added.",
      "\"Those of us who have survived and been there for years and made it work have done so by being steady, consistent, reliable, and trustworthy, \" the strategist said.",
      "The majority of Black Republicans who spoke to ABC News acknowledged that while the optics of Trump being surrounded by mostly white people aren't ideal, they believe if Trump delivers on a better economy, securing the border, Second Step Act, and judicial reform it could be transformative for the Black community, but they do want the former president to hire more Black conservatives.",

    "summary": "The Democratic National Committee is hoping to highlight down-ballot successes last month as it hosts a key post-election meeting.",
    "story": [
      "DNC Chair Jaime Harrison said the election was a \"mixed bag.\"",
      "The Democratic National Committee is hoping to highlight down-ballot successes last month as it hosts a key post-election meeting and looks to turn the page from its stinging White House loss.",
      "DNC Chair Jaime Harrison wrote in a grassroots memo obtained first by ABC News that while Democrats fell short in the presidential race, beefy and historic investments in down-ballot contests offer a roadmap to success. The party was able to salvage four Senate races in states President-elect Donald Trump won and gain House seats despite headwinds at the top of the ticket.",
      "\"As we reflect on the cycle and take stock of where we fell short, it\u2019s equally important to assess what worked. Data shows that the work of the DNC and our partners was effective in beating back what could have been a larger red wave,\" Harrison wrote.",
      "\"In 2024, the DNC made strategic campaign grants in every state party for the first time in history, and delivered record-breaking investments directly to coordinated campaigns in every state -- totaling over $264 million,\" he added. \"These investments yielded results and underscore the importance of continued state party investment\u2026\"",
      "The memo marks the first public, thorough dissection by the DNC of the election results, in which Vice President Kamala Harris lost to Trump and Republicans flipped the Senate and kept the House of Representatives.",
      "The document paints a rosy portrait of a party that failed to keep the White House but won Senate races in Trump-won states like Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin, key House races in California and New York, and won a gubernatorial race in North Carolina, a state that has been a white whale for Democrats at the federal level.",
      "Harrison specifically writes that despite the disappointments, Trump was kept below 50% in the popular vote (he still won it), Democrats held Senate seats in states Trump won and cut into Republicans' House margin, and the party was successful in breaking some GOP state legislative majorities and holding on in certain chambers, including its one-seat majority in the Pennsylvania state House.",
      "The memo highlights DNC efforts in all those cases, including voter registration efforts, investments in key demographic groups in Senate races, efforts in New York and California to boost prospects in key House races there and money sent to traditionally noncompetitive states like Alaska and Arkansas to make state legislative gains.",
      "\"Notable down-ballot wins in 2024 provide us with a roadmap on what works and where investments mattered most,\" Harrison wrote.",
      "The memo is being released at the start of a meeting of the Association of State Democratic Committees, where state party leaders will gather to discuss what went right and wrong in November.",
      "The election is sparking a crowded race to lead the DNC, with Harrison not running for reelection as chair, and a broader party reckoning over its identity and whether it should be more centrist, populist, progressive or some combination of the three.",
      "In an interview, Harrison conceded the election was a \"mixed bag.\"",
      "\"Of course, we lost the most important election on that ticket, the presidential election, and I'm heartbroken over that,\" he said.",
      "\"But then when we start to look underneath that race and look into the battleground states, and what happened in other races, it's, again, a mixed bag. Donald Trump didn't have the coattails. It was not this landslide vote that many people wanted to say that it was on Election Day because Democrats still won in many of those battleground states.\"",
      "Harrison cited several reasons behind the \"mixed\" results.",
      "On the one hand, Harris faced a historically short runway after President Joe Biden left the race in July, combined with economic headwinds and a liberal media ecosystem that still struggles to match Republican heavyweights like Fox News. Trump, Harrison said, had emerged as a \"cultural\" figure over the course of nine years who was able to put together an expansive coalition.",
      "\"I think time definitely was a part of it,\" Harrison said. \"I thought that she was going to be become sort of a cultural figure. Just seeing the early energy, I need to tell you, man, just that convention alone, I felt like there was something turning. But it didn't go full circle. And that's something that we got to figure out. Why not? Did we change the message? What did we do in order not to have it go full circle?\"",
      "\"I don't know if we need to find our own Joe Rogan [the influential podcaster who interviewed then endorsed Trump days before the election], and I've heard that from a number of folks, but I think we need to make sure that we're in in all those spaces,\" he added of whether Democrats need to expand their media strategy in traditional and non-traditional outlets.",
      "Still, Harrison found positive signs in a state party infrastructure that Democrats had worked hard to revive after years of atrophy in recent years.",
      "\"We got to continue those investments. We can't go back to the post-Obama years in which we minimized the amount of resources that the DNC sent to state parties,\" he said. \"We are still trying to work our way back from that point in time. So, now, it's about focusing on continuing moving forward.\"",
      "Still, the meeting isn't taking place in a vacuum, and the present could get in the way of discussions about the future.",
      "Biden dropped a bombshell Sunday night when he announced that he was pardoning his son, Hunter, leading to a flood of Democratic criticism Monday over his intervention in Justice Department proceedings.",
      "However, Harrison said he believed that the ASDC meeting would stay on track.",
      "\"The president is a good man, he's a decent man, he's a just person, and he always tries to do the best thing, and this is, I believe, the best thing at this point in time,\" Harrison said. \"Almost to a person, the Democrats that I've talked to, grassroots activists, Democrats, are leading. This won't consume that.\"",

      "Republicans historically dislike broad federal regulation.",
      "Ever since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was picked by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, he has been vocal about his plans to \"Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "Kennedy has vowed to crack down on dyes in the food industry and to reduce pesticides in the farm and agriculture industry.",
      "He has called for restrictions on ultra-processed foods as part of an initiative to address the high rates of chronic disease in the United States, and he's said more research needs to be conducted on vaccines.",
      "Those plans could require him to override regulations set in place by the Food and Drug Administration or Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, and/or perhaps see new regulations put in place.",
      "Political science experts say this may put him at odds with members of his own party, because Republicans typically advocate for fewer regulations and limited government oversight.",
      "\"I think where you would see the challenges would be on allocation of money,\" Shana Gadarian, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University in New York, told ABC News.",
      "\"If all of a sudden HHS is now in the business of passing more regulations on the food industry, on agriculture, we might see that a Republican Senate majority and a Republican House is less interested in allocating a budget to HHS that then would be under a different leadership,\" she continued.",
      "Praise from other Republicans",
      "Despite Republican criticism of previous Democratic initiatives to tackle disease and childhood obesity, Kennedy has received praise from some Republicans.",
      "\"RFK Jr. has championed issues like healthy foods and the need for greater transparency in our public health infrastructure,\" Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana, said in a statement earlier this month. \"I look forward to learning more about his other policy positions and how they will support a conservative, pro-American agenda.\"",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin called Kennedy a \"brilliant, courageous truth-teller whose unwavering commitment to transparency will make America a healthier nation,\" and Sen. Josh Hawley called Trump's decision to name him to head the HHS a \"Bad day for Big Pharma!\"",
      "However, Gadarian said the support from some Republicans in the Senate may not translate to support among Republican constituents.",
      "\"We may want to separate what average people think about and know about [what Kennedy wants] and what elites in the party might have a vested interest in,\" Gadarian said.",
      "For farmers and others whose bottom lines might be negatively impacted by some of Kennedy's proposed top-down policies, she said, \"Those ideas of, like, removing pesticides from agriculture may actually be quite unpopular.\"",
      "Republicans' distaste for regulation",
      "Historically, the Republican party has been ideologically associated with a smaller, limited federal government.",
      "During his January 1981 inaugural address, President Ronald Reagan stated, \"Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem,\" espousing the belief that the government should not intervene in American lives.",
      "If Kennedy is confirmed, there may be some culling of regulations, such as the CDC decision on vaccines health insurers are required to cover, according to Gadarian.",
      "But his confirmation may also lead to new regulations; for example, he might weigh in on which food dyes companies are allowed to use or the use of pesticides on farms.",
      "While it isn't yet fully clear how Kennedy could make all of his proposed changes directly through his leadership at HHS, as opposed to the Environmental Protection Agency or Department of Agriculture, he has called for restrictions on food additives, dyes and ultra-processed foods \u2014 which he could have direct influence over through the FDA.",
      "Gadarian said this is not in line with the typical conservative view on regulations, which is to generally loosen them.",
      "\"I do think that increasing regulation on businesses like agriculture and others who use pesticides -- or on the food industry -- is, in fact, against a kind of idea of limited government, of loosening regulation so businesses can do business and not be encumbered by the federal government,\" she said.",
      "Robert Ravens-Seger, a professor of history and political science at American International College in Massachusetts, said he thinks the idea of Republicans being for \"small\" or \"limited government\" is a myth.",
      "He said both Republicans and Democrats want government regulation, but they have different views on how it should be implemented.",
      "\"Once you are in the government, your dislike for government tends to diminish somewhat,\" he told ABC News. \"I think that in a very short amount of time, you've seen a change in the Republican party. They've changed from being a party of small government [and] I think that the government that's going to be coming will be very heavy-handed.\"",
      "He added that he believes Kennedy could have an impact on the messaging around food and/or agriculture by advocating for consumers to buy what he says is safe and healthy. However, Ravens-Seger is not sure to what degree the impact will be.",
      "\"I definitely believe that he will have an impact on things like food additives, food safety, and the like,\" Ravens-Seger said. \"The food side, especially, goes against Republican orthodoxy and could make for some interesting debates, but the degree to which, on this issue in particular, he will find much support within the party seems doubtful.\"",
      "Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, said last month he wanted to meet with Kennedy before a confirmation hearing and \"educate\" him about agriculture, indicating concerns about views Kennedy has expressed.",
      "\"I'm willing to have a discussion with him and find out where he's coming from,\" Grassley told reporters, according to Politico. \"But I may have to spend a lot of time educating him about agriculture, and I'm willing to do that.\"",
      "Eitan Hersh, a professor of political science at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said it's important to remember that many steps need to occur before new regulations are put in place, including Kennedy being confirmed by the Senate, new regulations being proposed and approved, potential discussion in Congress and enforcement of those regulations.",

    "title": "What a 'deep state' investigation could look like if Kash Patel becomes FBI director",
    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 10:54:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Here's how Kash Patel, President-elect Trump's choice to lead the FBI, might try to make good on his pledge to rid the government of the so-called \"deep state.\"",
    "story": [
      "Here's how the Trump loyalist might try to eliminate the so-called \"deep state.\"",
      "Trump loyalist Kash Patel, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to become the next FBI director, has said the FBI's investigation of alleged ties between Trump or his associates and Russia, launched more than eight years ago, was such a massive \"criminal enterprise\" that it \"drowns Watergate.\"",
      "And he says the current and former U.S. officials who he claims orchestrated \"Russia Gate\" should be prosecuted, while \"thousands and thousands and thousands\" of government employees need to be fired for aiding the so-called \"deep state\" -- what conspiracy theorists claim is a cadre of career government employees working together to secretly manipulate policy, undermine elected leaders, and take down Trump.",
      "As a senior House investigator during part of Trump's first term, Patel helped direct the House Republicans' probe of the Russia investigation, which led to Patel joining the Trump administration in 2019.",
      "When Patel appeared on Trump ally Steve Bannon's podcast last December, Bannon asked him if -- as someone expected to take on a senior national security role in what they hoped would be Trump's next administration -- Patel was \"highly confident\" he could quickly deliver \"serious prosecutions and accountability\" for the \"evil deeds\" of the \"deep state.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Patel responded.",
      "It's unclear if comments like that reflect pre-election posturing or genuine intentions, especially considering that multiple official inquiries into \"Russia Gate\" have not supported the types of grand claims Patel and other Trump allies have made about it. But, if Patel becomes FBI director and actually launches such investigations, how would he conduct them, who would he target, and what type of \"accountability\" would he seek?",
      "Patel's media interviews, his other public statements, and a book that he published last year titled \"Government Gangsters\" -- which Trump praised as a \"roadmap to end the Deep State's reign\" -- offer potential clues.",
      "Patel spent several years as a prosecutor in the Justice Department's National Security Division before becoming a House investigator and then joining the Trump administration. In the final year of Trump's presidency, Patel was appointed acting deputy director of national intelligence -- the second-in-command of the entire U.S. intelligence community -- and then chief of staff to the acting U.S. defense secretary, a position critics claimed he was unqualified to hold.",
      "Of efforts to dig into \"Russia Gate,\" Patel said on his \"Kash's Corner\" podcast in July 2021, \"I would basically run this entire investigation as if it was a giant conspiracy.\"",
      "At the time, he had high hopes that a probe by special counsel John Durham, who was appointed under the first Trump administration to scrutinize the Russia investigation, would ultimately produce a wave of indictments.",
      "\"[It was] the greatest political fraud in American history,\" Patel said of the alleged conspiracy. \"No one person could pull this off alone. It's impossible.\"",
      "More recently, at a September Trump campaign rally in Las Vegas, Patel offered this summary of what he believes happened: In 2016, the Democratic Party \"illegally spen[t] campaign dollars to hire a foreign intelligence asset from overseas and funnel fake, false information into the Federal Bureau of Investigation, only to have them go to a secret surveillance court, lie to a federal judge, just so that they could illegally surveil their political opponent,\" he said.",
      "But that's not what happened, according to Durham's final report, as well as a separate report from the Justice Department's inspector general and other publicly-released government records.",
      "In July 2016, based on uncorroborated information the FBI received suggesting Russia might try to help Trump win the 2016 election, the agency launched a wide-ranging investigation into whether Trump and his associates were working with Russia.",
      "Separately, a law firm working for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign hired a private investigator, former British spy Christopher Steele, to conduct opposition research on Trump, and Steele compiled a series of reports with shocking claims about Trump and his associates.",
      "When FBI officials in Washington -- already looking at Trump's associates -- then received those reports in September 2016, they asked a secret surveillance court for approval to eavesdrop on Trump adviser Carter Page. The FBI officials heavily relied on Christopher Steele's reports in their applications to obtain that approval. According to Durham, the FBI came to learn after its first application was approved that much of Steele's information originated from a Russian national who either fabricated it or passed it on from a former Democratic staffer.",
      "In his final report on the matter, Durham blasted the FBI for using \"unvetted and unverified\" information to open a \"full investigation\" and to repeatedly obtain approval for intrusive surveillance of Page. Durham said \"senior FBI personnel\" and federal prosecutors \"displayed a serious lack of analytical rigor\" toward the allegations they received, and they failed to sufficiently disclose contrary information when they learned it.",
      "But Durham also said his investigation didn't find evidence proving that any FBI official \"intentionally\" tried to \"falsely accuse Trump of improper ties to Russia,\" or intentionally sought to provide inaccurate information to the surveillance court.",
      "\"[T]he Office was unable to establish that any government officials acted with a criminal intent to violate the law, as opposed to mere negligence or recklessness,\" Durham wrote in his final report.",
      "Through its own investigation, the Justice Department's inspector concluded that while there were \"fundamental errors\" and significant \"failures\" in the FBI probe, the investigation itself was reasonably opened based on the information the FBI had received.",
      "Still, Patel has repeatedly insisted that \"laws were broken,\" as he said during a podcast in August 2021.",
      "\"And the evidence is there,\" he claimed, without providing specifics.",
      "Over the past few years, Patel has provided varying numbers regarding how many people he claims may have committed crimes related to the Russia probe.",
      "In some interviews, he's suggested there's only a handful. In other interviews, he's said as many as 20 people -- inside and outside of government -- need to be scrutinized.",
      "In an interview two months ago, Patel insisted he doesn't \"have a hit list\" of people he would target. But spread across his many interviews, he has repeatedly identified certain people by name.",
      "Current FBI Director Cristopher Wray, who was nominated by Trump at the start of his first administration and would now be replaced by Patel, has been frequently mentioned. So have former FBI Director James Comey, who Wray replaced after Trump fired him, and Comey's former deputy, Andy McCabe.",
      "McCabe \"basically orchestrated this entire thing for Comey,\" Patel claimed on a March 2022 podcast, regarding the Russia probe.",
      "Ex-FBI agent Peter Strzok and former FBI attorney Lisa Page, who exchanged personal text messages criticizing Trump as they worked on a major investigation related to him, \"broke the law\" and \"weaponized the system of justice against a political target they hated,\" Patel said on the Shawn Ryan podcast two months ago. Strzok was fired from the bureau in 2018 and subsequently reached a settlement with the Justice Department over his claims that his privacy rights were violated when his text messages were released.",
      "In its final report on the matter, the Justice Department's inspector general said it uncovered no evidence that \"political bias or improper motivation influenced\" the investigation of alleged ties between Trump or his associates and Russia.",
      "Still, in a June 2022 interview, Patel said, \"I would be able to bring cases against all of them.\"",
      "And, on his podcast in July 2021, Patel said that if he were in charge of the federal investigation, he would grant immunity to Lisa Page so she could testify against more than a dozen others he'd consider subpoenaing.",
      "In other interviews, Patel has said Steele and a slew of Obama administration officials -- including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former CIA Director John Brennan, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper -- potentially committed crimes, even though the multiple probes that reviewed the matter resulted in no charges against them.",
      "And in the interview two months ago, Patel said that several former Trump administration officials -- former Attorney General Bill Bar, former deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, former CIA Director Gina Haspel, former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, and former National Security Council staffer Fiona Hill -- might also deserve prosecution.",
      "\"I don't know that it ever gets to the level of treason singularly with any of them, but what you have is a build-up of so many actions by the deep state that it becomes borderline treasonous,\" he said of officials from both the Obama and Trump administrations.",
      "The multiple federal inquiries into \"Russia Gate\" have not produced evidence to support charges against any of those officials.",
      "Patel has also identified many others, including saying in a 2021 interview that Jake Sullivan, who was Hillary Clinton's foreign policy adviser during her 2016 campaign and now serves as President Joe Biden's national security adviser, \"has got problems as well,\" without offering any details.",
      "Appearing on ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday, Sullivan said he has \"50 days left to continue to try to protect this country from threats,\" and, \"I'm going to spend every day doing that and not worrying about other things.\"",
      "Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Clinton, Brennan, Clapper, Barr, Rosenstein, Haspel, Esper, Hill and Sullivan are all among 60 current and former officials identified in Patel's book as \"Members of the Executive Branch Deep State\" -- people who he called \"corrupt actors of the first order.\"",
      "Like Barr, Rosenstein, Haspel and Esper, nearly a third of the 60 were appointed to senior roles by Trump or members of his administration.",
      "\"[A]ll those who manipulated evidence, hid exculpatory information, or in any way abused their authority for political ends must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\" Patel wrote in his book.",
      "Many -- if not all -- of those referenced by Patel have denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Patel has also suggested that members of the media should be targeted for investigation.",
      "\"We will go out and find the conspirators not just in government but in the media,\" Patel said on Bannon's podcast last year. \"Yes, we're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens [and] who helped Joe Biden rig the presidential election, we're going to come after you.\"",
      "\"Whether it's criminally or civilly, we'll figure that out, but we're putting you all on notice,\" he added.",
      "Patel has suggested that prosecutors who bring such conspiracy cases need to be \"more creative.\"",
      "In 2021, Durham indicted attorney Michael Sussmann for allegedly lying to the FBI about Democrats' connections to the origins of Trump-related allegations he provided them, separately from Steele's reports. But when a jury in Washington, D.C., acquitted Sussmann a year later, Patel said on a podcast that Durham was \"too much by the book\" and \"too much of a straight arrow.\"",
      "Patel was particularly upset that Durham followed Justice Department guidelines in the case and filed charges where the central actions allegedly took place -- in \"liberal\" Washington, D.C.",
      "\"He has to get more creative,\" Patel said. A conspiracy case \"can be brought anywhere any part of the conspiracy occurred, so if some guy moved through southwest Utah for a split second, you can bring the whole case there,\" Patel claimed.",
      "When Durham then put Igor Danchenko, Steele's original source for the dossier allegations, on trial in Northern Virginia for allegedly lying about his role to the FBI, Patel predicted things would be \"entirely different\" there. But the jury in Virginia rejected a Durham case for the second time, acquitting Danchenko.",
      "Patel, in his book last year, nonetheless said the Justice Department must \"drastically curb\" the number of cases it prosecutes in Washington because it is \"perhaps the most liberal jurisdiction in America.\"",
      "Durham ultimately brought few indictments from his investigation. The only person successfully prosecuted was Kevin Clinesmith, who Patel once described as a \"medium-level attorney at the FBI\" and who altered an email supporting the final application for surveillance of Carter Page, eight months after the FBI began its surveillance. Clinesmith pleaded guilty to a false statement charge and was sentenced to a year's probation, with the judge saying that while the criminal conduct was serious, it did not necessarily alter the secret court's decision to approve further surveillance.",
      "Though Patel often says criminal investigations are a key part of seeking justice for the crimes of \"Russia Gate,\" he has also emphasized there are others way to help rid government of so-called \"Deep State\" actors.",
      "\"You walk in on Day 1 and you fire literally everyone that was part of that Deep State,\" he said to cheers at the conservative CPAC conference last year. \"It'll be thousands and thousands and thousands, and nobody has had the guts to do that. But President Trump will.\"",
      "In his book, Patel called for a \"comprehensive housecleaning\" at the Justice Department and a wholesale overhaul of the FBI, which he called \"the prime functionary of the Deep State.\"",
      "He wrote that \"unaccountable bad actors\" at the top of the FBI and other agencies are \"aided and abetted by staff in the government who are either in on the game or too afraid to speak up.\"",
      "Wray has pushed back against such claims for years, saying as early as Trump's first year in office that the FBI he knows \"is tens of thousands of brave men and women working as hard as they can to keep people they will never know safe from harm.\"",
      "At the CPAC event last year, Patel said \"the biggest scam in government\" is the assertion that career government employees can't be easily fired.",
      "\"There are ways to do it. Don't believe anybody that says, 'Oh, these guys are in for life,'\" he insisted.",
      "Speaking at another conservative event in October, just two weeks before the presidential election that would lead to his nomination as FBI director, Patel was even more blunt.",
      "\"We are on a mission to annihilate the deep state,\" he said.",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Dan Blue, a groundbreaking figure in North Carolina politics across more than 40 years, will no longer serve as leader of state Senate Democrats after over a decade and is being replaced by another Raleigh-area lawmaker.",
      "The Senate Democratic Caucus elected Sen. Sydney Batch as the minority leader entering the next two-year session, the caucus said in a news release Monday after it met privately.",
      "Batch, a family law attorney who first entered the General Assembly in 2019, succeeds Blue, who before the leadership election \u201cannounced his desire to decline another term\u201d as leader, the caucus release said.",
      "\u201cI am excited to pass the torch into the capable hands of Senator Batch,\u201d Blue said in the release. No details on the vote were released.",
      "Blue, 75, first joined the legislature in 1981 as a House member and 10 years later was elected North Carolina\u2019s first \u2014 and still only \u2014 Black House speaker. He held the position for four years until Republicans took over the chamber.",
      "He left the House following an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate in 2002. He returned to the House in 2006 and shifted to the Senate in 2009 \u2014 filling vacancies in both instances. In early 2014, Blue was elevated to the minority leader's post after then-Sen. Martin Nesbitt stepped aside due to an illness. Nesbitt died days later.",
      "As minority leader, Blue has been in the difficult position of finding ways to push back effectively against Republicans, who have held continuous control of the Senate since 2011. Through several years in the post \u2014 including most of 2023 and all of 2024 \u2014 the GOP has held veto-proof majorities in each General Assembly chamber.",
      "While referencing a \u201cnew chapter\u201d in caucus leadership, Batch praised Blue on Monday for \u201cbringing forth his many years of experience gained through a historic tenure in both chambers of the General Assembly to deliver results for the people of North Carolina.\u201d",
      "Blue, who was reelected to a Wake County Senate seat last month, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a text seeking comment.",
      "In the next two-year session starting in January, Republicans will continue to hold at least 30 of the 50 Senate seats. But barring changes in an unresolved district race, House Republicans will fall just short of veto-proof control in their chamber \u2014 giving more leverage to Democratic Gov.-elect Josh Stein and his legislative allies.",
      "Batch was first elected to the House in 2018 but lost a reelection bid two years later. In early 2021, she filled a Senate vacancy and was elected again in 2022 and last month. Batch is a breast cancer survivor who has spoken out on issues involving health care and support for abortion rights.",
      "Batch said the Democratic caucus \"remains focused on creating a North Carolina where every resident can build the life they want for their families and themselves, and we are ready to work to get North Carolina back on the right track.\u201d",
      "The Senate Democratic Caucus also on Monday reelected Sen. Jay Chaudhuri of Wake County as the minority whip.",

      "A judge\u2019s overturning of Wisconsin\u2019s 13-year-old law that effectively ended collective bargaining for teachers and most state government employees has rekindled a battle over labor rights in a state where the first public sector unions were formed 65 y...",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A judge's overturning of Wisconsin's 13-year-old law that effectively ended collective bargaining for teachers and most state government employees has rekindled a battle over labor rights in a state where the first public sector unions were formed 65 years ago.",
      "But before unions head back to the bargaining table, more legal fights await. Here are five things to know about the law, the current challenge and what happens next:",
      "At its core, the battle is over whether tens of thousands of teachers, nurses, prison guards and other state government employees can bargain over their workplace conditions and salary.",
      "The law, known as Act 10, was enacted in 2011 and limits bargaining to only wage increases no greater than the inflation rate. That means that other issues, such as benefits, safety and working conditions, and vacations, are not negotiable.",
      "The law also requires every public sector union to vote annually on maintaining its own certification. In order to pass, at least 51% of each union's members must vote yes, not just 51% of those voting.",
      "Union members were also required to pay more for their benefits, which reduced their take home pay and effectively served as a pay cut.",
      "Supporters say the law has saved school districts and local governments billions of dollars. Opponents say the law has kneecapped unions that traditionally back Democrats and hurt workers' morale and income.",
      "Passage of the law helped ease the way for the Legislature in 2015 to approve a so-called right-to-work law that limited the power of private-sector unions.",
      "Then- Gov. Scott Walker introduced the proposal shortly after taking office in 2011. That sparked weeks of massive protests, a walkout by Democratic state senators in a failed attempt to block passage of the law, and recall elections targeting Walker and Republicans who voted for it.",
      "The fight thrust Wisconsin into the the center of the battle over union rights in the U.S. Walker rode the attention, survived the 2012 recall attempt and then mounted a campaign for president a few years later. He dropped out, though, in the fall of 2015 as Donald Trump's support grew.",
      "The battle lines then and now are largely the same. The law is opposed by Democrats and unions. It is supported by Republicans, conservative groups and powerful organizations like Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the largest business lobbying group in Wisconsin.",
      "Numerous legal challenges have been filed challenging the law in state and federal courts. None of them succeeded until now.",
      "The latest challenge was filed last year by seven unions representing teachers and other public-sector workers and three individuals.",
      "This lawsuit alleges that Act 10\u2019s exemption of some police, firefighters and other public safety workers from the bargaining restrictions violates the Wisconsin Constitution\u2019s equal protection guarantee.",
      "A similar argument was made in a federal lawsuit alleging that Act 10 violated the equal protection guarantee in the U.S. Constitution. But a federal appeals court in 2013 said the state was free to draw a line between public safety and other unions, and the following year again ruled that the law was constitutional.",
      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2014 also upheld the law as constitutional, rejecting a lawsuit brought by teachers and Milwaukee public workers. That case raised different arguments than the current lawsuit. And in 2019, a federal judge rejected a lawsuit brought by two arms of the International Union of Operating Engineers that argued the law violates free speech and free association under the First Amendment.",
      "Walker, whose legacy is largely defined by his fight with the unions, called the ruling \u201cbrazen political activism.\u201d",
      "The judge who struck down the law, Dane County Circuit Judge Jacob Frost, was appointed by Wisconsin's current governor, Democrat Tony Evers. It also appears that Frost signed the petition to recall Walker.",
      "Republican leaders of the Legislature echoed Walker's comments, decrying the ruling and calling Frost an \u201cactivist.\u201d",
      "Evers called the decision \u201cgreat news\" and said, \u201cI\u2019ve always believed workers should have a seat at the table in decisions that affect their daily lives and livelihoods.\"",
      "Unions applauded the ruling while conservative groups warned that undoing the law would dramatically increase costs on local governments, leading to service cuts and tax increases.",
      "The Legislature has appealed the case. That would typically send it to the state court of appeals, unless the unions ask the Wisconsin Supreme Court to take the case directly.",
      "Opponents of the law are anxious for the state Supreme Court to get the case while it is controlled 4-3 by liberal justices. An election in April will determine whether liberals maintain control or the court flips back to conservatives, who held sway there from before Act 10 was passed until 2023. The newly elected justice will start work next August.",
      "Even if the current court takes the case, it's unclear what justices would hear it.",
      "Justice Janet Protasiewicz, whose win last year gave liberals the majority, said during her campaign that she believes Act 10 is unconstitutional. She also said she would consider recusing herself from any case challenging the law. Protasiewicz participated in protests against the law and signed the petition to recall Walker.",
      "Conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn was Walker\u2019s chief legal counsel and had a role in drafting the Act 10 law. But during his successful run for the court in 2015, Hagedorn would not promise to recuse himself if a case challenging Act 10 came before the court."

      "NEW YORK -- Chad Chronister, Donald Trump's pick to run the Drug Enforcement Administration, said Tuesday he was withdrawing his name from consideration, becoming the second person selected by the president-elect to bow out quickly after being nominated for a position requiring Senate confirmation.",
      "Sheriff Chronister, the top law enforcement officer in Hillsborough County, Florida, said in a post on X that he was backing away from the opportunity, which he called \u201cthe honor of a lifetime.\u201d",
      "\u201cOver the past several days, as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in, I\u2019ve concluded that I must respectfully withdraw from consideration,\u201d Chronister wrote. He did not elaborate, and Trump's transition team did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "Chronister follows former Republican congressman Matt Gaetz, Trump\u2019s first pick to serve as attorney general, in withdrawing his name for a post in the administration. Gaetz withdrew following scrutiny over a federal sex trafficking investigation that cast doubt on his ability to be confirmed as the nation\u2019s chief federal law enforcement officer.",
      "Trump's pick of Chronister for the DEA job drew backlash from conservatives, who raised concerns over his actions during the COVID-19 pandemic and his saying that his office \u201cdoes not engage in federal immigration enforcement activities.\u201d",
      "In March 2020, Chronister arrested the pastor of a megachurch who held services with hundreds of people and violated a safer-at-home order in place aimed at limiting the spread of the Covid virus.",
      "\u201cShame on this pastor, their legal staff and the leaders of this staff for forcing us to do our job. That\u2019s not what we wanted to do during a declared state of emergency,\u201d Chronister said at the time. \u201cWe are hopeful that this will be a wakeup call.\u201d",
      "U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky, was among those airing public complaints, saying Chronister should be \u201cdisqualified\u201d for the arrest.",
      "Others flagged comments Chronister made in a video about Florida\u2019s immigration laws that he released in 2023 that circulated again online after Trump named him last weekend.",
      "In the video, Chronister praised the \u201crich diversity\u201d of his community and called it \u201ca place where people from all walks of life come together.\u201d",
      "He said it was important to note his office \u201cdoes not engage in federal immigration enforcement activities. We do not target individuals based on their immigration status. That\u2019s the authority of federal agencies.\u201d",
      "Trump has made a sweeping crackdown on immigration a central focus of his campaign and his aims for his coming administration.",

      "The two officers, Christa Lloyd and Mary Harris, who work for the state's gaming division, were among six officers charged last year with failing to intervene to stop the actions of former sheriff\u2019s Deputy Andrew Buen, who ultimately shot Glass after a standoff in a small mountain community.",
      "A judge ruled Monday that gaming officers were not covered by the law making it a crime for peace officers, like police and state troopers, to fail to intervene to stop a fellow officer from using excessive force. The misdemeanor was created by state lawmakers in 2020 following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.",
      "Buen was convicted this year of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor, in the Glass shooting, which drew national attention and prompted calls for police reform focused on crisis intervention. Jurors could not reach a verdict on more serious charges of second-degree murder and official misconduct. Buen is scheduled to be tried again on those charges in February.",
      "Another officer indicted for criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangerment in Glass\u2019 death pleaded guilty to failing to intervene.",
      "Glass parents\u2019, Sally and Simon Glass, had long pushed for the other officers on the scene to also be prosecuted. They reached a $19 million settlement with the variety of agencies who responded to the standoff. It included such policy changes as crisis intervention training for Colorado law enforcement officers responding to people in distress."

      "State and federal authorities in Louisiana celebrated breaking ground on an ambitious $330 million conservation project intended to revitalize one of the state's largest swamp ecosystems by reconnecting it with the Mississippi River",
      "GARYVILLE, La. -- Louisiana has long relied on a vast levee system to rein in the Mississippi River and protect surrounding communities from flooding. But cutting off the natural flow of the river with man made barriers has been slowly killing one of the nation's largest forested wetlands.",
      "The 176 square mile (456 square kilometers) Maurepas Swamp just to the west of New Orleans holds Louisiana's second largest contiguous forest, a beloved state wildlife refuge filled with water tupelo and bald cypress trees, their branches adorned by wisps of Spanish moss. A beloved recreation site, the swamp also houses bald eagles, ospreys, black bears and alligators and serves as a waystation for hundreds of different migratory birds.",
      "Deprived of nutrients from the stanched Mississippi River, the swamp's iconic trees are dying in stagnant water. Yet they're now set to receive a life-saving boost.",
      "State and federal authorities on Tuesday celebrated breaking ground on an ambitious conservation project intended to replenish the ailing trees by diverting water from the Mississippi back into the swamp.",
      "\u201cThis is about reconnecting a natural system, actually fixing it to what it used to be,\u201d said Brad Miller, who has shepherded the project for the state's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority since 2006.",
      "Miller likened the $330 million river diversion to watering a garden: \u201cThe swamp needs river water to be a good swamp.\u201d",
      "The River Reintroduction into Maurepas Swamp will allow for a maximum of 2000 cubic feet per second (57 cubic meters per second) to flow out of a gated opening to be built in the levee system and routed along a 5.5 miles (9 kilometers) diversion channel. The project expects to revitalize around 45,000 acres (182 square kilometers) of swamp in an area where less than a third of the forest is considered healthy according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Besides injecting much-needed nutrients and oxygen into the swamp, river water will leave thin layers of sediment deposits that mitigate the effect of subsidence \u2014 a natural phenomenon on Louisiana\u2019s fragile coast exacerbated by fossil fuel extraction \u2014 and climate change-induced sea level rise, said Nick Stevens, a researcher at Southeastern Louisiana University\u2019s wetlands ecology and restoration lab. Healthier forests bolster the swamp with decomposing matter from branches and leaves, he added.",
      "\u201cAll of that is completely hindered by not having the Mississippi River attached to it anymore,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got all this land sinking as a result of just not getting nutrients.\u201d",
      "The swamp's diminishing health has had ripple effects on biodiversity, says Erik Johnson, director of conservation science at Audubon Delta, an organization focused on bird ecology in the Mississippi River delta. Some migratory birds like the yellow throated warbler, prothonotary warbler and the northern parula have had their populations plummet by nearly 50% in the past two decades, Johnson said.",
      "These birds rely on caterpillars who are dependent on water tupelo and bald cypress foliage. When there's less healthy leaves for the caterpillars to gorge on, there's less food for the birds.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s driving a really rapid decline in these bird populations that depend on this one forest,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe whole system has shifted.\u201d",
      "Scientists say they expect to start seeing an increase in canopy cover and new tree growth within a few years of the project\u2019s anticipated completion in 2028.",
      "Unlike the state\u2019s controversial $3 billion river diversion project intended to combat coastal land loss, the Maurepas project has received widespread support from elected officials and local communities.",
      "The Maurepas project is primarily funded by the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, a multi-state and federal program managing settlement funds from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill that devastated the Gulf Coast.",
      "The Maurepas project benefits from an innovative partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is building an adjacent 18.5 miles (30 kilometers) levee system to protect several southeast Louisiana parishes. The Corps will count 9,000 acres (36 square kilometers) of Maurepas Swamp restoration towards offsetting environmental damage caused by the new levee construction, meaning it can direct additional federal funds towards the diversion program.",
      "\u201cFor every dollar the state can save here, they have more to invest\" in other coastal restoration projects, said John Ettinger, director of policy and environmental compliance with Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council.",
      "And conservationists say the Maurepas reintroduction project highlights the importance of coastal protection and wetlands restoration going hand in hand in a hurricane-prone region.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a healthier ecosystem on the outside of that levee, which means you\u2019re going to have a better buffer for storm surge and it\u2019s going to allow the levees to be more effective,\u201d said Amanda Moore, National Wildlife Federation\u2019s Gulf Program senior director. \u201cThis is how we need to be thinking at large about what\u2019s possible and how we can how we can do more effective conservation by working with nature.\""

      "The investigation has drawn international attention to the small northern Virginia community, where homicide cases are rare. The disappearance of Mamta Bhatt, a pediatric nurse, spurred community members and her family in Nepal to band together to try to figure out what happened.",

      "Out of 34 states with data available for the 2022-2023 school year, half had absenteeism rates for Native American and Alaska Native students that were at least 9 percentage points higher than the state average.",
      "Many schools serving Native students have been working to strengthen connections with families, who often struggle with higher rates of illness and poverty. Schools also must navigate distrust dating back to the U.S. government's campaign to break up Native American culture, language and identity by forcing children into abusive boarding schools.",
      "History \"may cause them to not see the investment in a public school education as a good use of their time,\u201d said Dallas Pettigrew, director of Oklahoma University's Center for Tribal Social Work and a member of the Cherokee Nation.",
      "The San Carlos school system recently introduced care centers that partner with hospitals, dentists and food banks to provide services to students at multiple schools. The work is guided by cultural success coaches \u2014 school employees who help families address challenges that keep students from coming to school.",
      "Nearly 100% of students in the district are Native and more than half of families have incomes below the federal poverty level. Many students come from homes that deal with alcoholism and drug abuse, Superintendent Deborah Dennison said.",
      "Students miss school for reasons ranging from anxiety to unstable living conditions, said Jason Jones, a cultural success coach at San Carlos High School and an enrolled member of the San Carlos Apache tribe. Acknowledging their fears, grief and trauma helps him connect with students, he said.",
      "\u201cYou feel better, you do better,\u201d Jones said. \"That\u2019s our job here in the care center is to help the students feel better.\u201d",
      "In the 2023-2024 school year, the chronic absenteeism rate in the district fell from 76% to 59% \u2014 an improvement Dennison attributes partly to efforts to address their communities' needs.",
      "\u201cAll these connections with the community and the tribe are what\u2019s making a difference for us and making the school a system that fits them rather than something that has been forced upon them, like it has been for over a century of education in Indian Country,\u201d said Dennison, a member of the Navajo Nation.",
      "In three states \u2014 Alaska, Nebraska, and South Dakota \u2014 the majority of Native American and Alaska Native students were chronically absent. In some states, it has continued to worsen, even while improving slightly for other students, as in Arizona, where chronic absenteeism for Native students rose from 22% in 2018-2019 to 45% in 2022-2023.",
      "AP's analysis does not include data on schools managed by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Education, which are not run by traditional districts. Less than 10% of Native American students attend BIE schools.",
      "At Algodones Elementary School, which serves a handful of Native American pueblos along New Mexico's Upper Rio Grande, about two-thirds of students are chronically absent.",
      "The communities were hit hard by COVID-19, with devastating impacts on elders. Since schools reopened, students have been slow to return. Excused absences for sick days are still piling up \u2014 in some cases, Principal Rosangela Montoya suspects, students are stressed about falling behind academically.",
      "Staff and tribal liaisons have been analyzing every absence and emphasizing connections with parents. By 10 a.m., telephone calls go out to the homes of absent students. Next steps include in-person meetings with those students\u2019 parents.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s illness. There\u2019s trauma,\u201d Montoya said. \u201cA lot of our grandparents are the ones raising the children so that the parents can be working.\u201d",
      "About 95% of Algodones' students are Native American, and the school strives to affirm their identity. It doesn't open on four days set aside for Native American ceremonial gatherings, and students are excused for absences on other cultural days as designated by the nearby pueblos.",
      "For Jennifer Tenorio, it makes a difference that the school offers classes in the family\u2019s native language of Keres. She speaks Keres at home, but says that\u2019s not always enough to instill fluency.",
      "Tenorio said her two oldest children, now in their 20s, were discouraged from speaking Keres when enrolled in the federal Head Start educational program \u2014 a system that now promotes native language preservation \u2014 and they struggled academically.",
      "\u201cIt was sad to see with my own eyes,\u201d said Tenorio, a single parent and administrative assistant who has used the school's food bank. \u201cIn Algodones, I saw a big difference to where the teachers were really there for the students, and for all the kids, to help them learn.\u201d",
      "Over a lunch of strawberry milk and enchiladas on a recent school day, her 8-year-old son Cameron Tenorio said he likes math and wants to be a policeman.",

      "U.S. biathletes face \u201cmisogynistic\u201d behavior while racing and fear retaliation if they report their concerns, according to an inquiry by an independent contractor hired to assess athlete safety.",
      "The investigation of U.S. Biathlon was ordered following an Associated Press report that a female team member had been sexually harassed and abused for years while racing on the World Cup circuit.",
      "\u201cIt is very uncomfortable as a woman ... to be in that environment,\" one biathlete said in the report released Monday, which did not identify the athletes to preserve confidentiality.",
      "Many biathletes said they feared if they complained they would be denied training opportunities, financial support and selection for relay teams, according to the assessment by outside auditor Vestry Laight.",
      "The AP reported in January that a U.S. Center for SafeSport investigation found that two-time Olympian Joanne Reid had been sexually harassed by a ski-wax technician from 2016 to 2021. Wax technicians play a critical role in biathlon, which combines cross-country skiing with target shooting.",
      "SafeSport suspended the wax tech for six months and put him on probation through December. U.S. Biathlon fired him from the team and ordered the audit.",
      "Investigators interviewed athletes, parents, coaches and staff, and studied U.S. Biathlon policies as part of the review. They also sent a confidential survey to 57 biathletes who have competed since 2020.",
      "The report found the U.S. Biathlon Association code of conduct failed to provide clear examples of prohibited behavior. There was also no way to file complaints online or anonymously, making it less likely people would come forward, it said.",
      "The survey showed that while 92% of male respondents said they felt comfortable raising concerns about athlete safety, only 52% of women did. Women were far more likely to say they feared negative consequences to their careers for reporting misconduct \u2014 57% compared to 8% of men.",
      "In addition, 43% of women said they had observed conduct in violation of the USBA code in the past year, compared to 25% of men.",
      "Biathlon officials said they were adopting an \"action plan\u201d in response to the report, including workshops with staff and athletes to define core values and create a way to measure progress.",
      "\u201cWe have full confidence in the USBA leadership to implement the necessary improvements and build a culture that will enable the athletes and our community to thrive,\u201d Bob Hall, USBA board chair, told members in an email.",
      "Reid told the AP on Tuesday that she believes U.S. Biathlon\u2019s response is inadequate, calling it \"mostly a promise to develop metrics and plans, with nothing concrete that they can be held accountable to.\"",
      "She said it was \u201creally rugged\u201d to see how many women had witnessed abuse but feared reporting it.",
      "Many athletes interviewed said they feared retaliation for reporting abuse after what happened to Reid. Six months after SafeSport's investigation, U.S. Biathlon retroactively changed the criteria for being pre-qualified for the World Cup team \u2014 and Reid was bumped off. The change didn\u2019t affect the status of anyone else on the team.",
      "U.S. Biathlon CEO Jack Gierhart told the AP in January the World Cup rule change was not retaliation.",
      "SafeSport has launched a new investigation into whether Gierhart and High Performance Director Lowell Bailey retaliated against Reid by changing the qualification criteria. Gierhart said in an interview Tuesday that he could not comment on that inquiry.",
      "Athletes interviewed for the audit said the way U.S. Biathlon officials handled the Reid case made them feel powerless and unsafe.",
      "\u201cIt was clearly demonstrated by USBA that if an athlete, especially a female athlete, were to bring up this topic they would risk their spot on the team in the upcoming year,\" one athlete wrote in the survey.",
      "\"Not speaking out is the best bet if you want to keep competing for USBA,\u201d another said."

      "But Monday, the Israeli military acknowledged the painful truth: The 21-year-old had not been taken hostage, but was killed during the group\u2019s surprise attack on the Nova Music Festival that sparked the latest conflict in the Middle East.",
      "Speaking at a memorial service Tuesday at the Long Island synagogue where his son celebrated his bar mitzvah years earlier, Ronen Neutra said he was at a loss for words.",
      "After spending months telling his son\u2019s story and pleading for his release at numerous rallies in the U.S. and abroad, news of his death \u201cleft us breathless and empty,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor over a year now, we\u2019ve been breathing life into your being, my beautiful boy,\u201d Orna Neutra, Omer\u2019s mother, said through tears. \u201cWith the hope and love of so many, we kept going and going and going, keeping you alive, speaking your name from every outlet, pushing any hint of despair, not stopping to breathe or to take in the deep pain of your absence.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow things are clear,\u201d she told the packed service at the Midway Jewish Center in Syosset. \u201cBut not as we\u2019d hoped.\u201d",
      "The couple have been a regular presence at protests in the U.S. and Israel. They also addressed the Republican National Convention this year and maintained contact with outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s administration in their effort to secure their son\u2019s release.",
      "Daniel Neutra, Omer\u2019s younger brother, vowed the family would continue to honor his life\u2019s work by continuing to call for the release of the remaining hostages and an end to the war.",
      "\u201cIt is too late for him, but it was not in vain,\u201d he said.",
      "Omer Neutra was born in Manhattan just weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, his parents recounted during the service, which was also attended by Gov. Kathy Hochul and other local politicians.",
      "The grandson of Holocaust survivors, he attended a Jewish school on Long Island where he was captain of the basketball, soccer and volleyball teams, they said.",
      "He was offered admission to the State University of New York at Binghamton, but instead deferred, took a gap year and then moved to Israel to enlist in the army.",
      "Ronen Neutra called Israel his son\u2019s \u201ctrue love\u201d and said he had insisted on serving on the frontline. His unit was among the first to respond to Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack.",
      "\u201cYou gave too much, too soon,\u201d Orna Neutra said.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces have not said how they determined that Neutra died in the attack and was not taken hostage, as initially thought.",

      "They added that they \u201cwill not rest or be silent\u201d until his body is recovered from the Palestinian territory of Gaza.",
      "Biden and first lady Jill Biden said in a statement Monday they were \u201cdevastated and outraged\u201d to learn of Neutra\u2019s death. They said he planned to return to college in the U.S. and \u201cdreamed of dedicating himself to building peace.\u201d",

      "Iowa officials are suing the Biden administration for access to information on the citizenship status of more than 2,000 registered voters they had questioned in the weeks leading up to the 2024 election",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Iowa officials on Tuesday sued the Biden administration for access to information on the citizenship status of more than 2,000 registered voters they had questioned in the weeks leading up to the 2024 election.",
      "The complaint details a back and forth with the federal government after state election officials checked voter rolls against a list of people who identified themselves as noncitizens with the state's Department of Transportation. The vast majority of the 2,176 names had subsequently registered to vote or voted, meaning that some of those people could have become naturalized citizens in the lapsed time.",
      "Secretary of State Paul Pate\u2019s office requested information from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on the citizenship status of those individuals but did not get it, the complaint alleges.",
      "Federal authorities' \u201cfailure meant that the State had to rely on the best \u2014 imperfect \u2014 data it had available to ensure that no Iowan\u2019s vote was canceled by an illegal, noncitizen vote,\u201d a joint statement from Pate and Attorney General Brenna Bird said.",
      "A DHS spokesperson said in an email Tuesday that the federal agency does not comment on pending litigation but added that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services have \u201cengaged with Iowa and will continue to correspond with them directly through official channels.\u201d",
      "Two weeks before Election Day, when early voting was already underway, Pate told county elections officials to challenge the ballots case by any of the named individuals and have them cast a provisional ballot instead.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa then sued Pate on Oct. 30 on behalf of four voters who are naturalized citizens but were named on the list, calling into question the accuracy of the DOT's information and alleging Pate infringed upon their right to vote. Their request for a stop to the ballot challenges was denied by a federal judge on Nov. 3.",
      "It is illegal for non-U.S. citizens to vote in federal elections, but there is no evidence that it is occurring in significant numbers, though Iowa and some other states say they have identified dozens of such cases.",
      "Some individuals in Iowa had registered to vote or voted before identifying themselves as noncitizens to the DOT, so Pate's office sent those names to law enforcement and Bird's office for investigation and potential prosecution. But Pate's critics have said even those individuals might be wrongly identified as noncitizens since the DOT data has proven unreliable.",
      "The ACLU and ACLU of Iowa said in a statement that the state would be getting the information it needed from the federal government if it agreed not to misuse it.",
      "\u201cStudies, journalistic efforts, and repeated attempts by government officials in Iowa and nationally have found very few non-citizens who have voted, out of the many millions of people who vote,\" the statement said. \"This wasteful lawsuit isn\u2019t going to change that. State leaders should spend their time on actual problems that face our state.\u201d",
      "Pate's office has not released any additional information on the number of people who turned out to vote, whose ballots were challenged or whose citizenship status was ultimately confirmed. The Des Moines Register, based on preliminary information collected from 97 of the state's 99 counties, found at least 500 of the identified individuals proved their citizenship status and had their votes counted.",
      "Another 74 ballots were rejected, according to the Register, mostly because those people did not return to prove their citizenship status.",
      "The majority of the people on Pate's list did not vote in the 2024 election, according to the Register's data from county auditors.",
      "Concern about elections being undermined by noncitizen voting had been a focus of political messaging this year from President-elect Donald Trump and other Republicans, even though such voting is rare in American elections.",
      "Since no voter had been removed from Iowa\u2019s lists, Pate tried to differentiate Iowa from other states, such as Virginia, where more than 1,600 voters were purged from the voter registration list in the past two months in a program enacted through an Aug. 7 executive order from Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.",
      "The Justice Department and a coalition of private groups sued Virginia in early October, arguing that state election officials violated federal law\u2019s 90-day \u201cquiet period\u201d ahead of elections. The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority said that Virginia could continue.",
      "Ahead of the Nov. 5 election, Pate said the DOT information was the \u201conly list that we have available to us\u201d without access to federal immigration records.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re balancing this process. We want everyone to be able to vote. That\u2019s why none of them have been taken off the voter rolls,\u201d he said. But \u201cwe do owe an obligation to make sure that they are citizens now.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "For a second time, a Delaware judge has nullified a pay package that Tesla had awarded its CEO, Elon Musk, that once was valued at $56 billion",
      "DETROIT -- For a second time, a Delaware judge has nullified a pay package that Tesla had awarded its CEO, Elon Musk, that once was valued at $56 billion.",
      "On Monday, Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick turned aside a request from Musk's lawyers to reverse a ruling she announced in January that had thrown out the compensation plan. The judge ruled then that Musk effectively controlled Tesla's board and had engineered the outsize pay package during sham negotiations.",
      "Lawyers for a Tesla shareholder who sued to block the pay package contended that shareholders who had voted for the 10-year plan in 2018 had been given misleading and incomplete information.",
      "In their defense, Tesla's board members asserted that the shareholders who ratified the pay plan a second time in June had done so after receiving full disclosures, thereby curing all the problems the judge had cited in her January ruling. As a result, they argued, Musk deserved the pay package for having raised Tesla's market value by billions of dollars.",
      "McCormick rejected that argument. In her 103-page opinion, she ruled that under Delaware law, Tesla's lawyers had no grounds to reverse her January ruling \u201cbased on evidence they created after trial.\u201d",
      "On Monday night, Tesla posted on X, the social media platform owned by Musk, that the company will appeal. The appeal would be filed with the Delaware Supreme Court, the only state appellate court Tesla can pursue. Experts say a ruling would likely come in less than a year.",
      "\u201cThe ruling, if not overturned, means that judges and plaintiffs' lawyers run Delaware companies rather than their rightful owners \u2014 the shareholders,\u201d Tesla argued.",
      "Later, on X, Musk unleashed a blistering attack on the judge, asserting that McCormick is \u201ca radical far left activist cosplaying as a judge.\u201d",
      "Legal authorities generally suggest that McCormick\u2019s ruling was sound and followed the law. Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said that in his view, McCormick was right to rule that after Tesla lost its case in the original trial, it created improper new evidence by asking shareholders to ratify the pay package a second time.",
      "Had she allowed such a claim, he said, it would cause a major shift in Delaware\u2019s laws against conflicts of interest given the unusually close relationship between Musk and Tesla\u2019s board.",
      "\u201cDelaware protects investors \u2014 that\u2019s what she did,\u201d said Elson, who has followed the court for more than three decades. \u201cJust because you\u2019re a \u2018superstar CEO\u2019 doesn\u2019t put you in a separate category.\u201d",
      "Elson said he thinks investors would be reluctant to put money into Delaware companies if there were exceptions to the law for \u201cspecial people.\u201d",
      "Elson said that in his opinion, the court is likely to uphold McCormick's ruling.",
      "Experts say no. Rulings on state laws are normally left to state courts. Brian Dunn, program director for the Institute of Compensation Studies at Cornell University, said it's been his experience that Tesla has no choice but to stay in the Delaware courts for this compensation package.",
      "The company could try to reconstitute the pay package and seek approval in Texas, where it may expect more friendlier judges. But Dunn, who has spent 40 years as an executive compensation consultant, said it's likely that some other shareholder would challenge the award in Texas because it's excessive compared with other CEOs' pay plans.",
      "\u201cIf they just want to turn around and deliver him $56 billion, I can't believe somebody wouldn't want to litigate it,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cIt's an unconscionable amount of money.\u201d",
      "Almost certainly. Tesla stock is trading at 15 times the exercise price of stock options in the current package in Delaware, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to investors. Tesla's share price has doubled in the past six months, Jonas wrote. At Monday\u2019s closing stock price, the Musk package is now worth $101.4 billion, according to Equilar, an executive data firm.",
      "And Musk has asked for a subsequent pay package that would give him 25% of Tesla's voting shares. Musk has said he is uncomfortable moving further into artificial intelligence with the company if he doesn't have 25% control. He currently holds about 13% of Tesla's outstanding shares."

      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats reelected Chuck Schumer as party leader on Tuesday as the party moves into a deeply uncertain time, with no real consensus on a strategy as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office.",
      "Schumer faced no opposition in the party leadership elections, in which Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin was also reelected to the No. 2 spot and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar became the new No. 3. In a statement, Schumer, of New York, said he was honored to move the party forward \u201cduring this crucial period for our country.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur preference is to secure bipartisan solutions wherever possible and look for ways to collaborate with our Republican colleagues to help working families,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cHowever, our Republican colleagues should make no mistake about it, we will always stand up for our values.\u201d",
      "While Schumer remains popular with his colleagues, it is a bleak moment for Senate Democrats, who had been hopeful that they could hold the majority for the third election in a row. Instead they lost four seats and will be in the minority, 53-47, as Trump takes office and pressures the Senate to quickly confirm his Cabinet nominees.",
      "Unlike eight years ago, when opposition to Trump\u2019s narrow election win fueled enthusiasm in their party, Democratic lawmakers and many of their voters are exhausted and looking for answers.",
      "So far, Democrats have stayed relatively quiet on Trump\u2019s nominees and plans for office \u2013 a stark contrast from the loud opposition to Trump when he was elected eight years ago. Schumer has declined to comment on specifics of any nominees, instead allowing Republican reaction to dominate the conversation.",
      "On Monday, Schumer wrote a public letter to South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the incoming Republican majority leader, asking him to resist Trump\u2019s pressure to allow him to appoint some of his nominees without a Senate vote and to insist on full FBI background checks for all nominees. But he has said little else about Trump\u2019s upcoming presidency.",
      "While some have been more aggressive \u2014 Washington Sen. Patty Murray, a former chairwoman of the Senate Health, Labor, Education and Pensions Committee, said that Trump\u2019s nomination of Robert Kennedy Jr. to lead the Health and Human Services Department is \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cnothing short of disaster\u201d \u2014 several Democratic senators say they are saving their strength and figuring out a focus.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s in kind of in a wait-and-see mode right now,\u201d said Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, who is part of Schumer\u2019s leadership team. \u201cUnder the previous Trump administration, there was chaos all the time, all the time. And I do think it is important to pick your battles.\u201d",

      "Enron, the Houston-based energy company that exemplified the worst in corporate fraud and greed in America after it went bankrupt in 2001, is coming back",
      "HOUSTON -- An elaborate parody appears to be behind an effort to resurrect Enron, the Houston-based energy company that exemplified the worst in American corporate fraud and greed after it went bankrupt in 2001.",
      "If its return is comedic, some former employees who lost everything in Enron\u2019s collapse aren\u2019t laughing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty sick joke and it disparages the people that did work there. And why would you want to even bring it back up again?\u201d said former Enron employee Diana Peters, who represented workers in the company\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the history of Enron and the purported effort to bring it back.",
      "Once the nation\u2019s seventh-largest company, Enron filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer hide billions of dollars in debt or make failing ventures appear profitable. The energy company's collapse put more than 5,000 people out of work and wiped out more than $2 billion in employee pensions. Its aftershocks were felt throughout the energy sector.",
      "Twenty-four Enron executives, including former CEO Jeffrey Skilling, were convicted for their roles in the fraud. Enron founder Ken Lay\u2019s convictions were vacated after he died of heart disease following his 2006 trial.",
      "On Monday \u2014 the 23rd anniversary of the bankruptcy filing \u2014 a company representing itself as Enron announced in a news release it was relaunching as a \u201ccompany dedicated to solving the global energy crisis.\u201d It also posted a video on social media, advertised on at least one Houston billboard and a took out a full-page ad in the Houston Chronicle",
      "In the minute-long video full of generic corporate jargon, the company talks about \u201cgrowth\u201d and \u201crebirth.\u201d It ends with the words, \u201cWe\u2019re back. Can we talk?\u201d",
      "In an email, company spokesperson Will Chabot said the new Enron was not doing any interviews yet, but \"We\u2019ll have more to share soon.\u201d",
      "Signs point to the comeback being a joke.",
      "In the \u201cterms of use and conditions of sale\u201d on the company's website, it says \u201cthe information on the website about Enron is First Amendment protected parody, represents performance art, and is for entertainment purposes only.\u201d",
      "Documents filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office show College Company, an Arkansas-based LLC, owns the Enron trademark. The co-founder of College Company is Connor Gaydos, who helped create a joke conspiracy theory claiming all birds are actually government surveillance drones.",
      "Peters said she and some other former employees are upset and think the relaunch was \u201cin poor taste.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s a joke, it\u2019s rude, extremely rude. And I hope that they realize it and apologize to all of the Enron employees,\u201d Peters said.",
      "Peters, 74, said she is still working in information technology because \u201cI lost everything in Enron, and so my Social Security doesn\u2019t always take care of things I need done.\u201d",
      "\u201cEnron\u2019s downfall taught us critical lessons about corporate ethics, accountability, and the consequences of unchecked ambition. Enron\u2019s legacy was the employees in the trenches. Leave Enron buried,\u201d she said.",
      "But Sherron Watkins, Enron\u2019s former vice president of corporate development and the main whistleblower who helped uncover the scandal, said she didn\u2019t have a problem with the joke because comedy \u201cusually helps us focus on an uncomfortable historical event that we\u2019d rather ignore.\u201d",

      "The federal government has closed its investigation into an E",
      "The U.S. government said Tuesday it has closed its investigation into an E. coli outbreak tied to McDonald's Quarter Pounder hamburgers after determining there is no longer a safety risk.",
      "The outbreak, which was first reported Oct. 22, sickened at least 104 people in 14 states, including 34 who were hospitalized, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. One person in Colorado died and four people developed a potentially life-threatening kidney disease complication.",
      "The FDA, which conducted the investigation along with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state health departments, linked the outbreak to yellow onions distributed by California-based Taylor Farms and served raw on Quarter Pounders at McDonald\u2019s restaurants in Colorado, Kansas, Wyoming and other states.",
      "There have been no new cases reported since Oct. 21, when McDonald's pulled the Quarter Pounder off its menu in the affected states, the CDC said Tuesday. Taylor Farms initiated a voluntary recall of yellow onions on Oct. 22.",
      "Federal and state health officials in Colorado didn\u2019t find the strain of E. coli that caused the illnesses in onions it tested or in any samples from the environment. But they concluded that evidence showed that recalled yellow onions were the likely source of the outbreak.",
      "\u201cMcDonald\u2019s is no longer serving recalled onions and there does not appear to be a continued food safety concern related to this outbreak,\u201d the FDA said Tuesday in a statement.",
      "McDonald's briefly pulled Quarter Pounders from 3,000 U.S. stores as a result of the outbreak, then narrowed that to 900 stores once testing had pinpointed onions \u2014 and not hamburger patties \u2014 as the likely source of E. coli. The company found an alternate supplier and resumed selling Quarter Pounders with slivered onions at all U.S. stores last month.",
      "But the outbreak has hurt demand. In mid-November, McDonald's said it planned to spend $100 million to bring customers back to stores, including $65 million that will go directly to the hardest-hit franchisees.",
      "Chicago-based McDonald's wouldn't say Tuesday whether its sales have returned to normal levels in the affected regions. But it thanked U.S. regulators for their quick action and said it remains confident in its rigorous food-safety standards.",
      "McDonald's last major food-safety issue happened in 2018, when more than 500 people contracted an intestinal illness after eating its salads.",
      "McDonald's also declined to comment Tuesday on legal action against the company as a result of the E. coli outbreak.",
      "Nicole and Richard West of Townsend, Montana, are suing McDonald\u2019s after their 11-month-old daughter, Logan, was hospitalized in October with E. coli poisoning. The toddler ate a few bites of her father\u2019s Quarter Pounder hamburger with onions during a family road trip on Oct. 2.",
      "She fell ill a few days later with severe vomiting and diarrhea. Her mother rushed her to the hospital, where she was found to be infected with E. coli O157:H7, which can cause life-threatening illness, particularly in young children.",
      "Richard West also fell ill but didn\u2019t seek medical attention because he was at home caring for the family\u2019s other children. He lost more than two weeks of work as a truck driver because of the outbreak and the family faces a barrage of medical expenses.",
      "Nicole West said Tuesday that Logan's health has improved but the outbreak has shaken the family\u2019s confidence in the fast-food giant.",
      "\u201cWith kids, when you want to go out to eat, they want to go to McDonald\u2019s. They want to get a Happy Meal,\u201d West said. \u201cBut we just don\u2019t trust it anymore.\u201d"

      "BANGKOK -- China announced Tuesday it is banning exports to the United States of gallium, germanium, antimony and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications, as a general principle, lashing back at U.S. limits on semiconductor-related exports.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced the move after the Washington expanded its list of Chinese companies subject to export controls on computer chip-making equipment, software and high-bandwidth memory chips. Such chips are needed for advanced applications.",
      "The ratcheting up of trade restrictions comes as President-elect Donald Trump has been threatening to sharply raise tariffs on imports from China and other countries, potentially intensifying simmering tensions over trade and technology.",
      "China's Foreign Ministry also issued a vehement reproof.",
      "\u201cChina has lodged stern protests with the U.S. for its update of the semiconductor export control measures, sanctions against Chinese companies, and malicious suppression of China\u2019s technological progress,\" Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said in a routine briefing Tuesday.",
      "\"I want to reiterate that China firmly opposes the U.S. overstretching the concept of national security, abuse of export control measures, and illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction against Chinese companies,\u201d Lin said.",
      "China said in July 2023 it would require exporters to apply for licenses to send to the U.S. the strategically important materials such as gallium and germanium. In August, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would restrict exports of antimony, which is used in a wide range of products from batteries to weapons, and impose tighter controls on exports of graphite.",
      "Such minerals are considered critical for national security. China is a major producer of antimony, which is used in flame retardants, batteries, night-vision goggles and nuclear weapon production, according to a 2021 U.S. International Trade Commission report.",
      "The limits announced by Beijing on Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings. The licensing requirements that China announced in August also covered smelting and separation technology and machinery and other items related to such super-hard materials.",
      "China is the biggest global source of gallium and germanium, which are produced in small amounts but are needed to make computer chips for mobile phones, cars and other products, as well as solar panels and military technology.",
      "After the U.S. side announced it was adding 140 companies to a so-called \u201centity list\u201d subject to strict export controls, China\u2019s Commerce Ministry protested and said it would act to protect China\u2019s \u201crights and interests.\u201d Nearly all of the companies affected by Washington's latest trade restrictions are based in China, though some are Chinese-owned businesses in Japan, South Korea and Singapore.",
      "Both governments say their respective export controls are needed for national security.",
      "China's government has been frustrated by U.S. curbs on access to advanced processor chips and other technology on security grounds but had been cautious in retaliating, possibly to avoid disrupting China\u2019s fledgling developers of chips, artificial intelligence and other technology.",
      "Various Chinese industry associations issued statements protesting the U.S. move to limit access to advanced chip-making technology.",
      "The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said it opposed using national security as a grounds for export controls, \u201cabuse of export control measures, and the malicious blockade and suppression of China.\u201d",
      "\u201cSuch behavior seriously violates the laws of the market economy and the principle of fair competition, undermines the international economic and trade order, disrupts the stability of the global industrial chain, and ultimately harms the interests of all countries,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "The China Semiconductor Industry Association issued a similar statement, adding that such restrictions were disrupting supply chains and inflating costs for American companies.",
      "\u201cU.S. chip products are no longer safe and reliable. China\u2019s related industries will have to be cautious in purchasing U.S. chips,\u201d it said.",
      "The U.S. gets about half its supply of both gallium and germanium metals directly from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. China exported about 23 metric tons (25 tons) of gallium in 2022 and produces about 600 metric tons (660 tons) of germanium per year.",
      "The U.S. has deposits of such minerals but has not been mining them, though some projects underway are exploring ways to tap those resources.",
      "The export restrictions have had a mixed impact on prices for those critical minerals, with the price of antimony more than doubling this year to over $25,000 per ton. Prices for gallium, germanium and graphite also have mostly risen.",

      "Nine of the defendants, including the rapper Gunna, accepted plea deals before the trial began, and four more pleaded guilty during the trial, in October. Charges against 12 others remain pending. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case. That left Kendrick and Stillwell, both of whom were stabbed while in jail \u2014 Stillwell last year and Kendrick on Sunday.",

      "Defense attorneys said the state relied on faulty evidence \u2014 song lyrics, cherry-picked social media posts and unreliable witness testimony \u2014 to create a misleading narrative about young men who turned to music to escape economic hardship and difficult pasts.",
      "The jury's decision left Kendrick\u2019s mom, Tasha Kendrick, in tears.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just thankful for a lot of things right now,\u201d she said. \u201cMy emotions are all over the place right now.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Williams and two others founded Young Slime Life in association with the national Bloods gang in 2012. The 33-year-old artist also has a record label called Young Stoner Life. Deamonte Kendrick is featured on two of the most popular songs from the label\u2019s compilation album Slime Language 2, \u201cTake It to Trial\u201d and \u201cSlatty,\u201d as well as Young Thug\u2019s \u201cSlime Sh-t,\" which prosecutors presented as evidence.",
      "Williams entered a risky \u201cblind\u201d plea \u2014 meaning he pleaded guilty without an agreement on his sentence \u2014 in October. Williams\u2019 lawyer said he felt like they were winning, but the rapper complained that sitting in court felt like \u201chell\u201d and wanted to go home to his family. Judge Paige Reese Whitaker let him out of jail on probation with tight restrictions, including a 10-year ban from metro Atlanta except for certain occasions.",
      "The trial shook Atlanta\u2019s rap scene. Williams grew up in an Atlanta housing project and became a highly successful artist who added his own melodic twist to the modern Southern trap sound he helped popularize.",
      "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Ural Glanville was removed from the case in July after he met with prosecutors and a state witness without defense attorneys present. Kendrick\u2019s attorney Doug Weinstein said defendants got a \u201cfair trial\u201d once Whitaker took over. Among other things, she reprimanded the prosecution for being disorganized and not sharing evidence.",
      "During closings, Stillwell\u2019s defense attorney Max Schardt sought to cast doubts on the gang investigators and other state witnesses. Several alleged YSL members testified they had lied to police to stay out of prison. Schardt said officers had threatened them with long prison sentences if they didn\u2019t say the right thing.",
      "Prosecutors said those witnesses were honest with police but lied on the stand, in front of the people they had \u201csnitched\u201d on. They said their statements were corroborated by other evidence such as songs and social media posts where they said defendants were \u201cbragging about murder.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors threw together lyrics, social media posts and irrelevant evidence to \u201csee what sticks,\u201d Weinstein argued, but did not prove they were connected to a criminal enterprise.",
      "While defendants did commit crimes in the past, Schardt said during closings, it was to make money for themselves in communities stripped of economic opportunity \u2014 not to advance a gang. And music let some of them move on.",
      "\u201cAs a whole, we know the struggles that these communities have had,\u201d Schardt said. \u201cA sad, tacit acceptance that it\u2019s either rap, prison or death.\u201d",

      "Stillwell is not \u201cblind to the fact that he is getting a second chance at life,\" Schardt said.",
      "Weinstein said Kendrick, who is close friends with Young Thug, was laser-focused on his music career before the state pulled him back into the criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so happy that he can kind of draw a line in the sand now,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cAll of this is behind him. He can get on with his life and not worry about this nonsense.\u201d",

      "The Supreme Court is hearing arguments Wednesday in just its second major transgender rights case, a challenge to a Tennessee law that bans gender-affirming care for minors",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court is hearing arguments Wednesday in just its second major transgender rights case, which is a challenge to a Tennessee law that bans gender-affirming care for minors.",
      "The justices' decision, not expected for several months, could affect similar laws enacted by another 25 states and a range of other efforts to regulate the lives of transgender people, including which sports competitions they can join and which bathrooms they can use.",
      "The case is coming before a conservative-dominated court after a presidential election in which Donald Trump and his allies promised to roll back protections for transgender people.",
      "Four years ago, the court ruled in favor of Aimee Stephens, who was fired by a Michigan funeral home after she informed its owner that she was a transgender woman. The court held that transgender people, as well as gay and lesbian people, are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace.",
      "The Biden administration and the families and health care providers who challenged the Tennessee law are urging the justices to apply the same sort of analysis that the majority, made up of liberal and conservative justices, embraced in the case four years ago when it found that \u201csex plays an unmistakable role\u201d in employers' decisions to punish transgender people for traits and behavior they otherwise tolerate.",
      "The issue in the Tennessee case is whether the law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, which requires the government to treat similarly situated people the same.",
      "Tennessee's law bans puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors, but not \u201cacross the board,\u201d lawyers for the families wrote in their Supreme Court brief. The lead lawyer, Chase Strangio of the American Civil Liberties Union, is the first openly transgender person to argue in front of the justices.",
      "The administration argues there is no way to determine whether \u201ctreatments must be withheld from any particular minor\u201d without considering the minor's sex.",
      "\u201cThat is sex discrimination,\u201d Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in her main court filing.",
      "The state acknowledges that the same treatments that are banned for transgender minors can be prescribed for other reasons. But it rejects the claim that it is discriminating on the basis of sex. Instead, it says lawmakers acted to protect minors from the risks of \u201clife-altering gender-transition procedures.\u201d",
      "The law \u201cdraws a line between minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes. And boys and girls fall on both sides of that line,\u201d Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti wrote in the state's Supreme Court brief.",
      "While the challengers invoke the 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County for support, Tennessee relies on the court's precedent-shattering Dobbs decision in 2022 that ended nationwide protections for abortion and returned the issue to the states.",
      "The two sides battled in their legal filings over the appropriate level of scrutiny the court should apply. It's more than an academic exercise.",
      "The lowest level is known as rational basis review and almost every law looked at that way is ultimately upheld. Indeed, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati that allowed the law to be enforced held that lawmakers acted rationally to regulate medical procedures, well within their authority.",
      "The appeals court reversed a trial court that employed a higher level of review, heightened scrutiny, that applies in cases of sex discrimination. Under this more searching examination, the state must identify an important objective and show that the law helps accomplish it.",
      "If the justices opt for heightened scrutiny, they could return the case to the appeals court to apply it.",
      "Gender-affirming care for youth is supported by every major medical organization, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association.",
      "But Tennessee is pointing to health authorities in Sweden, Finland, Norway and the United Kingdom that found that the medical treatments \"pose significant risks with unproven benefits.\u201d",
      "None of those countries has adopted a ban similar to the one in Tennessee and individuals can still obtain treatment, Prelogar wrote in response.",
      "The Williams family of Nashville, Tennessee are among those challenging the state law. Brian Williams said that as a result of puberty blockers and hormone treatments, his transgender daughter, L.W., is a \u201c16-year-old planning for her future, making her own music and looking at colleges.\u201d",
      "But because of Tennessee's ban, she has to travel to another state to receive the health care that \u201cwe and her doctors know is right for her.\u201d"

      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- A former police detective in Kansas who died in an apparent suicide as he was about to stand trial for allegedly sexually assaulting and terrorizing vulnerable women for decades wasn't supposed to have a gun while he was under house arrest.",
      "Police found Roger Golubski dead on his back porch Monday morning after a neighbor reported hearing a gunshot, and there were no indications of foul play, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation said in a statement. The judge\u2019s order allowing Golubski to be under house arrest said he could not \u201cpossess a firearm, destructive device, or other weapon.\u201d",
      "Golubski's death \u2014 just as jury selection was to begin at the federal courthouse in Topeka \u2014 raised questions about why the 71-year-old wasn't behind bars, and how a gun came to be at his home in Edwardsville, outside Kansas City, Kansas.",
      "\"We will look into how he obtained the firearm as a part of the death investigation,\u201d said Melissa Underwood, a bureau spokeswoman.",
      "Golubski, once a highly regarded detective in Kansas City, was charged in 2022 with six felony counts of violating the civil rights of women and girls. Prosecutors say he sexually abused them and sometimes threatened to throw them or their relatives in jail if they didn't comply.",
      "The trial was to focus on two women. One said Golubski began sexually abusing her when she was in middle school. The other said he began abusing her after her twin sons were arrested. Prosecutors said seven other women were planning to testify that Golubski abused or harassed them as well. Advocates for the women believe there are other victims who have either died or are afraid to come forward.",
      "Prosecutors say that Golubski, who was white, victimized Black women and girls in some of Kansas City\u2019s poorest neighborhoods.",
      "Golubski\u2019s prosecution followed hundreds of abuse cases across the country where officers lost their badges after allegations of sexual assault.",
      "After Golubski's death, the judge dismissed the case at the request of prosecutors.",
      "Prosecutors wanted Golubski jailed almost immediately. They asked to have him taken into custody two days after a federal grand jury indicted him in September 2022.",
      "But U.S. Magistrate Judge Rachel Schwartz rejected their request, concluding that while the allegations were \u201cshocking,\u201d Golubski was not the risk he was when the alleged abuse occurred years ago.",
      "An attorney for Golubski described him as \u201csick and infirm,\u201d saying he needed medical care for diabetes and to recover from quintuple bypass heart surgery. Golubski was undergoing kidney dialysis three times a week, and his trial was scheduled around those treatments.",
      "Golubski's accusers believe he had too much freedom under house arrest. Some of them were especially angry after they saw video of him at a Culver\u2019s restaurant following a medical appointment in January. Schwartz tightened conditions on Golubski\u2019s house arrest after that, but didn't order him detained.",
      "\u201cThe perception of people, rightly or wrongly, and regardless of the law, is that had they been in front of the court under similar circumstances, they probably would have been detained,\u201d Cheryl Pilate, an attorney for some of Golubski\u2019s accusers, said Tuesday.",
      "Barry Grissom, who served as the top federal prosecutor in Kansas from 2010 to 2016, said Golubski\u2019s longtime ties to the Kansas City area \u2014 something cited by the magistrate \u2014 argued against detention. Schwartz ordered Golubski to stay at home except for religious services and medical care. He was not allowed to get a passport.",
      "\u201cHe hadn\u2019t been found guilty \u2014 you know, it hadn\u2019t been proved \u2014 so he still, like anybody, was presumed innocent,\u201d Grissom said.",
      "That's unclear.",
      "Sean O'Brien, a University of Missouri-Kansas City law professor, said officers would have searched Golubski's home when his house arrest started, but added that \u201cit's not like they were surveilling his house 24/7.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut, you know, once he\u2019s there \u2014 you know, people coming and going \u2014 anybody could have brought a gun to him or maybe the search wasn\u2019t that thorough,\u201d O'Brien said.",
      "Golubski worked for decades for the Kansas City police department before retiring from there in 2010. He then worked for the Edwardsville police, leaving that department in 2016.",
      "Edwardsville Chief Rance Quinn said in an email Tuesday that the department issues firearms to its officers and those in good standing are allowed to store them outside the department. The firearm can become a gift to an employee who retires, but Golubski did not get such a gift upon leaving in 2016, Quinn said.",
      "Quinn said none of the department's firearms were missing Monday morning and that \"the firearm found on scene was not the make/model of firearm used by the Edwardsville PD.\u201d",
      "In Kansas City, police officers buy the firearms they'll use on duty from a list of approved weapons and, if they cover the cost themselves, keep them after leaving the department, said spokesperson Nancy Chartrand. It was not immediately clear whether Golubski did that.",
      "Christopher Joseph, Golubski's lead attorney, said in an email Tuesday that he'd expected to meet Golubski in Topeka on Monday morning and go to the courthouse, some 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Golubski's home in Edwardsville. Golubski hadn't skipped a court appearance before Monday.",
      "\u201cI was in regular contact with Roger, including over the weekend,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cI saw no warning signs. His defense team was confident about the prospect of acquittal.\u201d",
      "Joseph said Golubski himself did not believe he could get a fair trial because of media coverage of his case and that he only learned Monday morning that Golubski was despondent over that coverage.",
      "\u201cRoger\u2019s death should not be considered an admission of guilt,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cInstead, it should be a warning about the power of the media to pick a narrative and present it as truth.\u201d",
      "Golubski was at the center of a string of lawsuits and criminal allegations that led the Wyandotte County prosecutor\u2019s office to begin a $1.7 million effort to reexamine cases he worked on during his 35 years on the force.",
      "One double murder case Golubski investigated resulted in the exoneration of a man wrongfully convicted and imprisoned for 23 years, and government payments totaling $14 million to the man. A criminal justice organization run by rapper Jay-Z is suing to obtain police records.",
      "Pilate said only a small subset of Golubski's victims were willing to come forward and that his trial would have represented \u201cjust a first step toward accountability\u201d for local police and government officials.",
      "\"And then when the time finally arrived for accountability, it was yanked away from them,\u201d she said.",

      "Workers have fitted a reactor into the first nuclear power station to be built in Britain for 30 years.",
      "Hundreds of engineers and construction staff worked for several days to lift the 500-tonne steel equipment into place at Hinkley Point C, near Bridgwater, Somerset.",
      "\"It was a huge operation for all the teams involved,\" said Matt Abbott, who led the team installing it. \"This is the heart of the plant.\"",
      "The 13m-long (42.6 ft) unit is one of two reactors which will contain the nuclear chain reaction that will generate enough power for six million homes, when it opens in 2030.",
      "The giant steel cylinder was winched up the side of the reactor building in a 12-hour operation.",
      "It then had to be manoevered along rails through a giant equipment hatch, rotated through 90 degrees and lowered carefully onto a prepared base.",
      "It will stay there for 60 years of nuclear operation, and decades beyond.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband called it \"a major step forward\".",
      "He said: \u201cGetting Hinkley up and running to produce clean power for six million homes will be a win for our long-term energy independence.\"",
      "At least 12,000 people work there, alongside more than 100 cranes. The reactor will power 25m high steam generators, and drive turbines featuring the longest blades ever made.",
      "Yet the project has been delayed by political debates, the Covid pandemic and supply chain problems.",
      "It is now due to open five years later than originally planned. The estimated cost has risen to \u00a346bn from the \u00a318bn predicted in 2017.",
      "Nonetheless, installing the reactor is a significant milestone.",
      "So how does it work, who made it, and when will they switch it on?",

      "JLR announced the transition to electric vehicles in 2021, keeping all of its three British plants open as part of the strategy.",
      "It said the decision to stop selling new Jaguar cars in the UK last month was a deliberate move to \"create some breathing space\" before unveiling its new look.",
      "The Type 00 model unveiled at a Miami art fair is a concept car and so will not go into production for sale to the public.",
      "Instead, the vehicle, which features an ultra-long bonnet and big wheels, gives a pointer to the direction of the brand's new models.",
      "Mr Glover said Jaguar had \"ripped up the rulebook\" with the new design, which is also intended to evoke Jaguars past when the brand was in its heyday.",
      "The rebrand comes with a higher price point, with Jaguar aiming for the luxury market.",
      "\"Nobody needs a vehicle at \u00a3120,000. You have to want one,\" he said.",
      "\"Overall, this has got that sense of real occasion. And that's that's what we think is perhaps missing in that luxury EV space,\" he added.",
      "But many on social media were nonplussed by the preview.",
      "James May, broadcaster and former presenter of Top Gear, said he was \"slightly disappointed\" by the design and its price.",
      "\"I wanted something more futuristic,\" he told the BBC. \"I mean, Jaguar have been saying they will copy nothing, but there's quite a bit of other concept cars in that new Jag.\"",
      "May said Jaguar cars had traditionally been \"very reasonably priced compared with, for example, Aston Martin\".",
      "\"So I'd like to see something more like half the price that they're toting at the moment.\"",
      "'Too big'",
      "Beatrix Keim, director at the Center of Automotive Research, said that Jaguar's concept car was \"too big, too unreal\".",
      "\"This is not the way to go,\" she said, given that there are already big cars in the market and \"electric cars cannot only be for the rich\".",
      "\"Of course, Jaguar is a luxury brand,\" she added. \"But I don't think that this is the direction which Jaguar at current point of time needs, because it's losing out on volume as well. And this is not a volume car.\u201d",
      "Amanda Stretton, a racing driver and motoring journalist, also said she thought Jaguar was going in the \"wrong direction\" on price.",
      "\"The market for cars in excess of \u00a3100,000 is not enormous. So Jaguar\u2019s trying to break into a market that's already tightly fought,\" she said, adding that the size of the new car appeared to be \"absolute nonsense\".",
      "\"It needs to be shrunk by about 50% to be practical.\"",

    "summary": "Demand for electric cars is lower than expected, the industry says. What might help to boost sales?",
    "story": [
      "The government is facing a backlash from car manufacturers, who claim that current rules designed to promote electric vehicles are too harsh.",
      "They say consumer demand for electric cars has fallen far short of what was expected, meaning they are struggling to sell enough.",
      "Ford insists this was a factor in its recent decision to cut 800 UK jobs.",
      "Vauxhall's owner Stellantis is to close its van-making plant in Luton - partly, it says, because of the new rules.",
      "So what could be done to encourage more consumers to buy electric?",
      "1. Subsidise the cost",
      "Electric vehicles (EVs) are generally more expensive to buy than their petrol or diesel equivalents. This is partly because they still represent a relatively small proportion of cars being built, so economies of scale \u2013 when the cost comes down the more you build \u2013 have not yet properly kicked in.",
      "The government already offers some subsidies to make EVs cheaper. They attract a low rate of company car tax, for example. Salary sacrifice schemes allow workers to lease cars cheaply through their employers, using their untaxed income, which can offer significant savings.",
      "But since the abolition of the plug-in grant for cars in 2022, there has not been a similar incentive for people who cannot get a car through their company. People within the industry believe that should change.",
      "Automotive journalist Quentin Willson, who now fronts the campaign group FairCharge, thinks the government should consider \u201cinterest free loans on used electric vehicles for lower income drivers and halve the VAT on new cars\u201d. This, he suggests, could be funded by abandoning the current freeze on fuel duty.",
      "2. Make cheaper electric cars",
      "The price of electric cars is coming down, partly due to cheaper battery packs. Despite sharp fluctuations in the value of metals used to make them, such as lithium and cobalt, battery pack prices have fallen by about 70% since 2015.",
      "This has helped reduce the price gap between electric and conventional cars. Earlier this year, Stellantis began offering the electric version of its Frontera model at the same price as the petrol hybrid model.",
      "However, that doesn\u2019t mean it is easy to find a low-budget electric car. There is a shortage of truly cheap options on the market.",
      "That is partly because a number of manufacturers have preferred to focus on more expensive and potentially more profitable models. But as Roger Atkins, founder of the Electric Vehicles Outlook consultancy, puts it, \u201ccars that cost \u00a350,000 to \u00a360,000 are not the kind of cars everyone can buy\u201d.",

      "The government says the sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in 2030 \u2013 but will it?",
      "Plans to force conventional cars off the market were originally meant to take effect in 2040, under plans introduced by Theresa May's government. But the target was brought forward to 2030 under Boris Johnson, then delayed to 2035 under Rishi Sunak.",
      "People within the industry claim the changing target has sent out mixed messages and confused consumers, leading some people to delay buying an electric car until the situation becomes clearer.",
      "According to Melanie Shufflebotham, co-founder of electric charging guide Zapmap, many drivers are \u201cconfused about dates, concerned on costs and have questions about charging.\u201d She says \u201ca consistent factual communication programme\" is needed, supported by government.",
      "4. Cut VAT on public charging points",
      "Although the cost of using public charging points can vary widely depending on the provider and the charging speed you choose, public chargers are usually more expensive than charging at home.",
      "This is partly due to tax. An EV owner charging a car on their drive will pay 5% VAT on the electricity they consume. But if they use a public charger they will pay 20%. People who are unable to charge at home are left with no choice but to pay the higher rate.",
      "The industry, EV advocates and even a House of Lords committee have called for the public rate to be reduced to 5%",
      "Consultant Roger Atkins claims the current policy is \u201cdivisive\u201d, because it \u201cfavours better-off people who can charge at home on their driveways\u201d.",
      "5. Sort out the public charging network",
      "Read any survey of potential buyers\u2019 attitudes towards electric cars, and concerns about charging infrastructure will be at or near the top. People worry about whether they will be able to find a charger at a busy service station, or in a rural area.",
      "The number of charging points is growing. According to ZapMap, as of October this year, there were 71,459 charging points across the UK, at 36,060 locations. This was a 38% increase on the year before.",
      "But not everyone is happy. Complaints from existing owners struggling to find a charging point, having to queue for a long time or arriving to find it broken are not hard to find.",
      "As more EVs come onto the roads, many more charging points will be needed. The government wants 300,000 in place by 2030 \u2013 but the current rate of expansion is not fast enough to reach it.",
      "Part of the blame appears to lie with local authorities, who are responsible for granting planning permission for new rapid charging hubs. According to Roger Atkins, the process simply takes too long.",
      "Simon Smith, of charging firm Instavolt agrees that red tape is a problem. He thinks that difficulties getting grid connections for rapid charging stations is also a \"critical barrier\" to expanding the network.",
      "\"We need greater support to address planning delays, local council resistance and grid connectivity challenges\", he says."

      "She juggles her job with being a mother of five - which is \u201creally hard\u201d.",
      "When Sophie had her fifth child by Caesarean, she was told she needed bed rest for six weeks. But she says that wasn\u2019t an option, and she went back to work immediately.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t afford to stop because I needed the money.\u201d",
      "Her life would have been much easier had she had a right to maternity leave, paid by her employer.",
      "Under a new law in Belgium - the first of its kind in the world - this will now be the case. Sex workers will be entitled to official employment contracts, health insurance, pensions, maternity leave and sick days. Essentially, it will be treated like any other job.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for us to exist as people,\u201d Sophie says.",
      "There are tens of millions of sex workers worldwide. Sex work was decriminalised in Belgium in 2022 and is legal in several countries including Germany, Greece, the Netherlands and Turkey. But establishing employment rights and contracts is a global first.",
      "\u201cThis is radical, and it\u2019s the best step we have seen anywhere in the world so far,\u201d says Erin Kilbride, a researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cWe need every country to be moving in that direction.\u201d",
      "Critics say the trade causes trafficking, exploitation and abuse - which this law will not prevent.",
      "\u201cIt is dangerous because it normalises a profession that is always violent at its core,\u201d says Julia Crumi\u00e8re, a volunteer with Isala - an NGO that helps sex workers on the streets in Belgium.",
      "For many sex workers, the job is a necessity, and the law could not come soon enough.",
      "Mel was horrified when she was forced to give a client oral sex without a condom, when she knew a sexually transmitted infection (STI) was going round the brothel. But she felt she had no option.",
      "\u201cMy choice was either to spread the disease, or make no money.\u201d",
      "She had become an escort when she was 23 - she needed money, and quickly started earning beyond expectations. She thought she had struck gold, but the experience with the STI brought her sharply back to earth.",
      "Mel will now be able to refuse any client or sexual act she feels uncomfortable with - meaning she could have handled that situation differently.",
      "\u201cI could have pointed the finger at my madam [employer] and said: \u2018You're violating these terms and this is how you should treat me.\u2019 I would have been legally protected.\u201d",
      "Belgium\u2019s decision to change the law was the result of months of protests in 2022, prompted by the lack of state support during the Covid pandemic.",
      "One of those at the forefront was Victoria, president of the Belgian Union of Sex Workers (UTSOPI) and previously an escort for 12 years.",
      "For her, it was a personal fight. Victoria regards prostitution as a social service, with sex being only about 10% of what she does.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s giving people attention, listening to their stories, eating cake with them, dancing to waltz music,\u201d she explains. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s about loneliness.\u201d",
      "But the illegality of her job before 2022 raised significant challenges. She worked in unsafe conditions, with no choice over her clients and her agency taking a big cut of her earnings.",
      "In fact, Victoria says she was raped by a client who had become obsessed with her.",
      "She went to a police station, where she says the female officer was \u201cso hard\u201d on her.",
      "\"She told me sex workers can't be raped. She made me feel it was my fault, because I did that job.\u201d Victoria left the station crying.",
      "Every sex worker we spoke to told us that at some point they had been pressured to do something against their will.",
      "Because of that, Victoria fiercely believes this new law will improve their lives.",
      "\u201cIf there is no law and your job is illegal, there are no protocols to help you. This law gives people the tools to make us safer.\u201d",
      "Pimps who control sex work will be allowed to operate legally under the new law - provided they follow strict rules. Anyone who has been convicted of a serious crime will not be allowed to employ sex workers.",
      "\u201cI think many businesses will have to shut down, because a lot of employers have a criminal record,\u201d says Kris Reekmans. He and his wife Alexandra run a massage parlour on Love Street in the small town of Bekkevoort.",
      "The massages they offer clients include \u201ctantra\u201d and \u201cdouble pleasure\u201d.",

      "Kris and his wife employ 15 sex workers, and pride themselves on treating them with respect, protecting them and paying them good salaries.",
      "\u201cI hope the bad employers will be shut out and the good people, who want to do this profession honestly, will stay - and the more the better,\u201d he says.",
      "Erin Kilbride from Human Rights Watch is of similar mind - and says, by putting restrictions on employers, the new law will significantly \u201ccut away at the power they have over sex workers\u201d.",

      "\u201cIn what other job would you need a panic button? It\u2019s not the oldest profession in the world, it\u2019s the oldest exploitation in the world.\u201d",
      "How to regulate the sex industry remains a divisive issue globally. But for Mel, bringing it out of the shadows can only help women.",

    "summary": "Once restricted to only big cities, high-end specialty coffee chains are finding new customers across India.",
    "story": [
      "\"It's not just about brewing a good cup of coffee but connecting with customers on a deeper level.\"",
      "It was this one thought that made Harmanpreet Singh leave his family bakery to open a specialty coffee shop in the northern Indian city of Jalandhar.",
      "It was an unexpected decision - coffee has always been popular in southern states, traditionally served strong and frothy in a steel tumbler. But it's still not the first choice of beverage in the vast swathes of north India, where drinking tea is an intrinsic part of the culture.",
      "For Mr Singh, the journey began in 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic when he saw a growing demand for specialty coffee, particularly among the city's youth and the overseas residents who returned to the country at that time.",
      "Recognising this shift, he moved to the southern city of Bengaluru to learn brewing techniques. \"I studied everything - from the way coffee is served to the role things like decor, cutlery, music and even packaging played in the overall experience,\" he said.",
      "Three months later, Mr Singh put his learnings to test and opened Buland Caf\u00e9 in Jalandhar.",
      "Today, the cafe has 40 outlets across the city and has become a favourite spot for the city's youth, who come here to relax or work over piping cups of coffee.",
      "The beans, roasted in various blends, are sourced from the famed coffee estates of  Karnataka. Mr Singh says he personally trained his staff on how to brew the perfect cuppa and take care of the coffee machine.",
      "\"It's a thriving scene,\" he says.",
      "Mr Singh is among a crop of young entrepreneurs that are benefitting from a wave of specialty coffee consumption in small north Indian towns and cities.",
      "India has had a vibrant cafe culture for years - but it has been largely restricted to big cities where homegrown specialty and international coffee chains dominate the market.",
      "However, post-Covid, several tier-two cities are also seeing a boom in demand for such spaces as people embrace practices like remote working and look for new places to meet their friends and families.",
      "Cafe owners say more Indians are now willing to pay more for coffee that's roasted in smaller batches and customised as per their preferences.",
      "\"Clients have become more knowledgeable about the roasts and are interested in the origins of their coffee,\" says Bharat Singhal, the founder of Billi Hu roasteries.",
      "In fact, more than 44% of the Indian population now drinks coffee, a 2023 report by CRISIL, a marketing analytical company, shows.",
      "While a lot of it comes from home consumption, the growing demand for specialty coffee in small cities plays a big part, says Bhavi Patel, a coffee consultant and dairy technologist.",
      "Roastery owners say the growth is also evident in numbers. \"Subscription based orders have surged by 50% in one year,\" says Sharang Sharma, the founder of Bloom Coffee Roasters. \"Customers have moved from French presses to pour-over or espresso machines, adopting more sophisticated brewing methods.\"",
      "While India is often associated with tea, it also has a long coffee-drinking history.",
      "The culture took shape in the 1900s when Indian Coffee Houses emerged as a hangout spot for the intellectual and elite class. Housed in colonial-styled buildings, these cafes served English breakfasts with steaming hot coffee and offered a space to discuss politics and mobilise support during pivotal periods in history.",
      "A shift occurred in the 1990s when economic reforms opened India to the world, allowing entrepreneurs to open private coffee shops frequented by young peeople, who saw it as a hip experience.",
      "Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day (CCD), which opened in 1996, quickly became one of India\u2019s most popular and widespread coffee chains. At its peak, CCD boasted over 1,700 outlets, serving as a popular gathering spot for students and young adults. But mounting debt, management issues and the untimely death of its founder led to a closure of most of its outlets across India.",
      "In 2012, the arrival of international giant Starbucks spurred the rise of homegrown specialty coffee brands like Blue Tokai Roasters, Third Wave Coffee and Subko Coffee.",
      "Mr Singhal says that while big cities like Delhi, Jaipur, Mumbai, and Bengaluru still dominate the scene, smaller cities are quickly catching up.",
      "However, it's not just changing palettes that's driving consumption. \"Often it's social media,\" Mr Singh says. \"People want good coffee but they also want to be in a space that's trendy and which they can post online.\"",
      "Nishant Sinha from Lucknow city is among those who understood the trend early on.",
      "His Roastery Coffee House offers trendy ambience, free wi-fi and cosy seating options along with an array of coffee roasts. While the beans are sourced from coffee estates in the south, the food is distinctively north Indian.",
      "Others like Jatin Khurana in the northern city of Ludhiana are experimenting with flavours.",
      "At his Urban Buhkkad cafe, Mr Khurana serves the \"Shadi Wali Coffee [the wedding coffee]\" - a wedding favourite in the 1990s, which became famous for its blend of instant coffee, milk, sugar, and a sprinkle of chocolate powder.",
      "But instead of coffee powder, Mr Khurana uses freshly grounded beans, available in different roasts and varieties, to enhance its flavours. \"The idea is to capture the essence of the beverage that many Indians grew up drinking,\" he says.",
      "It's an exciting time to be in the business - but growth comes with its own set of challenges.",
      "\"Demand is growing, but a smaller coffee shop owners tend to cut corners, whether it\u2019s by opting for substandard machines, serving weaker coffee shots, or hiring inexperienced baristas,\" Mr Singhal says.",
      "And running the business is not always profitable given the high price of coffee and the infrastructural costs involved in running such spaces.",
      "When Neha Das and Nishant Ashish opened The Eden\u2019s caf\u00e9 in Ranchi in 2021, they wanted to create a safe and relaxed space for young students to get together in the city.",
      "Today, their hazelnut coffee and cold brews have become a favourite of many.",
      "\"It took some time but longevity requires more than profit,\" Ms Das says.",
      "\"It\u2019s about dedication, crafting local flavours, and understanding customers, even if it means working with slim profit margins for the long haul.\""

      "Mohamed Al Fayed manipulated Harrods managers to conceal his crimes, sacking those he could not control, an ex-director has told the BBC.",
      "Jon Brilliant, who worked in Al Fayed's private office for 18 months, says the late entrepreneur plied him with envelopes full of cash - totalling about $50,000 (\u00a339,000)  - to try to compromise and control him.",
      "\u201cHe tried to own you. And ultimately, I got fired because I couldn't be bought,\u201d he says.",
      "Harrods didn't respond to Mr Brilliant's claims. It has previously said that it was \u201cutterly appalled\u201d by the abuse allegations, adding that it is a \u201cvery different organisation to the one owned and controlled by Al Fayed\u201d.",
      "Mr Brilliant says he was \u201chorrified\u201d when he first heard the allegations that Al Fayed had abused hundreds of women and says he \u201cbeat himself up\u201d about whether there was anything he should have questioned more.",
      "He told the BBC about surveillance, sackings, and a culture designed to keep top managers from trusting or communicating with one another.",
      "This made it harder for them to do their duty as directors to exercise independent judgement and check Al Fayed\u2019s power - or ask questions which may have revealed more to them about how he was treating women.",
      "\u201cI 100% can see how the management structure and culture was set up to cover it up, mask it from people,\u201d says Mr Brilliant.",
      "Four other former directors have anonymously confirmed elements of this picture.",
      "A US citizen, Mr Brilliant was 36 when he joined the firm in August 2000. He was hired to relaunch the Harrods online business.",
      "He says that shortly before his first business trip to visit Microsoft in Seattle, Al Fayed gave him a brown envelope containing $5,000 (\u00a33,993) in $50 notes.",
      "After the trip he tried to return the full amount. He says Al Fayed refused, asking him, \u201cYou didn't need any entertainment?\u201d",
      "Mr Brilliant replied that he did not need it - he had been too busy to visit the cinema or theatre, and someone else had paid for dinner.",
      "Receiving cash ahead of business trips - large-value notes of pounds, francs or dollars depending on his destination - continued over the following six months.",
      "Three senior colleagues suggested to Mr Brilliant at the time that Al Fayed was trying to get him to compromise himself.",
      "Mr Brilliant says they told him: \u201cHe was trying to get you to come back and say \u2018oh, I spent money on drugs or I spent money frolicking, doing something that I shouldn't have been doing,\u2019 and that he would then use that information against you if you should ever turn on him.\u201d",
      "He adds: \u201cI am certainly aware of people who... succumbed to the temptation.\u201d",
      "Mr Brilliant continued trying to return the money, until his family arrived in London and he started looking for a home. With Al Fayed\u2019s consent, he put it towards the purchase of a property.",
      "Al Fayed had form for using envelopes of cash as a tool of power and control. It had caused a scandal in the 1990s after he paid MPs to ask questions in the House of Commons - and then exposed those who had accepted his gifts.",
      "Mr Brilliant believes he was not immune to Al Fayed\u2019s extensive use of bugging and surveillance, carried out by the Harrods owner\u2019s large team of security guards.",
      "\u201cEven when I tell this story to you right now, I get kind of goosebumps and the hair stands up on the back of my neck, realising that my phones were being listened in on,\u201d he says.",
      "Mr Brilliant\u2019s first suspicion that he may have been bugged came in 2002, shortly before he was fired. After a disagreement about the funding of Fulham FC, words from a private phone conversation with someone in the US were quoted back to him in a meeting.",
      "Another former Harrods director, who wanted to remain anonymous, told us he had moved into an Al Fayed-owned property when he started at the store and one of the security team warned him it was bugged.",
      "The director says he and his wife would jokingly say \u201cgood morning\u201d to the security guards who might be listening when they woke up.",
      "He noticed that many directors kept a personal mobile phone as well as a work phone, because they feared the Harrods phone might be bugged.",
      "Mr Brilliant, who has returned to the US, says he was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d when he first heard the BBC investigation.",
      "\u201cI do look back and say, \u2018should I have seen something? Did I miss something?\u2019 And I've gone over it and over it,\u201d he says.",
      "He worked in Al Fayed\u2019s \u201cring of steel\u201d office suite on the fifth floor of Harrods, protected by two sets of security doors. There was a group of administrative assistants who were all young, blonde and attractive - he says.",
      "Mr Brilliant recalls them as \u201cobedient\u201d. He explains: \u201cThere was this notion of \u2018do this, jump, how high should I jump?\u2019 - and really being on the ball. Mohamed demanded a lot of people, and they were serving their role.\u201d",
      "He adds that he now questions whether the women acted in that way because of what may had been happening.",
      "When challenged on whether he should have done more to protect the women he says he asks himself whether he could have.",

      "'Frontal lobotomy'",
      "Mr Brilliant says Harrods\u2019 managers were set in opposition to each other and then expected to keep a watchful eye on their rivals.",
      "In addition to his core role, he was given partial oversight of a range of Al Fayed\u2019s interests, including Fulham FC and the Paris Ritz.",
      "\u201cI was asked to oversee people I had no right overseeing,\u201d says Mr Brilliant. In turn, he found that \u201cpeople were looking over my shoulder\u201d.",
      "Information was treated like a \u201ccurrency\u201d and people would jockey to share it to \u201ccurry favour\u201d with the boss, he says.",
      "This has been corroborated by an anonymous director. \u201cThere was no trust between directors,\u201d he told us. \u201cEveryone was on the defensive.\u201d",
      "In his 1997 biography of Al Fayed, journalist Tom Bower described Harrods as a \u201cmedieval court\u201d where executives\u2019 survival depended on \u201cutter loyalty\u201d and \u201ca drip of salacious gossip to sow doubts about rivals\u201d.",
      "Senior managers at Harrods were sacked with such regularity that Mr Brilliant says it was a \u201crunning joke\u201d in the store.",
      "Managers were sacked or quit so frequently that The Sunday Times began to publish a regular count, which reached 48 in 2005 - before a legal letter put a stop to it.",
      "Many dismissals ended in legal action or employment tribunals. Some were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), although Mr Brilliant was not.",
      "But some managers lasted for more than a decade. And to do that, you had to have a \u201cfrontal lobotomy\u201d said Mr Brilliant.",
      "Some, he felt, were compromised and couldn\u2019t speak out. For the others, \u201cI think you had to just do what you were told to do, do it with a smile\u2026 No original thought, no willing to challenge the status quo, just willing to accept.\u201d",
      "The BBC has tried to contact as many long-serving former Harrods directors as possible, but none were willing to give an interview.",
      "Although he only worked there for 18 months, Mr Brilliant said he wanted to speak to the BBC for two reasons.",
      "\u201cOne, if there's anything that I'm able to say or do that shows support for these women who have been horrifically treated, traumatised, I want to do whatever I can.",

    "story": [
      "Wearable tech \u2013 currently dominated by smart watches - is a multi-billion dollar industry with a sharp focus on health tracking.",
      "Many premium products claim to accurately track exercise routines, body temperature, heart rate, menstrual cycle and sleep patterns, among others.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting has talked about a proposal to give wearables to millions of NHS patients in England, enabling them to track symptoms such as reactions to cancer treatments, from home.",
      "But many doctors \u2013 and tech experts \u2013 remain cautious about using health data captured by wearables.",
      "I\u2019m currently trying out a smart ring from the firm Ultrahuman \u2013 and it seemed to know that I was getting sick before I did.",
      "It alerted me one weekend that my temperature was slightly elevated, and my sleep had been restless. It warned me that this could be a sign I was coming down with something.",
      "I tutted something about the symptoms of perimenopause and ignored it - but two days later I was laid up in bed with gastric flu.",
      "I didn\u2019t need medical assistance, but if I had \u2013 would the data from my wearable have helped healthcare professionals with my treatment? Many wearable brands actively encourage this.",
      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",
      "The Apple Watch is reported to be the world\u2019s best-selling smart watch, although sales have slowed lately.",
      "Apple didn't comment, but the tech giant uses true stories of people whose lives have been saved because of the heart tracking function of the device in its marketing, and anecdotally I have heard plenty of those too. What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOn your watch, you\u2019re not going to measure your ECG continuously because you drain your battery straight away.\u201d",
      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",
      "The alerts were genuine, and sent to her as his emergency contact \u2013 but in this case unnecessary. Ben was out at a race track driving some fast cars. He admitted that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very gifted\u201d at it \u2013 but said he felt safe at all times.",
      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",
      "Pritesh Mistry, digital technologies fellow at the Kings Fund, agrees that there are significant challenges around folding current patient-generated data into our healthcare systems, and adds that the discussion has already been going on for several years in the UK without any clear resolution.",
      "He says there\u2019s \u201ca good case to be made\u201d for the use of wearables in the UK government\u2019s current drive to push care out of hospitals and into community settings.",
      "\u201cBut without that underpinning foundation of technology enablement in terms of the infrastructure, and supporting the workforce to have the skills, knowledge, capacity and confidence, I think it\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d he adds.",

    "story": [
      "Boeing, Nike and Starbucks have all changed their chief executives in recent months. But just how important is the person in the top job for the successful running of such huge companies?",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s only one cat who\u2019s on the hot seat,\u201d says Alan Lafley, who was CEO of global consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble from 2000 to 2010, and then again from 2013 to 2015.",
      "With P&G selling everything from Pampers nappies, to Head & Shoulders shampoo, and Fairy washing up liquid, it has more than five billion customers around the world. And its workforce now exceeds 107,000 people.",
      "Mr Lafley equates leading a firm of that vast size with being the manager of one of England\u2019s Premier League football teams. Specifically, he says the job comes with the same risk of being sacked if results are not as good as expected.",
      "\u201cWith the football players, if they have a bad season, they're not gone,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead it is the coach or manager that\u2019s going to go.\u201d",
      "Coffee giant Starbucks announced a change of CEO in August, following falling sales caused by factors including a complicated menu, tough competition in China, and boycotts linked to the war in the Middle East. The hope is that new boss Brian Niccol can transform the firm\u2019s fortunes.",
      "To lure him away from the success he was enjoying running US restaurant chain Chipotle, Starbucks is paying him more than $100m (\u00a379m) in his first year, plus the use of a private jet to allow him to commute 1,000 miles from his home in California to the firm\u2019s head office in Seattle, Washington state.",
      "\u201cIt's pretty obvious that there's a big hope for him and his ability to turn that company around,\u201d says executive coach Alisa Cohn, who explains that top pay packages are set by a company\u2019s board of directors, and reflect their expectations of the CEO they\u2019re appointing.",
      "Investors welcomed Mr Niccol\u2019s appointment  with a 24.5% jump in Starbucks share price the day it was announced. The same day Chipotle fell 7.5%.",
      "Mr Niccol is now continuing efforts to simplify Starbucks\u2019 menu.",
      "\u201cCEOs are the ones who are setting the strategy for the company,\u201d adds Ms Cohn. \u201cThey're the ones setting the culture for the company, and, truthfully, the buck stops with them in terms of their accountability.\u201d",
      "Marcia Kilgore is a Canadian entrepreneur behind skincare brands Soap & Glory and Beauty Pie, plus footwear firm Fitflop. She says that the role of CEO is complicated, demanding, and critical to a company\u2019s success.",
      "\u201cYou need to have somebody who can really look at the different streams of work that need to be done, and make those organised and prioritised,\u201d she adds.",
      "\u201cAnd someone who can make sure that the different teams in the company are working together harmoniously, and ensuring that time is not wasted, money is not wasted, and energy is not wasted on things that are not going to move the dial for the company.\u201d",
      "The failure to make the right choices and lead teams in the right direction was why Mr Lafley became the boss of P&G in 2000.",
      "His predecessor Durk Jager resigned as a result of the failure of a huge global restructuring that he led. Cutting 15,000 jobs and 10 factories was meant to increase profits, but instead led to repeated profit warnings and a steep share price collapse.",
      "Mr Lafley says that as CEO it\u2019s not about doing everything yourself, but \u201cenabling and empowering everybody in the organisation\u201d to do what needs to be done.",
      "\u201cWe had 100,000 people looking to the new CEO to tell them two things \u2013 \u2018what happened?\u2019, and \u2018what are we going to do next?\u2019.\u201d",
      "He explains that he decided to refocus the firm on serving customers and innovating new products, telling staff that \u201cI have confidence that we\u2019re all going to get us out of where we are and back on track\u201d.",
      "Mr Lafley adds that clearly communicating his plans with employees was so \u201chugely important\u201d that in those pre-Zoom days he flew around the world to meet staff in person.",
      "Inspiration and communication are also seemingly at the heart of the approach of new Nike CEO Elliott Hill. On getting the job in September he wrote to staff telling them he had \u201cgreat confidence in his team and our future together\u201d despite years of falling sales.",
      "Ms Cohn who has worked with companies including Google, Etsy and Johnson & Johnson says that whatever the plans of a new CEO, confidence is vital for any success.",
      "\u201cThe most important quality that you need to be the CEO is knowing that you will be able to be the CEO,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a sense of confidence, and healthy ego that you need to bring to the table.",
      "\u201cThe second thing you need to bring to the table is an ability to adapt. You've got to be able to assess the situation, make some important decisions, and then adapt them as you go\u201d.",
      "It\u2019s not something she thinks can always be taught, which is why she says so many people get \"stuck\" at lower levels in a company. Ms Cohn adds: \u201cYou need to develop your own sort of internal state to know that you can handle the pressure, the difficulty, the spotlight\u201d.",
      "That pressure is one the reasons why top CEO\u2019s are often compensated with huge pay packages. When it comes to the S&P 500 group of the US\u2019s biggest companies last year, the top earner was Hock Tan at Broadcom who got $162m, followed by Nikesh Arora with $151m at cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, and Stephen Schwarzman with $120m at investment giant Blackstone.",
      "The average for an S&P500 CEO last year was a record $16.3m, according to executive consultants Equilar. It means they are getting 196 times as much as the average worker at their companies and critics says CEO\u2019s aren\u2019t worth that much more than their staff.",
      "\u201cThis is based on the foolish notion that the person in the corner office is somehow almost single-handedly responsible for corporate value,\u201d says Sarah Anderson from the Washington based progressive think tank the Institute for Policy Studies.",
      "She think it\u2019s a problem that is getting worse, and spreading around the world.  \u201cI think runaway CEO pay is bad for our economy, bad for democracy and bad for business,\u201d she adds.",
      "Mr Lafley agrees that the ratio between staff and CEOs\u2019 pay is \u201ctoo high\u201d, but reasons that firms are having to compete to attract the best talent.",
      "He thinks the answer lies in paying CEOs \u201ca rather modest basic salary, and then everything else is incentive\u201d.",
      "\u201cIn the end, it's sort of like a coach. If you're not motivating people, and you're not enabling them to do what you're asking them to do, then you're not doing the job.\u201d",

      "\"How is it possible to continue this coursework without understanding a British accent or English properly?\" she tells BBC File on 4.",
      "Most students paid other people to do their coursework, she explains, and some would pay people to register their attendance at lectures for them.",
      "Yasmin's experience reflects a growing concern. The University and College Union (UCU) says some institutions are overlooking language skills to receive high fees from overseas students, and one professor tells us 70% of his recent master\u2019s students had inadequate English.",
      "Universities UK - which represents 141 institutions - rejects the claims and says there are strict language requirements for students coming from abroad.",
      "Jo Grady from the UCU, which represents 120,000 lecturers and university staff, says it is an open secret that students who lack English skills find ways to come to the UK to study.",

      "In England, university tuition fees for undergraduate domestic students are capped at \u00a39,250, rising to \u00a39,535 per year in 2025-26. Each of the other UK nations set their own fees. But fees for overseas students studying in England have no upper limit.",

      "\"You can charge a foreign student as much as they're willing to pay,\" says Ms Stephenson.",
      "Post-graduate fees are not capped either, so a master\u2019s degree at an elite university could cost \u00a350,000.",
      "Because undergraduate tuition fees for domestic students in England have not kept up with inflation, there has been a real-terms cut in university funding, says Ms Stephenson - with international students, in effect, subsidising the below-cost fees of home students.",
      "One whistleblower who worked at an education provider that prepares international students for university, told us agents would target families abroad who had the money to pay.",
      "The whistleblower - who has previously also spoken to the Sunday Times - said: \"We knew that those universities are increasingly desperate and would go along with our plans without much scrutiny into how those students were being found.",
      "\"No independent party is looking at the grades or the examinations. It's the Wild West, in a way.\"",
      "The whistleblower worked for Study Group, one of dozens of providers feeding the UK university system, and taking fees from students in the process.",
      "Based in the UK, Study Group is a registered provider which says it works for more than 50 universities with a network of 3,500 agents in 99 countries.",
      "Study Group strongly disputes the whistleblower's claims, saying overseas students earn their places on merit. It adds that any decision to admit a student on to a course is taken by the university, not Study Group, and rejects the claim that entry criteria are waived for any reason.",
      "It says courses it runs are robustly \"scrutinised by partner universities\".",
      "Yasmin paid \u00a316,000 for her course in international finance at a university in southern England. She later found out that of the 100 students on most of her modules, \"maybe 80 or 90 of them bought assignments\" from so-called \"essay mills\" based overseas. In England it is a criminal offence to complete work for a student which they can pass off as their own.",
      "When Yasmin told her tutor what was happening, he took no action. Yasmin says she now feels her master\u2019s degree has been \"devalued\".",
      "A Russell Group university professor, who has taught at several universities and wants to remain anonymous, echoes Yasmin's concerns. He tells File on 4 that 70% of his students at master\u2019s degree level over the past five years did not have sufficient English language skills to be on the course.",
      "\"There have certainly been occasions when very simple questions have not been able to be understood by students who I am teaching,\" he says.",
      "The professor told us he has had to adapt his teaching technique, and says students even use translation apps in class. But he insists fault does not lie with international students themselves, who are mostly trying their best, and says the situation varies from subject to subject.",
      "They pass, he says, because courses are often assessed through assignments, rather than exams. Some students use essay mills and pay for others to write their work or, increasingly, use artificial intelligence (AI). Both methods, he says, can defeat current anti-plagiarism software.",
      "UCU\u2019s Jo Grady says it is hardly surprising some students with poor English skills feel they need help from other people, or even use AI to do their work, as an \"act of desperation\".",

However, she says \"university managers and leaders pursue it regardless, because of the money and income it will bring in\".",

      "Ms Stern says international students are attracted by the quality of the UK's universities and says it would be \"unwise\" to rely on international income to fund domestic education and research, because overseas student numbers could be affected by geopolitics or shifts in exchange rates.",
      "Meanwhile, international student numbers are falling. Data on UK student visa applications from the first half of this year shows there has been a 16% decline in applications, resulting in a loss of income for some institutions. This drop is, in part, being attributed to changes in UK student visa rules preventing most postgraduate students from bringing dependents.",
      "It is contributing to the worst financial crisis for universities since fees were first introduced. Last month, the government regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), estimated that by 2025-26, 72% of universities could be spending more money than they have coming in, and warned that \"rapid and decisive action is necessary\".",
      "The Department for Education told the BBC a reliance on overseas students has been identified as a risk, and many universities will have to change their business models, adding that the government is committed to managing migration carefully."

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 01:12:07 GMT",
    "summary": "The fashion guru spoke to the BBC ahead of a new Vogue show looking back on the industry's history.",
    "story": [
      "Anna Wintour walks into our interview with her trademark dark glasses firmly on.",
      "I\u2019m meeting the woman who has been editor-in-chief of Vogue magazine since 1988 at VOGUE: Inventing the Runway, the show dreamt up by Wintour about the history of the catwalk.",
      "Our rendezvous is in a large underground space and we\u2019re surrounded by three vast screens. It\u2019s fairly dark inside but the sunglasses remain in place during our conversation.",
      "I tentatively ask what they\u2019re for. Are they a shield or for something more prosaic, short-sightedness perhaps?",
      "\u201cThey help me see and they help me not see,\u201d Wintour tells me, somewhat enigmatically. \u201cThey help me be seen and not be seen. They are a prop, I would say\u201d.",
      "The Lightroom in London uses digital projection and audio technology in a high-walled space to generate an immersive experience for visitors.",
      "It has previously hosted a blockbuster David Hockney show and Tom Hanks\u2019s exhibition on the history of space travel.",
      "Now the exhibition space gives audiences a front-row seat at some of the most spectacular fashion shows in history, tapping into Vogue\u2019s archive and contributor network.",
      "Wintour admits that \u201cfor someone who goes to so many shows, you get a little, not jaded, but you get used to the experience\".",
      "Since most visitors to the exhibition will not have had the chance to attend such events, she says they were keen to make sure it felt as though they were actually there.",
      "As the reigning queen of the fashion world, Wintour has had a real front-row seat for decades - often on a delicate gold chair, the kind of furniture that is ubiquitous at the high end catwalk viewings where her invitation is always a dead cert.",
      "In the blurb to the exhibition, Wintour writes that she has \u201cprobably spent a year of my life waiting for fashion shows, which are famously tardy, to begin\u201d.",
      "She tells me the American designer Marc Jacobs once held a runway show that was an hour and a half late, but \u201cwe all yelled at him so much after that, the next season, he not only started the show on time, he actually started five minutes early\u201d.",
      "The Italian designer Gianni Versace, though, was \u201calways on time\u201d,",
      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter who wasn\u2019t there, it could have been the Pope, he didn\u2019t care\u201d.",
      "That would have suited Wintour, who is \u201chorribly punctual, usually early\u201d.",
      "She arrives early for our interview. Fortunately, I\u2019d been warned it was a character trait and we were ready.",
      "The Vogue show offers audiences a series of vibrant chapters, narrated by Cate Blanchett, which tell the story of fashion and the runway.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite nostalgic to sit in the space and look at the incredible changes that have happened in fashion,\" Wintour tells me.",
      "We\u2019re treated to a series of the magazine's front covers from the early days, black and white footage of the first catwalk shows and images of the couture salons of the early twentieth century.",
      "Fashion then was \u201cvery elitist - you had to be invited and it was a very tight little world,\u201d says Wintour.",
      "Contrast that with the debut show by the musician and entrepreneur Pharrell Williams for Louis Vuitton in 2023. A pop-culture event, it was held on the Pont Neuf in Paris, with the likes of Beyonce, Rihanna and of course Wintour in attendance, and got one billion views online.",
      "The democratisation of fashion means, as Wintour puts it, \u201cnow everyone can come to the party, which is as it should be\u201d.",
      "The exhibition also takes us back to 2017 when Karl Lagerfeld devised a space-station inspired runway set, complete with a rocket blasting off as models stood beside it decked in Chanel. Wintour told me it was \u201cextraordinary\u2026 and you couldn't wait to see what he was going to come up with next\u201d.",
      "Lagerfeld had form. Ten years earlier for Fendi, he had broken new ground, using the Great Wall of China as a catwalk, his models parading along the stone. Fashion designers of his stature clearly don\u2019t do things by halves.",
      "To insiders, Wintour has been one of the most significant players in fashion for the best part of 40 years - a maker of careers, an advocate for the power of fashion to meld with the A-list of entertainment.",
      "She\u2019s the driving force behind the annual Met Gala in New York, which sees the worlds of fashion and fame collide and go viral in a spectacle of outrageous outfits and celebrity appearances on the first Monday of every May.",
      "Those not on the inside are more likely to wonder just how closely Wintour resembles Miranda Priestly, the fictional tyrannical magazine boss from the film The Devil Wears Prada, whose portrayal by Meryl Streep is seared into the memories of fans.",
      "\u201cIs there some reason that my coffee isn\u2019t here? Has she died or something?\u201d Priestly inquires dismissively about her assistant.",
      "\u201cDetails of your incompetence do not interest me,\u201d she later tells her.",
      "On Wintour\u2019s trip to London, she leant in to the comparison, attending the gala performance of the new musical version of the film. There, she told the BBC that it was \"for the audience and for the people I work with to decide if there are any similarities between me and Miranda Priestly\u201d.",
      "When we spoke, I wanted to know if she finds the public persona of Anna Wintour - the sharp, bobbed hair, the meticulous outfits, the glasses - a role she feels she has to perform.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really think about it,\" she says. \"What I\u2019m really interested in is the creative aspect of my job.\"",
      "Wintour tells me she only brought one or two suitcases with her to London and she won\u2019t be drawn on whether she dresses down when she\u2019s at home in the US. \"It\u2019s really about respect in how you present yourself.\"",
      "More than one person has told me that nobody ever says 'no' to Wintour. Donatella Versace says the same in the recent Disney documentary, In Vogue: The 90s.",
      "Wintour demures. \u201cThat is absolutely untrue. They often say no, but that\u2019s a good thing. No is a wonderful word\u201d.",
      "Do you think people are frightened of you, I ask her. \u201cI hope not,\u201d she replies.",
      "Under her leadership, through talent, force of personality and an eye for what sells, Wintour has tried to future proof Vogue, turning it into a global brand. She is also global content advisor for Conde Nast, the magazine's publisher.",
      "In the modern era, when influencers can take photos of fashion moments and pump them out immediately, Wintour has successfully positioned Vogue as an arbiter of taste and style.",
      "Fashion and advertising are entwined in Vogue's content but Wintour doesn\u2019t accept my premise that fashion journalism can be sycophantic.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s simply not true and it\u2019s sometimes, I think, frustrating to us that work in fashion, that there is an outside perception fashion is frivolous and superficial.",
      "\"In fact, it\u2019s a huge business. We give employment to millions of people around the world.\"",
      "I take that answer to mean that Wintour, the daughter of a former editor of the Evening Standard newspaper, sees herself more as a fashion ambassador than a journalist.",
      "But of course she is also a journalist, arguably one of the most famous journalistic faces on the planet - and one that has no obvious successor.",
      "I ask her, at 75, how much longer she plans to stay in her role.",
      "\u201cI have no plans to leave my job,\u201d she says, adding: \u201cCurrently.\u201d",

      "\"Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen\" he says, before later adding \"keep telling yourself that you was a mom\".",
      "Nelson sued her son for defamation in 1999 over another of his hits, My Name Is, but later said it was her lawyer\u2019s idea and settled out of court for $25,000 (\u00a319,000).",
      "The rapper, who battled his own problems with prescription drugs, connected his own experiences of addiction with his mother's, stating \"that's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom\" on the 2009 track My Mom.",
      "In 2008, Nelson wrote a memoir titled My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem, in which she said she was \"heartbroken\" over her son's claims about her.",
      "However, the toxicity in their relationship appeared to simmer down over the years.",

      "They appear to have remained mostly estranged for the rest of her life, but when Eminem was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2022, she publicly congratulated him.",
      "\u201cMarshall, I want to say, I could not let this day go by without congratulating you,\u201d she said in a video that was later deleted.",

      "The event in west London was everything you imagine an awards ceremony for the chronically online to be like. There were endless photo opportunities, more ring lights than people - and some creators seen refreshing their follower accounts during the ceremony.",
      "Those who won awards told the BBC about how they rose to stardom on the video platform, and expressed their views on whether short social media videos were contributing to \"brain rot\" - the supposed deterioration of a person's mental state due to over-consumption of low-quality or unchallenging online content.",

      "The singer/rapper said his latest track is \"not just a song\" but \"a statement\".",
      "The video begins with the Grammy-winning star declaring live on ITV's Good Morning Britain programme that \"African problems need to be solved by Africans\".",
      "It follows Ed Sheeran saying last month that Band Aid had not asked for permission to re-use his vocals from a 30th anniversary version of their track. He then credited Fuse ODG, who had declined the offer to take part in the project, for updating his view of the situation.",
      "Sheeran said: \"A decade on and my understanding of the narrative associated with this has changed, eloquently explained by @fuseodg\".",

      "\"It's been touching seeing the efforts that were put into it initially, the British public and different celebrities coming together to support a good cause, because there was a crisis at the time they needed attending to,\" he said.",
      "\"I have no problem with that, I think that was fantastic, and even just watching it back, I'm even getting emotional.\"",
      "\"But in that act of kindness, in that process of trying to help a crisis, we created another identity crisis,\" he continued.",
      "\"As a child who's now grown up in this era of images like that, Band Aid and initiatives like it have put Africa as a place of famine, a place of poverty, disease-filled.",
      "\"It took away our collective sense of pride and identity. So in the middle of trying to solve a temporary crisis, we've caused another dangerous crisis, which is an identity crisis for a whole continent.\"",

      "\"It hit me that the images that the Band Aid project portrays just did not align with our mission to portray Africa in a positive light.\"",
      "Speaking about the debate, Midge Ure recently acknowledged the criticisms of Band Aid's approach in the modern climate, saying it was \"unfortunate\" that Sheeran had not been contacted about the 2024 mix.",
      "\"I understand the whole thing about the 'white saviour complex',\" he told Radio 2's Jeremy Vine. \"It's not new. We've had this thrown at us for 40 years.\"",
      "However, he said the song was not about portraying Africa in a negative light, but was trying to show the real-life consequences \"of famine, of war, of conflict\".",

      "The status of the sculptures has been a source of diplomatic tension between the UK and Greece for decades.",
      "Greece says they were stolen, but the British Museum rejects that and says they were legally obtained. Talks between Greece and the museum have been going on since 2021.",
      "What are the Elgin Marbles?",
      "'Every Greek felt offended' - how Athens sees the Elgin Marbles row",
      "Prof Stamatoudi, who advised the Greek culture minister during previous Elgin Marbles negotiations, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme she believes \"a deal is close\" but was unsure if it was \"close enough\".",
      "She said the Greek government has proposed a \"cultural, strategic partnership\" which would involve other antiquities being sent to the British Museum to fill the gallery which would be left vacant by any return.",
      "Negotiations over what could be sent to the British Museum are \"secret\", Prof Stamatoudi said, adding that while she is not personally involved in this round of talks, she believes it would involve \"antiquities that attract public attention\".",
      "Prof Statamoudi said securing the return is something \"all Greeks are passionate about\" as the antiquities are widely considered to be part of the country\u2019s \"cultural heritage\".",
      "Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has made securing the return of the Elgin Marbles a political priority.",
      "The issue caused a diplomatic spat last year when then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak cancelled a planned meeting with Mitsotakis after he indicated he would use it to raise the issue.",
      "The previous government said the sculptures should remain in the museum. In opposition, Labour's view was they wouldn't stand in the way of a loan arrangement between the British Museum and Athens if one was arranged.",
      "Government sources in Athens have told Greek media Mitsotakis wants to \"pick up the thread\" with Starmer following a meeting between the pair in November 2023.",
      "Earlier this week, Greek government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis said Mitsotakis would raise the issue again with Starmer but that it was more of a matter for the British Museum than the government.",
      "He also denied a Sky News report that three private meetings had taken place between senior Greek officials and  members of the British Museum board of directors.",
      "Asked if they discussed the potential return of the marbles, Starmer's official spokesman said: \"The government's position is that we have no plans to change the law that would permit a permanent move, and that the case of decisions relating to the care and management and sculptures are a matter for the trustees for the British Museum, which is operationally independent of the government.\"",
      "Downing Street also said the government had not been asked to consider any return proposal by the British Museum.",
      "Starmer is thought to be more open to the statues being relocated than his predecessor, providing a deal can be struck between the Greek government and the British Museum.",
      "The Elgin Marbles were crafted in the 5th century BC and were originally displayed in the Parthenon in Athens. They are considered among the most prized antiquities from the Ancient Greek period.",
      "They were removed by British aristocrat Lord Elgin while Athens was part of the Ottoman Empire and were badly damaged en route to London, where they have been displayed since.",
      "A law called the 1963 British Museum Act prevents the removal of objects from the British Museum's collection.",
      "The trustees of the British Museum are exploring the possibility of a special loan arrangement with Greece.",
      "But the Greek government has previously said it will not agree to a loan as this would acknowledge the British Museum's ownership of the sculptures.",

    "story": [
      "In Beatles '64, the new documentary which charts the impact of the band's first US tour and how it catapulted them to global superstardom, Paul McCartney makes a suggestion as to why they achieved so much so quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen we came, it was quite shortly after Kennedy had been assassinated,\" he said.",
      "\"Maybe America needed something like The Beatles to be lifted out of sorrow.\"",
      "Beatles scholars and cultural historians have long remarked upon how much of a lift the band gave to an America in mourning.",
      "But was McCartney right? Was the rise of the world's most famous band partly down to the murder of the 35th president of the United States?",
      "Did The Beatles crack America because Kennedy was killed?",
      "'Unstoppable force'",
      "When The Beatles landed at the recently-renamed John F. Kennedy International Airport on 7 February 1964, it was just 70 days after the the 46-year-old Democrat had been murdered.",
      "Kennedy was shot as his motorcade drove through Dallas, Texas, on 22 November 1963 and his death threw his country into a period of mourning.",
      "Dr Patrick Andelic, assistant professor of American History at Northumbria University, said it was a moment that shook the nation to its core, partially because of JFK's own pop culture persona.",
      "\"In a sense, Kennedy was the first TV president, which was relatively new at this point,\" he said.",
      "\"By the beginning of the '60s, 90% of American families had TVs, so the way news and media was consumed totally changed.\"",
      "He said the president was, like The Beatles, \"young, handsome, witty and energetic, which translated really well to TV\".",
      "\"He embraced television and was well suited to it,\" he said.",
      "\"And that makes the shock and trauma of his death sharper in the aftermath.",
      "\"It was the first killing of a sitting president in 60 years.\"",
      "It was, of course, TV which also helped The Beatles become a phenomenon in their homeland.",
      "Settling on their now final line-up of Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr in 1962, the Liverpool four-piece had already scored two number one albums in 1963 with Please Please Me and With The Beatles.",
      "When that success was coupled with the famous 1963 Royal Variety Performance appearance during which Lennon asked \"the people in the cheaper seats to clap their hands\" and the rest to just \"rattle their jewellery\" they became a national sensation.",
      "Senior music industries lecturer Dr Holly Tessler, from the University of Liverpool, said it was that show that \"made them stars overnight\".",
      "\"At this point, The Beatles were an unstoppable force in the UK,\" she said.",
      "Fear of failure",
      "The Beatles' youthful exuberance was central to their success, chiming with the legions of British teenagers that had begun to follow them.",
      "Dr Andelic said in America, JFK had a similar appeal.",
      "\"Kennedy projected youth and vitality and in his inaugural address, he spoke of the torch being passed to a new generation of Americans,\" he said.",
      "\"His death cut that short in a shocking way.\"",
      "He said in the aftermath, the nation started \"to look for more positive things, stability and reassurance\".",
      "\"When The Beatles arrive, I think they represented that.",
      "\"They were also young, vital, and [in the footage] of them getting off the plane, they were being silly.",
      "\"So, for a nation shattered by a trauma, The Beatles represented an opportunity to laugh and have fun again.\"",
      "Winning over a portion of America's youth was one thing, but cracking the national market was another.",
      "Many British acts had tried and failed to mirror the transatlantic appeal of their US counterparts, who had seen great chart success in the UK, and crack the American market.",
      "There had been limited success for those that came before The Beatles.",
      "Lonnie Donegan, the titular \"King of Skiffle\", had two top ten hits, while Cliff Richard, then the biggest act in Britain, had only made it into the US top 40 on one occasion.",
      "Spencer Leigh, author of many books on The Beatles, said the trend of British acts failing to \"make it\" in the United States, had seen Capitol, one of the country's biggest record companies, even refuse to distribute The Beatles' music for fear of the same result.",
      "\"Artists from the UK didn't sell well in America and it seemed Capitol looked down its nose at the British work,\" he said.",
      "Capitol's concerns were understandable. The singles Please Please Me, From Me To You and She Loves You had all been released in the US in 1963 and seen limited success, so they were reluctant to put out I Want To Hold Your Hand.",
      "The band's manager Brian Epstein and Capitol's parent company EMI managed to change the label's minds and on Boxing Day 1963, about a month after Kennedy's assassination, the single hit America's stores.",
      "Its impact was huge and by the first week of February, it was at the top of the US charts, a position it would hold for seven weeks.",
      "The success meant more than 3,000 fans and a large press pack were at the airport when the band touched down.",
      "For Spencer Leigh, it was what came next, not what had happened before, that led to their global success.",
      "\"My view is the people screaming for The Beatles at the airport were young and didn't know much about politics,\" he said.",
      "\"For me, the turning point was the Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "'Fleeting at best'",
      "At 20:00 on 9 February 1964, The Beatles made the first of three appearances on the programme, which was one of America's most popular TV variety shows.",
      "The TV channel CBS reportedly received more than 50,000 requests for seats at its 700-capacity studio ahead of the band's visit and those who failed to get their hands on any huddled excitedly around TVs at home.",
      "\"More than 70 million people watched the first one and they performed so well,\" Leigh said.",
      "He said one of the moments that really caught the audience's attention was when cameras panned to each band member, flashing their names on the screen.",
      "\"They put a caption on John Lennon saying 'sorry girls he's married',\" he said.",
      "\"I'm not sure how much [the band] appreciated that.\"",
      "About a month after those first three performances, The Beatles made US chart history by becoming the first act to hold the top five slots simultaneously.",
      "Beatlemania had now gone global and the rest was history.",
      "For Dr Tessler, the notion that America went down with the death of JFK and back up with the arrival of The Beatles is too simplistic.",
      "For her too, it was the Ed Sullivan Show appearances, rather than the assassination aftermath that set The Beatles on the road to pop immortality.",
      "\"I really struggle with the idea that The Beatles owe their US success to JFK being shot,\" she said.",
      "\"Their manager Brian Epstein had already been to America and done the deal to get them on the Sullivan show weeks before Kennedy was killed, and there was so much hype when the band finally landed in the US.",
      "\"America might have wanted a distraction from that feeling of 'what's next' after the assassination, but The Beatles became the story so quickly that the connection to Kennedy was only fleeting at best.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 02:40:03 GMT",
    "summary": "The musician says winning the Mercury Prize helped put an end to his \"desperate\" search for approval.",
    "story": [
      "When Michael Kiwanuka was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2020, he thought he knew the deal.",
      "He'd been up for the prestigious album award twice before. Like most artists, he said it was an honour to be nominated. A win would be nice, but not particularly life-changing.",
      "He was wrong.",
      "When Annie Mac ambushed him on The One Show to reveal it was third time lucky, a switch was flipped.",
      "\"It sort of woke me up,\" the singer-songwriter reveals.",
      "\"I'd been desperately looking for approval from my peers and certain [media] outlets - and the Mercury freed me from that desperation.",
      "\"It allowed me to feel that, actually, I just want to make the records that come naturally.\"",
      "The realisation was particularly powerful because his winning album, simply titled Kiwanuka, had grappled with his sense of inferiority as a musician, a black man, a partner and a friend.",
      "External validation didn't silence the voices in his head - but it gave him a healthy dose of perspective.",
      "\"When you have impostor syndrome and you\u2019re busy beating yourself up, you're actually using up all your energy doing that, as opposed to being like, 'Wow, how amazing it is to be making my own record?', or, 'How amazing that I'm playing the Pyramid Stage [at Glastonbury]?'",
      "\"The list is so long of how cool this job is, and I spent most of my time moaning. Winning the Mercury kicked off that feeling of, oh, I've got to sort this out.\"",
      "You could see that newfound freedom when he played at Glastonbury in June. Basking in the late afternoon sun, the 37-year-old took to the stage wearing a bright white kanzu robe - a traditional tunic from Uganda, where his parents are from.",
      "And when a malfunctioning synthesizer forced him to abort a performance of his new song Small Changes, the former perfectionist just laughed it off.",
      "\"I could hear my friend Joe laughing, and I sort of forgot I was on the Pyramid Stage,\" he recalls.",
      "\"A second later, I heard the crowd cheer, and it lifted me up off the ground.",
      "\"It was an amazing feeling. I felt like I had a massive battery pack from these people. I could do no wrong. Wherever I went, they would hold me up.\"",
      "Afterwards, the musician realised that one simple moment of fallibility had put the audience on his side.",
      "\"They saw the real me for a second, rather than what I thought people wanted to see,\" he reflects. \"It was really eye-opening.\"",
      "It\u2019s a little odd to hear the musician describe himself as a people pleaser.",
      "Since the release of his debut album Home Again in 2012, his music has worked in opposition to the trend-chasing virality of modern pop. His grooves are unhurried and thoughtful, his lyrics deeply introspective, and his inspirations - such as Isaac Hayes, Bill Withers and Marvin Gaye - decidedly old-school.",
      "His second album, Love & Hate, brought him to international attention after its opening track, Cold Little Heart, was picked to be the opening theme for hit TV show Big Little Lies,  starring Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman.",
      "Kiwanuka, released in 2019, earned him the Mercury Prize and his first Grammy Award nomination. But the densely-arranged, sumptuous soul often pushed his voice back in the mix \u2013 something he has confronted on his latest record, Small Changes.",
      "\"I fell in love with my voice again, which sounds weird,\" he says. \"But I realised being able to sing, and to have a voice that sounds good on recording, is a blessing.",
      "\"So I started to want that to be heard more than all the other stuff - the drums or the guitars or the strings. And that really aided the sound of the record.\"",
      "Chart battle",
      "The result is his smallest, most understated album to date. Aided once again by producers Inflo and Danger Mouse, he has created a suite of spacious, slow-burning confessionals that compel you to lean in and pay attention, slowly revealing their beauty on repeated listens.",
      "Reviews have been ecstatic. Awarding a score of 9/10, Uncut magazine called it \"rich, moving and inventive\", while Dork said the \"perfectly-balanced\" collection was \"genuine, gracious, and absolutely first-class\".",
      "The record is locked in a two-way battle for this week's UK number one album with Kendrick Lamar\u2019s surprise release GNX \u2013 but you get the impression Kiwunka won't pay too much attention to chart positions.",
      "For him, fulfilment came in the studio, surrounded by some of his favourite musicians -  including legendary bassist Pino Palladino and Janet Jackson\u2019s producer Jimmy Jam, who popped in to say hello and ended up contributing organ parts to half of the record.",
      "Each song is about a small change Kiwanuka has made in his life - confronting depression, rediscovering the innocence of childhood, and weathering the ups and downs of marriage.",
      "His languorous voice can tend towards the melancholy, but the lyrics are full of hope. \u201cSmall changes solve the problems,\u201d he sings on the title track.",
      "Despite that, the album was written during a period of major upheaval, as Kiwanuka moved away from London, became a father, and stared down the barrel of middle age.",
      "\"I realised, at the age of 37, it\u2019s the first time I can talk about something that happened 10 years ago, and I was still an adult,\" he laughs.",

      "She then joined a pineal cyst support group, mainly consisting of young women, who believe such cysts are to blame for debilitating symptoms.",

      "Led by neurosurgeon Prof Thomas Santarius, the study involved patients being assessed by various specialists, and documenting their symptoms before and up to three years after the operation.",
      "Prof Santarius said: \u201cThe study showed that the treatment is effective and safe.",

      "\"Some of these abnormalities are quite common, but rarely cause any problems.",
      "\"For a link to be made with a scan finding, and for surgery to be proposed, there has to be a plausible mechanism for symptoms to be produced and a reasonable expectation that the symptoms will be resolved by surgery.",
      "\"And surgery is, of course, not without risks. For any surgery, the risk of operating has to be less than the risk of not operating.\"",
      "Pineal cysts symptoms can be caused if the cyst is big enough to obstruct the passage of cerebrospinal fluid - the fluid constantly produced by the brain, which bathes and supports it, he added.",
      "\"In this case, pressure inside the head can rise, causing headache and very occasionally more serious problems.",
      "\"By and large surgeons will not offer surgery if this is not the case.",
      "\"But in the case of cysts of the pineal gland, there is a large amount of information on the web which prompts patients to seek surgery for minor and often unrelated symptoms.",

More than 500 Britons have died at Dignitas in the past two decades, including 40 last year. The lethal medication must be self-administered.",

It has since been extended to children - the only European countries to allow this. Both allow euthanasia - or physician-assisted dying.",
      "Most recently, Spain and Austria have legalised assisted dying for both terminal illness and intolerable suffering. In Austria, the drugs must be self-administered, whereas in Spain a medical professional can administer them.",
      "Despite the variation, what\u2019s clear is that eligibility for assisted dying is far wider across Europe than is being proposed anywhere in the British Isles. MSPs at Holyrood are to debate a similar bill covering Scotland as that being voted on at Westminster.",

      "I\u2019m currently trying out a smart ring from the firm Ultrahuman \u2013 and it seemed to know that I was getting sick before I did.",
      "It alerted me one weekend that my temperature was slightly elevated, and my sleep had been restless. It warned me that this could be a sign I was coming down with something.",
      "I tutted something about the symptoms of perimenopause and ignored it - but two days later I was laid up in bed with gastric flu.",
      "I didn\u2019t need medical assistance, but if I had \u2013 would the data from my wearable have helped healthcare professionals with my treatment? Many wearable brands actively encourage this.",
      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",
      "The Apple Watch is reported to be the world\u2019s best-selling smart watch, although sales have slowed lately.",
      "Apple didn't comment, but the tech giant uses true stories of people whose lives have been saved because of the heart tracking function of the device in its marketing, and anecdotally I have heard plenty of those too. What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOn your watch, you\u2019re not going to measure your ECG continuously because you drain your battery straight away.\u201d",
      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",
      "The alerts were genuine, and sent to her as his emergency contact \u2013 but in this case unnecessary. Ben was out at a race track driving some fast cars. He admitted that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very gifted\u201d at it \u2013 but said he felt safe at all times.",
      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",
      "Pritesh Mistry, digital technologies fellow at the Kings Fund, agrees that there are significant challenges around folding current patient-generated data into our healthcare systems, and adds that the discussion has already been going on for several years in the UK without any clear resolution.",
      "He says there\u2019s \u201ca good case to be made\u201d for the use of wearables in the UK government\u2019s current drive to push care out of hospitals and into community settings.",
      "\u201cBut without that underpinning foundation of technology enablement in terms of the infrastructure, and supporting the workforce to have the skills, knowledge, capacity and confidence, I think it\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d he adds.",

      "\"Currently victims might not be told who their stalker is - leaving them potentially walking past them on street without them knowing,\" she told the Today programme.",
      "The change is part of the government's plans give more protection to victims of stalking in England and Wales - with Home Secretary Yvette Cooper pledging the government will use \"every tool available\" to take power away from abusers.",
      "About one in five women aged 16 and over in England and Wales have been a victim of stalking at least once, official figures show.",
      "The government said it had worked with broadcaster and activist Nicola Thorp, whose stalker is serving a 30-month jail sentence, in developing the new protections.",
      "Ms Thorp had been unable to find out the identity of her stalker until he appeared in court.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Thorp said the \"right to know\" would have been crucial in relieving the \"psychological impact\" of her experience.",
      "\"Well-meaning police officers felt worried they were going to breach this guy's right to anonymity and GDPR - so he had his identity protected. I felt like a sitting duck - and I started to suspect everybody\".",
      "\"It would have given me some form of power back in my life to know who this man was - but more importantly, who he wasn't,\" she added.",
      "Under the new measures, Stalking Protection Orders - which can ban alleged stalkers from contacting or being within a certain distance of their victims - will be made more widely available, the government said.",
      "The changed approach will see courts able to impose these orders after a conviction even when one was not in place before a criminal trial, in a change to the current system - where one needs to have been issued beforehand.",
      "Offenders will also be prevented from contacting their victims from behind bars, the Home Office said.",
      "If an accused person is acquitted, courts will still be able to apply protection orders on them if there is sufficient evidence indicating they still pose a risk to someone.",
      "Cooper said victims \"have been subject to debilitating and vicious abuse at the hands of stalkers\" who \"use any means necessary\" to monitor and control their lives.",
      "\"Today's measures are an important part of our cross-government mission to halve violence against women and girls in a decade,\" she added.",

      "The department will also set out national standards on stalking perpetrator programmes to ensure consistency across England and Wales",
      "The changes in policy come after a major review - carried out by three police watchdogs - found in September that victims of stalking are not being protected enough by police forces in England and Wales, leaving some at \"serious risk\".",
      "Stalking victims failed by police, report finds",
      "Stalking super-complaint launched against police",

    "story": [
      "A World War Two veteran has said she is \"angry\" and \"heartbroken\" after a meeting with a minister left her believing the government will not consider changing its policy of freezing the state pensions of some British citizens who live overseas.",
      "Anne Puckridge, who turns 100 this month, had travelled from her home in Canada to lobby the government.",
      "She is one of just over 453,000 British pensioners living abroad who do not get any annual rise in their state pension.",
      "Pensions Minister Emma Reynolds agreed to a meeting after a request to see Sir Keir Starmer was turned down due to \"pressures on his diary\".",
      "Following the meeting in Parliament, Ms Puckridge said she had been left feeling \"bitterly disappointed\" and \"disgusted\".",
      "She said she had got the impression Reynolds had been \"polite enough and kind enough to come in and spend her time with us but I think her mind was made up before we even started the meeting\".",
      "Ms Puckridge said she and her fellow campaigners would have to think \"very carefully about what we really can do from now\" although she added they would do something.",
      "Ms Reynolds said she thanked Ms Puckridge for the meeting and for sharing her experiences.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said the government understood that \"people move abroad for many reasons, and we provide clear information on how this can impact their finances in retirement \u2013 with the policy on the uprating of the UK state pension for recipients living overseas a longstanding one\".",
      "The spokesperson said the government was \"deeply proud of our veterans and their families for the contribution they make to our country\".",
      "Previous governments have rejected calls to uprate frozen pensions, citing the cost as a barrier.",
      "A source with knowledge of a previous government's approach suggested that unfreezing the pensions would not be as simple as it might appear and risked opening the door to legal challenges.",
      "How much is the state pension going up?",
      "Ms Puckridge has received \u00a372.50 a week since she moved to Canada in 2001, at the age of 76, to be nearer her daughter.",
      "Her state pension is now less than half the \u00a3169.50 paid to pensioners still living in the UK.",
      "She told the BBC frozen pensions affect every aspect of life.",
      "\"You\u2019ve got to be careful about entertainment,\" she said.",

      "\"You feel you\u2019ve lost all sense of dignity, the government has thrown you away, you know, out of sight out of mind.\"",
      "Ms Puckridge said when she informed the DWP she was moving to Canada \"they never said a word about [my] pension being frozen\".",
      "\"The first I knew about it was when my first raise was due,\" she said.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t get it. So I wrote and asked about it, and I was told no... you will receive no more from the day you left the UK, no more increases in pension.\"",
      "She added: \"It\u2019s the injustice of it that is so unfair, the fact that we were never warned.\"",
      "Under an arrangement called the triple lock, the UK state pension goes up each year by either 2.5%, inflation or earnings growth - whichever is the highest figure.",
      "Not all pensioners who move abroad have their pensions frozen.",
      "The UK has agreements in place with EU countries and the United States, among others, to continue increasing pensions in line with the amount received by UK residents.",
      "Canada, Australia, New Zealand and India are among the countries which do not have agreements.",
      "Campaigners say that creates an injustice.",
      "Patrick Edwards, who lives in Australia and is also part of the End Frozen Pensions campaign, said they had paid in like everyone else but were now being \"treated differently merely because of their address\".",
      "\"If they lived in many other countries around the world they\u2019d be getting the same as people in the UK but unfairly they\u2019ve been selected as having had their pensions frozen,\" he said.",
      "There is diplomatic pressure to change the policy too.",
      "The Canadian government is understood to have raised the issue with the new government already.",
      "The Australian government made repeated representations to the last government and a spokesperson said it would continue to raise it at \"appropriate opportunities\".",
      "There appears to be little disagreement that politically it is difficult to justify the different treatment of overseas pensioners between countries.",
      "The Institute for Economic Affairs think tank, which has often questioned the sustainability of the state pension, said: \"The government should always be trying to save money, but this does not look like a particularly principled way of doing so.\"",
      "However, previous governments have argued that individual pensioners would be unlikely to benefit overall, as many also get financial support from governments, like Canada and Australia, which would be reduced as a result.",
      "They have also cited the cost of fully restoring frozen pensions as a barrier.",
      "In 2019, the Conservative government estimated it would cost \u00a3600m to fully restore pensions to the level they would have been if they had not been frozen.",

      "Plans to speed up the removal of unsafe cladding, including target dates for making buildings safe and tougher penalties for refusing to act, have been announced by ministers.",
      "Under the plans, buildings higher than 18 metres - defined as high-rise - with dangerous cladding covered by government-funded schemes will be fixed by the end of 2029.",
      "By the same date, unsafe cladding in buildings over 11 metres should either be fixed or have a date for completion, otherwise landlords will face penalties.",
      "Housing Secretary Angela Rayner said she was taking \"decisive action\" but campaigners said the proposals were \"extremely disappointing\" and would \"only make a horribly complicated process worse\".",
      "The drive to remove certain types of cladding from buildings was triggered by the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire which killed 72 people.",
      "An inquiry into the tragedy found that the building's cladding, made from combustible material, was the \"principal\" reason for the fire's rapid spread.",
      "In the years since the fire, there have been efforts to remove similar materials from other tower blocks.",
      "But seven years on from the fire only a third of tower blocks have been fixed and around half a million people are still living in mid and high-rise flats with unsafe cladding.",
      "Watchdog says cladding removal deadline may be missed",

      "I heard years of Grenfell testimony. Here's why the disaster could have been prevented",
      "The lengthy process of identifying what work needs to be done and who should pay for it has left many residents living in fear of fires or with worries over costly repair bills.",
      "The housing department had previously estimated that works in buildings over 11 metres in England would be completed by 2035.",
      "However, earlier this year the UK's spending watchdog, the National Audit Office warned that this target would be missed unless the process was speeded up.",
      "It also estimated that up to 60% of buildings with dangerous cladding had still not been identified.",
      "The government has now produced a remediation acceleration plan which it says will \"get buildings fixed quicker, ensure rogue freeholders are held to account, and put the end in sight for affected residents\".",
      "The government says the new deadlines it has set, requiring action by 2029, will be backed by investment in enforcement.",
      "It also says 29 developers, covering 95% of the buildings being fixed, have committed to \"more than doubling the rate at which they have been assessing and starting to fix unsafe buildings\".",
      "Housing Minister Alex Norris said developers could face fines or even criminal sanctions if the deadlines are not met.",
      "\"We will use whatever options it takes - we are drawing a line in the sand,\" he said.",

      "However, End Our Cladding Scandal, a group representing leaseholders impacted by unsafe buildings, said that they are \"still far from a comprehensive solution\" on building safety.",
      "The group said in a statement: \"Labour's remediation acceleration plan is extremely disappointing. These proposals will only make a horribly complicated process worse with further layers of bureaucracy.",
      "\"The government may be patting itself on the back by announcing a target date for all high-rise buildings in government-funded schemes to have been remediated; however, the building safety fund first opened for registrations in June 2020, so a target date of nine years from then is underwhelming.\"",

    "summary": "A funding award of \u00a315,000 to the band was blocked by former Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch.",
    "story": [
      "Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has said it is \"unbelievable\" that the Labour government have decided to no longer contest a discrimination case brought by Belfast rap group Kneecap.",
      "The group won its case against the UK government over a decision Badenoch took when she was a minister to withdraw an arts grant.",
      "The group was awarded \u00a314,250 - the same amount they were initially granted.",
      "A government spokesperson said the decision was made not to continue contesting the band's challenge as \"we do not believe it is in the public interest\".",
      "They added: \u201cThis government\u2019s priority is to try to reduce costs and help protect the taxpayer from further expense.\"",
      "Badenoch described the move as \"yet another cowardly decision after giving away the Chagos Islands\".",
      "\"Labour will always capitulate rather than defend UK interests,\" a spokesperson for the Conservative leader added.",
      "The decision to block the grant, taken by Badenoch when she was business and trade minister, was described in court by Kneecap's barrister as \"unlawful and procedurally unfair\".",
      "In a statement, the band said Badenoch and her department had \"tried to silence us and they have failed\".",
      "The band said it would split the \u00a314,250 equally between two youth organisations who work with Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland \"to create a better future for our young people\".",
      "Kneecap originally applied for a grant allocated to support UK-registered artists in global markets in December 2023.",
      "The group, who have faced controversy for their lyrics and political outlook, were successful in their application, but were subsequently blocked from receiving the funding after an intervention by the Department for Business and Trade.",
      "At the time, then-UK Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch's spokesperson said they did not want to hand taxpayers' money \"to people that oppose the United Kingdom itself\".",
      "The band's music and marketing heavily features themes relating to Irish republicanism and opposition to British rule in Northern Ireland.",
      "The group have courted controversy and it claimed it was told a 2019 tour, entitled Farewell to the Union, had angered the then Conservative government.",
      "Kneecap have also antagonised unionists in Northern Ireland - one of their best known records is called Get Your Brits Out, a parody rap in which the band go on an imaginary, drug-fuelled night out with prominent members of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).",
      "In statement following Friday's court hearing, band member DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed said: \"For us this action was never about \u00a314,250, it could have been 50p.\"",
      "The group said its motivation for taking the case was \"equality\".",
      "\"This was an attack on artistic culture, an attack on the Good Friday Agreement itself and an attack on Kneecap and our way of expressing ourselves.\"",
      "In a statement following the settlement, Badeonch's spokesperson said \"this case is not about whether a band promotes violence or hates the UK, as Kneecap clearly do; this is about whether government ministers have the ability to stop taxpayers' money subsidising people who neither need nor deserve it\".",
      "\"Labour would rather waste your money than stand up to a group of Irish republicans who go to court because the UK government won\u2019t hand them cash.\"",
      "'Generosity and support'",
      "Kneecap have said it will split the money awarded to them between two Belfast charities, Gl\u00f3r Na M\u00f3na in Ballymurphy and RCity Belfast on the Shankill Road.",
      "Sarah Jane Waite, director of RCity Belfast, expressed the charity's thanks for the \"generosity and support from Kneecap\".",

      "Feargal Mac Ionnrachtaigh, executive director of Gl\u00f3r Na M\u00f3na, said it was a \"pleasant surprise\" to receive news about the funding.",
      "The club, based in west Belfast, was previously attended by Kneecap member Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh, known by his stage name Mo Chara.",
      "Mr Mac Ionnrachtaigh added that they are a grassroots group in a disadvantaged area, and the money will be put to \"good use\" including towards the construction of a new building.",
      "\"The key for us is... 25 years after the Good Friday Agreement, we have built a sector through the medium of Irish, but we're still finding ourselves in mobile huts and substandard accommodation,\" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.",
      "\"This donation goes to the heart of that.\"",
      "Mr Mac Ionnrachtaigh said Mo Chara was part of the \"new generation\" of Irish-medium youth availing of the Gl\u00f3r Na M\u00f3na's services, and added he would be speaking to the group on Friday evening to thank them for the donation.",
      "\"The idea of creating social change through youth, through art, through culture is what Kneecap are ultimately about and what both of these youth projects are ultimately about,\" he said.",

      "Who are Kneecap?",
      "Kneecap are an Irish-speaking rap trio from west Belfast who have courted controversy with their provocative lyrics and merchandise.",

      "Of all of this new government\u2019s big promises, getting economic growth up and immigration down are the two biggies \u2013 and their early months in office show just how hard achieving either, let alone both, will be.",

      "And immigration, both legal and illegal, via small boat crossings, has ballooned in recent years.",

      "For some it can be described more bluntly: people breaking into the country, with those with the job of stopping it failing.",
      "As Nick Robinson sets out here after a week of reporting on this for the Today Programme on Radio 4, the huge amount of people desperate to reach the UK and other countries like it is not likely to shrink significantly.",
      "And so the political argument revolves around what can be done to put people off trying.",
      "One thing that does put people off, but politicians have no control over, is the weather.",
      "The boats that are used are incredibly flimsy for a sea journey. I have seen and touched them, when visiting Border Force in Dover. They are made of the same stuff as a bouncy castle.",
      "So it is not surprising that when the weather isn\u2019t great, and in particular when there are plenty of waves, fewer crossings are attempted.",
      "The Home Office classifies each day according to the weather, with those judged to have the most benign conditions on the water called 'red days'.",
      "Between mid October and mid November this year, there was the highest concentration of so-called red days in any month since the big uptick in small boat crossings in 2021.",
      "Of the 31 days between those dates, 26 fell into that category and 6,288 people crossed the  Channel.",
      "In the same period last year there were three red days and 768 arrivals.",
      "But expect to see the Conservatives brand this as a \u2018dog ate my homework excuse\u2019 or words to that effect.",
      "They will argue that the abandonment of the previous government\u2019s plan to send some migrants to Rwanda has meant the removal of a crucial deterrent to potential crossings.",
      "When Yvette Cooper and the shadow home secretary Chris Philp debate this in the Commons on Monday afternoon, we can expect the Rwanda policy to be a big part of the conversation.",
      "Cooper will attempt to, at least, partially itemise where the \u00a3700m spent on the idea went.",
      "She will claim that the cost of the four people who volunteered to go to Rwanda was the equivalent of the total cost of the state education of a single child in England.",
      "The home secretary will instead claim that focused on what is described as the \u2018upstream problem\u2019 \u2013 where smuggling gangs initially recruit people to make the long journeys to the West \u2013 is key.",
      "Last week she was in the Kurdistan region of Iraq to sign a deal to try to tackle the gangs and ensure the speedy return of failed Iraqi asylum seekers.",

      "Announcing the appointment, the prime minister said he wanted a \"complete re-wiring of the British state\" and that there was \"no-one better placed\" to do that than Sir Chris.",
      "As someone who has worked for the civil service since the early 1990s, Sir Chris has plenty of civil service experience.",
      "Depending on your perspective that either makes him an ideal candidate who understands how to fix the system's problems or an establishment figure, wedded to the status quo.",
      "His appointment was greeted with delight by Lord Jim Bethell, a former health minister who worked with Sir Chris during the Covid pandemic.",
      "\"When the killer zombies invade, I'd like Chris Wormald at my back,\" he posted on social media.",
      "Ex-health secretary Sajid Javid described Sir Chris as \"brilliant and dedicated\" while another former health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he was a \"natural reformer\" who knew \"where the bear-traps are\".",
      "However, another former colleague has been less complimentary.",
      "Dominic Cummings, a senior No 10 adviser during the pandemic, said: \"Today should be a wake-up call to all investors in UK and young talent.",

      "Chris Wormald to become new civil service head",
      "Cabinet Secretary to step down on health grounds",
      "What is the UK Covid inquiry and how does it work?",
      "In May 2016, Sir Chris became the most senior civil servant in the Department of Health and over the next eight years worked with no fewer than seven different secretaries of state from Conservative Jeremy Hunt through to Labour\u2019s Wes Streeting.",
      "In that role, he oversaw important policies and decisions made after Covid emerged. And also \u2013 crucially \u2013 in the years before the virus started spreading, when planning for a pandemic was meant to be taking place.",
      "He has already given evidence on three separate occasions to the public inquiry into the government\u2019s handling of the crisis.",
      "Following one of his evidence sessions, one lawyer for the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice group accused him of providing \"an object lesson in obfuscation, a word salad, so many, many words, so very little substance\".",
      "In November 2023, the Covid inquiry published text messages he exchanged with his then-boss, Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill.",
      "These were sent on 12 March 2020, less than two weeks before the country entered its first national lockdown.",
      "In the messages, Lord Sedwill wrote: \u201cPresumably like chickenpox we want people to get it and develop herd immunity before the next wave. We just want them not to get it all at once and preferably when it\u2019s warm and dry.\u201d",
      "Sir Chris replied: \u201cExactly right. We make the point every meeting, they don\u2019t quite get it.\"",
      "Around that time, the government was forced to deny it had a plan to develop so-called herd immunity by accepting that younger, fitter people would catch the virus.",
      "Asked about this at the time, Sir Chris accepted he had been \u201cvery, very loose\u201d in his language but was, in reality, following scientific advice.",
      "Writing on X following Sir Chris's appointment on Monday, Cummings was fiercely critical of his role at the time.",
      "\u201cMany officials came to me in panic when they realised the cabinet secretary and permanent secretary of the health department in charge of pandemic planning truly believed that the faster everyone got Covid, the better,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cHe is now in charge of the entire system. Plan accordingly!\u201d",
      "Cummings also accused Sir Chris of being \u201cembedded deeply\u201d in the infected blood scandal and repeatedly telling ministers \u201cuntruths about the documents\u201d.",
      "In 2018 Sir Chris did write letters of apology after it emerged two former health ministers were incorrectly told all documents linked to infected blood had been placed in the National Archives, when campaigners later established that was not the case.",
      "Three years later, in 2021, Sir Chris then recused himself from any decisions related to the scandal.",
      "It later emerged that his father Peter, who was himself a Department of Health official from 1978 to 1981, was involved in meetings and decisions related to Britain\u2019s Blood Products Laboratory and had provided written evidence to the infected blood inquiry.",
      "Sir Chris was born in London in 1968 and went to Rutlish School in Merton, the same school former Prime Minister Sir John Major had gone to over 20 years earlier.",
      "He studied at St John's College, Oxford and on graduating almost immediately joined the civil service, starting out as a fast stream trainee in the Department for Education.",
      "Over the next 20 years he rose through the ranks, serving across Whitehall including at the Department for Communities and Local Government and in the office of the then-Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.",
      "Now at the pinnacle of his career, it had been widely-known that Sir Chris was on the final shortlist to be the prime minister's new cabinet secretary, alongside Antonia Romeo, who leads the Ministry of Justice, and Tamara Finkelstein, the top civil servant at the environment department.",
      "Nevertheless his appointment came as a bit of a surprise in Westminster, where there was a feeling that Sir Chris's time had been and gone.",
      "While some civil servants privately share Cummings' assessment of their new boss, those in the health department may welcome the fact that the top job has been given to someone who understands the NHS.",
      "Getting down NHS waiting lists is one of the prime minister's priorities and he may have had this in mind when picking Sir Chris.",
      "Another factor in the selection could be Sir Chris's relatively low media profile.",
      "Bruised by the brief tenure of his well-known chief of staff Sue Gray, the prime minister will hope that Sir Chris largely continues to go under the radar of the wider public's consciousness."

      "For the first time in almost a decade, MPs will vote on Friday on giving terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to have an assisted death. While it\u2019s something that remains illegal in most countries, more than 300 million people now live in countries which have legalised assisted dying.",

      "The proposed bill in England and Wales comes with safeguards supporters say will make it the strictest set of rules in the world, with patients needing the approval of a High Court judge. Critics on the other hand say changing the law would be a dangerous step that would place the vulnerable at risk. They argue the focus should be on improving patchy access to palliative care.",

      "The US",
      "Across the US, assisted dying - which some critics prefer to call assisted suicide - is legal in 10 states, as well as in Washington DC. Oregon was one of the first places in the world to offer help to die for some patients, in 1997, and so has more than 25 years\u2019 experience. It has become the model on which other US assisted dying laws have been framed.",
      "In Oregon, assisted dying is open to terminally ill, mentally competent adults expected to die within six months - and must be signed off by two doctors. Since 1997, 4,274 people have received a prescription for a lethal dose of medication - with 2,847 (67%) deaths.",
      "Two thirds of patients in the state who asked for help to die last year had cancer. Around one in 10 had a neurological condition and about the same proportion had heart disease. Of the 367 patients who took a lethal dose of medication last year, the vast majority (91.6%) said loss of autonomy was a key concern, while others cited:",

      "Oregon is important for supporters of assisted dying in England and Wales as they point out it has remained restricted to terminally ill adults since its introduction. However, opponents say some of the rules have been relaxed. A residency requirement has been lifted, which means it is open to people from outside the state. The number of assisted deaths has also risen substantially over the years.",
      "Canada",
      "Canada is the country often cited by opponents of assisted dying as an example of the so-called \"slippery slope\" - a place where assisted dying has been extended and made available to more people since it was first brought in. Medical assistance in dying (Maid) was introduced in 2016, initially just for the terminally ill.",
      "This was amended in 2021 and extended to those experiencing \"unbearable suffering\" from an irreversible illness or disability. It\u2019s still due to become available to those with a mental illness in three years, despite delays.",
      "Critics say the more the law is widened, the more disabled and vulnerable people will be put at risk. There has also been a dramatic growth in the number of people using Maid. Four in 100 deaths in Canada are now medically assisted, compared to about one in 100 in Oregon.",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the MP who proposed the assisted dying bill in Westminster, says the Canadian system is not what is being debated for England and Wales, where eligibility would be restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Europe",
      "Across Europe, six countries have some form of legalised assisted dying: Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Austria. In all of them - unlike the proposals in England and Wales - help to die is not restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Switzerland was the first country in the world to create a \u201cright to die\u201d when it made assisted suicide legal in 1942. It is one of the few countries which allows foreigners access to help to die via organisations like Dignitas, in Zurich. More than 500 Britons have died at Dignitas in the past two decades, including 40 last year. The lethal medication must be self-administered.",
      "The Netherlands and Belgium both legalised assisted dying more than 20 years ago for patients experiencing unbearable suffering from an incurable illness, including mental health issues. It has since been extended to children - the only European countries to allow this. Both allow euthanasia - or physician-assisted dying.",
      "Most recently, Spain and Austria have legalised assisted dying for both terminal illness and intolerable suffering. In Austria, the drugs must be self-administered, whereas in Spain a medical professional can administer them.",
      "Despite the variation, what\u2019s clear is that eligibility for assisted dying is far wider across Europe than is being proposed anywhere in the British Isles. MSPs at Holyrood are to debate a similar bill covering Scotland as that being voted on at Westminster.",
      "A bill to allow terminally ill adult patients to die if they have 12 months or less to live has nearly passed all its stages in the Isle of Man parliament. The legislation is likely to get Royal Assent next year and the first assisted death on the island could happen in 2027. There is a residency requirement of five years. Jersey has also committed to changing the law to allow assisted dying for the terminally ill.",
      "Australia and New Zealand",
      "In the past few years voluntary assisted dying has become legal across most of Australia. While in New Zealand, patients must be terminally ill and expected to die within six months. That is extended to 12 months for those with a neurodegenerative condition in eligible parts of Australia.",
      "In both countries, patients can self-administer the lethal medication. But it can also be administered by a doctor or nurse, usually via an intravenous injection.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 01:12:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Governments don\u2019t want to tell people they\u2019re going to have to pay more, argues an expert.",
    "story": [
      "It is the perfect start to a holiday: your plane ticket is cheap, your cabin baggage is safely stowed, the engines are roaring into life - and the pilot has announced that there\u2019s no need to worry about the environmental impact.",
      "This is Jet Zero, a vision where air travel is entirely carbon neutral thanks to new technology and green ventures that offset the environmental impact. The plan was drafted in 2022 when Boris Johnson was prime minister, marking a step towards the government\u2019s legal obligation to reach net zero by 2050. The Labour government has since made a similar pledge, and in addition it wants all domestic flights and UK airport operations to reach zero emissions by 2040.",
      "This is no easy feat when you consider the scale of the challenge: one passenger taking an economy-class flight from London to New York generates 309kg of carbon dioxide, which would take roughly a year to absorb via 10 mature trees.",
      "Multiply this on the global scale and the aviation industry would need to plant roughly 100 billion mature trees each year to offset its emissions. For UK emissions alone you\u2019d need a forest almost the size of Wales.",
      "So, just how realistic is the plan to hit Jet Zero by 2050? And what is the knock-on cost for passengers?",
      "Earlier this year, Anthony Browne, who was the aviation minister in the Conservative government at the time, said that he thought any increase in ticket prices would be \u201cmarginal\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe don't think the difference will be noticeable to most consumers,\u201d he said.",
      "But some experts claim that politicians are not being realistic. Sir Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, argues that there \u201cdefinitely would be higher cost\u201d.",
      "\u201cGovernments desperately don\u2019t want to tell people they\u2019re going to have to pay for what they do.\u201d",
      "But ultimately, the cost depends on which methods are employed to cut or reduce emissions.",
      "From sharklets to UltraFans",
      "The previous government said that it aimed reach Jet Zero by focusing on \"the rapid development of technologies\u201d, as well as operational improvements and - among other things - more sustainable fuel types.",
      "This is not an entirely new quest. Aircraft around the world have been steadily getting cleaner since 1969 when the first high-bypass turbofan engines were used on the new Boeing 747 aircraft. In the years since there have been other innovations including sharklets, or upturned wing tips on modern planes that reduce drag and save, on average, 4% of fuel per trip.",
      "More developments are in the pipeline, including a new type of jet engine, developed by Rolls Royce, called the \u201cUltraFan\u201d, which will reduce average fuel consumption by 10%.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s a gearbox, the turbine can run very fast, much more efficiently, the fan can run slower and be much bigger,\u201c explains Simon Burr, a director at Rolls-Royce.",
      "The problem is that, though it was first tested in 2023, it\u2019s unlikely to be available on commercial aircraft until the 2030s because of production lead times - and even then, a 10% improvement is impressive but not a game changer.",
      "Aviation\u2019s CO2 emissions come primarily through jet engines using carbon-rich fossil fuels, which produce CO2 when burned, so there have been attempts to create an alternative type made from renewable biomass and waste resources, known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).",
      "The first SAF flight ran between London and Amsterdam in 2008 using fuel derived from a mixture of Brazilian babassu nuts and coconuts.",
      "Now the British government says that 22% of all jet fuel from UK aviation has to come from sustainable sources by 2040. But this comes with further challenges.",
      "In the UK, SAF is mainly made from cooking oil, some of which is shipped from Asia, and shipping is responsible for 2% of global CO2 emissions.",
      "Alternative methods of creating SAF require large quantities of electricity as part of the manufacturing process. This would involve a vast amount of renewable energy to make it sustainable.",
      "\"It's very hard, to think there is such a thing as a sustainable aviation fuel,\u201d says Sir Dieter Helm. \u201cThere are aviation fuels that are less polluting than the ones being used at the moment, and you can use elements of biofuel and chip fat and so on.",
      "\"Think about the scale that's required to do it.\u201d",
      "Remapping the sky",
      "There is another more unexpected way that airlines could reduce emissions. That is, making their flight paths more direct to reduce fuel consumption.",
      "Currently most planes fly on routes determined by a network of beacons, many of which were put in place decades ago. As a result they don\u2019t always fly by the shortest route, but \"airspace modernisation\", as it is known, will allow for straighter paths to destinations.",
      "Satellite technology is required to do this: aircraft flying over the Atlantic used to have to fly at least 40 miles apart, but the satellite technology means that aircraft can in theory fly as close as 14 miles apart, allowing more aircraft to fly on the direct flight paths.",
      "The Jet Zero Strategy estimates that this, together with other fuel efficiency improvements, could cut emissions by as much as 15% by 2050.",
      "But the National Air Traffic Services (NATS), which control most flights in and out of England and Wales, caution that these changes are neither easy nor quick. \u201cIt's a very, very complicated thing to do,\u201d warns Chris Norsworthy, director of future planning.",
      "\u201cThe national infrastructure change of this type takes many years. The deployments we've made already are years in the making.\u201d",
      "The electric plane race",
      "Hidden away in a mini aircraft hangar of sorts, just outside Bristol, inventor Stephen Fitzpatrick has spent seven years working on a pioneering aircraft that could be the basis of another solution. His carbon fibre creation, known as VX4, has eight propellers and looks like a giant drone, but what's crucial is that it doesn\u2019t use fuel. Instead it is powered by lithium-ion batteries similar to those in electric cars.",
      "The batteries alone weigh 800kg, which brings the first challenge: the sheer weight limits how far it can fly.",
      "Mr Fitzpatrick says the VX4 will have a range of around 100 miles to begin with. \u201cEach year the batteries that we use will improve... Over time, we\u2019ll be able to develop a hybrid powertrain, probably using hydrogen fuel cells and batteries, and that will increase the range further.\u201d",
      "The prospect of replacing jet engine-powered long-haul flights is, however, remote. \u201cThere is no battery chemistry in the world that will give us the energy we need to take hundreds of passengers over the Atlantic,\u201d he concedes.",
      "Harnessing hydrogen in other ways may be a better bet.",
      "The British-American aircraft company, ZeroAvia, says it expects to have an 80-seater powered entirely by hydrogen in the air within two to three years. Airbus is developing something similar.",
      "Both are propeller planes, however, with limited speeds and ranges.",
      "The pricetag for passengers",
      "The reductions from SAF, fuel efficiency improvements and zero carbon aircraft will only cut aviation emissions by around a third, according to the previous government's estimates. So another part of the Jet Zero strategy involves a pricing scheme to charge airlines for CO2 emissions and carbon offsetting.",
      "Airlines already pay a duty for each flight someone takes in the UK, a cost that is passed to passengers. In much of the UK (excluding Scotland) this adds \u00a37 to each domestic flight, \u00a314 to short-haul ones and \u00a392 for long-haul. But carbon offsetting means paying another fee.",
      "Some schemes have been highly controversial, with questions around how to prove how many trees have been prevented from being cut down.",
      "Cait Hewitt, policy director at the Aviation Environment Federation, is concerned that the current informal offsetting projects may be counterproductive: \u201cThey could actually have made that problem a bit worse over time by giving consumers the false impression that the emissions from their flight [are] being cancelled out somehow by an offset.\u201d",
      "The Lebanon ceasefire is a respite, not a solution for the Middle East",
      "How service charges in flats spiralled out of control",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "Duncan McCourt, chief executive of Sustainable Aviation, an umbrella group for UK airlines, airports, manufacturers and others in the business, is optimistic that removing carbon from flying won\u2019t add much more than a few pounds to the cost of an airline ticket.",
      "\u201cWe think we can do it while enabling people to continue to fly and continue to get that benefit of flying, such as connecting people, such as being able to go on holiday,\u201d he says.",
      "But the Jet Zero plan says nothing directly about the knock-on cost to passengers. Instead, it refers to \u201cdemand management\u201d.",
      "Sir Dieter Helm has his own take on what Jet Zero means for holidaymakers and fully believes that it will lead to higher costs. As for the likelihood of the government hitting its Jet Zero target on time, he is unconvinced of this too, but he also suggests that this may not be the point.",
      "\u201cIt depends whether you think Jet Zero is\u2026 genuinely a target and they mean to achieve it. I'm really sceptical about the second.\u201d",
      "And now, the number of flights taken annually by people in the UK is projected to rise even further, translating into an additional 150 million more flights a year. So the scale of the government's challenge, which was large enough when it began, is only set to grow.",

      "I didn\u2019t need medical assistance, but if I had \u2013 would the data from my wearable have helped healthcare professionals with my treatment? Many wearable brands actively encourage this.",
      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",

What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOn your watch, you\u2019re not going to measure your ECG continuously because you drain your battery straight away.\u201d",
      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",
      "The alerts were genuine, and sent to her as his emergency contact \u2013 but in this case unnecessary. Ben was out at a race track driving some fast cars. He admitted that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very gifted\u201d at it \u2013 but said he felt safe at all times.",
      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The most popular mobile games in the UK are being advertised without disclosing they contain loot boxes - random in-game purchases which critics say are \"exploitative\" and \"foster addiction\".",
      "The regulator, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), says it bans and removes ads which fail to make the clear whether or not a game contains a loot box.",
      "But a BBC investigation found only two of the top 45 highest-grossing games on the Google Play store actually followed those rules.",
      "Dr Jane Rigbye, chief executive of Young Gamers & Gamblers Education Trust (Ygam), called the findings \"deeply concerning\".",
      "\"In the absence of robust regulation in gaming, it is essential for games to provide clear and transparent information about their features, allowing both parents and gamers to make informed decisions,\" she said.",
      "In a statement, the ASA said: \"This is an ongoing area of our work, and we\u2019re closely monitoring the sector to discover the scale of compliance and act accordingly.\"",
      "However, some say the regulator lacks the teeth to deal with the problem.",
      "\"The ASA, although it has upheld some complaints, it takes so long to properly process all of these things - they will go to a company and say, 'you should comply', but they don't comply,\" said Leon Y  Xiao, a video game regulation researcher at the IT University of Copenhagen.",
      "\"People are walking into a video game not knowing the potential risks, and this is assuming that people have even understood the risk of loot boxes to begin with.\"",
      "What is a loot box?",
      "Loot boxes contain random digital items that gamers can only reveal through gameplay or - more controversially - by making a payment.",
      "Game-makers have previously defended them as being akin to a chocolate egg containing a plastic toy, with children not knowing exactly what they are getting until the egg is bought and opened.",
      "But critics say they are in fact a form of gambling, with a report in 2022 by the Norwegian Consumer Council concluding they \"often involve exploiting consumers through predatory mechanisms, fostering addiction, targeting vulnerable consumer groups and more.\"",
      "The same year, the UK government resisted pressure to regulate loot boxes, saying the video game industry could self-regulate instead.",
      "Trade body Ukie published guidance in July 2023, including the requirement to disclose loot boxes prior to games being purchased, which the industry was given a year to comply with.",
      "But, more than 12 months later, the BBC has discovered the vast majority of major mobile games containing loot boxes are still flouting the rules, with most games only disclosing their presence if would-be players tap a small information button on the Play Store.",
      "Adrian Hon, head of game developer Six to Start, said the games industry had a track record of \"conveniently ignoring or forgetting regulations that might interfere with their ability to sell to players\".",
      "\"We know that many people, including children, struggle with overspending on loot boxes,\" he said, adding they were deliberately designed to be \"habit-forming\".",
      "\"The least that games companies could do is disclose the presence of loot boxes, but they won't even do that - it's an indictment of their priorities and lack of care towards vulnerable players.\"",
      "Non-compliance",
      "The BBC checked the adverts for the top 45 highest grossing games on Google's Play Store, which along with Apple's App Store are where the vast majority of people access mobile games.",
      "Of those 45, 26 were labelled as including loot boxes - 22 of which were being actively advertised at the same time.",
      "However, only two of those titles spelt out the presence of the loot boxes in their ads.",
      "The highest-grossing game on the Play Store to contain loot boxes, Monopoly GO, was among those not to mention random in-game purchases in its adverts.",
      "The game has been downloaded more than 50 million times, generating more than $3bn (\u00a32.37bn) in revenue according to the IP's owner Hasbro.",
      "Mr Xiao told the BBC the findings were in line with preliminary results of his own research, which has also found around 90% of games containing loot boxes are not disclosing this in their ads.",
      "The BBC has approached Hasbro, Meta and the ASA for comment.",
      "Zo\u00eb Osmond, CEO of GambleAware, said she was \"extremely concerned\" about \"gambling-like activities\" becoming normalised for children.",
      "\"We know from our previous research that many children have reported how their online spaces are 'saturated' with content which often blurs the lines between gaming and gambling,\" she said.",

    "title": "Could a thermal camera reveal your home's hidden heat loss?",
    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 00:05:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Thermal imaging tech has become cheaper and homeowners are using it to track down heat loss.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s like X-ray vision \u2013 for heat loss. Last year, web engineer Jamie Matthews bought a thermal imaging camera. His home, in the southeast of England, was about to give up some of its secrets.",
      "The colourful images on the device\u2019s small screen soon revealed how his loft hatch was letting him down.",
      "\u201cThat was really obvious on the camera,\u201d he says, explaining that he could see cool areas on the hatch, where heat was apparently escaping.",
      "Mr Mathews, who runs a software company that supplies the clean tech industry, also found some other small gaps in external walls and parts of his roof that appeared less well insulated than others.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good fun and it certainly shows up things that may not be immediately obvious,\u201d he says.",
      "While Mr Matthews was able to draught-proof some areas himself, he says he would take a more methodical approach if he were planning any major changes to his home. The web engineer later had a professional heat loss survey carried out when he installed a heat pump, for example.",
      "That approach is sensible, according to building physics researchers who spoke to the BBC. There are signs that thermal cameras are becoming more popular, as homeowners seek to slash their heating bills and carbon emissions. Local councils are increasingly allowing residents to borrow the devices for free, for example.",
      "But there is no substitute for professional advice if you are planning big works or interventions, experts say.",
      "Thermal cameras work by using a sensor to detect infrared light, which we cannot see, but which we can sometimes feel as heat. Such devices aren\u2019t cheap. Mr Matthews spent roughly \u00a3160 on his, though organisations including local councils and energy supplier Octopus Energy do loan them out to people free of charge so that they can gain a basic understanding of heat loss in their homes.",
      "Wiltshire Council recently made 11 devices available to borrow from local libraries, as well as a brief guide on how to use them. There has been \u201chuge uptake\u201d says Cllr Ian Blair-Pilling, such that the council now has a waiting list for interested residents.",
      "\"Expert advice, combined with a measured approach to the findings from thermal imaging, will give residents the best chance of making informed decisions about energy-saving home improvements,\" says Cllr Blair-Pilling.",
      "Small interventions could help people keep their homes warm and reduce the risk of cold-related health conditions, he adds.",
      "However, Jo Atkinson, senior consultant in buildings decarbonisation at Energy Systems Catapult, a research organisation, expresses concern over the growing availability of thermal cameras: \u201cIn my opinion, the risks are too great for making the wrong choices.\u201d",
      "It is possible to misinterpret thermal camera images, she says, noting that if a wall has been warmed by the sun, an image of that wall taken outside could make it look as though heat is escaping, when it is not. Reflective surfaces can also appear, misleadingly, to be leaking heat.",
      "While using a thermal camera as a starting point for understanding your home is \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d, according to Ronita Bardhan at the University of Cambridge, it is important to ask for independent expert advice when planning any renovation works.",
      "Thermal camera imagery can make it look as though some areas of your home are losing a lot of heat, but this might simply be a result of how the camera has been calibrated, how the user holds it and moves it around, and which colour palette was chosen for the display.",
      "Dr Bardhan adds that there is a risk of triggering \u201cretrofit anxiety\u201d in homeowners.",
      "Plus, if people go on to alter their insulation, for example, such measures should be taken with great care as improper installation can cause damp and mould.",
      "North Somerset Council provides thermal cameras to residents, on loan, and this scheme is also currently operating on a waiting list basis due to its popularity. The Council has published introductory advice on how to use the cameras, including an online video.",
      "The Centre for Sustainable Energy (CSE), a charity, highlights a more detailed guide from the National House-Building Council, which describes how to use thermal cameras. However, a CSE spokeswoman adds that the organisation still recommends people seek expert advice.",
      "Phil Steele, future technologies evangelist at Octopus Energy, agrees: \u201cYou have got to be careful.\u201d Thermal cameras can, for instance, make the corners of rooms look very cold but this is simply a reflection of reduced air circulation in those areas, rather than an insulation problem, he explains.",
      "Octopus Energy has around 500 cameras that it loans out to customers every winter. Last year, the firm distributed the devices roughly 3,800 times.",
      "Thermal camera-wielding homeowners who have spoken to the BBC, such as Mr Matthews, say they have treated the imagery with caution.",
      "Louise Green, a designer in London, says she read online training materials before using a thermal camera to search for points of heat loss in a house shortly after she and her partner moved in.",
      "In her case, Miss Green rented the camera from Library of Things, a community-focused organisation that makes various items available for people to borrow. The device indicated loss of heat around windows and doors in Miss Green\u2019s home. She and her partner were able to compare the results to their neighbour\u2019s better-insulated property.",
      "\u201cIt just confirmed what we knew already, but it was still interesting to see, you know, were there any other areas?\u201d she explains.",
      "Darrell Taylor at Flir, a firm that makes thermal cameras, says that members of the public can access some free training materials on his company\u2019s website.",
      "He adds that Flir aims to make thermal images as clear and easy to interpret as possible \u2013 including by merging optical imagery with thermal imagery, to add more detail to the final picture. And he suggests that, in the future, Flir cameras may offer machine learning-based instructions and advice as people use the devices.",
      "Those who know how best to interpret thermal camera imagery can find extraordinary hidden problems in a building, though.",
      "Dr Bardhan recently took a very high resolution camera to a viewing of a house she was considering buying. But the thermal images revealed cracks in a wall, which later proved to be signs of subsidence.",
      "\u201cThat would probably not have been exposed unless I had gone in and seen it,\u201d she says. Dr Bardhan decided not to make an offer on the property.",

      "Who is South Korea's scandal hit president Yoon Suk Yeol?",
      "How did it all unfold?",
      "Yoon has acted like a president under siege, observers say.",
      "In his address on Tuesday night, he recounted the political opposition's attempts to undermine his government before saying he was declaring martial law to \"crush anti-state forces that have been wreaking havoc\".",
      "His decree temporarily put the military in charge - with helmeted troops and police deployed to the National Assembly parliament building where helicopters were seen landing on the roof.",
      "Local media also showed scenes of masked, gun-toting troops entering the building while staffers tried to hold them off with fire extinguishers.",
      "Around 23:00 local time on Tuesday (14:00 GMT), the military issued a decree banning protests and activity by parliament and political groups, and putting the media under government control.",
      "But South Korean politicians immediately called Yoon's declaration illegal and unconstitutional. The leader of his own party, the conservative People's Power Party, also called Yoon's act \"the wrong move\".",
      "Meanwhile, the leader of the country's largest opposition party, Lee Jae-myung of the liberal Democratic Party, called on his MPs to converge on parliament to vote down the declaration.",
      "He also called on ordinary South Koreans to show up at parliament in protest.",
      "\"Tanks, armoured personnel carriers and soldiers with guns and knives will rule the country... My fellow citizens, please come to the National Assembly.\u201d",
      "Thousands heeded the call, rushing to gather outside the now heavily guarded parliament. Protesters chanted: \"No martial law!\" and \"strike down dictatorship\".",
      "Local media broadcasting from the site showed some scuffles between protesters and police at the gates. But despite the military presence, tensions did not escalate into violence.",
      "And lawmakers were also able to make their way around the barricades - even climbing fences to make it to the voting chamber.",
      "Shortly after 01:00 on Wednesday, South Korea's parliament, with 190 of its 300 members present, voted down the measure. President Yoon's declaration of martial law was ruled invalid.",
      "How significant is martial law?",
      "Martial law is temporary rule by military authorities in a time of emergency, when civil authorities are deemed unable to function.",
      "The last time it was declared in South Korea was in 1979, when the country's then long-term military dictator Park Chung-hee was assassinated during a coup.",
      "It has never been invoked since the country became a parliamentary democracy in 1987.",
      "But on Tuesday, Yoon pulled that trigger, saying in a national address he was trying to save South Korea from \"anti-state forces\".",
      "Yoon, who has taken a noticeably more hardline stance on North Korea than his predecessors, described the political opposition as North Korea sympathisers - without providing evidence.",
      "Under martial law, extra powers are given to the military and there is often a suspension of civil rights for citizens and rule of law standards and protections.",
      "Despite the military announcing restrictions on political activity and the media, protesters and politicians defied those orders. And there was no sign of the government seizing control of free media - Yonhap, the national broadcaster, and other outlets kept reporting as normal.",
      "Why was Yoon feeling pressured?",
      "Yoon was voted into office in May 2022 as a hardline conservative, but has been a lame duck president since April when the opposition won a landslide in the country's general election.",
      "His government since then has not been able to pass the bills they wanted and have been reduced instead to vetoing bills passed by the liberal opposition.",
      "He has also seen a fall in approval ratings - hovering around lows of 17% - as he has been mired in several corruption scandals this year, including one involving the First Lady accepting a Dior bag, and another around alleged stock manipulation.",
      "Just last month he was forced to issue an apology on national TV, saying he was setting up an office overseeing the First Lady's duties. But he rejected a wider investigation, which opposition parties had been calling for.",
      "Then this week, the opposition proposed slashing a major government budget bill - which cannot be vetoed.",
      "At the same time, the opposition also moved to impeach cabinet members and several top prosecutors- including the head of the government's audit agency - for failing to investigate the First Lady.",
      "What now?",
      "The opposition Democratic Party has moved to impeach Yoon.",
      "Parliament will have to vote by Saturday on whether to do this.",
      "The impeachment process is relatively straightforward in South Korea. To succeed, it would require support from more than two-thirds of the 300-member National Assembly - at least 200 votes.",
      "Once an impeachment is approved, a trial is held before the Constitutional Court - a nine-member council that oversees South Korea's branches of government.",
      "If six of the court's members vote to sustain the impeachment, the president is removed from office.",
      "If this happens, it wouldn't be the first time that a South Korean president has been impeached. In 2016, then-President Park Geun-hye was impeached after being accused of helping a friend commit extortion.",
      "In 2004 another president, Roh Moo-hyun, was impeached and suspended for two months. The Constitutional Court later restored him to office.",
      "Yoon's rash action stunned the country - which views itself as a thriving, modern democracy that has come far since its dictatorship days.",
      "Many see this week's events as the biggest challenge to that democratic society in decades.",
      "Experts contend it may be more damaging to South Korea's reputation as a democracy than even the 6 January riots in the US.",
      "\"Yoon\u2019s declaration of martial law appeared to be both legal overreach and a political miscalculation, unnecessarily risking South Korea\u2019s economy and security,\" one expert, Leif-Eric Easley at Ewha University in Seoul said.",
      "\"He sounded like a politician under siege, making a desperate move against mounting scandals, institutional obstruction and calls for impeachment, all of which are now likely to intensify.\""

      "\u201cI fear that she's dead,\" her mother Mandy told the BBC in her first television interview. \"And if she's not dead, she's not getting enough food to eat, she's not able to wash herself, drink water, she could be ill.\"",
      "\u201cShe's suffering from gunshot wounds to her hand and her leg... I worry every day, I worry every second because in the next second, she could be murdered, just because she's there.\u201d",
      "Mandy Damari, who was born in Surrey, called on the British government to do more to ensure humanitarian supplies go to the hostages while negotiations continue for their release.",
      "She also welcomed US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s statement that there would be \u201chell to pay\u201d if the hostages were not released before he takes office in January, saying: \u201cIt made me a bit more optimistic\u201d.",

      "\"If the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against humanity,\u201d he warned.",

The draft did demand their release, but it was vetoed by the US, which said it did not make that a precondition for a ceasefire.",
      "\u201cI felt really like they were stabbing me in the heart. There was no prerequisite to release the hostages... It was basically signing a death warrant for her [Emily], because if there's a ceasefire with no release of the hostages, the hostages will stay there forever,\u201d Mrs Damari said.",

      "\u201cI really need the British government if they are not able to get her released immediately, at least to get her humanitarian aid or a sign of life, and let me know what's happening with that, because I'm desperate for a sign of life.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cWe talk about humanitarian aid all the time to Gaza, but I don't hear about humanitarian aid for the hostages who are held in despicable conditions. I'm desperate to get humanitarian aid into her, for someone to see her. It's a human right to allow to allow people to see what's happening to her.\u201d",
      "Mrs Damari initially did not speak out publicly about her daughter because she trusted the governments and negotiators to get her released. But now she wants the British public to understand a dual citizen is being held.",

    "summary": "Giulia Cecchettin was killed by her ex-boyfriend in 2023, sparking an outpouring of grief and soul-searching.",
    "story": [
      "Filippo Turetta, the 22-year-old Italian student who admitted to stabbing to death his ex-girlfriend Giulia Cecchettin last year, has been sentenced to life in jail.",
      "The murder case gripped Italy and sparked a heated debate on the issue of violence against women.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the sentence was read out in a Venice court, Giulia's father Gino Cecchettin said: \"Nobody is giving me Giulia back so I am neither more relieved nor more sad than I was yesterday or than I will be tomorrow.\"",
      "He added that the battle against gender violence was one \"we'll have to fight together as a society... we look ahead and hope another dad won't find himself at my place\".",
      "Over the last year a huge amount of detail about the killing has emerged, forming a picture of an increasingly anguished young woman harassed by her possessive ex-boyfriend who refused to accept the end of their relationship.",
      "The case, which captivated Italians, has thrust the concepts of femicide, patriarchy and male violence into the headlines.",
      "On 11 November 2023 Mr Turetta picked up his fellow university student and ex-girlfriend Ms Cecchettin, a 22-year-old biomedical engineering student from the Venice province, to take her shopping for an outfit for her upcoming graduation.",
      "Later that evening, he stabbed her more than 70 times, and left the student's body at the bottom of a ditch, wrapped in plastic bags.",
      "Then, he disappeared. For a week, Italians followed the search for the couple with bated breath. The discovery of Ms Cecchettin\u2019s body on 18 November was met with an unprecedented outpouring of grief. The next day, Mr Turetta was arrested in Germany. He readily admitted to killing Ms Cecchettin and was extradited to Italy.",
      "To raise awareness of the signs of controlling relationships, Ms Cecchettin\u2019s family recently shared a list she wrote a few months before her death, titled \u201c15 reasons I had to break up with him\u201d.",
      "In it, Ms Cecchettin said Mr Turetta insisted she had a \u201cduty\u201d to help him study, complained if she sent him fewer emoji hearts than usual, didn\u2019t want her to go out with friends and needed her to text him all the time.",
      "\u201cThey were the typical signs of possessiveness,\u201d Giulia\u2019s father Gino told the BBC. \u201cHe would deny her her own space, or demand to always be included. He always needed to know everything she said to her friends or even her therapist.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe realised later that she thought she was the cause of his pain, that she felt responsible for it,\u201d he said.",
      "In an 80-page statement written from jail in childlike handwriting, Mr Turetta said since Ms Cecchettin broke up with him he spent every day hoping to get back with her. \u201cI didn't feel like I could accept any other outcome,\u201d he wrote.",
      "In his police interrogation Mr Turetta confirmed that, on the night he killed her, Ms Cecchettin had just told him he was too dependent and needy.",
      "\u201cI shouted that it wasn\u2019t fair, that I needed her,\u201d Mr Turetta said, adding that he killed her after getting \u201cvery angry\u201d when she tried to get out of the car.",
      "\u201cI was selfish and it's only now I realise it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI didn't think about how incredibly unfair that was to her and to the promising and wonderful life she had ahead of her.\u201d",
      "Mr Turetta\u2019s lawyer Giovanni Caruso has argued that his client should be spared an \u201cinhuman and degrading\u201d life sentence and pushed back against allegations that the killing had been premeditated.",
      "\u201cHe is not Pablo Escobar,\u201d Mr Caruso said - a line of defence Giulia\u2019s father told the BBC made him feel \u201cviolated all over again\u201d.",
      "Stories of femicide routinely top the news agenda in Italy, but Giulia Cecchettin\u2019s story attracted an unusual amount of attention from the start. The week-long search for the young couple gripped people; the revelation that Ms Cecchettin had been killed just days before her graduation moved them. More than 10,000 attended her funeral.",
      "But it was the tearful and furious interview given by Giulia\u2019s sister Elena, in which she said that Filippo Turetta was not a \u201cmonster\u201d but \u201cthe healthy son of a patriarchal society\u201d which sparked a heated debate on male violence and gender roles in modern Italy.",
      "Elena\u2019s words reverberated. Suddenly, the patriarchy - a concept thought by many as arcane or irrelevant - was discussed widely.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a man you\u2019re part of a system that teaches you that you are worth more than women,\u201d Mr Cecchettin told the BBC.",
      "\u201cIt means that if you\u2019re in a relationship everything needs to go through you... and so a patriarch can\u2019t be told: \u2018I don\u2019t love you anymore\u2019, because it goes against his sense of ownership.\u201d",
      "In November, at the launch of a foundation established by Gino Cecchettin in memory of Giulia, Education Minister Giuseppe Valditara argued that the patriarchy no longer existed in Italy and said the rise in sexual violence was instead \u201clinked to the marginalisation and perversion that stems from illegal immigration\u201d.",
      "The comments sparked outrage. \u201cGiulia was killed by a respectable, white Italian man,\u201d Elena Cecchettin hit back. \u201cMy father has done something to prevent violence. What is the government doing?\u201d",
      "Since his daughter\u2019s death, Gino Cecchettin has thrown himself headfirst into a battle to teach teenagers how to handle emotions and relationships, touring schools to tell pupils his daughter's story.",
      "He also hopes that sharing Giulia's own voice and words could help others - like one voice message she sent friends in which she sounds both exasperated by Mr Turetta\u2019s insistence and riddled with guilt about his suicidal thoughts. \u201cI wish I could disappear,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m worried he could hurt himself.\u201d",
      "Italian woman's killing sparks nationwide reckoning",
      "Huge rallies condemn violence against women in Italy",
      "Thousands attend Italy funeral after woman's killing",
      "Elisa Ercoli of Differenza Donna, a charity that fights gender-based violence, told the BBC the messages had a tangible impact, with her organisation getting a high number of calls from parents who recognised similar behaviours in their daughters. \"We think bruises are the problem but underhand psychological violence is the issue in many situations,\" she said.",
      "A government department has also said that the national anti-violence helpline experienced a surge in calls after Ms Cecchettin\u2019s murder, and that the number of calls is now 57% higher than last year.",
      "But NGOs and opposition politicians are all demanding that Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni\u2019s government take concrete steps to prevent and punish violence against women, such as \u201caffectivity lessons\u201d in schools.",
      "\u201cWhat the Cecchettin family is doing is a grain of sand compared to what the government would have the power to achieve,\u201d said Francesca Ghio, a leftwing councillor in Genoa who recently publicly revealed she was raped when she was 12 - she said the decision to speak out was inspired by the \u201cstrength\u201d of the Cecchettin family.",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump and Joe Biden may not have much in common. But when it comes to their connections to high-profile prosecutions, they have sounded a similar tune \u2013 even in the face of outcry from opponents and some in their own parties.",
      "In announcing a \u201cfull and unconditional\u201d pardon for Hunter Biden on Sunday night, Joe Biden condemned what he characterised as an unfair prosecution of his son.",
      "\u201cNo reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter\u2019s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son \u2013 and that is wrong,\u201d Biden said.",
      "The president\u2019s criticisms of a politicised system of justice echoed those regularly lobbed by Trump \u2013 perhaps most conspicuously in the New York City case involving hush-money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. That indictment ultimately led to the former president\u2019s conviction on multiple felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal campaign finance violations.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in New York is an outrage,\u201d Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Trump confidante, said of the former president\u2019s hush-money trial. \u201cI think it\u2019s selective prosecution for political purposes.\u201d",
      "Analysis: Biden\u2019s sweeping pardon for son rewrites the rules",
      "What did Hunter Biden do and what is a presidential pardon?",
      "Triumph over legal cases seals Trump's comeback",
      "What similarities are there between the cases?",
      "The Hunter Biden cases and Trump hush-money case do have notable similarities \u2013 ones that have fuelled attacks on the judicial process.",
      "Both were brought to court in 2024, years after the incidents in question. Trump\u2019s payments to Daniels occurred in 2016. The handgun application on which Hunter Biden denied his drug use was from 2018, while his fraudulent tax returns were from 2016 to 2019.",
      "Both cases took sharp twists after it seemed they would not reach trial. It appeared the New York Trump investigation would be dropped when Alvin Bragg was elected to replace Cyrus Vance as Manhattan attorney. A plea deal that would have resulted in Hunter Biden accepting guilt but serving no prison time collapsed at the last minute amid questions from the presiding judge.",
      "Both also involved applications of existing law in novel or unusual circumstances.",
      "The underlying campaign finance crimes in the Trump case were federal, not state, violations that US government attorneys had already chosen not to pursue. Rarely are gun-application cases like Biden\u2019s prosecuted without a connection to more serious misdeeds. And his tax evasion violations were addressed through back-payment and fines \u2013 a resolution that typically avoids criminal charges.",
      "In fact, Trump\u2019s legal team drew explicit comparisons between the two cases in a legal filing on Tuesday that cited Hunter Biden\u2019s pardon as reason to dismiss Trump\u2019s New York conviction.",
      "\u201cPresident Biden argued that \u2018raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice,\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote. \u201cThese comments amounted to an extraordinary condemnation of President Biden\u2019s own [Department of Justice].\u201d",
      "\u201cThis case should never have been brought,\u201d they concluded.",
      "What are the differences?",
      "There are notable differences between the two cases, of course. Hunter Biden never held public office. And the New York hush-money case was just one of multiple prosecutions of the former president, several of which dealt with much more serious and recent alleged crimes. Trump didn\u2019t distinguish between them, however, claiming all of the investigations of him were politically motivated \u201cwitch hunts\u201d designed to damage his electoral prospects.",
      "Differences aside, both Trump and the Bidens raised similar questions about whether politics unduly influenced their cases, even as Democrats insisted that the Trump trial was proper, and Republicans viewed the Hunter gun trial and tax evasion guilty plea as justice served.",
      "According to Kevin McMunigal, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University and former assistant US attorney, the claim that politics affects prosecutorial decisions is largely inaccurate. He notes, however, that the public may not appreciate that there is a complicated calculus behind when or whether to charge criminal offences.",
      "\u201cCongress and state legislatures love to pass criminal statutes, and they rarely repeal them because of the politics involved,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone wants to be tough on crime. You wind up with statute books that are full of crimes, many of which don\u2019t get prosecuted.\u201d",
      "He adds that it is not common knowledge that these statutes are often ignored by prosecutors. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard for people to get their heads around,\u201d he said.",
      "This lack of understanding could provide reason enough for those on both sides of America\u2019s sharp political divide to perceive a double standard when it comes to the American system of justice \u2013 particularly when it involves high-profile cases involving government officials or their families, and especially when it is the politicians themselves who are stoking the fires.",
      "What could Biden's pardon mean for Trump?",
      "Whether or not the indictments were an appropriate exercise of prosecutorial judgement, both Trump and Hunter Biden were convicted of their crimes.",
      "Due to his pardon, Hunter Biden will face no consequences for that. And as Trump prepares to head back to the White House, it appears increasingly likely that the nature of his high office will protect him from a sentence for his conviction. It has already led to the federal cases against him being dropped.",
      "Public perception of a double-standard for the wealthy and powerful may not be so off base.",
      "American faith in the criminal justice department is being undermined, said John Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University and head of its Project on Unity and American Democracy. He adds, however, that claims of selective prosecution amount to a \u201cpebble thrown in a very large lake\u201d, compared to the broader issues at play.",
      "\u201cJustice has never been blind,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been periods of time when it has been more even-handed than others, however.\u201d",
      "Recent developments, he says, reflect a growing public distrust in political institutions across the board \u2013 including Congress, the presidency and the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump has capitalised on this distrust in institutions, railing against the government \u201cswamp\u201d and promising the kind of sweeping reforms his supporters believe more established politicians are unable or unwilling to deliver.",
      "When taken in context, Trump\u2019s ongoing complaints of political prosecutions, and Biden\u2019s recent adoption of similar claims, are a reflection of a larger crisis of American faith in government \u2013 one that both politicians have taken advantage of when circumstances put them in uncomfortable legal terrain.",
      "Biden\u2019s use of Trumpian rhetoric to explain his exercise of presidential power to protect his son might only help the incoming president find more support to swing the wrecking ball at the institutions that Biden has long served and pledged to protect.",

    "story": [
      "Abdulkafi, an English teacher from Aleppo, saw his father for the first time in years on Monday, days after rebels launched a major offensive and took control of the northern Syrian city from government forces.",
      "\u201cHe is 85, an old man. He never dreamed he would see me again before he died,\u201d said Abdulkafi, who lives in opposition territory. Until the offensive he had been unable to cross into regime-held Aleppo.",
      "A video of the encounter, seen by the BBC, shows the two men embracing and sobbing with emotion.",
      "Abdulkafi is one of several people inside Aleppo who have spoken to the BBC since the city was captured by the armed rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allies from forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad.",
      "They described being treated with respect by HTS fighters and increased supplies of electricity and water - but also spoke of their fears at war returning to Aleppo and distrust that the former al-Qaeda-linked group\u2019s professed moderation would last.",
      "Tens of thousands of people have been displaced by the recent fighting, according to the UN.",
      "Many interviewees requested anonymity for their own safety. Some details of individual accounts could not be verified due to the difficulty of reporting independently from Syria.",
      "Many people in Aleppo are scared of renewed fighting, the locals the BBC spoke to said. Air strikes by the Syrian government and allied Russian forces have already killed dozens, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group.",
      "One man told the BBC his main worry was the bombardment that he feared could hit the city at any point. He said he had stopped his family from even going to the corner shop.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re living in complete apprehension,\u201d he said. He added that the air strikes that have hit the city over the past few days reminded him of earlier periods in the war.",
      "Aleppo, most of which had been captured by rebels in the early years of the Syrian civil war, was retaken by Syrian government forces backed by Russia in 2016 after a gruelling siege.",
      "Since then, the city has mostly avoided direct warfare. The Syrian government claims credit for what it says is the ongoing reconstruction of the city, which until the war was Syria\u2019s commercial hub.",
      "But NGOs and independent journalists accuse the government of widespread human rights abuses there, including torture and killings of civilians and non-existent democratic rights.",
      "Abdulkafi and his father's reunion was joyful - but Abdulkafi said some of his relatives were afraid to be seen with him for fear of retribution were regime forces to retake the city once again.",
      "\u201cNineteen Eighty-Four is applied in Aleppo. Assad\u2019s image is on every building, streets, on every corner. He is controlling their minds,\u201d he said, referring to the George Orwell novel about totalitarianism.",
      "HTS was set up under a different name, Jabhat al-Nusra, in 2011 as a direct affiliate of al-Qaeda. It has since split from the group and claims to have moderated its ideology. Human rights groups accuse HTS of arbitrarily detaining and mistreating critical journalists and civilians, claims the group denies.",
      "Some in Aleppo remain fearful. One woman said people were \u201cconfused and scared\u201d following the rebel takeover. She said she hadn't left her house at first, but later went for walks and drives with her family after hearing that civilians were not being harassed by the rebels.",
      "\u201cEverywhere was relatively calm. But everyone looked scared and anxious, you could sense it in their faces and their reactions. No-one looked comfortable.",
      "\u201cPeople are scared, because we don\u2019t trust anyone or what their reaction might be to what\u2019s happening now.",
      "\u201cWe feel let down by everyone. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to us.\u201d",
      "One man, Mohammad, told the BBC on Sunday that he had seen some armed men on the streets while he had been out buying food. Many other people had been stocking up on supplies, he said.",
      "\"When I went out the militiamen asked me if I was going to leave the city, they said to me \u2018don\u2019t worry it is safe for you\u2019,\" he said.",
      "\"One of the men from the militia asked why my sister, who I was with, did not have her head covered. But they didn\u2019t tell her to cover it - they just asked why.",
      "\"We are grateful that these armed groups have taken over. They are better than the government.",
      "\"There is a lot of fear, fear that the city will run out of food, but our biggest fear is of the Russia and Syrian government bombardment.\u201d",
      "What is happening in north-western Syria and why now?",
      "Analysis: Syria's rebel offensive is astonishing - but don't write off Assad",
      "George Meneshian, a Greek-Armenian political analyst who is in contact with Armenians in Aleppo, said Christians in the city had not experienced any problems since the HTS takeover.",
      "\u201cOn the first day, an HTS fighter knocked on the door of an Armenian neighbour and assured them that they would definitely not harm them,\u201d he told the BBC, adding that his sources were afraid to directly speak to the media due to fear of retribution.",
      "\u201cThey said they would respect them and allow them to do whatever they want, as Christians and as Armenians.\u201d",
      "Mr Meneshian said Christians were suspicious of HTS promises, saying minority groups in Syria had previously been persecuted by jihadist groups which at first said they would not harm non-Muslims. He said many had grown used to Assad\u2019s rule, which was authoritarian but at least did not actively persecute Armenians.",
      "\u201cThere are precedents for Islamist militias initially not harming anyone, but afterwards committing crimes against minorities. Hopefully this will not be the case.\u201d",
      "Abdulkafi, who lives in the HTS-controlled city of Al-Dana in Idlib, said that minorities had nothing to fear from the group, which he stressed he disagreed with.",
      "\u201cThey are showing much more flexibility, because the highest achievement that HTS can get is acceptance from the world. This doesn\u2019t mean that I like them.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 05:57:53 GMT",
    "summary": "She is now in a race for her life - if she can pay back 75% of what she took, she could be spared.",
    "story": [
      "Vietnamese property tycoon Truong My Lan has lost her appeal against her death sentence for masterminding the world\u2019s biggest bank fraud.",
      "The 68-year-old is now in a race for her life because the law in Vietnam states that if she can pay back 75% of what she took, her sentence will be commuted to life imprisonment.",
      "In April the trial court found that Truong My Lan had secretly controlled Saigon Commercial Bank, the country\u2019s fifth biggest lender, and taken out loans and cash over more than 10 years through a web of shell companies, amounting to a total of $44bn (\u00a334.5bn).",
      "Of that prosecutors say $27bn was misappropriated, and $12bn was judged to have been embezzled, the most serious financial crime for which she was sentenced to death.",
      "It was a rare and shocking verdict - she is one of very few women in Vietnam to be sentenced to death for a white collar crime.",
      "On Tuesday, the court said there was no basis to reduce Truong My Lan's death sentence. However, she could still avoid execution if she returns $9bn, three-quarters of the $12bn she embezzled. It's not her final appeal and she can still petition the president for amnesty.",
      "During her trial Truong My Lan was sometimes defiant, but in the recent hearings for her appeal against the sentence she was more contrite.",
      "She said she was embarrassed to have been such a drain on the state, and that her only thought was to pay back what she had taken.",
      "Born into a Sino-Vietnamese family in Ho Chi Minh City, Truong My Lan started as a market stall vendor, selling cosmetics with her mother. She began buying land and property after the Communist Party introduced economic reform in 1986. By the 1990s, she owned a large portfolio of hotels and restaurants.",
      "When she was convicted and sentenced in April, she was the chairwoman of a prominent real estate firm, Van Thinh Phat Group. It was a dramatic moment in the \"Blazing Furnaces\" anti-corruption campaign led by then-Communist Party Secretary-General, Nguyen Phu Trong.",
      "All of the remaining 85 defendants were convicted. Four were sentenced to life in jail, while the rest -including Truong My Lan's husband and niece - were given prison terms ranging from 20 years to three years suspended.",
      "The State Bank of Vietnam is believed to have spent many billions of dollars recapitalising Saigon Commercial Bank to prevent a wider banking panic. The prosecutors argued that her crimes were \"huge and without precedent\" and did not justify leniency.",
      "Truong My Lan\u2019s lawyers said she was working as fast as she could to find the $9bn needed. But cashing in her assets has proven difficult.",
      "Some are luxury properties in Ho Chi Minh City which could, in theory, be sold quite quickly. Others are in the form of shares or stakes in other businesses or property projects.",
      "In all the state has identified more than a thousand different assets linked to the fraud. These have been frozen by the authorities for now. The BBC understands the tycoon has also reached out to friends to raise loans for her to help reach the target.",
      "Her lawyers have argued for leniency from the judges on financial grounds. They said that while she is under sentence of death it would be hard for her to negotiate the best price for selling her assets and investments, and so harder for her to raise $9bn.",
      "She could do much better if under a life sentence instead, they say.",
      "\u201cThe total value of her holdings actually exceeds the required compensation amount,\u201d lawyer Nguyen Huy Thiep told the BBC before her appeal was rejected.",
      "\u201cHowever, these require time and effort to sell, as many of the assets are real estate and take time to liquidate. Truong My Lan hopes the court can create the most favourable conditions for her to continue making compensation.\u201d",
      "Few had expected the judges to be moved by these arguments. She is now, in effect, in a race with the executioner to raise the funds she needs.",
      "Vietnam treats the death penalty as a state secret. The government does not publish how many people are on death row, though human rights groups say there are more than 1,000 and that Vietnam is one of the world\u2019s biggest executioners.",
      "Typically there are long delays, often many years before sentences are carried out, although prisoners are given very little notice.",
      "If Truong My Lan can recover the $9bn before that happens, her life will most likely be spared.",

      "Pisani said the order was issued in light of the \"intensification of the phenomenon of so-called 'short-term rentals'\" as well as \"the numerous political, cultural and religious events being planned\", including the Catholic Church's 2025 Jubilee celebrations.",
      "Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri yesterday welcomed the order, which first came from the Interior Ministry, saying it would mean \"more effective controls on access, and a first brake on unfair competition\"."

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 22:16:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Why men who reported for duty after October 7 are now refusing to fight",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Fergal read this article",
      "Listen to Fergal read this article",
      "Every single person in his platoon knew someone who was killed. Yuval Green, 26, knew at least three. He was a reservist, a medic in the paratroops of the Israel Defence Forces, when he heard the first news of the 7 October Hamas attack.",
      "\u201cIsrael is a small country. Everyone knows each other,\u201d he says. In several days of violence,1,200 people were killed, and 251 more abducted into Gaza. Ninety-seven hostages remain in Gaza, and around half of them are believed to be alive.",
      "Yuval immediately answered his country\u2019s call to arms. It was a mission to defend Israelis. He recalls the horror of entering devastated Jewish communities near the Gaza border. \u201cYou're seeing\u2026 dead bodies on the streets, seeing cars punctured by bullets.\u201d",
      "Back then, there was no doubt about reporting for duty. The country was under attack. The hostages had to be brought home.",
      "Then came the fighting in Gaza itself. Things seen that could not be unseen. Like the night he saw cats eating human remains in the roadway.",
      "\u201cStart to imagine, like an apocalypse. You look to your right, you look to your left, all you see is destroyed buildings, buildings that are damaged by fire, by missiles, everything. That's Gaza right now.\u201d",
      "One year on, the young man who reported for duty on 7 October is refusing to fight.",
      "Yuval is the co-organiser of a public letter signed by more than 165 - at the latest count - Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) reservists, and a smaller number of permanent soldiers, refusing to serve, or threatening to refuse, unless the hostages are returned - something that would require a ceasefire deal with Hamas.",
      "In a country still traumatised by the worst violence in its history, those refusing for reasons of conscience are a minority in a military that includes around 465,000 reservists.",
      "There is another factor in play for some other IDF reservists: exhaustion.",
      "According to Israeli media reports, a growing number are failing to report for duty. The Times of Israel newspaper and several other outlets quoted military sources as saying that there was a drop of between 15% to 25% of troops showing up, mainly due to burnout with the long periods of service required of them.",
      "Even if there is not widespread public support for those refusing to serve because of reasons of conscience, there is evidence that some of the key demands of those who signed the refusal letter are shared by a growing number of Israelis.",
      "A recent opinion poll by the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI) indicated that among Jewish Israelis 45% wanted the war to end - with a ceasefire to bring the hostages home - against 43% who wanted the IDF to fight on to destroy Hamas.",
      "Significantly, the IDI poll also suggests that the sense of solidarity which marked the opening days of the war as the country reeled from the trauma of 7 October has been overtaken by the revival of political divisions: only 26% of Israelis believe there is now a sense of togetherness, while 44% say there is not.",
      "At least part of this has to do with a feeling often expressed, especially among those on the left of the political divide, that the war is being prolonged at the behest of far-right parties whose support Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu needs to remain in power.",
      "Even the former Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, a member of Netanhayu\u2019s Likud Party, dismissed by the prime minister last month, cited the failure to return the hostages as one of the key disagreements with his boss.",
      "\u201cThere is and will not be any atonement for abandoning the captives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a mark of Cain on the forehead of Israeli society and those leading this mistaken path.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu, who along with Gallant is facing an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, has repeatedly denied this and stressed his commitment to freeing the hostages.",
      "The seeds of refusal",
      "The seeds of Yuval\u2019s refusal lie back in the days soon after the war began. Then the deputy speaker of the Knesset (Israel\u2019s parliament), Nissim Vaturi, called for the Gaza Strip to be \u201cerased from the face of the Earth\u201d. Prominent rabbi Eliyahu Mali, referring generally to Palestinians in Gaza, said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t kill them, they\u2019ll kill you.\u201d The rabbi stressed soldiers should only do what the army orders, and that the state law did not allow for the killing of the civilian population.",
      "But the language - by no means restricted to the two examples above - worried Yuval.",
      "\u201cPeople were speaking about killing the entire population of Gaza, as if it was some type of an academic idea that makes sense\u2026 And with this atmosphere, soldiers are entering Gaza just a month after their friends were butchered, hearing about soldiers dying every day. And soldiers do a lot of things.\u201d",
      "There have been social media posts from soldiers in Gaza abusing prisoners, destroying property, and mocking Palestinians, including numerous examples of soldiers posing with people\u2019s possessions - including womens\u2019 dresses and underwear.",
      "\u201cI was trying to fight that at the time as much as I could,\u201d says Yuval. \u201cThere was a lot of dehumanising, a vengeful atmosphere.\u201d",
      "His personal turning point came with an order he could not obey.",
      "\u201cThey told us to burn down a house, and I went to my commander and asked him: \u2018Why are we doing that?\u2019 And the answers he gave me were just not good enough. I wasn't willing to burn down a house without reasons that make sense, without knowing that this serves a certain military purpose, or any type of purpose. So I said no and left.\u201d",
      "That was his last day in Gaza.",
      "In response, the IDF told me that its actions were \u201cbased on military necessity, and with accordance to international law\u201d and said Hamas \u201cunlawfully embed their military assets in civilian areas\u201d.",
      "Three of the refusers have spoken to the BBC. Two agreed to give their names, while a third requested anonymity because he feared repercussions. All stress that they love their country, but the experience of the war, the failure to reach a hostage deal led to a defining moral choice.",
      "'People calmly talked about abuse or murder'",
      "One soldier, who asked to remain anonymous, was at Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion airport when news started coming in about the Hamas attacks. He recalls feeling shock at first. Then a ringing sensation in his ears. \u201cI remember the drive home\u2026 The radio\u2019s on and people [are] calling in, saying: \u2018My dad was just kidnapped, help me. No-one's helping me.\u2019 It was truly a living nightmare.\u201d",
      "This was the moment the IDF was made for, he felt. It wasn\u2019t like making house raids in the occupied West Bank or chasing stone-throwing youths. \u201cProbably for the first time I felt like I enlisted in true self-defence.\u201d",
      "But his view transformed as the war progressed. \u201cI guess I no longer felt I could honestly say that this campaign was centered around securing the lives of Israelis.\u201d",
      "He says this was based on what he saw and heard among comrades. \u201cI try to have empathy and say, \u2018This is what happens to people who are torn apart by war\u2026\u2019 but it was hard to overlook how wide this discourse was.\u201d",
      "He recalls comrades boasting, even to their commanders, about beating \u201chelpless Palestinians\u201d. And he heard more chilling conversations. \u201cPeople would pretty calmly talk about cases of abuse or even murder, as if it was a technicality, or with real serenity. That obviously shocked me.\u201d",
      "The soldier also says he witnessed prisoners being blindfolded and not allowed to move \u201cfor basically their entire stay\u2026 and given amounts of food that were shocking\u201d.",
      "When his first tour of duty ended he vowed not to return.",
      "The IDF referred me to a statement from last May which said any abuse of detainees was strictly prohibited. It also said three meals a day were provided, \u201cof quantity and variety approved by a qualified nutritionist\u201d. It said handcuffing of detainees was only carried out \u201cwhere the security risk requires it\u201d and \u201cevery day an examination is carried out\u2026 to make sure that the handcuffs are not too tight\u201d.",
      "The UN has said reports of alleged torture and sexual violence by Israeli guards were \u201cgrossly illegal and revolting\u201d and enabled by \u201cabsolute impunity\u201d.",
      "\u2018A fertile ground for fostering brutality\u2019",
      "Michael Ofer-Ziv, 29, knew two people from his village who were killed on 7 October, among them Shani Louk whose body was paraded through Gaza on the back of a pickup truck in what became one of the most widely shared images of the war. \u201cThat was hell,\u201d he says.",
      "Michael was already a committed left-winger who advocated political not military solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But, like his comrades, he felt reporting for reserve duty was correct. \u201cI knew that the military action was inevitable\u2026 and was justified in a way, but I was very worried about the shape it might take.\u201d",
      "His job was to work as an operations officer in a brigade war room, watching and directing action relayed back from drone cameras in Gaza. At times the physical reality of the war hit home.",
      "\u201cWe went to get some paper from somewhere in the main command of the Gaza area,\u201d he remembers. \u201cAnd at some point we opened the window\u2026 and the stench was like a butchery\u2026 Like in the market, where it's not very clean.\u201d",
      "Again it was a remark heard during a discussion among comrades that helped push him towards action. \u201cI think the most horrible sentence that I heard was someone who said to me that the kids that we spared in the last war in Gaza [2014] became the terrorists of October 7, which I bet is true for some cases\u2026 but definitely not all of them.\u201d",
      "Such extreme views existed among a minority of soldiers, he says, but the majority were \u201cjust indifferent towards the price\u2026 what's called \u2018collateral damage\u2019, or Palestinian lives\u201d. He\u2019s also dismayed by statements that Jewish settlements should be built in Gaza after the war - a stated aim of far-right government ministers, and even some members of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party.",
      "Figures suggest there is a growing body of officers and troops within the IDF who come from what is called a \u2018National Religious\u2019 background: these are supporters of far-right Jewish nationalist parties who advocate settlement and annexation of Palestinian lands, and are firmly opposed to Palestinian statehood. According to research from the Israeli Centre for Public Affairs, a non-governmental think tank, the number of such officers graduating from the military academy rose from 2.5% in 1990 to 40% in 2014.",
      "Ten years ago, one of Israel\u2019s leading authorities on the issue, Professor Mordechai Kremnitzer, a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, warned about what he called the \u2018religification\u2019 of the army. \u201cWithin this context, messages about Jewish superiority and demonisation of the enemy are fertile ground for fostering brutality and releasing soldiers from moral constraints.\u201d",
      "The decisive moment for Michael Ofer-Ziv came when the IDF shot three Israeli hostages in Gaza in December 2023. The three men approached the army stripped to the waist, and one held a stick with a white cloth. The IDF said a soldier had felt threatened and opened fire, killing two hostages. A third was wounded but then shot again and killed, when a soldier ignored his commander\u2019s ceasefire order.",

And I also remember thinking, there is just no way this is the first time [innocent people were shot]\u2026 It's just the first time that we are hearing about it, because they are hostages. If the victims were Palestinians, we just would never hear about it.\u201d",
      "The IDF has said that refusal to serve by reservists is dealt with on a case-by-case basis, and Prime Minister Netanyahu insists it is \u201cthe most moral army in the world\u201d. For most Israelis, the IDF is the guarantor of their security; it helped found Israel in 1948 and is an expression of the nation - every Israeli citizen over 18 who is Jewish (and also Druze and Circassian minorities) must serve.",
      "The refusers have attracted some hostility. Some prominent politicians, like Miri Regev, a cabinet member and former IDF spokeswoman, have called for action. \u201cRefusers should be arrested and prosecuted,\" she has said.",
      "But the government has so far avoided tough action because, according to Yuval Green, \u201cthe military realised that it only draws attention to our actions, so they try to let us go quietly.\u201d For those starting their national service and who refuse, sanctions are tougher. Eight conscientious objectors - not part of the reservists group - due to begin their military service at 18 years old have served time in military prison.",

      "The soldiers I spoke with described a mix of anger, disappointment, pain or \u2018radio silence\u2019 from their former comrades.",
      "\u201cI strongly oppose them [the refusers],\u201d says Major Sam Lipsky, 31, a reservist who fought in Gaza during the current war but is now based outside the Strip. He accuses the refusers group of being \u201chighly political\u201d and focused on opposing the current government.",

      "Maj Lipsky is a supporter of what he views as Israel\u2019s mainstream right - not the far right represented by government figures like Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister who has been convicted of inciting racism and supporting terrorism, and finance minister, Belazel Smotrich, who recently called for the population of Gaza to be halved by encouraging \u201cvoluntary migration\u201d.",
      "Maj Lipsky acknowledges the civilian suffering in Gaza and does not deny the imagery of dead and maimed women and children.",
      "As we speak at his home in southern Israel, his two young children are sleeping in the next room. \u201cThere's no way to fight the war and to prosecute a military campaign without these images happening,\u201d he says. He then uses an expression heard in the past from Israeli leaders: \u201cYou can't mow the lawn without grass flying up. It is not possible.\u201d",
      "He says the blame belongs to Hamas who went to \u201crandomly slaughter as many Jews as possible, women, children, soldiers\u201d.",
      "The imperative of fighting the war has postponed a deepening struggle over the future character of the Jewish state. It is, in large part, a conflict between the secularist ideals held by people like Michael Ofer-Zif and Yuval Green, and the increasingly powerful religious right represented by the settlements movement, and their champions in Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet, including figures like Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich.",
      "Add to that the lingering, widespread anger over the government\u2019s attempts to dilute the power of the country\u2019s judiciary in 2023 - it led to mass demonstrations in the months before October 7 - and the stage is set for a turbulent politics long after the war ends.",
      "On both sides it is not unusual to hear people talk of a struggle for the soul of Israel.",
      "Maj Lipsky was packing to return to military duty on the evening I met him, sure of his duty and responsibility. No peace until Hamas was defeated.",
      "Among the refusers I spoke with, there was a determination to stand by their principles. Michael Ofer-Ziv may leave Israel, unsure whether he can be happy in the country. \u201cIt just looks less and less likely that I will be able to hold the values that I hold, wanting the future that I want for my kids to live here, and that is very scary,\u201d he says.",
      "Yuval Green is training to become a doctor, and hopes that a settlement can be reached between peacemakers among the Israeli and Palestinian people. \u201cI think in this conflict, there are only two sides, not the Israeli side and the Palestinian side. There is the side that supports violence and the side that supports, you know, finding better solutions.\u201d There are many Israelis who would disagree with that analysis, but it won\u2019t stop his mission.",

      "Our rendezvous is in a large underground space and we\u2019re surrounded by three vast screens. It\u2019s fairly dark inside but the sunglasses remain in place during our conversation.",
      "I tentatively ask what they\u2019re for. Are they a shield or for something more prosaic, short-sightedness perhaps?",
      "\u201cThey help me see and they help me not see,\u201d Wintour tells me, somewhat enigmatically. \u201cThey help me be seen and not be seen. They are a prop, I would say\u201d.",

      "Wintour admits that \u201cfor someone who goes to so many shows, you get a little, not jaded, but you get used to the experience\".",
      "Since most visitors to the exhibition will not have had the chance to attend such events, she says they were keen to make sure it felt as though they were actually there.",
      "As the reigning queen of the fashion world, Wintour has had a real front-row seat for decades - often on a delicate gold chair, the kind of furniture that is ubiquitous at the high end catwalk viewings where her invitation is always a dead cert.",
      "In the blurb to the exhibition, Wintour writes that she has \u201cprobably spent a year of my life waiting for fashion shows, which are famously tardy, to begin\u201d.",
      "She tells me the American designer Marc Jacobs once held a runway show that was an hour and a half late, but \u201cwe all yelled at him so much after that, the next season, he not only started the show on time, he actually started five minutes early\u201d.",

      "Fashion then was \u201cvery elitist - you had to be invited and it was a very tight little world,\u201d says Wintour.",
      "Contrast that with the debut show by the musician and entrepreneur Pharrell Williams for Louis Vuitton in 2023. A pop-culture event, it was held on the Pont Neuf in Paris, with the likes of Beyonce, Rihanna and of course Wintour in attendance, and got one billion views online.",

      "Wintour tells me she only brought one or two suitcases with her to London and she won\u2019t be drawn on whether she dresses down when she\u2019s at home in the US. \"It\u2019s really about respect in how you present yourself.\"",
      "More than one person has told me that nobody ever says 'no' to Wintour. Donatella Versace says the same in the recent Disney documentary, In Vogue: The 90s.",
      "Wintour demures. \u201cThat is absolutely untrue. They often say no, but that\u2019s a good thing. No is a wonderful word\u201d.",
      "Do you think people are frightened of you, I ask her. \u201cI hope not,\u201d she replies.",
      "Under her leadership, through talent, force of personality and an eye for what sells, Wintour has tried to future proof Vogue, turning it into a global brand. She is also global content advisor for Conde Nast, the magazine's publisher.",
      "In the modern era, when influencers can take photos of fashion moments and pump them out immediately, Wintour has successfully positioned Vogue as an arbiter of taste and style.",
      "Fashion and advertising are entwined in Vogue's content but Wintour doesn\u2019t accept my premise that fashion journalism can be sycophantic.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s simply not true and it\u2019s sometimes, I think, frustrating to us that work in fashion, that there is an outside perception fashion is frivolous and superficial.",
      "\"In fact, it\u2019s a huge business. We give employment to millions of people around the world.\"",
      "I take that answer to mean that Wintour, the daughter of a former editor of the Evening Standard newspaper, sees herself more as a fashion ambassador than a journalist.",
      "But of course she is also a journalist, arguably one of the most famous journalistic faces on the planet - and one that has no obvious successor.",
      "I ask her, at 75, how much longer she plans to stay in her role.",
      "\u201cI have no plans to leave my job,\u201d she says, adding: \u201cCurrently.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 00:13:09 GMT",
    "summary": "Ghanaians are about to elect a new president amid concerns about inflation, unemployment and debt.",
    "story": [
      "Ghana is heading for its ninth general election since multiparty politics resumed in 1992.",
      "In that time, there have been three peaceful transfers of power, with the two main parties \u2013 the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the New Patriotic Party (NPP) \u2013 holding the presidency for a total of 16 years each.",
      "Here, in charts, are the big issues this time round as the NPP goes for an unprecedented third successive term in power.",
      "Ghanaians were hit particularly hard in the pocket by the global bout of inflation, beginning in early 2022, that saw prices rise in the country at their fastest rate for more than two decades.",
      "The annual rate of increase reached a peak of 54.1% in December 2022. It has since come down, but this is just an average and prices of some staples have continued to go up sharply.",
      "Eggs and tomatoes, for instance were more than twice as expensive in February 2024 as they were 12 months earlier. Other Ghanaian favourites have also shot up with wages not keeping pace.",
      "Although the popular national dish - Ga kenkey (fermented maize dumplings) with fish - has not seen such a big jump, the balls of kenkey are now smaller.",
      "As a result, more people have been pushed into poverty and living standards have suffered, the World Bank says.",
      "In 2022, Ghana defaulted on its debt repayments and was forced into lengthy negotiations with international lenders to try and restructure the loans, which are still on-going.",
      "Local lenders were forced into taking lower repayments.",
      "The government also went to the International Monetary Fund to get help with a bailout programme.",
      "President Nana Akufo-Addo admitted the country was in \u201ccrisis\u201d but blamed outside forces. The opposition and some economists said it was down to economic mismanagement by the government.",
      "The amount of money that Ghana owes its creditors has steadily risen for the last two decades, but there was a sharp uptick in 2019, and by 2022 the government needed more than 70% of its income just to service the debt.",
      "The country\u2019s economic difficulties have been accompanied by a steadily rising unemployment rate.",
      "Going back two decades, one in 20 Ghanaians able to work were unemployed - that figure now stands at one in seven.",
      "With more than half the population - some 24 million people - under the age of 35, young people have been particularly hard-hit.",
      "For 15-to-24-year-olds the unemployment rate is twice the overall figure, with nearly 30% without a job.",
      "The views of younger voters could have a big impact on the outcome of the election.",
      "As Africa\u2019s largest \u2013 and the world\u2019s 10th biggest \u2013 producer of the precious metal, gold plays a big role in the economy.",
      "Gold mining has become a major talking-point in the months leading up to the election, with complaints about the damage that small-scale and illegal mining is doing to the environment.",
      "But with the global gold price more than doubling in the last decade, the attraction of getting involved in the business is obvious.",
      "Gold is a big foreign-exchange earner for Ghana \u2013 in 2023, exports amounted to $5.2bn (\u00a34.1bn).",
      "Along with gold, the country has resources of oil, gas, diamonds, bauxite and lithium among other things.",
      "It is also a big player in the global cocoa market, being the world's second largest supplier of the vital ingredient of chocolate.",
      "These resources have transformed the economy over the past three decades and enabled the country to become much richer, with extreme poverty dropping by half in that time, World Bank experts have said.",
      "The average annual income per person has gone through a dramatic shift since 2005, with the standard of living showing a marked increase up to 2017.",
      "Since then, however, it has barely risen, except for a spike in 2021.",
      "At election time, politicians have to contend with the fact that voters tend not to take the long-term view but generally base their choice on whether things are improving in the short term.",
      "The last three decades have seen a series of closely fought and peaceful elections.",
      "As a result Ghana has often been held up as an example of an open democracy that has turned its back on instability and its own history of coups in a region where they are still an issue.",
      "In some cases, elections hinged on just tens of thousands of votes and despite occasional legal challenges, the results have generally been accepted by the losers.",
      "We expect to find out the results of this year's race within three days of the 7 December election.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 20:40:33 GMT",
    "summary": "The ruling party denies any Russian link, but its actions raise questions about Georgia's path to the EU.",
    "story": [
      "Night after night, Georgians have filled the broad central avenue that runs past parliament, in such great numbers there is barely space to move, on the road or the pavement either side.",
      "They come to Rustaveli Avenue draped in flags, the blue and gold of the EU and the red and white of the George Cross, and accuse their increasingly authoritarian government of ditching their European future for a return to the sphere of their Russian neighbour.",
      "The ruling party, Georgian Dream, fervently denies any link to the Kremlin, but its actions in recent days have raised big questions about this country\u2019s future with the West.",
      "Not only has the party presided over a bitter fallout with the EU, it has just seen the US suspend Georgia\u2019s hard-won strategic partnership too.",
      "In a country of only 3.7 million people, these are dangerous as well as momentous times. One Georgian Dream supporter spoke of his country sitting at the edge of an abyss.",
      "Through the night, whistles and the honk of vuvuzelas are occasionally punctuated by the crackle of protesters\u2019 fireworks aimed at the imposing parliament building and the riot police standing guard with water cannon and tear gas.",
      "For the first four nights, police waited until towards dawn before moving in to reclaim the street by force. But on Monday night they advanced far earlier, pushing protesters elsewhere.",
      "Police have counted more than 100 injuries among their own force, while protesters in detention have endured beatings and serious facial and head injuries, according to lawyers, and dozens of TV reporters have come under attack.",
      "\u201cThe scale of people being hunted down and beaten individually, so they have to be treated in clinics, has never been seen before here,\u201d says Lasha Dzebisashvili, professor of politics at the University of Georgia.",
      "Georgia\u2019s public rights defender, Levan Ioseliani, says police have engaged in \u201cbrutality\u201d and abused their authority with impunity. Government supporters argue police have come under intolerable attack from stones and fireworks.",
      "It is a constitutional crisis with no obvious way out, unless one side blinks first. Will the government back down, or the protests fizzle out under pressure from police?",
      "\u201cNo negotiations,\u201d says Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, claiming without foundation that the protests are funded from abroad.",
      "One couple say they will turn out every night in December until Georgian Dream changes tack and calls fresh elections, to erase a vote just over a month ago marred by a string of violations ranging from bribery to multiple voting.",
      "Georgia's PM hits back as protests and resignations intensify",
      "Both sides accuse the other of lacking legitimacy.",
      "The protesters, spurred on by a figurehead pro-Western president and four opposition groups, say the government is illegitimate; the opposition won\u2019t enter parliament because of the \u201cfalsified elections\u201d.",
      "The ruling party, Georgian Dream, says it won the vote fair and square and insists it\u2019s the largely ceremonial president, Salome Zourabichvili, who has no legitimacy. Her time in office is almost up, so why is it she is the one who plans to stay on to maintain stability, it asks.",
      "All the while neighbouring Russia trains a close eye, comparing events to Ukraine\u2019s \u201cMaidan\u201d, when its unpopular president was ousted by pro-EU protesters in February 2014 and Russian troops and their proxies moved in to seize parts of the country.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re losing our country,\u201d says Nika Gvaramia, an opposition leader from the alliance Coalition for Change, and Georgians are facing a stark choice between either a European Georgia or Russia.",
      "As he speaks, the protests are in full swing around the corner from his party HQ, and colleagues point to a CCTV video from inside their lobby a few days ago, showing a protester being beaten by police.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re shaking this government. The rallies will go on for as long as needed. We have no other option. It\u2019s a liberation fight. We know who we\u2019re fighting with, and that\u2019s Russia.\u201d",
      "The words \u201cNo to Russia\u201d were daubed in big black graffiti on the front of the parliament building over the weekend and you can find the same kind of message on walls all over Tbilisi in varying degrees of bluntness.",
      "It is also a message that carries different meanings here.",
      "Georgian Dream\u2019s highly controversial laws targeting civil society and LGBT groups this year have been branded Russian-style as well as anti-democratic.",
      "The president has spoken of Georgian Dream\u2019s election win as a Russian special operation, and there was an outcry afterwards when it emerged that a Russian called Alexander Malkevich who had set up a propaganda network in occupied eastern Ukraine had been given accreditation to cover the vote.",
      "But none of that proves Russian interference, even if the billionaire driving force behind the party, Bidzina Ivanishvili, made his money in banking and steel in Russia, and critics believe he must still have contacts there.",
      "A high-ranking Georgian Dream figure told the BBC back in October that Georgia had said no to Moscow a long time ago and that the \"Russia card\" was being used by the opposition to attack her party.",
      "\u201cKnowing a little bit of Georgian history\u2026 no government would be that stupid to start thinking about that,\u201d said Maka Bochorishvili. Russia did fight a war with Georgia only 16 years ago.",
      "She has since become Georgia\u2019s foreign minister, the new face of this country\u2019s diplomacy.",
      "The crunch moment for Georgia and its relationship with the West came last Thursday, when the prime minister declared that the government had \u201cdecided not to put the issue of opening negotiations with the European Union\u201d on the agenda for the next four years.",
      "Within hours, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin had seized on his comments.",
      "\u201cI admired their courage and character, which they showed when defending their point of view,\u201d he said, stressing that Russia had no direct relationship with Tbilisi.",
      "Kobakhidze has even used the same kind of language as the Kremlin, accusing the opposition of planning a Ukraine-style \"Maidan\" revolution.",
      "However, his point was that Georgian police would ensure it did not happen.",
      "Thomas de Waal, a Caucasus specialist at Carnegie Europe, believes it\u2019s a mistake to see any kind of close friendship with Russia.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a business relationship - there\u2019s no diplomatic relationship. Things are going on behind the scenes but they\u2019re more afraid of Russia than wanting to join Russia.\u201d",
      "Whatever the extent of contacts, Moscow is bound to prefer Georgian Dream, who have within a short period trashed Georgia\u2019s links with the EU and US, to a passionately pro-Western opposition.",
      "The nightly protests show no sign yet of abating, despite temperatures falling close to freezing, and there is no indication yet of a resolution.",
      "Georgia has seen protests before, but not like this, says Lasha Dzebisashvili. Public servants from all walks of life have signed letters and petitions, and several ambassadors have resigned, including Georgia\u2019s ambassador to the US, a clear blow for the ruling party.",
      "The long stretch of Rustaveli Avenue is where this story will play out in front of parliament in Tbilisi, but the protests are being felt in other towns and cities too, including Batumi and Poti on the Black Sea, Zugdidi in the north-west and Kutaisi.",
      "On Sunday night, a large crowd of protesters formed outside the public broadcaster, demanding that the president be given airtime rather than the usual pro-government fare.",
      "It didn\u2019t happen and gradually the protesters marched towards the centre of the capital, halting the traffic and chanting \u201cGeorgia, Georgia\u201d.",
      "Nika Gvaramia and his fellow opposition leaders believe the clear way out is for free and fair elections, not under the existing election commission but under the auspices of the EU and US: \u201cIf Georgian Dream is sure they won the elections, let\u2019s go with new ones.\u201d",
      "That seems highly unlikely as it would require an implicit admission that the original vote was unfair.",
      "GD supporter and university lecturer Levan Gigineishvili believes they just need to hold out for a new president in the US: \u201cI think a great way out of this will be [Donald] Trump coming to power and then everything will change.\u201d",
      "But 20 January is a long way ahead and this small state in the Caucasus will not be top of his agenda. And Georgia\u2019s business sector for one will not be happy with a continuing stalemate or with the government doing lasting damage to ties with the West."

    "story": [
      "Critics of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the FBI have expressed doubts that he is qualified to lead the US government\u2019s principal law enforcement agency.",
      "Some also raised fears that Kash Patel, a behind-the-scenes figure in Trump's first administration known for his loyalty, aims to dismantle an apolitical federal security service and refashion it into a means of partisan retribution.",
      "\"Look, 99.9% of the bureau is made up of hard working agents who adhere to the principles of fidelity, bravery and integrity,\" Jeff Lanza, a former FBI agent, said. \"But he's said that he's coming in to just decimate the agency. How is that going to go well and how will that play into the morale of the agents who have to work under him?\"",
      "Trump selected Patel, an unconventional nominee and vocal critic of the FBI, because of his agenda to carry out a radical overhaul of the agency he's been tapped to lead.",
      "The FBI director leads 37,000 employees across 55 US field offices. They also oversee 350 satellite offices and more than 60 other foreign locations expected to cover almost 200 countries.",
      "Former FBI and Department of Justice officials who spoke to BBC said the job is  difficult, and it would be nearly impossible for someone like Patel, who has limited management experience, to operate effectively.",
      "Gregory Brower, a former FBI assistant director and deputy general counsel who worked closely with the past two directors, called the job \"nonstop\".",
      "\"It's relentless. It's high stakes. It requires expert judgment, stamina, experience, and a strong ethical and moral compass,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Who else is in Trump's top team?Just how big was Trump's victory?",
      "Who else is in Trump's top team?",
      "Just how big was Trump's victory?",
      "When he announced his pick for FBI director, Trump called Patel \"a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People\".",
      "Patel began his career as a federal public defender in Miami before working as a terrorism prosecutor at the Department of Justice between 2014 and 2017. He then spent two years as senior aide to Republicans who led the House Intelligence Committee, reportedly fighting the investigation of Trump and Russian collusion in the 2016 election.",
      "When Democrats took control of the House in 2019, he was hired as a staffer on Trump\u2019s National Security Council. In February 2020, he became principal deputy in the Office of Director of National Intelligence - then led by acting director Richard Grenell.",
      "By November of that year, he had moved to the Pentagon to serve as chief ofstaff to Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller - a position he held until Trump left office two months later.",
      "\u201cKash Patel has served in key national security positions throughout the government. He is beyond qualified to lead the FBI and will make a fantastic Director,\" Alex Pfeiffer, a Trump transition spokesman, told the BBC.",
      "Those critical of Patel cite past FBI directors, many of whom worked their way up through the justice department or FBI for decades, as a better measure of the qualifications needed to lead the agency.",
      "\"It's certainly not like the backgrounds that we've seen other directors of the FBI and those who have overseen other similarly sized and important federal agencies bring to their jobs,\" Brower said of Patel's experience.",
      "Some pointed to former US Attorney General Bill Barr\u2019s recollection in his 2022 memoir of Trump's attempt to place Patel in a senior FBI position in his first term to stress the point further.",
      "\u201cI categorically opposed making Patel deputy FBI director. I told Mark Meadows it would happen \u2018over my dead body,'\u201d he wrote. \u201cSomeone with no background as an agent would never be able to command the respect necessary to run the day-to-day operations of the bureau.\u201d",
      "Since leaving office, Patel has promised in interviews that, if Trump returns to office, he and others will use the government to go after political opponents - including politicians and members of the media who he alleges without evidence helped overturn the 2020 US presidential election results.",
      "\"We're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,\" Patel told Steve Bannon, a White House chief strategist in Trump's first term, on the War Room podcast.",
      "\"We're going to come after you, whether it's criminally or civilly. We'll figure that out. But yeah, we're putting you all on notice\u2026 We're actually going to use the Constitution to prosecute them for crimes they said we have always been guilty of but never have.\"",
      "Trump said during his reelection campaign that he considers Patel\u2019s book - titled Government Gangsters - to be a \u201cblueprint\u201d for his next administration.",
      "In the memoir, which criticises the so-called deep state, Patel calls for \"comprehensive housecleaning\" of the FBI by firing \u201cthe top ranks\u201d.",
      "On a recent podcast, he said the incoming Trump administration intends to retain about 50 members of the FBI\u2019s Washington staff, and the remaining workforce would be put into the field. They would, in essence, \"close that building down\", he said, referring to FBI headquarters.",
      "\u201cOpen it up the next day as the museum to the deep state,\u201d he added.",
      "The FBI did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Mr Grenell and other former Trump administration officials who worked with Patel have praised his nomination and characterised him as a hardworking public servant.",
      "\u201cI have no doubt that Kash Patel will inspire our line FBI agents who want to fight crime, destroy the cartels, capture spies, and jail mobsters, thugs, fraudsters and traffickers,\u201d Robert O\u2019Brien, Trump\u2019s last national security adviser, said on X.",
      "Few, however, mentioned current FBI Director Christopher Wray, who was appointed by Trump after the then-president fired the agency\u2019s last leader - James Comey - or that he still has three years remaining on his term.",
      "Ultimately, it remains up to the Senate who will vote on whether Patel's nomination will be confirmed.",

    "summary": "Villagers remain scarred a year after the military mistook them for jihadists, killing 85 people.",
    "story": [
      "An Islamic school teacher, Masud Abdulrasheed, is struggling to come to terms with the killing of his seven-year-old daughter in drone strikes by Nigeria's military during a religious festival in their large but sparsely populated village exactly a year ago.",
      "The military said the bombing was caused by \"a failure of intelligence\", leading the army to mistake the open-air festival in Tudunbiri for a gathering of jihadist fighters.",
      "\"The incident of December 3rd, 2023 was a great tragedy that shouldn\u2019t have happened,\" military spokesman Maj-Gen Edward Buba told the BBC. \"The armed forces regret that incident. And if we could bring the lives lost back, we would.\"",
      "Warning: This story contains graphic details which some readers may find distressing",
      "About 85 people were killed, including Mr Abdulrasheed's little daughter Habeebah, when unmanned drones dropped two bombs on the village in northern Kaduna state.",
      "\"The first bomb dropped on us at around 10 pm, close to a tree where women and children were seated,\" Mr Abdulrasheed recalled. \"We ran for safety, but moments later we gathered to help those injured and also called for help, but the second bomb was dropped and it killed more people.\"",
      "Mr Abdulrasheed described Habeebah as \"the most caring among my children\".",
      "\"She would always give me whatever gift she was given, even if I didn\u2019t need it,\" he told the BBC.",
      "The 36-year-old was one of the organisers of the annual festival, known as Maulud, held to celebrate the birth of Prophet Muhammad.",
      "Many of his students were killed in the tragedy.",
      "\"We saw dead bodies all over the place as if they were sleeping. Body parts were strewn around the tree branches and rooftops. We had to pack them inside sacks and buried all the dead in a mass grave.",
      "\"There is nothing more devastating than seeing people you invited for a celebration coming to meet their end. I am so heartbroken,\" Mr Abdulrasheed said.",
      "As the father of four spoke to the BBC, he sat his second daughter, Zaharau, beside him on a mat outside their home. He gently pulled up her top to show a wound on her stomach.",
      "Four-year-old Zaharau was hit by shrapnel. It took at least an hour to drive her and the other wounded to the nearest hospital in Kaduna city.",
      "Although she underwent surgery, her wound still hasn't fully healed.",
      "\"When my daughter and the others that got injured were at the hospital, they were well taken care of. We thank the government for that.",
      "\"But things changed after they got discharged, months later. The hospital has refused to continue with their [free] treatment. They keep giving us excuses.\"",
      "Walking around Tudunbiri, there is hardly a family not affected by the tragedy of that fateful night.",
      "Twenty-year-old Aisha Buhari lost three of her younger brothers. She survived, suffering an injury to her left arm that is yet to heal.",
      "Sitting on a stool, she cried and wiped her tears with her hijab as she recalled the last moments of her brothers.",
      "\"That night, I just finished talking with them and stepped away for a moment when the first bomb hit, only for me to see their dead bodies on the ground moments later,\" Ms Buhari said.",
      "\"When they rushed me to the hospital, I could not think of anything but my brothers. I cried so much.\"",
      "As Ms Buhari spoke, she paused to wipe the pus oozing from her wound.",
      "\"There was no house or farm task I could not do before the incident, but now I can\u2019t do anything properly. I depend on people to help with something as basic as washing clothes,\" she said.",
      "Kaduna state governor Uba Sani told the BBC that he would look into the plight of villagers like Ms Buhari.",
      "\"Thank you BBC for this information. I will personally go back to Tudunbiri, and if I find people that still need treatment, I will take care of it,\" he promised.",
      "\"The instruction I gave was that all the injured should be treated and none of them should be discharged until they are fully recovered,\" he added.",
      "Undeterred by last year\u2019s tragedy, the Muslim faithful in Tudunbiri celebrated the festival again this year, but held it two months earlier.",
      "The occasion also marked the inauguration of a mosque the authorities have built for them over the bomb site, as a form of compensation.",
      "Mr Abdulrasheed acts as the mosque's imam as the previous one was killed in the air strikes.",
      "\"We are happy about the new mosque, but we can never forget what happened,\" Mr Abdulrasheed told the BBC. \"Any time I come here, I always remember that day, and I feel depressed. As we celebrate this year\u2019s Maulud, we also mourn those that we lost.\"",
      "For years, Nigeria's military has been battling armed jihadists and criminals, who raid villages and kidnap people for ransom in parts of the north.",
      "This has led to an upsurge in air strikes aimed at targeting them.",
      "The Nigerian Air Force has obtained \"a multitude\" of new aircraft, the editor of Defence Web, Guy Martin, told the BBC.",
      "This included Chinese-built unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones.",
      "\"Chinese UAVs are cheaper, making them more accessible. Nearly a third of African countries have acquired UAVs, mainly from Turkey and China,\" Mr Martin said, pointing out that it was strikes from UAVs that caused the disaster in Tudunbiri.",
      "\"Intelligence failure, poor coordination, and inadequate operator training are some of the reasons for erroneous strikes. The rapid deployment of UAV technology often outpaces the development of proper training and engagement protocols for military personnel,\" Mr Martin added.",
      "Maj-Gen Buba told the BBC that the military had found itself operating in a \"challenging and complex\" operational environment.",
      "\"But we have grown in our equipment holding and in our deployments of more experienced commanders and troops,\" he said.",
      "According to consulting firm SBM Intelligence, the Nigerian Air Force carried out 17 accidental air strikes between January 2017 and September 2024, killing more than 500 people.",
      "\"One mistake is enough; when we see hundreds being killed in erroneous attacks, we should be concerned,\" Human Rights Watch (HRW) Nigeria researcher Anietie Ewang said.",
      "In response, Maj-Gen Buba said that rights campaigners should \"give us more credit for being more transparent, for working with the people, and for being more accountable for our actions, as was revealed particularly during the Tudunbiri incident\".",
      "\"We will do everything possible to ensure that this never happens [again],\" Maj-Gen Buba added.",
      "He said that two army personnel were being court-martialled over the incident and while the case was still in progress, the military had redeployed them and relieved them of their command.",
      "Both the federal and state government have also unveiled development projects for the village as part of efforts to show remorse for the deaths, with Sani telling the BBC that the construction of a hospital and skills acquisition centre was almost complete.",
      "\"We have been supporting the people of Tudunbiri, and we will continue to do that,\" he said.",
      "\"They are my people,\" the governor added.",
      "But in a cruel irony, more than 20 people in the village reported that their farmland had been confiscated for the projects.",
      "They include 50-year-old Hashim Abdullahi, who told the BBC: \"I am not happy because this hospital has taken my means of livelihood and I was not compensated. I have been rendered jobless and can\u2019t provide for my family.\"",
      "In response, Sani said: \"For the people that genuinely have land, the department of land in Kaduna is working with the head of the community to ensure that the right people are given their land back.\"",
      "Nigeria's Vice-President Kashim Shettima also visited the village following the killings, promising - in conjunction with the state government - justice and financial compensation.",
      "People were told they would receive 2.5 million naira ($1,500; \u00a31,180) for each person killed in their family, while those injured were offered about 750,000 naira ($500).",
      "\"It is a difference that authorities actually carried out compensation this time around, but there is a sense that it has been very arbitrary,\" Ms Ewang said.",
      "\"We need to see the authorities take much-needed action towards justice, accountability, and compensation for victims in all of the other incidents of air strikes where they have accepted it was an error,\" she added.",
      "Ms Buhari told the BBC that her family had received the 7.5 million naira for her three brothers who were killed, and she got 750,000 naira for her injuries - though this was not enough.",
      "\"I usually buy drugs at a pharmacy to dress the wound because that\u2019s all I can afford to do now. The hospital doesn\u2019t attend to us any more. Sometimes the pain would be very severe for weeks,\" she said.",
      "\"We hope the government will come to our aid again so that I can get proper care for my arm. I can\u2019t wait to use it again,\" Ms Buhari added.",
      "Mr Abdulrasheed told the BBC he had not received financial compensation for the injuries suffered by his four-year-old.",
      "\"I always feel worried when I look at her condition,\" he said.",
      "He said he had received the full financial compensation for the death of his seven-year-old, but no amount of money could replace her.",
      "\"Every time I visit the grave site, I remember those we used to live together with but now they are no more. I miss them all. I miss my daughter.\"",

      "Shepherd J\u00f3zsef R\u00e1cz and his sons keep 500 ewes up on the high pasture here. It\u2019s a hard life: when he\u2019s not worrying about milking his sheep, which he does three times a day, he\u2019s worrying about protecting them from predators.",
      "Each year, J\u00f3zsef loses five or six of his herd to a wolf, or a bear. It\u2019s why he keeps 17 dogs.",
      "\u201cA good dog is the best tool a shepherd has, to protect his flock at night, and in the daytime too,\u201d the farmer says.",
      "On Tuesday, 45 years of strict protection for grey wolves in Europe came to an end, after conservation officials adopted EU measures to downgrade the animal's protected status.",
      "The news means that grey wolves will be moved from Annex II (strictly protected) to Annex III (protected) of the Bern Convention.",
      "This will remove many of the safeguards that have allowed the animals to flourish in Europe and means that from the beginning of March next year, each EU country will be able to set an annual quota of wolves to kill.",
      "The Commission argued that the number of wolves in the EU has almost doubled, from 11,000 in 2012 to over 20,000 today, and that they were causing too much damage to livestock.",
      "The Worldwide Fund for Nature  (WWF) has called the decision \"extremely disappointing\".",
      "\"Wolf populations have barely recovered after going extinct in most parts of Europe, and weakening their protection could jeopardise this fragile recovery,\" said the WWF in a statement.",
      "The organisation also accused the Commission of prioritising political decisions over science, saying the decision was influenced by \"personal reasons after Commission President Von der Leyen\u2019s pony was killed by a wolf in 2022\".",
      "Wildlife campaigners have argued that improved protection methods, including trained sheep dogs, would be a better solution than removing safeguards. They say that wolves keep down numbers of deer and wild boar, which damage trees and crops. Wolves also prevent the spread of diseases by eating sick animals.",
      "In the town of Baile Tusnad, in a valley near J\u00f3zsef\u2019s village, wildlife experts met recently to discuss large carnivores. Most, though not all, oppose the hunting of wolves and bears.",
      "\u201cAfrican swine fever is spreading all over Europe,\u201d said Michal Haring, a biologist from Slovakia, \u201cand the wolf is a very good \u2018doctor\u2019 for this, suppressing the disease. Wolves cannot catch it.\u201d",
      "Another argument against shooting wolves is that they hunt in packs of five to eight, usually a pair and their offspring. If the older wolves are shot, the pack fragments, making it harder for them to catch deer and wild boar.",
      "\u201cIndividual wolves are more likely to attack sheep and other domesticated animals,\u201d Mr Haring explains.",
      "Campaigners also pointed to a 2023 EU report, which states that only around 50,000 of Europe\u2019s 68 million sheep and goats are killed by wolves each year \u2013 0.065% of the total number \u2013 adding that the overall impact of wolves on EU livestock is \u201cvery small\u201d.",
      "Moreover, it says there have been no fatal wolf attacks on humans for 40 years.",
      "\u201cIf we expect countries like India or Indonesia to protect their tigers,\u201d says Laurent Schley, head of the Wildlife department in the Luxembourg government, \u201cand Africans to protect lions and elephants, then we as relatively rich Europeans should be willing to tolerate some wolves.\u201d Luxembourg is one of the few western European countries where no wolves have been sighted yet, Mr Schley believes it\u2019s only a matter of time.",
      "\u201cWe have very high densities of deer and wild boar, so the conditions for the wolf are there.",
      "\"Of course, if individual wolves or packs start killing too much livestock, or were to show aggression towards humans, we would have to draw the line. Human safety always comes first.\u201d",
      "But back on the mountainside, J\u00f3zsef says wolves are dangerous because \u201cthey\u2019re clever animals\u201d. He favours tougher legal measures to cull the predators.",
      "Bears approach through the forest, treading on branches and alerting his dogs, J\u00f3zsef says: if they break into the wickerwork enclosure where his herd stay at night, they will only grab one animal.",
      "If a pack of wolves get in though, they can kill dozens of sheep at a time.",
      "Last year, J\u00f3zsef\u2019s favourite dog, Moody, was killed by wolves, in broad daylight, as they moved from one pasture to the next. All they found was his bloodied pelt.",
      "The more wolves there are, J\u00f3zsef says, the more likely they will take his sheep.",

      "In the National Assembly, Barnier could count on his own conservative group and the Macronites. But this centrist bloc has been easily outnumbered by a left-wing coalition on one side, and on the other the populist right of Marine Le Pen.",
      "And when those two forces combine - as they will in Wednesday\u2019s censure motion - then the numbers are too much, and Barnier must fall.",
      "It is a crisis that has been waiting to happen, but was deferred till now by long procedural haggling over the 2025 budget.",
      "Shortly after taking office in September, he proposed a budget that promised \u20ac60bn (\u00a349bn) in deficit reduction - necessary, he said, to satisfy Brussels and get the country\u2019s finances back in shape.",
      "But because he lacked a majority, his budget was then disfigured by opposition amendments - from both left and populist right - which removed taxes and introduced more spending, thus changing its essential nature.",
      "After much parliamentary to-ing and fro-ing with the conservative dominated Senate, Barnier came back with a new text, or technically texts, because there is a social security budget as well as the overall budget.",

      "These include northern and eastern areas controlled by a Kurdish-led alliance of armed groups supported by the United States.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 16:57:15 GMT",
    "summary": "An act of clemency by Hunter Biden's father continues a tradition by American presidents.",
    "story": [
      "US President Joe Biden has issued a presidential pardon for his son Hunter, who was facing sentencing for two criminal cases.",
      "The move has proven controversial, since the outgoing president previously ruled out such a move. But he claimed the cases against his son were politically motivated.",
      "His use of his pardoning powers continues a tradition of presidents on both sides of the American political divide granting clemency to people close to them.",
      "What did Hunter Biden do?",
      "Hunter Biden was awaiting sentencing later this month in two federal cases.",
      "In June, he became the first child of a sitting US president to be criminally convicted - in a case relating to his gun ownership. He was found guilty by a jury in Delaware of three charges for lying about his drug use on a form when buying a handgun.",
      "He was also awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty in September in a federal tax case that centred on whether he paid enough tax from 2016-19. The nine charges included failure to file and pay his taxes, tax evasion and filing a false return.",
      "He faced up to 25 years in prison in the gun case and 17 years in the tax case, though he was likely to get much shorter tariffs and to serve the two sentences concurrently, experts told the New York Times.",
      "Follow live reaction to this storyPresident Biden's statement in fullWhat has the president said in the past about pardoning his son?Analysis: Biden's pardon for son shows presidents now act differentlyFull story: Biden highlights 'miscarriage of justice'",
      "Follow live reaction to this story",
      "President Biden's statement in full",
      "What has the president said in the past about pardoning his son?",
      "Analysis: Biden's pardon for son shows presidents now act differently",
      "Full story: Biden highlights 'miscarriage of justice'",
      "What is a presidential pardon?",
      "The US Constitution decrees that a president has the broad \"power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment\".",
      "In this case, the president's \"full and unconditional pardon\" is unusually sweeping.",
      "It covers any potential federal crimes the younger Biden may have committed during a period of more than 10 years from January 2014 to December 2024.",
      "That spans a period beyond Hunter Biden's tax and gun offences and dates back to the year he joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, while his father, then US vice-president, had a key role in US policy towards Kyiv.",
      "The wording of the pardon also makes clear that it covers any offence that the younger Biden \"has committed or may have committed\".",
      "The pardon represents legal forgiveness, ends any further punishment and restores rights such as being able to vote or run for public office.",
      "Although the pardoning power is considered broad, it is not limitless. For example, a president can only issue pardons for federal (national-level) crimes.",
      "The issue is relevant because there is a question mark over the sentencing of Trump in his hush-money case in New York. He will be unable to pardon himself in that state-level case when he returns to the White House in January.",
      "How many pardons have other presidents issued?",
      "There is a long-standing precedent of US presidents on both sides of the political divide issuing pardons - including to people close to them. This is the 26th pardon issued by Biden, a Democrat.",
      "In 2020, Trump, a Republican, pardoned Charles Kushner, the father-in-law of his daughter Ivanka. Kushner was sentenced to two years in prison in 2004 for charges including tax evasion, campaign finance offences and witness tampering.",
      "And in 2001, Bill Clinton, pardoned his younger half-brother, Roger Clinton, for a cocaine-related offence that dated back to 1985.",
      "In both cases, the pardons were given to people who had already served a sentence. President Biden's intervention in his son's case comes before sentencing.",
      "Trump granted 237 acts of clemency during his four years in the White House, according to the Pew Research Center, comprising 143 pardons and 94 commuted sentences. Many were in a flurry before he left office.",
      "That number is significantly fewer than his predecessor Barack Obama, who during his eight-year stint granted 1,927 acts of clemency, according to Pew. These were 1,715 commutations and 212 pardons.",
      "Most of those who received executive clemency under Obama had been convicted of narcotics charges at the height of the so-called US war on drugs.",
      "One of the most controversial presidential pardons was granted by Gerald Ford to his predecessor Richard Nixon in 1974 - covering acts that occurred during the Watergate Scandal. It was described as an effort to heal the nation.",
      "What have Biden and Trump said about pardons?",
      "The day after he took office in 2021, Biden emphasised that he would do things differently to Trump. His press secretary told reporters that the flurry of last-minute pardons issued by Trump was \"not a model... for how President Biden would use his own power. He would use his own power far more judiciously\".",
      "Biden said after his son's conviction that he would not issue a pardon. In the statement announcing his U-turn, he acknowledged that he had pledged to \"not interfere with the justice department\u2019s decision-making\". But, he said, the younger Biden had been \"singled out\" and subjected to a \"miscarriage of justice\".",
      "Trump is among those who have attacked Biden for the move, calling it an \"abuse\".",
      "The incoming president asked whether Biden would also pardon supporters of his who were prosecuted over the US Capitol riot on 6 January 2021.",
      "Trump, who faced a series of legal issues while away from the White House, has repeatedly made the allegation that the US justice system has been weaponised against him and his supporters.",
      "He has promised to issue pardons of his own for those who rioted in Washington. But who exactly will be granted clemency, and whether pardons will extend to those convicted of the most serious and violent offences, is still an open question."

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 21:16:05 GMT",
    "summary": "The country's president has already shown he is prepared to go to brutal lengths to save his regime.",
    "story": [
      "The reignited war in Syria is the latest fallout from the turmoil that has gripped the Middle East since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October last year.",
      "The attacks, and Israel\u2019s response, upended the status quo. Events in Syria in the last few days are more proof that the war gripping the Middle East is escalating, not subsiding.",
      "During a decade of war after 2011, Bashar al-Assad\u2019s rule survived because he was prepared to break Syria to save the regime he had inherited from his father.",
      "To do that he relied on powerful allies, Russia, Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah. They intervened on his side against rebel groups that ranged from the jihadist extremists of Islamic State to militias supported by the US and the rich Gulf monarchies.",
      "Now Iran is reeling from severe blows inflicted by Israel, with US support, on its security in the Middle East. Its ally Hezbollah, which used to send its best men to fight for the Assad regime in Syria, has been crippled by Israel\u2019s attacks. Russia has launched air strikes in the last few days against the rebel offensive in Syria \u2013 but its military power is almost entirely earmarked to fight the war in Ukraine.",
      "The war in Syria did not end. It dropped out of the place it used to occupy in headline news, partly because of turbulence across the Middle East and beyond, and because it is almost impossible for journalists to get into the country.",
      "In places the war was suspended, or frozen, but Syria is full of unfinished business.",
      "The Assad regime has never regained the power it had used to control Syria before 2011, the year of the Arab uprisings, though it still kept a gulag of Syrian prisoners in its jails.",
      "Even so, until the last few days, the regime of President Bashar al-Assad controlled the major cities, their surrounding countryside and the main highways connecting them.",
      "Now a coalition of rebel groups, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), has broken out of Idlib, the province along the border with Turkey that it controls, and in only a few days since 27 November swept away Syrian troops in a series of \"astonishing\" events, as one senior international diplomat told me.",
      "Two days into the offensive, they were posting photos of fighters who had taken the ancient citadel of Aleppo, which had been an impregnable base for government troops between 2012 and 2015, when the city was divided between rebels and regime forces.",
      "The atmosphere in Aleppo seems calm after the rout of government troops. One photo on social media showed uniformed and armed rebel fighters queuing for fried chicken at a fast-food outlet.",
      "HTS has roots in al-Qaeda, though it broke with the group in 2016 and at times has fought its rump loyalists. But HTS is still designated as a terrorist group by the UN Security Council and countries including the US, the European Union, Turkey and the UK.  (The Syrian regime calls all its opponents terrorists.)",
      "The leader of HTS, Abu Mohammad al-Jawlani, has a long history as a jihadist leader in Iraq and Syria. In recent years, though, he has moved away from strict jihadist ideology to try to broaden the appeal of his group.",
      "The rebranding is also being used to attract support for the offensive, which HTS calls Operation Repelling the Aggression. That name, and its official announcements, avoid jihadist language and Islamist references.",
      "Neutral language, according to Mina al-Lami, the jihadist media specialist at BBC Monitoring, is designed to distance what\u2019s happening from the jihadist past of HTS and present the offensive as a joint rebel enterprise against the regime.",
      "Syrians are generally repelled by extreme religious rhetoric. As jihadist groups came to dominate the rebellion after pro-democracy demonstrations were crushed after the first year or so of war after 2011, many Syrians either stayed neutral or sided reluctantly with the regime because they feared the murderous jihadist ideology of Islamic State.",
      "The offensive led by HTS comes out of the splintered political landscape of northern Syria. Much of the north-east is controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a group led by Kurds and supported by the United States, which stations around 900 troops in the area.",
      "Turkey is a big player, controlling borderlands where it has deployed its own regular troops as well as the militias it sponsors. Sleeper cells drawn from the remnants of Islamic State sometimes mount deadly ambushes on roads through the Syrian desert.",
      "Reports from Syria say that the rebel forces have captured significant supplies of military equipment, including helicopters, and are pressing on towards Hama, the next significant city on the road to Damascus.",
      "Without a doubt the regime and its allies will be working to steady themselves and to hit back, especially with air power. The rebels do not have an air force, though in another sign of the way that unmanned aerial vehicles are revolutionising warfare, there are reports that they used a drone to kill a senior regime intelligence official.",
      "The renewed fighting in Syria is causing international alarm. The UN envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, issued a statement saying that \"the latest developments pose severe risks to civilians and have serious implications for regional and international security\u2026 No Syrian party or existing group of actors can resolve the Syrian conflict via military means\".",
      "Pedersen added that there had been \"a collective failure to bring about a genuine political process\" to implement UN Security Council resolution 2254, which was passed in 2015. That laid out a roadmap for peace, with the principle in the text that \u201cthe Syrian people will decide the future of Syria\u201d.",
      "The objective was a future shaped by free elections and a new constitution. But that meant Assad and his family giving up a country that they treated for years as their personal fief. More than half a million dead attest to their determination not to let that happen.",
      "It is too soon to write the Assad regime off. It has a core of genuine support. Some Syrians see it as the least bad option \u2013 better than the jihadists who came to dominate the rebellion. But if other anti-Assad groups \u2013 and there are many \u2013 rise up, his regime will once again be in mortal danger.",

      "The band posted about the incident on their Instagram account. Cellphone video showed an individual taking items out of a van as the person taking the video shouts for one of the band's party to get down before yelling, \"Ring the police! Ring the police!\"",

    "summary": "At 32, she's an accomplished actor, successful singer-songwriter, billionaire business owner, and philanthropist. But Selena Gomez's gutsiest move may have been sharing her real self.",
    "story": [
      "On any red carpet, Selena Gomez is the picture of beauty, poise and confidence. But she'll be the first to tell you that things aren't always what they appear. For instance, her latest film: \"Emilia P\u00e9rez.\" Gomez co-stars as the wife of a powerful Mexican drug lord who secretly transitions. The film is a hard-hitting true crime story, a poignant love story, a journey of self-discovery \u2013 and a musical. But somehow it all works.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" click on the video player below:",
      "Gomez said shooting left her \"a little sore\" from all the dance numbers. So, why did she want to do it? \"I found it incredibly compelling,\" she said. \"I've never really seen a movie like this before. I don't think I've ever been this proud of something in the acting field.\"",
      "And that's really saying something; at 32, Gomez has a lot to be proud of: She's an accomplished actor, but she's also a very successful singer-songwriter, and thanks to her wildly popular Rare Beauty line of cosmetics, she's a billionaire, and a very active philanthropist. It's all quite impressive, and even more so when you realize where she started.",
      "Gomez was born in the Texas town of Grand Prairie. Her mom, Mandy Teefy, was only 16 years old. Selena's parents split when she was five. She says the family had a lot of love, and not much else, with tough times when her mother struggled to put food on the table. \"My mom worked multiple jobs,\" she said. \"She also was finishing high school when she was having me. When I'm doing something great today, it just makes me more thankful for the lessons that my mother taught me.\"",
      "Gomez was barely 10 when she landed a part on TV's \"Barney & Friends,\" and a few years later she became a fixture on the Disney Channel, on such shows as \"Wizards of Waverly Place.\"",
      "She branched out into music, and became a pop sensation. And when the pandemic came, she switched gears again, hosting \"Selena + Chef,\" a popular online cooking show shot in the kitchen of her L.A. home. \"We had cameras everywhere, from every aspect of it,\" she said.",
      "And how are her cooking skills now? \"They're not that great, I'm not gonna lie!\" she laughed.",
      "And then, in 2021 she helped cook up one of the biggest hits on TV: \"Only Murders in the Building.\" She praised her co-stars, Steve Martin and Martin Short: \"These men, Steve and Martin, have been working longer than I've been alive, but they are the first ones to be on set. They take time to ask everyone they run into how their day is. And on top of it, they think everything through. They are wonderful people, and they've helped me grow up in a lot of ways. These guys have become my friends and allies and people I can ask advice from. I couldn't be more grateful to work with them.\"",
      "Gomez is the first to admit that she's had a magical life, and that it hasn't always been a bed of roses. She's been open about her health struggles, like having lupus and receiving a kidney transplant.",
      "She also decided to take her struggles with anxiety and depression, and her bipolar diagnosis, public. Her 2022 documentary, \"Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me,\" is an unvarnished look at her life \u2013 the highs and the very deep lows.",
      "She admits she was a little nervous about sharing it with the world but, \"once I released it, it felt like a huge relief, because I am a firm believer that one of the strongest things you can do is be vulnerable. And that doesn't mean you have to pour your heart out to everyone. But I made that choice, because I knew I wasn't the only one that felt that way. And if my world was already out there for everyone to see, I'd like to tell my part of the story. And to add on that, it's a dream what I'm doing.\"",
      "Part of what her dream is was a benefit held last month for her Rare Impact Fund, a charity aimed at helping young people who suffer from the same mental health challenges she's been through. \"This is probably the most important thing to me, besides my family,\" she said. \"This is the cherry on top of everything.\"",
      "Another high point is her relationship with music producer Benny Blanco, whom People Magazine named one of the sexiest men alive. \"Yeah, that's my man!\" Gomez said. \"To know that there is someone in the world that deeply cares about every tiny detail about who I am, I'm really, really lucky.\"",
      "It's clear from \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" that she's an artist who likes to take risks. But Selena Gomez's gutsiest move has been sharing her real self, and that has made all the difference.",
      "I asked, \"The reaction in general has been overwhelmingly positive, hasn't it?\"",
      "\"Sure. Maybe,\" Gomez replied.",
      "Maybe?\u00a0 \"It's not that I really need anyone's approval,\" she added. \"I think I'm just really, I'm okay with where I am and who I am. And I'm glad. I'm glad that I finally got there.\"",

From introducing acts like Olivia Rodrigo, to mingling with pop princesses (\"Sabrina Carpenter, everyone!\"), and interviewing rock royalty like Cher, on this day, this Elvis is king.",
      "But he says being interviewed for TV is different for him: \"I'm not a camera guy, I'm a radio guy,\" he said.",
      "If you don't recognize his face, you may know his voice. Since 1996 the 60-year-old disc jockey has been host of \"Elvis Duran and the Morning Show,\" the country's most popular Top 40 morning program. \"I can't believe it's been 30 years, because it's been nothing but fun,\" he said.",
      "Every day, millions of listeners nationwide wake up to Duran and his crew dishing about music, pop culture \u2026 pretty much whatever's on their minds. \"I've been working with some of the same people for 25-30 years,\" he said. \"The energy with each other is what makes it work. I don't need to be the center of attention.\"",
      "With 70 markets across the country listening, Duran's a rarity these days \u2013 a nationally-known radio DJ.",
      "I asked, \"Growing up, I remember big-name radio DJs. Now it's kind of you and Ryan Seacrest. What happened?\"",
      "\"Radio isn't what radio used to be,\" Duran replied. \"A lot of radio companies gave up on personalities; they just wanted to play music, it's cheaper. That's not good for our business. So, I've done everything I can to keep personality on a radio show in the mornings.\"",
      "And it's Duran's personality that over the years has won him loyal fans, including some of the biggest names in pop music. \"Lady Gaga grew up dreaming of hearing her song on our show,\" he said. \"And when she walked into the room, she was sort of nervous. And I was thinking, 'Well, shouldn't it be the opposite way? It is Lady Gaga!'\"",
      "But it's everyday listeners with whom Duran feels a special bond. He said, \"We are in the friendship business. I think about you when you hop in your car in the morning. You're either leaving a house that may be full of turmoil, or going to a job with a boss you don't like. But I have you for 20-30 minutes, and I can be your friend.\"",
      "Duran fell in love with radio as a kid: \"I'd spend the night at my grandmother's house when mom and dad were out late, and I listened to the radio. And I became friends with this voice in the dark.\"",
      "He was just seven and growing up in McKinney, Texas. \"I didn't have a lot of friends growing up. I was a loner. And so, I found friendship through the radio.\"",
      "And so began his quest to become one of those voices. He even built his own transmitter, with a studio located in his bedroom closet. \"My only listener was the lady next door.\"",
      "Duran's first real radio job came at age 14. After dropping out of college, he spent a decade bouncing between markets across the country. \"Back in the old days in radio, you never unpacked, you never took dishes out of boxes, because you were always moving,\" he said. \"But you know what, I've been very lucky. I've been at Z100 since 1989. So, I'm doing okay.\"",
      "While his show is based in the Big Apple, Duran's heart belongs in New Mexico. As a kid, he visited the \"Land of Enchantment\" frequently. He says the quiet of Santa Fe is the polar opposite of New York City. \"Of course, I need that. Santa Fe is a magical place.

      "Duran and his husband, Alex Carr, share a home here, not far from where they were married in 2019. But decades before their first date, they had a chance encounter \u2013 where else? \u2013 on the radio, back in 1998. \"I had him on as a contest winner once,\" Duran said.\u00a0 \"Jingle Ball tickets.

I never, ever want to go back to being a lonely person ever again. And I don't want anyone listening to our show to be lonely. That's the legacy we're all trying to leave.

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 09:24:56 -0500",
    "summary": "It was in the chaos of a kitchen where the chef, restaurateur and TV cooking judge (and author of the new cookbook-memoir, \"Why I Cook\") learned how to be himself.",
    "story": [
      "When you find yourself at the farmer's market next to a guy with strong opinions about fennel and scallions, you listen. That's especially true if the guy is Tom Colicchio, who for more than 20 seasons has been a judge on one of America's biggest food shows, \"Top Chef,\" while also working as one of America's most successful restaurateurs.",
      "Many of his celebrated dishes have started at a local greenmarket in New York City's Union Square, but lately the meals he enjoys the most are even more local than these ingredients. \"I cook very simply at home,\" he said. \"It's not the food part of it. I enjoy the half an hour, 45 minutes that we're sitting together as a family.\"",
      "Now 62, married and a father of three, Colicchio is sharing the story of his many lives in the kitchen in a new book, \"Why I Cook\" (Artisan).",
      "So, why does he cook? \"Partly it was something that I found at a very young age that I was good at,\" he said. \"It came very easy.\"",
      "Thomas Patrick Colicchio grew up in Elizabeth, New Jersey, sharing a bedroom with two brothers, and big boisterous family meals in a working-class Italian neighborhood. While mom ran the family kitchen, it was dad, a gambler-turned-corrections officer, who helped turn Tom into a chef. \"Having ADHD, I struggled with recipes; I'd get frustrated by recipes,\" Colicchio said. \"But I loved cooking. And my dad wasn't the kind of dad who sat down and had these long conversations with you about your future. But he came home with these books \u2013 I had no idea what 'La Technique' was doing in a county jail library, but there it was!\"",
      "Yes, Jacques Pepin's \"La Technique\" is what helped Colicchio understand the fundamentals of cooking. \"Once I understood that, I could look at a recipe and go, 'Oh, they want me to roast something here. I know how to roast something. So, I don't need a recipe anymore,'\" he said. \"Or I can braise something. But now when I braise it, well, I can change the flavor profile by adding different things into that braise.\"",
      "The kitchen, however, was where Colicchio learned how to be himself, a place where in the chaos of orders and ingredients, he found a calling.",
      "His career took off fast, from flipping burgers at a local snack bar, to building whole menus at a North New Jersey hot spot, and ultimately to New York City, where \u2013 not yet 30 \u2013 he earned his first three-star review from The New York Times, at Mondrian.",
      "Colicchio doesn't credit his family for his entrepreneurial spirit: \"I think it came from the fact that I worked in kitchens and worked in restaurants that I didn't like. And I didn't want to have a boss.\"",
      "But even as he soared professionally \u2013 becoming executive chef at New York's celebrated Gramercy Tavern - Colicchio's private life was cruising toward rock-bottom. \"I was doing drugs when I was cooking the whole time,\" he said. \"Had a bad night and ended up in Harlem somewhere, you know, with another cook getting a bunch of drugs and, you know, getting high all night. I woke up in my bed \u2026 my shirt was covered in blood. I don't remember getting home, which kind of scared me, 'cause I was driving a motorcycle. So, somehow I made it home. But that was it. I woke up and said, 'That's it. No more.'\"",
      "He quit the drugs, but his working-class roots still led to some awkward moments in the Frenchified, fancy world of fine dining. \"I knew I could hold my own, but I just still felt like I was a fish out of water here,\" he said. \"Now I'm in New York. You know, you get three stars, now all of a sudden you're getting pulled in a lot of different directions. Was there a certain amount of impostor syndrome? Absolutely.\"",
      "He said he tried saying no to \"Top Chef\" (\"Didn't really love food TV\"), but then he had the experience of attending a food festival: \"Come time to sign books, and I'm sitting next to Bobby Flay, and he's signing 300 and I'm signing 20. I didn't think it was because he had a better book. He was on TV. It was like, 'All right, let me do this TV thing.'\"",
      "Looking back now, in his new book, Colicchio traces the arc of a changing industry, where sexism and even abuse has been replaced by something a little kinder, and a lot more welcoming. \"There's still voices being raised,\" he said. \"It's a little different than it used to be, but there's still, you know, in the middle of service there were times you got to be forceful. But you can be sure it's not personal. What's really missing is a lot of the misogyny that I saw.\"",
      "But for Tom Colicchio, after all these years, the one thing that hasn't changed is the one thing that also keeps him in the kitchen: \"Looking back on it, food has the power to bring people around a table. And to this day, I love doing dinner parties, love having people over. That's another reason why I cook.\"",

The on-duty commander that night guaranteed the child Santa would have a safe journey from the North Pole and a tradition was established. The annual tracking carried over when the precursor agency became NORAD in 1959. Since 1997, the tracker has been available online.",

      "Preparing to follow Santa's journey",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 16:29:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Levels of both the flu and COVID viruses are still low across much of the country, the CDC says.",
    "story": [
      "This year's winter surge of influenza and COVID-19 has yet to arrive for most of the country, data published this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, with trends so far a fraction of what they were at this time last year.",
      "\"COVID-19 activity remains low and is stable in most areas. Seasonal influenza activity is increasing slightly among children but remains low nationally,\" the CDC said this week, in its weekly report on data about the two viruses.",
      "The agency's updates are usually published every week by Friday, but were delayed until after the weekend because of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "A return to normal for flu?",
      "By this time last year, data tracking outpatient visits to places like emergency rooms and doctor's offices for the flu had already climbed above the agency's baseline for the season. This year's latest report suggests flu cases are only now starting to cross that threshold.",
      "\"We're maybe slightly later than last year, and maybe quite a bit later than the year before, but those years were unusually early,\" said University of North Carolina epidemiology professor Justin Lessler, a top expert in the CDC-backed network of disease forecasters.",
      "Lessler said this year's figures look \"much closer to about where you'd expect a normal flu season to be\" before the COVID-19 pandemic, when measures to curb the outbreak scrambled seasonal patterns of flu and other respiratory germs.",
      "Compared with last year, rates of weekly flu hospitalizations are around five times lower. Emergency room visits with flu from school-age kids have accelerated, the CDC's data shows, but remain less than a third of what they were at this time last year.",
      "One big factor that could be affecting the figures this year is immunity in the population from the last two waves of influenza, alongside vaccination.",
      "\"We have had two fairly substantial seasons, which could be driving this delay. Of course the question is, does that mean we're having a delay, or a milder season. That's really kind of uncertain at this point,\" said epidemiologist Shaun Truelove, associate scientist at Johns Hopkins University's public health school.",
      "Modeling of this year's flu season gathered from different experts make different assumptions about what the country's flu immunity looks like, as they try to play out different scenarios of how this year's flu season might look like.",
      "Truelove, who also helps lead the CDC-funded disease forecasting network, also thinks that this year could mark a \"return to normal\" for flu.",
      "\"That being said, flu is never consistent. We get early seasons and late seasons. So it's hard to say exactly what that means, and everything's a bit weird post-pandemic, in terms of scale and timing,\" said Truelove.",
      "Watching for another COVID-19 wave",
      "Several COVID-19 trends that the CDC tracks also remain below what was recorded at this time in 2023. This is a contrast with previous summer waves of the virus, which have only dipped slightly into the fall before picking up again during the winter.",
      "COVID-19 emergency room visits are \"low\" or \"minimal\" in nearly all states, after this year's late summer wave of the virus. Levels of the virus in wastewater are \"minimal\" in all regions, compared to \"high\" levels around this time last year.",
      "\"Does that mean that there was enough immunity built up in that summer wave that we're going to not see a winter wave? Does it mean the winter wave is going to come, but be a little bit later and maybe a little smaller,\" said Lessler.",
      "Both Truelove and Lessler said one major \"data gap\" making comparisons to previous seasons challenging has been the lapse in nationwide COVID-19 hospitalization data during the summer surge.",
      "A pandemic-era emergency requirement for health care providers to report COVID-19 hospitalizations lapsed earlier this year, and only recently resumed under a new rule issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Other factors muddying the figures include changes to how people test and seek care for COVID-19 infections.",
      "Another big unknown is the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Most circulating variants right now are a medley of closely related variants like XEC and KP.3.1.1.",
      "\"We don't know, like we do for flu, what the average pace of COVID's evolution away from our immune system will be, when it settles down,\" Lessler said.",
      "Early data released last month by researchers at The Ohio State University found XEC looked to be more infectious compared with the parent variant it shares upstream with KP.3.1.1, but not significantly more than its siblings.",
      "\"I actually have thought it had settled down a bit, after this year. We'll see what I think after the season's done. But right now, I'm a little less sure,\" he said.",
      "Other respiratory germs on the rise",
      "While COVID-19 and flu remain at unusually low levels nationwide, rates of at least other germs that spread through coughs and sneezes remain elevated.",
      "CDC's data on emergency room visits from the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, sometimes called \"walking pneumonia,\" have increased in recent weeks especially in babies.",
      "Cases in this year's wave of pertussis, or whooping cough, are also continuing to accelerate in several states around the country.",
      "The agency tallied 577 infections of pertussis nationwide for the week ending Nov. 23, around 33% higher than last week's count. That's higher than the peak of 2014's record pertussis wave, which reached 326 weekly infections reported in late December.",
      "Ohio remains the state with the most cases of whooping cough this past week, after 66 infections with pertussis were reported.",
      "The CDC's \"acute respiratory illness\" metric, which lumps together levels of patients showing up in emergency rooms with a broad array of cough and cold illnesses including influenza and whooping cough, tallies 14 states with \"moderate\" levels including Ohio.",

      "Federal investigators found nearly a dozen children to be working dangerous, overnight shifts at Seaboard Triumph Foods' pork processing plant in Sioux City, Iowa, the Department of Labor announced.",
      "Employed by Guymon, Oklahoma-based sanitation contractor Qvest, 11 kids allegedly used corrosive cleaners to sanitize head splitters, jaw pullers, bandsaws, neck clippers and other equipment at the Seaboard Triumph Foods facility from at least September 2019 through September 2023, the DOL stated in a news release\u00a0on Friday.",

      "Seaboard in September 2023 contracted Fayette Janitorial Services for sanitation work at its facility. After taking over the plant's sanitation services contract, Fayette allegedly rehired some of the children previously employed by Qvest, with the Somerville, Tennessee-based contractor earlier this year found to be employing nine minors at the Sioux City plant, the DOL alleged.",
      "Fayette also allegedly hired 15 children as young as 13 at a Perdue Farms processing plant in Accomac, Virginia, where a 14-year-old was severely injured. Perdue terminated its contract with Fayette before the DOL's court filing, the company said.",
      "Are migrant kids cleaning U.S. slaughterhouses?",
      "The development is part of an ongoing probe into whether migrant kids are cleaning U.S. slaughterhouses.

      "The DOL launched its investigation after a published report detailed migrant kids working overnight for contractors in poultry processing facilities on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. A New York Times Magazine\u00a0story\u00a0last December detailed children cleaning blood, grease and feathers from equipment with acid and pressure hoses.",
      "The Times'\u00a0account\u00a0included details of a 14-year-old boy who was maimed while cleaning a conveyor belt in a deboning area at a Perdue slaughterhouse in rural Virginia. The eighth grader was among thousands of Mexican and Central American children who have crossed the border on their own to work in dangerous jobs.",

      "From an elevated waterslide at a Jacksonville, Florida, beach park to a sawmill in Clarkrange, Tennessee, federal investigators are finding children across the country working illegal hours and performing risky, unlawful tasks. In May, federal investigators found a 13-year-old girl allegedly working up to 60 hours a week on an assembly line in Luverne, Alabama.",
      "More recently, the DOL found a Grand Rapids, Michigan, window cleaning company had illegally hired three kids to clean residential windows and gutters, and to install Christmas lights, with one requiring surgery after suffering serious injuries after falling from a roof. Another DOL case resolved last month involved children operating and cleaning a meat grinder and driving motor vehicles to deliver orders for a pizza restaurant in Iron River, Wisconsin.",

      "In addition to the federal government, the state of Massachusetts recently took aim at companies violating child labor laws, citing an operator of dozens of Burger King franchise locations across the state for allegedly scheduling minors to work more than the legally allowed hours.

The new Enron website includes the kind of blandly uplifting videos often favored by corporate PR departments, such as a ballerina at the beach and a rocket launch, with a voice over talking about \"rebirth\" and accepting change.",

      "The College Company is run by Connor Gaydos, whose LinkedIn account now identifies him as the CEO of Enron. Gaydos is also known for creating the \"birds aren't real\" satirical conspiracy theory with Peter McIndoe, which pokes fun at odd theories that now proliferate around the internet.

The new administration could review and respond to the comments and issue a final rule, or withdraw it entirely.",
      "Still, even if the proposal is not enacted, subminimum pay for those with disabilities could become a thing of the past, as more than a dozen states and the District of Columbia have already banned the program.

      "\"I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social late Monday. \"Through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs, we will make U.S. Steel Strong and Great Again, and it will happen FAST!\"",
      "He added, \"As President, I will block this deal from happening. Buyer Beware!!!\"",
      "While on the campaign trail, Trump had also promised to block Nippon's takeover of U.S. Steel.",
      "The Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States (CFIUS), an interagency government panel that assesses foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies, is currently examining Nippon Steel's deal for U.S. Steel.",

The president-elect has said tariffs are a tool that can help protect domestic manufacturing, as well as convince foreign companies to open plants in the U.S.",
      "In response to Trump's comments, Nippon Steel said it was \"determined to protect and grow US Steel in a manner that reinforces American industry, domestic supply chain resiliency and US national security.\"",
      "\"We will invest no less than $2.7 billion into its unionized facilities, introduce our world-class technological innovation and secure union jobs so that American steelworkers at U.S. Steel can manufacture the most advanced steel products for American customers,\" the Japanese firm said in a statement.",

    "summary": "Contracted truckers hauling packages between Amazon facilities are more likely to engage in dangerous behavior on the roads than other carriers, according to federal data analyzed by CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "The death of a 19-year-old college student on a Texas highway is raising questions about the fleet of drivers Amazon uses to move packages between its facilities. College freshman Iliana Velez's life was cut short in a crash with a contractor who was driving to pick up an Amazon load.",
      "A University of Texas freshman, Velez was working nights sorting packages part time at an Amazon fulfillment center.",
      "In the early morning hours of Jan. 3, 2022, Velez was on a break when she was forced off the road by a box truck driven by Jordan Sannicola, a contractor on his way to pick up an Amazon shipment. Velez's car rolled multiple times. She died at the scene.",
      "Her mother, Trula Velez, received the news from police that same evening.",
      "\"The officer knocked on my door and he said that she was involved in an accident, and she didn't make it,\" she said. \"I was such in a state of shock.\"",
      "When Sannicola was arrested four weeks later, investigators learned he had a history of traffic violations, a suspended driver's license and outstanding felony warrants, including one count of evading arrest with a vehicle. He told police he was using a hand-held mobile device when he collided with Iliana Velez's car.",
      "\"Someone with multiple warrants should not have been hired,\" Trula Velez said.",
      "A lawsuit filed by Trula Velez alleges Amazon had previously rejected Sannicola's application to deliver packages for the company's \"flex\" home delivery service after he failed a background check. Still, he was able to drive for an Amazon-contracted company. Despite his criminal history and driving record, Take Flight with B, a North Carolina motor carrier company, hired Sannicola to move Amazon freight.",
      "Missed warning signs?",
      "The Velez family attorney, Alex Hilliard, claims that because of the background check, Amazon was \"fully aware\" of Sannicola's poor driving record and criminal background when he started driving for Take Flight, which transported goods between Amazon facilities on a segment of the delivery network known as the \"middle mile.\"",
      "The lawsuit also alleges tracking technology provided by the Relay phone application Amazon uses to monitor driver location and performance had informed the company of Sannicola's unsafe driving behavior, but it failed to act.",
      "\"Mr. Sannicola had 70 different speeding violations [while working for Take Flight] that Amazon had been notified of,\" said Hilliard. \"They did nothing about that.\"",
      "A CBS News analysis of federal safety data revealed Amazon contractors primarily in the company's \"middle-mile\" delivery network had monthly violation rates \u2014 such as speeding and texting while driving \u2014 that were usually double those of carriers who didn't transport for Amazon. The analysis examined six years of monthly Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) unsafe driving rates and found the average rates of carriers who shipped for Amazon were at least 89% higher in every month.",
      "\"I was stunned,\" said Jason Miller, a professor at Michigan State University who is an expert in supply chain management. \"I've published many articles using these data. You do not see effects like this normally, where you have a set of carriers that is almost twice as unsafe as a different set of carriers.\"",
      "CBS News used roadside inspection reports in federal data to identify Amazon contractors. The reports, which are produced by law enforcement, indicate who a carrier said they were shipping for at the time of inspection. The analysis included carriers who shipped at least once for Amazon in the two years leading up to each month examined.",
      "Miller said the large patchwork of contractors Amazon uses for \"middle-mile\" transport poses challenges to ensuring a uniform culture of safety.",
      "\"The more you are essentially having your freight hauled by hundreds, if not thousands of small young firms, that makes it much more difficult to ensure those firms are operating safely versus a more - what we call strategic procurement model, where you may have a few very large carriers that you work with that handle a lot of freight,\" said Miller.",
      "In the past two years, at least 57 people have died in more than four dozen crashes involving federally regulated carriers shipping for Amazon, according to FMCSA data, though the data does not indicate who was at fault in these incidents. The FMCSA produces a crash involvement score for carriers, but it is not public.",
      "Amazon's response",
      "\"Any fatality is heartbreaking,\" said Tim Goodman, Amazon's global legal director for road safety. \"Any families that have been affected by this all have our condolences and our hearts go out to them.\"",
      "While Amazon mandates background checks for contracted drivers who deliver directly to customers' homes, Goodman said the company looks to the FMCSA to oversee \"middle-mile\" contractors who move freight between facilities in larger vehicles.",
      "A spokeswoman for FMCSA confirmed it requires contractors who dispatch commercial motor vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 10,000 pounds to conduct background checks into drivers' safety performance history as a condition of employment.",
      "Amazon said when the company learns a contracted carrier has violated FMCSA guidelines, the carrier can face consequences, including permanent suspension.",
      "\"We have taken disciplinary action against around 19,000 motor carriers for failing to meet FMCSA safety requirements,\" Goodman said.",
      "Among those carriers is Take Flight with B, the contractor that hired Jordan Sannicola. Amazon confirmed it suspended Take Flight with B permanently from its contracted fleet.\u00a0 The motor carrier has since gone out of business.",
      "Goodman defended Amazon's continuing reliance on third-party trucking contractors to move its freight and deliver packages.",
      "\"In the United States, transportation with motor carriers is driven by independent businesses, small businesses,\" said Goodman. \"It has been that way since at least the Carter administration.\"",
      "\"We are unique at Amazon in terms of our scale,\" Goodman said. \"But it's a business model that has worked, and worked well, and we're committed to having it be a catalyst to be able to improve safety for the roads for all of us.\"",
      "Amazon disputes CBS News' data findings. In a statement sent after the interview, a spokesperson said: \"We've worked closely with CBS throughout this story, and are disappointed that they continue to use data based on a flawed methodology. We take safety incredibly seriously and the truth is that overall crash rates across third party carriers that we work with have improved. Our standards are stricter than FMCSA requirements, and we'll continue working to ensure our partners are the safest carriers on the road.\"",
      "Among other complaints, the company took issue with how CBS News identified Amazon contractors\u2014it said inspection reports sometimes list the wrong shipper\u2014and how CBS News measured a carrier's safety.",
      "Amazon measures safety using the FMCSA's \"unsafe driving score,\" which is a number that applies different standards depending on the size of the carrier. This score is not made public by the government, but the underlying data is. Rather than ranking the carriers by size, CBS News looked directly at the underlying rates of unsafe driving violations like texting and speeding.",
      "CBS News consulted with multiple leading supply chain researchers, who all use FMCSA measures in peer-reviewed studies. Alex Scott, a University of Tennessee professor and expert in supply chain management, said he does not use the FMCSA's scores in part because they make smaller carriers appear safer than they are.",
      "\"I don't think that makes any sense,\" Scott said. \"If they're less safe, then they're less safe.\"",
      "What the court system says",
      "On Oct. 11, a judge sentenced Jordan Sannicola to a 40-year prison term for the charge of \"failing to stop and render aid -- accident involving death\" in the crash that killed Iliana Velez.",
      "\"One mistake cost someone's life, and that was my daughter's, and her life was just getting started,\" Trula Valez said.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 18:06:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk was seeking to reinstate a massive 2018 Tesla pay package after shareholders had reapproved it, but a judge denied his request.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's efforts to get his massive $56 billion 2018 Tesla pay package reinstated was rejected by a Delaware judge on Monday.",
      "The decision, issued by Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick, comes after a majority of Tesla shareholders in August reauthorized the compensation package during the electric vehicle maker's annual meeting.",
      "After it was initially approved in 2018, the pay package sparked a lawsuit from some Tesla shareholders who accused Musk and Tesla's board of directors of breaching their duties and unjustly enriching the billionaire. In January 2024, McCormick had ruled that Musk and his company failed to prove that the huge payout was legally warranted, prompting Musk to take the issue back to his shareholders in August.",
      "In her Dec. 2 decision, McCormick said that Musk had asked the court \"to flip its decision and enter judgment in their favor.\"",
      "She added, \"The motion to revise is denied,\" citing what the judge described as \"at least four fatal flaws\" in arguments from Musk's attorneys.",
      "\"The large and talented group of defense firms got creative with the ratification argument, but their unprecedented theories go against multiple strains of settled law,\" McCormick noted.",
      "Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Shares of Tesla fell slightly in after-hours trading, dipping $4.74, or 1.3%, to $352.35. The stock has gained 47% in the last month, buoyed by investor optimism that President-elect Donald Trump's victory at the polls will help boost Tesla's prospects, given Musk's support for his campaign.",
      "The stock options Tesla granted to Musk were initially worth $2.6 billion but had soared to $56 billion when McCormick blocked the package in January, according to\u00a0Bloomberg News.",
      "\"No basis in the common law\"",
      "Musk's attorneys had argued that the second vote made clear that Tesla shareholders, with full knowledge of the flaws in the 2018 process that McCormick had earlier pointed out, were adamant that Musk is entitled to the pay package. They asked the judge to vacate her order directing Tesla to rescind the pay package.",
      "Among the issues in their latest arguments, McCormick wrote, was a lack of procedural grounds for \"flipping the outcome of an adverse post-trial decision based on evidence they created after trial.\"",
      "She also objected to Musk's attempt to recertify the pay package through another shareholder vote, which she wrote his attorneys had argued served as \"common law ratification.\"",
      "\"What the defendants call 'common law ratification' has no basis in the common law \u2014 a stockholder vote standing alone cannot ratify a conflicted-controller transaction,\" she noted. \"[E]ven if a stockholder vote could have a ratifying effect, it could not do so here due to multiple, material misstatements in the proxy statement.\"",
      "McCormick also rejected an equally unprecedented and massive fee request by plaintiff attorneys, who argue they were entitled to legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $5 billion. The judge said the attorneys were entitled to a fee award of $345 million.",
      "Despite the setback, Musk remains the world's wealthiest person, with a net worth of $343 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:59:07 -0500",
    "summary": "Bluesky has added millions of new subscribers in the last month as some users leave X. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "It's unusual for a new social media service to get a foothold in a marketplace entrenched by the likes of X (formerly Twitter), Instagram and TikTok which, dominate people's phones. But Bluesky, a nearly 2-year-old app, is now grabbing attention amid a recent surge of new users, which the company says is likely due to growing frustrations with X.",
      "While the platform has grown since it opened as an invite-only service in February 2023, its membership snowballed following the November 5 presidential election. Bluesky currently has more than 22 million users, up from about 12 million people in mid-October, according to the company's data.",
      "Bluesky believes its recent growth is partly due to changes at X under billionaire owner Elon Musk, according to Bluesky Chief Operating Officer Rose Wang, who recently spoke to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Musk, who bought Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, has overhauled the service, changing its name to X\u00a0and\u00a0prioritizing accounts from people who pay for a blue checkmark \u2014 although accounts with more than 2,500 \"verified subscriber followers\" get access to Premium features for free.",
      "Ad sales almost immediately softened after Musk took over the platform, with companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Disney removing paid ads from X\u00a0last year. Most recently, The Guardian said it would no longer be posting its content under its official account on X. In its announcement, the British newspaper described X as \"toxic,\" adding that the platform has been used by Musk to shape political discourse.",
      "Musk became one of the most viral voices on elections during the 2024 campaign, frequently sharing conspiratorial narratives while promoting President-elect Donald Trump, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "When Twitter became X, \"it was no longer a public town square, and now it's more of a partisan microphone,\" Wang said, adding, \"that is a big reason why we think people are coming over.\"",
      "X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "What is the difference between X and Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky resembles the \"old Twitter\" in terms of layout and content,\u00a0wrote\u00a0PCWorld tech writer Dave Parrack in a recent column. He added, \"Bluesky feels like a safe haven. There's very little trolling, and when it does happen, people aren't biting.\"",
      "Bluesky users can find people to follow through so-called \"starter packs,\" or curated lists of people to follow by interest or fields, such as this group of garden writers. That enables users to quickly build a feed of posts from people that they pick, rather than being fed content by a corporate algorithm, the company says.",
      "Because people can tailor their interests and connect with other like-minded users, there's more interaction on the service than on X, according to Wang.",
      "Some companies are also reporting more engagement with their posts on the Bluesky app versus rival platforms. An executive for The Boston Globe, for instance\u00a0noted\u00a0that the newspaper's posts on Bluesky receive three times the traffic as on Meta's Threads.",
      "\"Thirty percent of users Bluesky are posters versus 1% on Twitter,\" Wang said.",
      "Even so, it's questionable whether Bluesky's jump in new users is making much of a dent in X's consumer base.",
      "The presidential election delivered a surge in traffic to Musk's social media service, according to tracking service Similarweb. It found that more than 46 million U.S. users visited X on November 6, the day after President-elect Donald Trump's win \u2014 more than any day in the prior year. About 115,000 people in the U.S. deactivated their accounts on X that same day, its data shows.",
      "How Bluesky makes money",
      "While Bluesky's user base is growing quickly, the company remains small in terms of its funding and staff, which Wang describes as \"a tiny team of 20\" employees, including herself and CEO Jay Graber. The service was created by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, although the business has been independent since 2021.",
      "In October, the company\u00a0raised $15 million in venture funding, which followed a seed round of $8 million in 2023. Wang noted that Bluesky is focused on figuring out how to sustain its business, which will soon include new revenue streams from subscriptions and financial transactions.",
      "\"We are launching subscriptions at the end of this year,\" Wang noted. \"It'll be custom aesthetics, custom avatar frames, maybe more video uploads.\"",
      "The company is also planning to enable financial transactions between users, such as if a game designer wants to sell his or her products to Bluesky users. The service would take a portion of the payment, Wang noted.",
      "Bluesky doesn't accept advertising, nor has it marketed itself in the wake of Musk's takeover of Twitter, she added.",
      "To be sure, Bluesky may never achieve the size of bigger social media networks, which advertisers flock to in order to reach much larger groups of users. For instance, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, had more than 3 billion daily users across its apps in the most recent quarter, and\u00a0booked almost $40 billion in revenue during that time.",
      "How do you sign up for Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky opened as an invitation-only platform in February 2023, but anyone can now sign up for the service.",
      "User handles on the service are a little bit different than X or other social media networks because they end with the site's domain, .bsky.social. Posts are limited to 300 characters, 20 more than on X. Photos and videos can also uploaded, though videos can't be longer than 60 seconds. GIFs and emojis are available, too.",
      "As with other platforms, you can tag people on Bluesky by typing \"@\" before their username, you can like posts by tapping a heart icon, and use hashtags to highlight a theme. Bluesky has added a\u00a0menu\u00a0to hashtags, so that when users click on one they'll get different options for seeing, or muting, posts on a particular topic.",
      "\"It's more of a community space \u2014 it's more of a Reddit model, where you land in those cosy corners,\" Wang added. \"At the end of the day it's all about the people, and what I encourage people to do is just come to Bluesky, give it a chance and see for yourself what the experience is like.\"",

      "The BRICS countries include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Trump said he'll enact the tariffs if the countries either move to create a new rival currency to the dollar or back an alternative currency to replace the greenback as the world's reserve medium of exchange.",
      "\"We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Trump's move comes after he recently\u00a0threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all products from Canada and Mexico entering the U.S., along with an additional 10% tax on goods from China, in what he says would force the countries to do more to halt the flow of unauthorized migrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.",
      "Why do BRICS countries want an alternative currency?",
      "The BRICS \u2014 named after the original five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) \u2014 was formed in 2009 to advance the interests of emerging economies and to make them less dependent on the U.S. dollar, which is by far the most commonly used currency in global commerce.",

      "Creating a competing new currency would be difficult given how widely used the dollar is to conduct business around the world. Despite the existence of the euro and growing importance of China's renminbi, the dollar remains the world's main reserve currency, representing roughly 58% of the world's foreign exchange reserves, according to the\u00a0IMF. Also, critical commodities like oil and gold are still mostly bought and sold using dollars.",
      "\"Economically, it's not a major issue because the idea of the BRICS countries being able to put together an alternative as a reserve currency for the U.S. dollar is not plausible in the short or intermediate term,\" said Mark Weinstock, a global trade expert and professor of economics at Pace University.",
      "In other words, BRICS nations would struggle to create a viable currency given the relative strength and stability of the U.S. economy and the faith that global investors and trading partners have in U.S. government debt. And while the group's members have some interests in common, unifying behind a single currency would be politically fraught and technically complex.",
      "\"Fundamentally, if you are going to create your own form of money, that desirability is commensurate with the economic strength and integrity of the issuer. BRICS countries don't have the type of institutions that inspire global confidence to convince people that it is a satisfactory alternative to the dollar,\" Weinstock said.",
      "Some BRICS members are already downplaying the push to get a new currency off the ground. After Trump's tariff threat last weekend, South Africa's government on Monday issued a statement on social media saying there are no plans to create a BRICS currency.",
      "\"Recent misreporting has led to the incorrect narrative that BRICS is planning to create a new currency,\" South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation said. \"This is not the case. The discussions within BRICS focus on trading among member countries using their own national currencies.\"",
      "What would stiff tariffs on BRICS goods mean for U.S. consumers?",
      "While economists largely agree that a 100% tariff on goods imported to the U.S. from BRICS nations is a long shot, if it came to pass the move would not benefit U.S. consumers, they say. Such levies would drive up the cost of goods from BRICS member nations, potentially fueling inflation and leading to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Like any tariffs, this would mean higher prices for consumers,\" Weinstock said. \"That's always the impact of the tariff.\"",
      "Among the leading products the U.S. gets from BRICS countries are coffee from Brazil, electronics and clothes from China, and minerals from South Africa, according to trade data.",
      "Why are some economists criticizing Trump for threatening the BRICS?",
      "Some experts criticized Trump's threat to punish the BRICS, saying it makes the U.S. look weak.",
      "\"It isn't a good look, as it indirectly elevates the stature of a non-threat and suggests a lack of confidence in the dollar,\" Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former Treasury Department economist,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Trump's threat could actually accelerate a move away from the dollar by other countries, according to Setser, who said that an effort to effectively coerce countries to use the dollar \"is actually a long-run threat to the dollar's global role.\"",
      "\"It makes the use of the dollar appear to be a favor to the U.S.,\" he added.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 10:10:33 -0500",
    "summary": "A CBS News investigation tracked plastic cups from Starbucks recycling bins to landfills and incinerators across the country.",
    "story": [
      "Many consumers trust that when they toss a plastic cup into a recycling bin at a restaurant or coffee shop, it will be recycled and turned into something new. However, a CBS News investigation uncovered that this isn't always true.",
      "CBS News investigated what happens at one of the largest users of plastic cups that advertises its recycling practices: Starbucks. Reporters placed plastic cold drink cups, embedded with trackers, into 57 labeled recycling bins at Starbucks locations across the country to see where the cups went. Only 36 provided reliable data.",
      "The trackers were superglued between two Starbucks cold drink plastic cups and CBS News monitored each tracker's location multiple times a day until the trackers stopped moving.",
      "Of the 36 cups CBS News dropped, 32 did not go to a recycling facility. Fourteen cups were traced to landfills, five to incinerators, and thirteen to waste transfer stations, where trash is compacted before being sent to landfills or incinerators. Only four cups were traced to Material Recovery Facilities, where recyclables are sorted and prepared for reuse.",
      "While attaching a metal Bluetooth tracker to plastic and placing it in a recycling bin could contaminate the item and prevent it from being recycled, only four of the cups tagged by CBS News went to facilities that sort and remove this type of contamination, whereas the rest were immediately diverted for the landfill or incineration.",
      "Two of the trackers revealed a surprising journey: one dropped at a Starbucks in New Jersey and another in Boston both traveled thousands of miles before ultimately ending up in the same landfill in Alabama.",
      "\"When it comes to recycling, companies across the country and the world are lying about all these single-use plastics, saying they're recyclable,\" said Jan Dell, a former chemical engineer and founder of The Last Beach Cleanup, a nonprofit dedicated to combating plastic pollution. \"They're not telling the truth.\"",
      "The challenge of plastic waste",
      "Americans produce more plastic waste each year than any other country \u2013 almost 500 pounds per person. Most of that plastic ends up as trash, according to a 2022 Greenpeace USA report, which revealed that the U.S. recycling rate for plastics is less than 6%.",
      "Companies such as Starbucks, which sells beverages to more than 6 billion customers a year globally, are a major generator of plastic waste. More than 75% of Starbucks' U.S. beverage sales are cold drinks, often served in plastic cups, but the company aims to reduce its overall waste by 50% by 2030.",
      "\"Our goal for cups is that 100% of our customer-facing cups will be reusable, recyclable or compostable,\" says Amelia Landers, vice president of innovation and solutions at Starbucks. Landers was part of the team that redesigned its cold plastic cups in April to be made with up to 20% less plastic, which she says will help divert more than 13 million pounds of plastic from landfills each year.",
      "\"There's a guilt factor associated with using the single-use plastic, for maybe 20 minutes, and then having it exist in the landfill forever, or get incinerated and cause carbon emissions,\" said Dell, which is one of the reasons she believes Starbucks encourages recycling in-store.",
      "But making sure that Starbucks cup is recycled is harder than you might think. Unlike other recyclable materials such as glass, paper or aluminum, plastics are not uniform. Thousands of different types exist, each with unique characteristics, chemicals and additives, making sorting and recycling nearly impossible. For instance, certain beverage bottles cannot be recycled with food containers because they are made from different types of plastic, are different shapes and may be different colors.",
      "Can Starbucks cups be recycled?",
      "Consumers assume items like Starbucks cups can be recycled because of the arrows on the cup or blue bins in the store, but only 9% of Material Recovery Facilities sort the specific plastic that makes a Starbucks cup to be sold as recycled content and very few places actually buy that plastic to recycle it into new content.",
      "Starbucks cups are made out of polypropylene, or No. 5 plastic, and Landers told CBS News that these cups are designed to be recyclable and there are facilities that do this in the U.S. CBS News asked Starbucks to send a list of companies that recycle No. 5 plastic beverage cups. They sent a list of four facilities: three that collected and sorted No. 5 plastics, but only one company, KW Plastics in Alabama, recycles No. 5 cups into new plastic items.",
      "KW Plastics is one of a handful of facilities in America that recycles No. 5 plastics into new material, but of the 160,000 tons of plastic waste made up of No. 5 cups and plates generated in the U.S. each year, less than 1% is recycled, according to the latest EPA report on plastic recycling.",
      "A reusable solution",
      "Starbucks officials say they can only control what happens inside the company's stores, and work with outside partners to ensure its waste ends up in the right place.",
      "\"We're working to increase the recycle capture of the plastic cups so that the recyclability has higher potential,\" says Landers. Her team is currently testing new cup materials and models to encourage reusable cups both in the store, and for customers to take away.",
      "\"The more we can offer customers to sit and stay, that takes a tremendous amount of single-use cups out of the landfill entirely,\" she says.",
      "Starbucks was the first major retailer to roll out a nationwide program where customers can provide their own cup for mobile and drive-thru orders earlier this year.",
      "\"We have tested over 30 different borrow-a-cup models around the world, and there is a lot to learn and a lot to solve,\" says Landers.",
      "Governments can also provide incentives for businesses to innovate by eliminating unnecessary plastics and encouraging reusable products. \"Regulation is absolutely critical as well as enforcement,\" said Dell, with The Last Beach Cleanup.",
      "Prohibitions on single-use plastics are becoming more common. Last week the Miami-Dade County Commissions approved a resolution to eliminate single-use plastics at municipal buildings, which include the Miami Zoo and the airport.",
      "Dell says customers can be critical in pushing for change. \"They can demand that companies be honest,\" she said. \"Secondly, they can choose with their pocketbooks and bring back in a reusable cup.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 13:17:16 -0500",
    "summary": "As the holiday shopping season kicks off, here are five ways retailers try to get consumers to spend.",
    "story": [
      "As shoppers gear up for Black Friday and the holiday shopping season, it can be easy for people to rack up debt that will weigh them down well into the new year. So it pays for consumers to be aware of some of the tactics retailers employ to get them to spend.",
      "For example, most offers that dangle savings in the form of free shipping or a free gift if you spend over a certain amount don't save you money. The practice, called \"spaving,\" or spending more in order to save, rarely benefits consumers, according to personal finance experts.",
      "\"I understand the appeal of getting to checkout and a notification pops up saying spend $10 more to get some perk,\" LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But 90% of the time when you break it down, it doesn't make sense. You're not actually saving money if you are spending more of it.\"",
      "Here are five tactics retailers use to get you to spend more, according to the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), a consumer advocacy group.",
      "Creating a false sense of urgency",
      "The fear of missing out on a good deal can nudge consumers into making impulse buys. Although some offers really are only valid for a limited time, U.S. PIRG identified a number of sellers on Etsy, an e-commerce site for independent craftspeople, who used fake countdown clocks for deals that never expire.",
      "Of 20 top-selling products on the site with countdown timers on deals, 80% of them simply reset when their tickers tickers hit \"0,\" according to a PIRG study.",
      "\"The 'limited' time window may not be as limited as it sounds and the deals not as good as they seem,\" U.S. PIRG's R.J. Cross told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Make your list, comparison shop on those items, and don't get distracted by offers you haven't had the time to think through.\"",
      "Implying scarcity",
      "Online retailers may label products as \"selling fast!\" or, as a consumer is considering a purchase, display how many other consumers are browsing the same item.",
      "\"Retailers and advertisers are always trying to get you to buy more than you need and spend more than you want,\" Cross said in a statement.\u00a0\"Once you know what to look for, you end up chuckling when you see these tactics instead of falling for them.\"",
      "Pricing tricks",
      "Ever wonder why a price reads $4.99 and not simply $5? When sellers round an item's price down, it suggests to a shopper that it is cheaper, PIRG notes. Although $4.99 is only a penny less than $5, a shopper is more likely to fixate on the dollar figure \u2014 $4 \u2014 versus the cents.",
      "Even removing a comma from a high sticker price like $1,200 and displaying it as $1200 can entice someone to pull the trigger, according to PIRG. Meanwhile, breaking the cost of an item down into monthly installments can also make the price seem smaller than it really is, the organization noted.",
      "\"You're still going to have to pay the full cost, and sometimes\u00a0even more in late fees, if you're not careful,\" Cross pointed out.",
      "Dubious testimonials",
      "Many retailers feature online testimonials ostensibly from customers raving about a \"life-changing\" vacuum cleaner or pair of sweatpants. Some of these account are from real customers, while other reviews cannot be trusted because they have been generated by a bot or the company itself, PIRG said.",
      "At bottom, it's a form of peer pressure \u2014 shoppers are subtly induced to think that buying the product will make them as happy as the satisfied customers depicted in the testimonial. In reality, many online reviews are fake, especially as AI bots proliferate.",
      "\"When you look at reviews on a product, don't necessarily take the star ratings for granted. Better to look through the comments and find those that seem real \u2014 that either include a picture of the product or that make a point specific to the product instead of a generic note like 'great product!'\" Cross recommends.",
      "Appeals based on fear",
      "Many marketing pitches and ads suggest that your life will somehow be worse if you don't make a purchase, from being at risk of a home invasion to hair loss. With e-commerce, of course, such messages are tailored to your individual interests and tastes given that website cookies track and share your browsing patterns with retailers.",
      "Messages \"about how to fix our perceived flaws only become more capable of finding us at all hours of the day whenever we go online,\" Cross said.",

      "On Monday, Trump pledged to add a 25% tariff on all products\u00a0from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% levy on Chinese goods, in an effort to crack down on illegal immigration and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S. The proposed taxes are in addition to earlier campaign promises to impose a baseline 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and a 60% tariff on goods shipped from China, once he takes office.",
      "While\u00a0prices on variety of goods, ranging from shoes to vacuum cleaners, could indeed rise if Trump moves forward with his tariff proposals, some retail experts say that retailers may be seeking to tap into people's universal fear of missing out on a limited-time offer or experience. But the tactic could also rub some shoppers the wrong way, experts caution.",
      "\"It's a double-edged sword. I think it it might get people interested in buying things, but it could also split consumers if they think everyone's going to bring their prices up,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData. \"The other problem is it's slightly political as well, so some retailers would want to steer clear of it.\"",
      "While Trump has said he plans to move forward with tariffs, some economists have pointed out that the next administration may simply use the duties as a bargaining chip, which could enable the White House to strike new trade deals, for instance. Even though the tariffs are far from certain, a number of companies have explicitly said the levies floated by Trump would inevitably force them to raise prices for consumers.",
      "\"Lock in our current prices\"",
      "For example, filtered shower head maker Jolie recently said it would have pass along some of the anticipated costs from the tariffs to consumers. In a recent email to customers, the company said that tariffs on goods made outside of the U.S. would \"mean we would need to raise our prices.\"",
      "\"If you're considering buying a Jolie, now is a great time to lock in our current prices,\" the company added. Currently, a shower head with a filter subscription costs $148. The company announced a \"potential\" new price of $178.",
      "Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy CEO Corie Barry similarly said on its latest earnings call that the goods it sells could become more expensive under Trump's proposed tariffs.",
      "Any added costs on U.S. imports from the three counties \"will be shared by our customers,\" Barry told investors on Nov. 26, noting that \"there's very little in [the] consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "\"Pre-tariff\" sales",
      "And on Facebook, a Dallas, Texas-based furniture store called Finally Home Furnishings, announced a \"pre-tariff sale\" that runs until January, earlier this month.",
      "\"Get a deal while you still can,\" the retailer said.",
      "Finally Home Furnishings did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment, or indicate how much it expects it may need to hike prices if new tariffs go into effect.",
      "Etsy seller Buzzy Park, who sells handmade bamboo picture frames, also advertised a \"pre-tariff \" sale on his entire inventory, starting this month and lasting until any new tariffs go into effect. \"Hurry and get them at their current prices,\" Park wrote in a social media post.",
      "While prices on variety of goods, ranging from shoes to vacuum cleaners, could indeed rise, some marketing and retail experts say that even sellers who don't expect to face added costs could be using potential tariffs as an excuse to charge customers more.",
      "\"If consumers panic about things getting more expensive, they are playing right into the hands of companies around the country to use it as an excuse to raise prices, even when it's not necessary,\" said Scott Lincicome, a trade expert at the Cato Institute, a public policy research group. \"",
      "He added, It's a pretty handy excuse when you are in a constant battle with consumers on price.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 10:28:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Target is the only place you can buy the latest Taylor Swift merch, including a new book, vinyl and CD.",
    "story": [
      "Taylor Swift's latest release isn't a new song or album \u2014 it's a book commemorating the pop star's\u00a0record-setting\u00a0\"Eras Tour,\" which hit store shelves on Black Friday.",
      "The collector's item chronicles Swift's wildly successful concert tour, which concludes in December and which last year became the first music tour to gross over $1 billion.",
      "A movie version of the concert she performed on her Eras Tour also shattered box office records. It earned an estimated $96 million domestically over its opening weekend, making it the most successful concert film of all time, according to Comscore.",
      "Where can I buy the book?",
      "The new keepsake, titled \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Book,\" is available exclusively at Target. It hit the retailer's stores on Friday, while it will become available for sale on Target's website\u00a0on Saturday. Swift self-published the book under Taylor Swift Publications.",
      "Some Target stores opened as early as 6 a.m. in anticipation of Black Friday shopping crowds and Taylor Swift fans.",
      "Target first teased the book launch in an Instagram\u00a0post on Oct. 15. Swift herself also promoted the book in an Instagram\u00a0post that garnered more than 3.6 million likes.",
      "What's in The Eras Tour book?",
      "The 256-page hardcover title, which costs $39.99, includes unreleased photographs of Swift in concert from every period of her career, according to Target.",
      "The book also documents the production of Swift's epic Eras Tour, which kicked off in August 2023, including \"personal reflections\" written by the artist herself.",
      "In tandem with the book release, Target is also exclusively launching \"The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology\" album as both a vinyl record and CD. The recording feature 35 tracks, including four acoustic versions of the following songs: \"Fortnight,\" \"Down Bad,\" \"But Daddy I Love Him\" and \"Guilty as Sin?\"",
      "Two million copies of the book have been printed, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Assuming the initial print run sells out, it would generate nearly $80 million in sales. Forbes puts Swift's net at worth $1. 6 billion, including $600 million from music royalties and touring, a music catalog valued at an estimated $600 million, and $125 million in real estate.",
      "Swift alone could be a forceful enough economic engine to boost Target. The retailer's latest sales and profit figures fell short of analysts' expectations, while Target lowered its earnings forecast for the current quarter. Analysts say that inflation-weary consumers are after deeper discounts than the retailer can offer, or simply aren't making as many discretionary purchases.",
      "\"Consumers tell us their budgets remain stretched, and they are shopping carefully,\" Target CEO Brian Cornell said in a Nov. 20 earnings call.",
      "That restraint seems unlikely to deter the Swifties, the singer's rabid fans, as she prepares to wind up the Eras Tour in Vancouver on Dec. 8.",

      "The Competition Bureau said that such action is necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
      "The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about non-compliance with the Competition Act.",
      "The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX. It estimates Google holds a market share of 90% in publisher ad servers, 70% in advertiser networks, 60% in demand-side platforms and 50% in ad exchanges.",
      "This dominance, the bureau said, has discouraged competition from rivals, inhibited innovation, inflated advertising costs and reduced publisher revenues.",
      "\"Google has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors, and distorting the competitive process,\" Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition, said in a statement.",
      "Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector.",
      "Dan Taylor, Google's vice president of global ads, said in a statement that the bureau's complaint \"ignores the intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice.\"",
      "The statement added that Google intends to defend itself against the allegation.",

      "The proposed breakup, floated in a 23-page document filed this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" He outlined a timeline for a trial on proposed remedies next spring and plans to issue a decision by August 2025.",
      "Mehta also found that Google in 2021 Google paid about $26 billion to Apple and other partners to ensure its search engine would be the default one on internet browsers.",

      "Experts are warning that fraudsters are exploiting Black Friday sales to target U.S. shoppers with fake websites and ads for major brands like IKEA, Wayfair and The North Face, after online scams hit record highs in 2023.",
      "A new report released by threat intelligence company EclecticIQ identified a campaign that operates a sprawling network of fabricated websites using \"Trusted Store\" badges to lure shoppers with fake products.",
      "When consumers attempt to make a purchase, scammers steal their personal and payment information. The consumers are often unaware they were scammed until they fail to receive the product.",
      "Reports of online fraud in 2023 exceeded $12.5 billion in potential losses \u2014   a 22% jump from 2022, according to FBI data. Officials say increasingly sophisticated scams are using tools including AI to power their campaigns.",
      "\"With the way it now seems like everyone is shopping online, reliance on digital platforms has handed these groups a wider attack surface than ever,\" EclecticIQ CEO Cody Barrow told CBS News. \"Unfortunately, it's likely we'll see its impact stretch into next week.\"",
      "The scams",
      "EclecticIQ says it identified at least 8,000 fabricated sites that lure shoppers by offering steep \"deals\" on popular brands. The websites are not affiliated with the brands they appear to represent, but are designed to look like official sites and use URLs that appear authentic.",
      "In one example, a site posing as Wayfair used the URL wayfairtoday.com. Another site used the URL wayfairblackfriday.com. The website was registered in early November and offered fake \"deals\" including an $800 mattress reduced to $39.",
      "CBS News also found an ad appropriating Wayfair's logo that directed users to another counterfeit site posing as the retailer. It was removed from Meta's ad library as of Friday. Wayfair told CBS News that it is actively monitoring scams to ensure customers are protected.",
      "Analysts discovered Mandarin coding and Chinese IP addresses on the sites, indicating that the phishing campaign was operated by a China-based group. IKEA told CBS News it was investigating one of the scam websites using its name that EclecticIQ identified.",
      "Separately, an ad on Facebook and Instagram using The North Face logo routed users to a fabricated site. The ad was removed for policy violations, and The North Face told CBS News it was working with Meta and \"other partners\" to combat scam sites.",
      "\"Scammers use every online platform available to them and constantly evolve their tactics in order to evade enforcement,\" said Meta spokesperson Erin Logan. \"In this instance, our systems proactively detected and removed a number of these ads before they were reported to us.\"",
      "The Federal Trade Commission released data in February that shows online shopping fraud was the second most common type of fraud reported in 2023.",
      "Experts say fraudulent sites and ads remain a pervasive issue. \"Many of the scam sites are short-lived campaigns, so it's an ongoing effort to identify new sites,\" Ilya Volovik, director of Recorded Future Payment Fraud Intelligence, told CBS News. \"Some of the longer living scam sites change their 'sales' advertisement based on a holiday.\"",
      "Tips to protect yourself",
      "Cliff Steinhauer, director of Information Security and Engagement at the National Cybersecurity Alliance, said consumers should take precautions, stay alert when online shopping and act quickly if they believe they have been scammed.",
      "Secure your accounts. Experts recommend setting up multifactor authentication as well as strong and unique passwords for all accounts, including shopping and bank sites.",
      "Avoid unfamiliar links: Be wary of links from unsolicited emails and text messages. Instead, use a search engine to navigate to the retailer's website.",
      "Look for red flags. Be wary of deals that appear too good to be true, as well as websites that use excessive pop-ups and urgent language. If in doubt, leave the site.",
      "Research the website. Look up reviews from other shoppers who have used the site. Visit the Better Business Bureau's website, which maintains a database with ratings for millions of businesses.",
      "If you think you have been the victim of fraud, immediately notify your bank to reverse the charges. You should also change the passwords to your online accounts. File a police report if you experience harassment or repeated attempts to steal more of your information.",
      "Experts also recommend freezing your credit on the three major credit reporting bureaus if your personal information has been compromised through a data breach. This will ensure your identity can't be stolen in the event that scammers obtain your social security number.",

    "story": [
      "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's government early Wednesday lifted the martial law he imposed during a tense night of political drama in which troops surrounded parliament and lawmakers voted to reject military rule.",
      "Yoon said his government withdrew military personnel following a bipartisan parliamentary vote that rejected martial law, and the measure was formally lifted around 4:30 a.m. during a Cabinet meeting. In all, martial law was in effect for about six hours.",
      "South Korea's main opposition party on Wednesday urged Yoon to resign immediately or face impeachment. Yoon has not publicly responded to the opposition's demand. But his office said senior presidential advisers and secretaries for Yoon offered to resign collectively and the president also put off his official Wednesday morning schedule.",
      "In the capital, tourists and residents walked around, traffic and construction were heard, and other than crowds of police holding shields, it seemed like a normal sunny, cold December morning.",
      "The liberal opposition Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the 300-seat parliament, said Wednesday that its lawmakers decided to call on Yoon to quit immediately or they would take steps to impeach him.",
      "\"President Yoon Suk Yeol's martial law declaration was a clear violation of the constitution. It didn't abide by any requirements to declare it,\" the Democratic Party said in a statement. \"His martial law declaration was originally invalid and a grave violation of the constitution. It was a grave act of rebellion and provides perfect grounds for his impeachment.\"",
      "Impeaching him would require support from two-thirds of the parliament, or 200 of its 300 members. The Democratic Party and other small opposition parties together have 192 seats.",
      "Why was martial law declared in South Korea?",
      "Late Tuesday, Yoon imposed martial law out of frustration with the opposition, vowing to eliminate \"anti-state\" forces as he struggles against opponents who control the country's parliament and who he accuses of sympathizing with communist North Korea.",
      "Yoon said during a televised speech that martial law would help \"rebuild and protect\" the country from \"falling into the depths of national ruin.\" He said he would \"eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.\"",
      "\"I will eliminate anti-state forces as quickly as possible and normalize the country,\" he said, while asking the people to believe in him and tolerate \"some inconveniences.\"",
      "Under South Korea's constitution, the president can declare martial law during \"wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states\" that require the use of military force to maintain peace and order. It was questionable whether South Korea is currently in such a state.",
      "When martial law is declared, \"special measures\" can be employed to restrict the freedom of press, freedom of assembly and other rights, as well as the power of courts.",
      "The constitution also states that the president must oblige when the National Assembly demands the lifting of martial law with a majority vote.",
      "Hours later, parliament voted to lift the declaration, with National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik declaring that lawmakers \"will protect democracy with the people.\" The resolution was passed with 190 of 300 members of the ruling and opposition parties in attendance, with all present in favor, the BBC\u00a0reported.",
      "Police and military personnel were seen leaving the Assembly's grounds after Woo called for their withdrawal. Lee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal Democratic Party, which holds the majority in the 300-seat parliament, said the party's lawmakers would remain in the Assembly's main hall until Yoon formally lifted his order.",
      "\"Democratic Party lawmakers, including me and many others, will protect our country's democracy and future and public safety, lives and properties, with our own lives,\" Lee told reporters.",
      "While announcing his plan to lift martial law, Yoon continued to criticize parliament's attempts to impeach key government officials and senior prosecutors. He said lawmakers had engaged in \"unscrupulous acts of legislative and budgetary manipulation that are paralyzing the functions of the state.\"",
      "Seemingly hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Assembly, waving banners and calling for Yoon's impeachment. Some protesters scuffled with troops ahead of the lawmakers' vote, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or major property damage. At least one window was broken as troops attempted to enter the Assembly building. One woman tried unsuccessfully to pull a rifle away from one of the soldiers, while shouting \"Aren't you embarrassed!\"",
      "The president's surprising move harkened back to an era of authoritarian leaders that the country has not seen since the 1980s, and it was immediately denounced by the opposition and the leader of Yoon's own conservative party.",
      "Following Yoon's announcement, South Korea's military proclaimed that parliament and other political gatherings that could cause \"social confusion\" would be suspended, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.",
      "The military also said that the country's striking doctors should return to work within 48 hours, Yonhap said. Thousands of doctors have been striking for months over government plans to expand the number of students at medical schools. The military said anyone who violates the decree could be arrested without a warrant.",
      "Soon after the declaration, the National Assembly speaker called in an emergency statement released on his YouTube channel for all lawmakers to gather at the National Assembly, where the opposition Democratic Party holds a majority. He urged military and law enforcement personnel to \"remain calm and hold their positions.\"",
      "All 190 lawmakers who participated in the vote supported the lifting of martial law. Television footage showed soldiers who had been stationed at parliament leaving the site after the vote.",
      "Hours earlier, TV footage showed police officers blocking the entrance of the National Assembly and helmeted soldiers carrying rifles in front of the building to restrict entrance to the building. Dozens of police patrol cars and riot police buses were assembled, the BBC reported.",
      "\"Open the gate, please. Your job is to protect the National Assembly. Why are you standing idly by while MPs are being trampled?\" a middle-aged man shouted at a group of policemen guarding the gate.",
      "An Associated Press photographer saw at least three helicopters, likely from the military, that landed inside the Assembly grounds, while two or three helicopters circled above the site.",
      "The leader of Yoon's conservative People Power Party, Han Dong-hoon, called the decision to impose martial law \"wrong\" and vowed to \"stop it with the people.\" Lee, the opposition leader who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, called Yoon's announcement \"illegal and unconstitutional.\"",
      "A White House National Security Council spokesperson told CBS News the Biden administration wasn't notified of the martial law declaration in advance but it was in contact with the South Korean government and \"is monitoring the situation closely.\"",
      "\"We are seriously concerned by the developments we are seeing on the ground in the ROK,\" the spokesperson said, referring to South Korea by its official name, the Republic of Korea.",
      "A White House official told CBS News that President Biden, who is traveling in Angola, has been briefed on the situation.",
      "Washington stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea to protect it from North Korea, its nuclear-armed neighbor. Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said there was no effect on the U.S. service members based in South Korea.",
      "\"We are watching the recent developments in the ROK with grave concern,\" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said. \"We have every hope and expectation that any political disputes will be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law.\"",
      "Yoon \u2014 whose approval rating has dipped in recent months \u2014 has struggled to push his agenda against an opposition-controlled parliament since taking office in 2022.",
      "Yoon's party has been locked in an impasse with the liberal opposition over next year's budget bill. The opposition has also attempted to pass motions to impeach three top prosecutors, including the chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, in what the conservatives have called a vendetta against their criminal investigations of Lee, who has been seen as the favorite for the next presidential election in 2027 in opinion polls.",
      "Yoon has also dismissed calls for independent investigations into scandals involving his wife and top officials, drawing quick, strong rebukes from his political rivals. The Democratic Party reportedly called an emergency meeting of its lawmakers following Yoon's announcement.",
      "Yoon's move is the first declaration of martial law since the country's democratization in 1987. The country's last previous martial law was in October 1979.",

      "Last month, it was\u00a0revealed that Hegseth had secretly paid a financial settlement to a woman who had accused him of raping her in 2017 at a Republican women's banquet at the Hyatt Regency in Monterey, California. The city of Monterey released its 2017 investigation into Hegseth.",
      "The accuser, who has not been publicly named, reported she felt as though she had been drugged and recalled repeatedly saying \"no\" while in a hotel room with Hegseth.

Monterey County District Attorney Jeannine M. Pacioni said last month her office \"declined to file charges\" in January 2018 as none were \"supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\"",

      "Calling it \"the honor of a lifetime\" to have been nominated, Chronister said in a social media post on X, \"Over the past several days, as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in, I've concluded that I must respectfully withdraw from consideration. There is more work to be done for the citizens of Hillsborough County and a lot of initiatives I am committed to fulfilling.\"",
      "Trump had announced Saturday that he'd tap the Republican Florida sheriff to be the DEA's administrator and help to \"stop the flow of Fentanyl, and other Illegal Drugs across the Southern Border.\"",
      "Chronister has been sheriff of Florida's Hillsborough County since he was appointed to the role by then-Gov. Rick Scott 2017, and he has won reelection twice. He has been with the department for 32 years. Hillsborough County includes much of the Tampa Bay metro area.",
      "The outgoing DEA administrator is Anne Milgram, who has held the role for nearly all of President Biden's term.",
      "The DEA, which is part of the Justice Department, has approximately 10,000 employees and is tasked with enforcing America's drug laws. Among its major edicts has been addressing the opioid crisis.",
      "In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" in September, Milgram said the U.S. is \"losing a generation\" to fentanyl.",
      "\"As complex and as massive a problem as this is, it's also not a whodunit. We know who's responsible,\" Milgram said. \"It's the Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco Cartel that are based in Mexico. They dominate and control the entire global fentanyl supply chain, starting in China, going to Mexico, coming into the United States.\"",
      "During his campaign, Trump pledged to crack down on illegal immigration and drug trafficking, and this week, Trump followed through by threatening to impose sweeping 25% tariffs on both Mexico and Canada until those issues are properly addressed to his liking.",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 17:41:18 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's attorneys mentioned Hunter Biden in a filing arguing the New York criminal case against the president-elect should be dismissed.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's lawyers pointed to an unlikely person in demanding a judge dismiss the president-elect's New York criminal case: Hunter Biden.",
      "Trump's attorneys said in a court filing made public Tuesday that President Joe Biden's controversial pardon of his son echoed Trump's complaints about the prosecution.",
      "\"Yesterday, in issuing a 10-year pardon to Hunter Biden that covers any and all crimes whether charged or uncharged, President Biden asserted that his son was 'selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,' and 'treated differently,'\" they wrote, before claiming Trump was treated similarly.",
      "In the filing, which was submitted Monday night, they formally demanded a New York judge throw out the president-elect's criminal case and nullify a unanimous jury's conclusion that Trump committed dozens of felonies.",
      "Their argument struck at the quality of the case against Trump, but centers largely on a wholly unique argument in the history of America's legal system. Trump's lawyers said his conviction in state court should not stand because he was elected president after his conviction.",
      "Prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg have vowed to oppose the dismissal motion, and have been given a one-week deadline to file their response. They pursued the case amid a torrent of public threats of retribution by Trump's allies, and anonymous threats of violence by his supporters.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued in their filing that the Constitution requires dismissal of the case, even though it's already progressed though trial, because ongoing proceedings threaten to take Trump's attention from the presidency.",
      "\"Wrongly continuing proceedings in this failed lawfare case disrupts President Trump's transition efforts and his preparations to wield the full Article II executive power authorized by the Constitution pursuant to the overwhelming national mandate granted to him by the American people on November 5, 2024,\" wrote his attorneys, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, each of whom are slated to take on high-level positions at the Justice Department after Trump is inaugurated.",
      "Trump's sentencing was recently postponed for a third time. After he was convicted in May, Justice Juan Merchan scheduled sentencing for July 11. In the interim, the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling concluding that former presidents could not be charged for official acts, and evidence related to their official work as president could not be used as evidence against them.",
      "The first sentencing postponement came because Trump's attorneys wanted to file a motion to dismiss based on that Supreme Court ruling. Merchan has yet to rule on that motion.",
      "They then asked for and were granted a postponement of the second sentencing date, Sept. 18, arguing that it was too close to the election.",
      "After Trump won the presidency on Nov. 5, his attorneys quickly indicated they'd make Monday's request. In Trump's filing, his attorneys refer to his election victory as \"overwhelming.\"",
      "Bragg's office has floated postponing sentencing and other proceedings until after Trump's term in office, which ends in 2029.",
      "\"Consideration must be given to various non-dismissal options that may address any concerns raised by the pendency of a post-trial criminal proceeding during the presidency, such as deferral of all remaining criminal proceedings until after the end of defendant's upcoming presidential term,\" they wrote in a Nov. 19 letter to Merchan.",
      "The Manhattan case against Trump set a series of unprecedented firsts. He was the first person in American history to be elected president after being convicted of crimes. When the anonymous jury concluded in May he was guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records, he became the first former president ever convicted of crimes. The case against Trump began when a grand jury in March 2023 made him the first former president ever indicted.",
      "The case revolved around a coverup of a \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star before his first election to office in 2016. While in office, Trump authorized a scheme to conceal reimbursements to a lawyer who made the payment to the actress just days before Trump's first election.",
      "Trump entered a not guilty plea in the case and promised minutes after his conviction that he would fight the jury's decision.",

    "story": [
      "A Chinese national living in California has been arrested and charged by federal law enforcement after he allegedly bought and exported guns and ammunition to North Korea at the direction of North Korean agents who funneled him $2 million to purchase the equipment, according to a newly unsealed criminal complaint.",
      "Shenghua Wen, 41, also admitted to trying to obtain military uniforms in an apparent attempt to help North Korean soldiers disguise themselves and conduct a \"surprise attack\" against South Korea, prosecutors said in an affidavit accompanying the complaint, which was filed on Nov. 26.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Wen came to the U.S. on a student visa in 2012 and lives in Ontario, California. During a series of interviews earlier this year, he allegedly told investigators that he met with North Korean officials in China before coming to the U.S., and they directed him to procure firearms, ammunition and technology on behalf of Pyongyang.",
      "Wen told the FBI he was \"good at smuggling,\" court records said, and he allegedly admitted he shipped two containers of guns in 2023 from Long Beach, California, to Hong Kong, where they were then smuggled into North Korea.",
      "Wen is charged with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on North Korea, which make it illegal to send American money or goods to the country without permission. An attorney for Wen could not immediately be identified.",
      "The affidavit filed in federal court in California revealed that FBI agents recovered 50,000 rounds of ammunition from Wen's car, and he allegedly admitted to having bought the ammo at the direction of North Korean officials. Law enforcement also seized a device used to detect chemical threats and a tool that can detect hidden surveillance devices, according to the affidavit. Investigators said they found photos of firearms and equipment that Wen sent in messages with co-conspirators, some of which they included in the affidavit.",
      "The criminal complaint did not detail the complete extent to which Wen allegedly worked on behalf of North Korea's government, but prosecutors wrote he communicated with his handlers via encrypted messaging apps where the officials directed his conduct and coordinated the smuggling operations.",
      "Wen allegedly bought some of the weapons he sent to North Korea via third-party straw purchasers and told investigators he drove on numerous occasions to Texas to obtain the firearms. To fund the allegedly illegal purchases and international shipments, Wen told authorities the North Korean government funneled about $2 million through a Chinese Bank into bank accounts belonging to Wen's partner, the criminal complaint said.",
      "\"During the interview on September 6, 2024, [Wen] explained that he believed the North Korean government wanted the weapons, ammunition, and other military-related equipment to prepare for an attack against South Korea,\" prosecutors wrote, adding his cellphone also contained numerous photos of U.S. military uniforms, pointing to his intent to ship the uniforms overseas.",
      "The Justice Department has charged other individuals living in the U.S. with similar conduct tied to the North Korean government. In May, federal prosecutors accused an Arizona woman of carrying out a scheme to help North Korean IT workers illegally obtain remote employment with American companies. The group allegedly used the identities of more than 60 individuals who lived in the U.S. to generate nearly $7 million for the North Korean government from more than 300 U.S. companies.",

      "\"Each one of us must reflect hard and decide \u2014 in close consultation with colleagues and leadership \u2014where we can be most personally effective in the fight to recapture a majority in Congress that can promote national progress,\" Raskin said in a letter to colleagues.",

Republicans flipped four seats, retaking the majority.",

It will be a very special day for all!\"",
      "Notre Dame was damaged in a fire that raged for 12 hours on April 15, 2019, nearly destroying the iconic 1,200-year-old church. Although experts said at the time that the restoration could take up to 40 years, Macron vowed to rebuild in five years.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday will consider the constitutionality of a Tennessee law that prohibits gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to convene Wednesday to hear arguments in a landmark case involving access to gender-affirming care like puberty blockers and hormone therapy for minors experiencing gender dysphoria.",
      "The case concerns the constitutionality of a Tennessee law that bans this medical care for transgender adolescents. Half the states have measures on the books that are similar to Tennessee's, and advocates for transgender rights are warning that if the Supreme Court upholds the ban, it would open the door to state lawmakers outlawing gender-affirming care for adults.",
      "The dispute is the first in which the justices will consider the constitutionality of state efforts to regulate medical interventions for transgender youth, but it comes as Republican-led states have enacted a slew of restrictions targeting transgender individuals, including policies on\u00a0sports teams and restroom access.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to restrict medical treatments for transgender minors and bar transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. And while the Biden administration will argue Wednesday that the Supreme Court should invalidate Tennessee's law, the incoming Trump administration could reverse the government's position once it is in power early next year.",
      "That shift in stance, though, may not preclude the high court from issuing a decision in the case, expected by the end of June.",
      "\"It's very difficult for these teenagers, who already face a difficult scenario, when there's this institutional governmental rejection of who they are,\" said Dr. Susan Lacy, a Memphis-based physician who challenged Tennessee's law alongside three families. \"That's very difficult to be told either you don't know who you are \u2014 being told that you're wrong, you don't know what you're talking about, your parents are trying to manipulate you, all of that kind of rhetoric is really difficult for these kids.\"",
      "Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care",
      "Known as SB1, Tennessee's Republican-led legislature approved its ban on certain medical treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria in March 2023. Puberty blockers and hormone therapy have been used to treat gender dysphoria for decades, but in the past three years, GOP-controlled state legislatures have adopted measures restricting access to these treatments for minors.",
      "Tennessee's law prohibits health care providers from administering any puberty blocker or hormone if they're meant to enable \"a minor to identity with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex.\" The state argues that it has a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in barring procedures that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "The use of these treatments for conditions such as precocious puberty, congenital defects or other diseases is allowed in Tennessee.",
      "The Biden administration argues that Tennessee's ban draws lines based on sex and discriminates against transgender people, in violation of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection. The Justice Department has argued that the law should be subject to a more stringent level of judicial review, known as heightened scrutiny, rather than the more relaxed standard applied by the lower court, rational basis review.",
      "\"Most immediately, SB1 prohibits transgender adolescents, their parents, and their doctors from making critically important and intensely personal decisions about the appropriate medical treatment for what everyone agrees is a serious medical condition,\" Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who will argue on behalf of the federal government, wrote in a filing with the high court.",
      "But Tennessee officials assert that the law is a routine exercise of state power to regulate medicine, and it is medical use and purpose \u2014 not sex \u2014 that dictate the availability of treatments. The state, they have said, is trying to protect children from the \"life-altering risks\" of gender-affirming care, which they said is \"risky\" and \"unproven.\"",
      "\"While the government is free to favor its transition-first, ask-questions-later approach, the Constitution does not bind Tennessee to that same choice,\" state officials wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court.",
      "The challenge before the high court was brought by three families and Lacy, who began providing gender-affirming care eight years ago. One of the challengers, a transgender girl identified in court filings as L.W., was diagnosed with gender dysphoria at the age of 12 and began taking puberty blockers, followed by hormones.",
      "Today, the state's ban means L.W., now 16, must travel to another state to receive her treatments.",
      "\"Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming medical care is an active threat to the future my daughter deserves,\" Brian Williams, L.W.'s father, told reporters in a press call hosted by the ACLU. \"It infringes not only on her freedom to be herself, but on our family's love for her.\"",
      "The ACLU is representing the families who challenged Tennessee's law. Chase Strangio, a lawyer with the group, will make history as the first openly transgender person to argue before the Supreme Court when he participates in oral arguments Wednesday.",
      "A federal district court ruled for the Biden administration and the challengers, finding that Tennessee's ban likely violates the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. The court ruled the law discriminates based on sex and targets transgender people, and said the benefits of the health care outlawed by the law are \"well-established.\"",
      "But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit reversed the lower court's decision and allowed Tennessee's law to take effect. The measure, the divided panel found, regulates gender-affirming care for all minors, regardless of sex.",
      "\"Life-tenured federal judges should be wary of removing a vexing and novel topic of medical debate from the ebbs and flows of democracy by construing a largely unamendable Constitution to occupy the field,\" Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote.",
      "The Biden administration and the families appealed the 6th Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court, which agreed in June to review the ruling.",
      "A \"sense of mental clarity\"",
      "The Williams Institute, a think tank that conducts research on sexual orientation and gender identity law, estimates there are roughly 1.6 million people ages 13 and older who identify as transgender. There are more than 300,000 transgender youth between the ages of 13 and 17 who live in states where access to puberty blockers and hormones is restricted, according to the center.",
      "Daniel Trujillo, a 17-year-old transgender boy who lives in Tucson, Arizona, began social transitioning when he was 8 years old and was prescribed puberty blockers after years of discussions between his parents, pediatrician and, later, a clinical psychologist.",
      "\"I myself am proof that gender-affirming care works and it helps people and it saves lives,\" he told CBS News. \"When I was experiencing a lot of dysphoria, it was really hard for me to focus on things that mattered. I couldn't focus on school. I was very anxious and internalizing whatever I was experiencing, and once I was able to feel more comfortable in myself and feel affirmed with me, as who I am, my parents were able to see the shift, my friends and family could see the shift.\"",
      "In 2022, then-Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, signed into law a bill that prohibits \"irreversible gender reassignment surgery\" for minors. An earlier version of the proposal would have also outlawed puberty blockers and hormone therapy, but it failed in a state senate committee.",
      "Still, Lizette Trujillo, Daniel's mother, said that had the state banned those treatments, the family would have moved elsewhere to ensure her son could continue to receive medical care.",
      "\"That felt really scary, because here is my child who is emotionally well, who has maintained strong self-esteem, feels love, he's doing well. And then to have the state infringe on our right and totally change our trajectory or change his life felt awful, it felt scary and felt unjust,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Medical interventions in minors experiencing gender dysphoria began in Europe in the late 1990s, when Dutch health care providers started offering puberty blockers. In 1998, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health recommended puberty blockers at the start of puberty and hormone treatment for transgender youth at 16.",
      "In recent years, though, some health authorities in European nations have warned of insufficient evidence on the efficacy of treatments for transgender youth.",
      "Sonia Suter, a law professor at George Washington University Law School, said the Supreme Court could side with Tennessee and conclude that it should give deference to the state legislature in regulating health care because of medical uncertainty and disagreement among experts.",
      "Citing an independent review from the United Kingdom, after which England's National Health Service stopped prescribing puberty blockers and hormones to minors with gender dysphoria, Suter that it could \"make it easy for the U.S. Supreme Court to say, you know what, there is clearly medical uncertainty here and therefore we're not going to second-guess.\"",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Tennessee officials warn that treatments for gender dysphoria carry health risks, such as negative impacts to fertility, diminished bone density and a higher risk of cancer.",
      "But Lacy, the provider who has roughly 700 transgender patients out of roughly 3,000 who visit her practice, said she has not seen any major complications affecting long-term health.",
      "\"When I first started providing trans care, the most compelling piece of it was that, prior to any sort of physical changes or obvious transitional changes, the first thing that people would tell me is that they felt like there was sort of a sense of mental clarity that they experienced,\" she said.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 20:02:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Hunter Biden was convicted of three separate felony charges related to his purchase of a gun and pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges in a separate case.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0President Biden announced late Sunday that he issued a pardon for his son Hunter Biden, in a major reversal in the final weeks of his presidency.",
      "Mr. Biden repeatedly pledged not to pardon his son, who was\u00a0convicted in June of three separate felony charges\u00a0related to his purchase of a revolver in 2018 when he was battling an addiction to illegal drugs, which he lied about on paperwork to obtain the gun. He also pleaded guilty to nine tax evasion charges in a separate case in September.",
      "\"Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement Sunday night.",
      "The president argued that \"Hunter was treated differently\" than others under similar circumstances, claiming that the charges were brought after \"several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election.\"",
      "\"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son \u2014  and that is wrong,\" Mr. Biden said.",
      "The \"Full and Unconditional Pardon\" applies to any crimes Hunter Biden may have committed from Jan. 1, 2014, through Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "Mr. Biden did not address the pardon with reporters before boarding Air Force One for his trip to Angola.",
      "Hunter Biden charges and allegations",
      "Hunter Biden was investigated and prosecuted by special counsel David Weiss, the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware who was kept on by Mr. Biden's administration in 2021, when other Trump-era prosecutors were asked to resign, in order to continue the probes into Hunter's conduct. Attorney General Merrick Garland later elevated Weiss to special counsel status after whistleblowers and congressional Republicans alleged irregularities in the probe.",
      "Weiss' office declined to comment on the pardon.",
      "Joseph Ziegler and Gary Shapley, two IRS whistleblowers who came forward to raise concerns about what they said were the Justice Department's efforts to shield Hunter Biden, said in a statement that it was \"a sad day for law abiding taxpayers to witness this special privilege for the powerful.\"",
      "Before dropping out of the race for president, Mr. Biden had committed not to pardon his son,\u00a0saying in an interview with ABC News in June that he had ruled it out. After opting to\u00a0leave the race\u00a0the next month, the White House maintained that Mr. Biden had no plans to pardon his son, though the possible political consequences of the decision had decreased. The White House\u00a0said\u00a0as recently as last month that the president still had no plans to issue a pardon.",
      "\"I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction \u2014 mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport. Despite all of this, I have maintained my sobriety for more than five years because of my deep faith and the unwavering love and support of my family and friends,\" Hunter Biden said in a statement Sunday night.",
      "\"I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering,\" the president's son said.",
      "Hunter Biden was set to be sentenced for the gun convictions on Dec. 12 and on Dec. 16 for the tax evasion charges.",
      "Following the White House announcement of the pardon, Hunter Biden's legal team informed the federal judges overseeing his cases in Delaware and California about the pardon so the cases can be formally dismissed and the sentencing hearings set for later this month be canceled.",
      "Hunter Biden was\u00a0indicted on three felony gun charges\u00a0in September after a proposed plea deal with federal prosecutors\u00a0fell apart. The deal would have had him plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and enter a diversion program instead of pleading guilty to a felony gun possession count.",
      "During the court hearing in which the plea deal was set to be finalized, the judge overseeing the case raised concerns over the terms while Hunter Biden's legal team pushed back against prosecutors over whether the agreement was to protect the president's son from any future criminal charges.",
      "Hunter Biden was accused of lying on paperwork and illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while he was addicted to crack cocaine. Federal law prohibits users of illegal drugs from owning firearms.",
      "Prosecutors said the president's son lied about his drug use on a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives form when he bought a revolver and several other items from a Wilmington, Delaware, gun store on Oct. 12, 2018.",
      "In the separate case in California, a federal grand jury last December\u00a0charged Hunter Biden\u00a0with three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanor offenses. The president's son was accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in federal taxes while living an \"extravagant lifestyle.\"",
      "According to the indictment, Hunter Biden made some $7 million in income from his foreign business dealings from 2016 through 2019. He was accused of spending nearly $5 million during that same time period on \"everything but his taxes,\" including on drugs, escorts, luxury hotels, cars and clothing. Hunter Biden was accused of falsely listing those purchases as business expenses.",
      "After unsuccessfully attempting to enter an \"Alford\" plea, wherein a defendant accepts a guilty verdict while maintaining their innocence, Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to the tax evasion charges on Sept. 5.",
      "\"Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form,\" Mr. Biden said Sunday night. \"Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently.\"",
      "Special counsel response",
      "Weiss argued in a court filing on Monday that Hunter Biden's cases should not be dismissed, but rather closed by the judge overseeing them. The Justice Department said Monday they have not yet seen the order of clemency signed by Mr. Biden for his son.",
      "Weiss argued the cases against Hunter Biden were not defective and as a result, should not be dismissed. He says the judges should follow precedent form other cases in which defendants received pardons and simply close the case and docket the notice of clemency on the public docket.",
      "\"If media reports are accurate, the Government does not challenge that the defendant has been the recipient of an act of mercy,\" Weiss said in the filing. \"But that does not mean the grand jury's decision to charge him, based on a finding of probable cause, should be wiped away as if it never occurred. It also does not mean that his charges should be wiped away because the defendant falsely claimed that the charges were the result of some improper motive. No court has agreed with the defendant on these baseless claims, and his request to dismiss the indictment finds no support in the law or the practice of this district.\"",
      "Without specifically calling out Mr. Biden by name, Weiss also pushed back on criticism of the probe, writing, \"there was none and never has been any evidence of vindictive or selective prosecution in this case.\"",
      "White House response",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre dodged questions about the president's reversal on Monday, reiterating portions of the president's statement while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One. She outlined that Mr. Biden made the decision over the weekend, saying that he \"agonized\" over it.",
      "While insisting Mr. Biden believes in the Justice Department, Jean-Pierre said that \"politics infected the process,\" arguing that \"both things could be true.\" She said the president is not seeking the resignation of the attorney general, and said Mr. Biden does not agree with President-elect Donald Trump that the DOJ has been weaponized for political purposes or needs reform.",
      "Jean-Pierre suggested that the decision came in part because the president didn't think his political opponents would let up.",
      "\"One of the reasons the president did the pardon is because it didn't seem like his political opponents would let go of it,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"It didn't seem like they would move on.\"",
      "Biden family reaction",
      "First lady Jill Biden told reporters on Monday \"of course I support the pardon of my son.\"",
      "The first lady and daughter Ashley were often present during Hunter Biden's trial to show their support for him. Hunter Biden, his wife Melissa and son Beau Jr. all spent Thanksgiving weekend on Nantucket with Mr. Biden, Jill Biden and Ashley.",
      "Reaction to the pardon",
      "On social media, Trump called the Biden pardon \"an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!\"",
      "Other Republicans on Sunday and Monday decried the pardon. House Speaker Mike Johnson posted X that \"trust in our justice system has been almost irreparably damaged by the Bidens and their use and abuse of it.\"",
      "Sen. Chuck Grassley wrote that is he is \"shocked\" about the pardon because Mr. Biden \"said many many times he wouldn't & I believed him[.] Shame on me.\"",
      "Colorado's Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, meanwhile, wrote on Sunday that as a father, he understands Mr. Biden's desire to pardon his son, but said he was \"disappointed that he put his family ahead of the country. This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later Presidents and will sadly tarnish his reputation.\"",
      "But former Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder said on Sunday night \"pardon warranted,\" posting on social media that had Hunter Biden's \"name been Joe Smith the resolution would have been - fundamentally and more fairly - a declination.\"",
      "Holder also mentioned Trump's announcement over the weekend that he wanted Kash Patel to lead the FBI, saying \"ask yourself a vastly more important question. Do you really think Kash Patel is qualified to lead the world's preeminent law enforcement investigative organization? Obvious answer: hell no.\"",
      "Presidential pardons",
      "Hunter Biden is the 26th person to receive a pardon during Mr. Biden's presidency. Most of the others received pardons for drug offenses. Trump granted\u00a029 pardons\u00a0at this point in his first term, but issued a total of 143 pardons by the time he left office in 2020.",
      "This is not the first time a president has pardoned a family member. President Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother, Roger Clinton, before leaving office. Trump pardoned his son-in-law's father, Charles Kushner, during his first term. Trump announced that he intends to\u00a0nominate Kushner\u00a0as U.S. ambassador to France on Saturday.",
      "The two federal cases against Hunter Biden came amid a backdrop of Republican-led congressional inquiries into his business dealings and whether they involved Mr. Biden. The president has maintained he had nothing to do with his son's businesses and the investigative committees produced no evidence showing the president engaged in wrongdoing.",
      "Robert Legare and \n                                                  \n                                  Arden Farhi\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Presidents are granted the authority to issue pardons under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden on Sunday issued a sweeping pardon of his son Hunter, who was convicted earlier this year on federal gun and drug charges, and pleaded guilty to tax charges in California.",
      "The presidential pardoning process is one that has long courted controversy, especially since many presidents issue pardons when they are leaving the White House.",
      "One of the most famous \u2014and controversial\u2014 pardons in history happened less than one month into President Gerald Ford's term. On Sept. 8, 1974, Ford announced from the Oval Office that he would \"grant a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States which he, Richard Nixon, has committed or may have committed.\" Ford's own press secretary resigned over the pardon, and Ford's approval rating dropped 20 points over the following days. His approval rating never recovered and he went on to lose the 1976 presidential election.",
      "What is a presidential pardon?",
      "Presidents are granted the authority to issue pardons under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. The Constitution's framers were heavily influenced by the English legal tradition of pardon, which dates back to the 7th century, and Alexander Hamilton introduced the concept of the presidential pardon at the Constitutional Convention.",
      "Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution declares: \"The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.\"",
      "There are four different types of clemency that fall under the president's pardoning power: pardon, amnesty, commutation and reprieve.\u00a0 As outlined by the White House, a pardon releases a person from punishment and restores all civil liberties; amnesty is the same as the pardon but is extended to an entire class of individuals; commutation reduces the sentence imposed by a federal court, and a reprieve delays the imposition of a sentence or punishment.",
      "Pardons, however, may not be issued in cases of impeachment or if it is an \"offense against the United States,\" such as treason.",
      "The Office of the Pardon Attorney at the Department of Justice issues guidelines for the application of clemency, but presidents do not need to follow them.",
      "To be pardoned, a person must have been convicted in a United States District Court, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, or a military court-martial \u2014 so a president cannot issue a pardon for a state conviction.",
      "What does a pardon mean for the pardoned person?",
      "A pardon can help eliminate some of the consequences of conviction and restore a person's civil rights.",
      "According to the Justice Department, the offense is not removed from a person's criminal record when they are pardoned but instead the conviction and the pardon both appear on the record. But the pardon can be helpful in obtaining licenses, bonding or employment.",
      "Who has Biden pardoned while in office?",
      "Hunter Biden is the 26th person Mr. Biden has pardoned so far. Most pardons relate to drug offenses, a practice started by former President Barack Obama. In September 2023, Mr. Biden granted clemency for three Iranians who were accused of moving $6 billion in a restricted Iranian account as part of a prisoner swap.",
      "At this point in President-elect Donald Trump's first term, he had pardoned 29 people.",
      "Who did Trump pardon during his first term?",
      "Trump issued a slew of pardons on Jan. 19, 2021, shortly before he left office. Trump pardoned 74 people and commuted the sentences of another 70.",
      "Among those pardoned were Steve Bannon, GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy, Albert J. Pirro and rapper Lil Wayne.",
      "Prior to those pardons, Trump pardoned more than 30 people in December 2020, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner's father, Charles Kushner, who had been convicted of witness tampering, tax evasion and illegal campaign contributions in 2005. Ahead of his second term, Trump has nominated Charles Kushner to be the ambassador to France.",
      "Earlier in his term, Trump pardoned Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio,\u00a0Dinesh D'Souza, his first national security adviser Michael Flynn, former George W. Bush aide I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby and Oregon ranchers Dwight L. Hammond and Steve D. Hammond.",
      "In 2020, Trump issued a full pardon for Alice Marie Johnson, whose sentence he had commuted in 2018 after lobbying from Kim Kardashian. Johnson is a great-grandmother who had served 22 years in federal prison for what was a first-time criminal offense, which had come to Kardashian's attention.",
      "In total over four years in office, Trump issued 237 acts of clemency, including 143 pardons and 94 commutations. The only presidents since 1900 who issued fewer acts of clemency were George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, according to the\u00a0Pew Research Center.",
      "Who did Obama pardon while in office?",
      "Obama issued 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations while in office, including for 568 people who were serving life sentences. In 2014, Obama launched the Clemency Initiative, which allowed federal prisoners to apply for leniency, especially those serving for nonviolent drug offenses. In the\u00a0Obama White House archives, his administration touts that those whose sentences were commuted were \"incarcerated under outdated and unduly harsh sentencing laws.\"",
      "Although Obama encouraged prisoners to apply for leniency under the Clemency Initiative, a report by the Justice Department Inspector General in 2018 found that initiative was poorly planned and not implemented properly, while also suffering from poor communication and bureaucratic feuds.",
      "\"We found that the Department did not effectively plan, implement, or manage the Initiative at the outset,\" Inspector General Michael Horowitz wrote in the report.",
      "Which president has pardoned the most people in history?",
      "President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who served 13 years in office, issued the most pardons: 3,687.",
      "Have past presidents pardoned family members?",
      "Although Mr. Biden is the first president to pardon his son, he is not the first to pardon a family member. Former President Bill Clinton pardoned his brother Roger Clinton and Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, his son-in-law's father.",
      "Abraham Lincoln, meanwhile, pardoned his sister-in-law, Emilie Todd Helm, who was the widow of a Confederate general, under the Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction.",
      "Can a president issue a preemptive pardon?",
      "Ford's infamous pardon of Nixon was a preemptive pardon, since Nixon had not been charged with a crime. Former President Jimmy Carter also issued preemptive pardons for Vietnam draft evaders, as did Lincoln in the Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction, which allowed for former Confederates to be pardoned if they took an oath to the U.S.",
      "President George H.W. Bush also pardoned his secretary of defense, Caspar Weinberger, along with five others, for his alleged role in the Iran-Contra scandal after he was indicted but before his trial.",
      "Mr. Biden's pardon of Hunter covers any crimes Hunter Biden may have committed from Jan. 1, 2014, through Dec. 1, 2024, even if he has not yet been charged. Hunter Biden's first plea agreement in Delaware fell apart because his lawyers sought full immunity from future prosecution.",
      "Can another president undo a previous presidential pardon?",
      "The pardon language in Article II of the Constitution does not include any language about revoking pardons, although only a few presidents have exercised that power.",
      "On President Andrew Johnson's last day in office, he issued several pardons \u2014 three of which President Ulysses S. Grant reversed on his first day by calling back the U.S. Marshal so they were never delivered. A fourth was allowed to stand since it had been delivered.",
      "According to Washington Monthly, an 1868 textbook by Supreme Court Associate Justice Joseph Story on the Constitution says a presidential pardon can be revoked if the president was impeached. In recent history, both Clinton and Trump have been impeached \u2014 although their pardons did stand after their terms.",
      "Former President George W. Bush, meanwhile, revoked one of his own pardons. In December 2008, shortly before leaving office, Bush pardoned 19 people, including\u00a0 Isaac Robert Toussie of Brooklyn, N.Y., who had been convicted of making false statements to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and of mail fraud.",
      "One day later, Bush reversed the decision, with White House press secretary Dana Perino citing \"information that has subsequently come to light,\" including on the extent and nature of Toussie's prior criminal offenses. She also said that neither the White House counsel's office nor the president had been aware of a political contribution by Toussie's father that \"might create an appearance of impropriety.\"",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump's selection of a number of House Republicans to fill top posts in his administration is pulling from an already shallow bench.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republicans have celebrated holding onto their narrow majority in the House, adding to their flip of the Senate and the White House for a trifecta in Washington next year. But President-elect Donald Trump's selection of a number of House Republicans to fill top posts in his administration is pulling from an already shallow bench, temporarily whittling the GOP majority down further as Trump takes office in January.",
      "Just one House race remains to be decided nearly four weeks after Election Day, with 99% of the vote counted in California's 13th Congressional District, where Democrat Adam Gray is leading GOP Rep. John Duarte. Last week, victories in another California district, along with one in Iowa brought the balance of power in the chamber to 220-214.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump has tapped a handful of House Republicans for top positions in his administration. In the week following the election, the president-elect made two selections from the House, with GOP conference chair Elise Stefanik of New York as ambassador to the U.N., and Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida as national security adviser.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, while outlining the GOP agenda following the picks last month, said the president-elect \"fully understands and appreciates the math here,\" noting that he didn't expect the conference would lose any more members to Trump's administration.",
      "\"Every single vote will count because if someone gets ill or has a car accident or a late flight on their plane then it affects the votes on the floor,\" Johnson said.",
      "Then came Trump's pick of former Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general, setting up three vacancies early in the new Congress. Gaetz resigned his seat immediately, hours after Trump announced his intent to nominate him.",
      "\"I told President Trump, 'enough already, you've got to give me some relief,'\" Johnson said on Fox News after Trump selected Gaetz for the role. \"I've got to maintain this majority.\"",
      "Though Gaetz has since withdrawn from consideration for the post, facing intense scrutiny over a House Ethics Committee investigation into alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, he's said he does not intend to serve in the 119th Congress, giving Johnson another unwelcome vacancy.",
      "Johnson expressed optimism at the time of Gaetz' selection that with his immediate resignation from the chamber, his seat could be filled by the start of the new Congress, citing Florida state law's process. But Gov. Ron DeSantis\u00a0set the primary for Jan. 28, and the general election for April 1, which he said was the earliest date the special election could take place. Florida's secretary of state said the election was being conducted \"as quickly as statutorily possible.\"",
      "Waltz' seat is also set for an April 1 general election in Florida. And the special election for Stefanik's seat could take up to 90 days after she resigns. The dynamic could mean for months in the early days of the president-elect's second term, Republicans could have a majority that is as low as one or two seats, meaning that if all House members are present, Johnson could need the support of every single Republican. If he has a three-seat majority, he could afford to lose one Republican on some votes.",
      "The outcome may spell trouble for the GOP's ability to act on the mandate that Republicans have claimed since Trump's victory in the presidential election. (Although Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in both the electoral and popular votes, he did not win a majority of American voters.) House Republican leadership has struggled in recent years to keep the conference united on key priorities, with a reliable group of detractors on its right flank. While the conservatives, many of whom are Trump loyalists, may be more inclined to stay in line under a Trump administration than during President Biden's time in office, Johnson could face opposition from moderates in his party.",
      "House Republicans like Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska, David Valadao of California and Dan Newhouse of Washington have previously been critical of Trump and could break with the party on some issues, imperiling some early legislative action. Bacon refused to back the president-elect during the primary, while Valadao and Newhouse are the two remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in 2021. After the election, Rep. Mike Lawler of New York told USA Today that he would be willing to speak out against Trump amid GOP control of Washington to work in the best interest of his constituents.",
      "\"When I agree with the president, I'll say it. If I disagree on something, I will say that, too,\" Lawler said.",
      "Still, the exceedingly narrow majority created by Trump's appointments is expected to be short-lived, since all three seats are in safely Republican districts. Johnson expressed confidence that Republicans would be able to work with a smaller majority for as long is necessary, while pledging to \"be very aggressive\" and move forward with Trump's agenda beginning on Day One.",

    "summary": "Bluesky has added millions of new subscribers in the last month as some users leave X. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "It's unusual for a new social media service to get a foothold in a marketplace entrenched by the likes of X (formerly Twitter), Instagram and TikTok which, dominate people's phones. But Bluesky, a nearly 2-year-old app, is now grabbing attention amid a recent surge of new users, which the company says is likely due to growing frustrations with X.",
      "While the platform has grown since it opened as an invite-only service in February 2023, its membership snowballed following the November 5 presidential election. Bluesky currently has more than 22 million users, up from about 12 million people in mid-October, according to the company's data.",
      "Bluesky believes its recent growth is partly due to changes at X under billionaire owner Elon Musk, according to Bluesky Chief Operating Officer Rose Wang, who recently spoke to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Musk, who bought Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, has overhauled the service, changing its name to X\u00a0and\u00a0prioritizing accounts from people who pay for a blue checkmark \u2014 although accounts with more than 2,500 \"verified subscriber followers\" get access to Premium features for free.",
      "Ad sales almost immediately softened after Musk took over the platform, with companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Disney removing paid ads from X\u00a0last year. Most recently, The Guardian said it would no longer be posting its content under its official account on X. In its announcement, the British newspaper described X as \"toxic,\" adding that the platform has been used by Musk to shape political discourse.",
      "Musk became one of the most viral voices on elections during the 2024 campaign, frequently sharing conspiratorial narratives while promoting President-elect Donald Trump, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "When Twitter became X, \"it was no longer a public town square, and now it's more of a partisan microphone,\" Wang said, adding, \"that is a big reason why we think people are coming over.\"",
      "X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "What is the difference between X and Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky resembles the \"old Twitter\" in terms of layout and content,\u00a0wrote\u00a0PCWorld tech writer Dave Parrack in a recent column. He added, \"Bluesky feels like a safe haven. There's very little trolling, and when it does happen, people aren't biting.\"",
      "Bluesky users can find people to follow through so-called \"starter packs,\" or curated lists of people to follow by interest or fields, such as this group of garden writers. That enables users to quickly build a feed of posts from people that they pick, rather than being fed content by a corporate algorithm, the company says.",
      "Because people can tailor their interests and connect with other like-minded users, there's more interaction on the service than on X, according to Wang.",
      "Some companies are also reporting more engagement with their posts on the Bluesky app versus rival platforms. An executive for The Boston Globe, for instance\u00a0noted\u00a0that the newspaper's posts on Bluesky receive three times the traffic as on Meta's Threads.",
      "\"Thirty percent of users Bluesky are posters versus 1% on Twitter,\" Wang said.",
      "Even so, it's questionable whether Bluesky's jump in new users is making much of a dent in X's consumer base.",
      "The presidential election delivered a surge in traffic to Musk's social media service, according to tracking service Similarweb. It found that more than 46 million U.S. users visited X on November 6, the day after President-elect Donald Trump's win \u2014 more than any day in the prior year. About 115,000 people in the U.S. deactivated their accounts on X that same day, its data shows.",
      "How Bluesky makes money",
      "While Bluesky's user base is growing quickly, the company remains small in terms of its funding and staff, which Wang describes as \"a tiny team of 20\" employees, including herself and CEO Jay Graber. The service was created by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, although the business has been independent since 2021.",
      "In October, the company\u00a0raised $15 million in venture funding, which followed a seed round of $8 million in 2023. Wang noted that Bluesky is focused on figuring out how to sustain its business, which will soon include new revenue streams from subscriptions and financial transactions.",
      "\"We are launching subscriptions at the end of this year,\" Wang noted. \"It'll be custom aesthetics, custom avatar frames, maybe more video uploads.\"",
      "The company is also planning to enable financial transactions between users, such as if a game designer wants to sell his or her products to Bluesky users. The service would take a portion of the payment, Wang noted.",
      "Bluesky doesn't accept advertising, nor has it marketed itself in the wake of Musk's takeover of Twitter, she added.",
      "To be sure, Bluesky may never achieve the size of bigger social media networks, which advertisers flock to in order to reach much larger groups of users. For instance, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, had more than 3 billion daily users across its apps in the most recent quarter, and\u00a0booked almost $40 billion in revenue during that time.",
      "How do you sign up for Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky opened as an invitation-only platform in February 2023, but anyone can now sign up for the service.",
      "User handles on the service are a little bit different than X or other social media networks because they end with the site's domain, .bsky.social. Posts are limited to 300 characters, 20 more than on X. Photos and videos can also uploaded, though videos can't be longer than 60 seconds. GIFs and emojis are available, too.",
      "As with other platforms, you can tag people on Bluesky by typing \"@\" before their username, you can like posts by tapping a heart icon, and use hashtags to highlight a theme. Bluesky has added a\u00a0menu\u00a0to hashtags, so that when users click on one they'll get different options for seeing, or muting, posts on a particular topic.",
      "\"It's more of a community space \u2014 it's more of a Reddit model, where you land in those cosy corners,\" Wang added. \"At the end of the day it's all about the people, and what I encourage people to do is just come to Bluesky, give it a chance and see for yourself what the experience is like.\"",

    "title": "Why is Trump threatening a 100% tariff on the BRICS nations?",
    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:41:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump said the U.S. would hit Brazil, Russia and six other countries with a crushing tariff if they sought to challenge the dollar.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 30 threatened to slap a 100% tariff on a group of nine nations \u2014 the so-called BRICS \u2014 if they try to replace the U.S. dollar with another currency.",
      "The BRICS countries include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Trump said he'll enact the tariffs if the countries either move to create a new rival currency to the dollar or back an alternative currency to replace the greenback as the world's reserve medium of exchange.",
      "\"We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Trump's move comes after he recently\u00a0threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all products from Canada and Mexico entering the U.S., along with an additional 10% tax on goods from China, in what he says would force the countries to do more to halt the flow of unauthorized migrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.",
      "Why do BRICS countries want an alternative currency?",
      "The BRICS \u2014 named after the original five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) \u2014 was formed in 2009 to advance the interests of emerging economies and to make them less dependent on the U.S. dollar, which is by far the most commonly used currency in global commerce.",
      "The primacy of the dollar in international trade gives the U.S. a number of advantages, including lower borrowing costs for the federal government and enormous geopolitical influence around the world.",
      "In October, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a new\u00a0 international payments system at a BRICS summit, saying \"the dollar is being used as a weapon,\" the Associated Press reported. In 2023, meanwhile, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva proposed creating a new, common currency in South America to reduce its reliance on the dollar in international trade.",
      "Would a BRICS currency threaten the dollar?",
      "Creating a competing new currency would be difficult given how widely used the dollar is to conduct business around the world. Despite the existence of the euro and growing importance of China's renminbi, the dollar remains the world's main reserve currency, representing roughly 58% of the world's foreign exchange reserves, according to the\u00a0IMF. Also, critical commodities like oil and gold are still mostly bought and sold using dollars.",
      "\"Economically, it's not a major issue because the idea of the BRICS countries being able to put together an alternative as a reserve currency for the U.S. dollar is not plausible in the short or intermediate term,\" said Mark Weinstock, a global trade expert and professor of economics at Pace University.",
      "In other words, BRICS nations would struggle to create a viable currency given the relative strength and stability of the U.S. economy and the faith that global investors and trading partners have in U.S. government debt. And while the group's members have some interests in common, unifying behind a single currency would be politically fraught and technically complex.",
      "\"Fundamentally, if you are going to create your own form of money, that desirability is commensurate with the economic strength and integrity of the issuer. BRICS countries don't have the type of institutions that inspire global confidence to convince people that it is a satisfactory alternative to the dollar,\" Weinstock said.",
      "Some BRICS members are already downplaying the push to get a new currency off the ground. After Trump's tariff threat last weekend, South Africa's government on Monday issued a statement on social media saying there are no plans to create a BRICS currency.",
      "\"Recent misreporting has led to the incorrect narrative that BRICS is planning to create a new currency,\" South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation said. \"This is not the case. The discussions within BRICS focus on trading among member countries using their own national currencies.\"",
      "What would stiff tariffs on BRICS goods mean for U.S. consumers?",
      "While economists largely agree that a 100% tariff on goods imported to the U.S. from BRICS nations is a long shot, if it came to pass the move would not benefit U.S. consumers, they say. Such levies would drive up the cost of goods from BRICS member nations, potentially fueling inflation and leading to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Like any tariffs, this would mean higher prices for consumers,\" Weinstock said. \"That's always the impact of the tariff.\"",
      "Among the leading products the U.S. gets from BRICS countries are coffee from Brazil, electronics and clothes from China, and minerals from South Africa, according to trade data.",
      "Why are some economists criticizing Trump for threatening the BRICS?",
      "Some experts criticized Trump's threat to punish the BRICS, saying it makes the U.S. look weak.",
      "\"It isn't a good look, as it indirectly elevates the stature of a non-threat and suggests a lack of confidence in the dollar,\" Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former Treasury Department economist,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Trump's threat could actually accelerate a move away from the dollar by other countries, according to Setser, who said that an effort to effectively coerce countries to use the dollar \"is actually a long-run threat to the dollar's global role.\"",
      "\"It makes the use of the dollar appear to be a favor to the U.S.,\" he added.",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California said there's \"a lot of reason for concern\" for the second Trump administration \"if the first administration is any indicator.\"",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California said on Sunday that President-elect Donald Trump \"has made it no secret that he has it in for California\" as Gov. Gavin Newsom has convened a special legislative session this week to prepare for legal fights in Trump's upcoming term.",
      "Padilla said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that there's \"a lot of reason for concern\" for the second Trump administration \"if the first administration is any indicator.\"",
      "The California Democrat cited reports that Trump initially withheld disaster funds for the state during his first term, saying the president-elect tried to keep federal dollars from California families \"simply because it's a state that did not vote for him in the presidential election.\" In September, Trump threatened to block federal wildfire aid for California if elected again.",
      "\"We're trying to inoculate ourselves from those types of threats,\" Padilla continued.",
      "California Democrats billed the state as the \"resistance\" state during the first Trump administration. And after Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election, Newsom announced that he would convene an emergency session of the California state legislature to \"safeguard California values and fundamental rights in the face of an incoming Trump administration.\" In addition to bolstering legal resources, the governor pointed to protections for civil and reproductive rights, climate action, and immigrant families.",
      "On immigration, Padilla said \"we're hearing a lot of bombast from Trump and his allies about the biggest deportation operation in our country's history.\" He said while \"nobody disagrees\" with a focus on violent criminals, that's \"very different than millions and millions of people being deported indiscriminately.\" Padilla said that providing legal support for communities that could be impacted by Trump's plans is \"just the California way.\"",
      "\"We embrace our diversity,\" Padilla said. \"Our diversity is what has made our communities thrive and our economy thrive. And so we will assist families against the threats of the Trump administration.\"",
      "Meanwhile, as a \"sanctuary state,\" California state law instructs local law enforcement not to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on deportations, teeing up what could be a clash with the Trump administration. Padilla, citing California's status as the most populous state in the nation with more immigrants than any other state, argued that the issue concerns the ability for people to be able to come forward to report a crime, saying \"the last thing you want is immigrants who may be witnesses to crime to be afraid to come forward and share any information that they have in the investigation and prosecution of crimes.\"",
      "\"Let the federal government do the federal government's job, but have state and local officials do the state and local officials' job,\" Padilla continued. \"There doesn't have to be a conflict unless that's what Trump wants.\"",
      "More broadly, Padilla said \"there's also a lot of good that can be finalized\" before President Biden leaves office, pointing to climate-related work and additional flexibility for public health care programs to target mental health issues. And the California Democrat noted that there's \"a lot of good work to be done\" beyond the current administration if the federal government will continue to support California.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress returns this week from a Thanksgiving recess with a number of priorities to get through before the end of the year, while a deadline to fund the government looms over lawmakers.",
      "With the new Congress set to be sworn in on Jan. 3, lawmakers are pushing through a list of to-dos in the coming weeks in the lame-duck session, while Republicans gear up for leadership in Washington next year.",
      "But first, Congress must address government funding, since lawmakers only have until Dec. 20 to approve new spending. And although a shutdown remains unlikely, leaders will need to reach an agreement on a short-term funding measure in the weeks ahead.",
      "Funding the government",
      "In September, lawmakers approved a continuing resolution to keep the government funded through Dec. 20, setting a pre-holiday deadline to prevent a shutdown that has become commonplace for Congress. With frustration among some conservatives over the practice, House Speaker Mike Johnson made clear at the time that he opposed an omnibus package to fund the government, suggesting that the House would work to approve the 12 full-year spending bills individually after the election. But the favorable results for Republicans in the 2024 elections appeared to change the calculus.",
      "Republicans appear likely to push to punt the deadline into the early days of President-elect Donald Trump's administration, though the exact timeline for the stopgap measure remains a key question. The deadline will tee up a larger fight over government spending, with Republicans set to control the House, Senate and the White House \u2014 and looking to make significant spending cuts while juggling the extension of Trump's 2017 tax cuts.",
      "Lawmakers also have disaster aid to consider after the Biden administration requested $98 billion in aid to address the aftermath of Hurricanes Milton and Helene in the southeast.",
      "The funding fight comes as Johnson is looking to hold onto his gavel in the new year, with a narrow House majority that's proven problematic for Republicans seeking the speakership in recent years. Republicans have already selected Johnson to be their nominee for speaker in January, and the full House will elect a speaker when lawmakers are sworn in next month.",
      "Senate Republicans meet with Trump's administration picks",
      "Senate Republicans are expected to continue meeting with Trump's picks for top posts in his administration this week, looking to secure support in the upper chamber, which has the role of confirming the intended nominees.",
      "Ahead of their recess, Senate Republicans met with Trump picks including Pete Hegseth and former Rep. Matt Gaetz, who then opted to withdraw his name from consideration for Attorney General following intense scrutiny over a House Ethics Committee investigation into alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. On Monday, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa is set to meet with former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who Trump tapped for Attorney General after Gaetz withdrew.",
      "Trump has continued to announce his picks for the top posts, including Kash Patel, a 44-year-old who served in intelligence and defense roles in Trump's first term and has a reputation as a controversial figure, for FBI director. The announcement came as Trump-nominated Christopher Wray's term isn't set to expire until 2027.",
      "Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who Trump tapped to lead the newly coined Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, will also be on Capitol Hill this week, meeting Thursday with Senate and House Republicans.",
      "House Ethics Committee meets to consider Gaetz report",
      "The House Ethics Committee is set to meet Thursday to further consider whether to release the report about its investigation into Gaetz, after the evenly split bipartisan panel failed to reach an agreement in an hourslong meeting last month.",
      "A day later, Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration, further complicating the ethics committee's decision about whether to release the report. Gaetz' resignation from the House after his selection for attorney general had ended the committee's jurisdiction over him, making the release of the report all the more controversial. The Republican committee chairmen said he voted against the release of the report over the jurisdiction issue.",
      "Still, some view the report's release as essential if Gaetz is eyeing other offices, like another post within Trump's administration or running for Florida governor down the road.",
      "The Ethics Committee's investigation first began in 2021, but was put on pause as the Justice Department conducted a sex trafficking and obstruction probe of Gaetz. Last year, the Ethics Committee resumed its work, after prosecutors declined to charge Gaetz, who has denied all wrongdoing.",
      "Senate Democrats hold leadership elections",
      "Senate Democrats, who will be in the minority in the new Congress, are expected to meet Tuesday to elect their leadership for the next two years, after Republicans flipped the chamber in the 2024 elections.",
      "Though the top posts in Democratic leadership are expected to remain unchanged, with Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and whip Dick Durbin seeking to remain in their roles, the no. 3 post is up for grabs as Sen. Debbie Stabenow set to retire.",
      "Stabenow, who is leaving the Senate after more than two decades, chairs the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee. The post has been eyed by Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.",
      "The leadership races come as Senate Democrats are making a final push on their agenda, with a focus on confirming President Biden's remaining nominees to the nation's courts. Democrats are hoping to meet or surpass Trump's 234 judicial confirmations from his first term during the lame-duck session, but have run into resistance from Republicans looking to hold up and drag out the process.",

From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted. Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form. Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently.",
      "The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room \u2013 with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter's cases.",

In trying to break Hunter, they've tried to break me \u2013 and there's no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.",

    "summary": "Democrats and some former Trump officials criticized President-elect Donald Trump's announcement that he wants Kash Patel to be FBI director.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's announcement\u00a0Saturday that he intends to nominate Kash Patel as FBI director sent shockwaves through Washington over the weekend, prompting outrage from Democrats and even some former Trump officials, while some loyalists insisted they believed Patel would be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Patel, a 44-year-old who served in intelligence and defense roles in Trump's first term, is a controversial figure even within Trump's world, and a former U.S. official described him as \"by far the most dangerous pick\" Trump has made.",
      "\"There is no 'there' to him,\" the official told CBS News. \"He'll literally do anything.\"",
      "John Bolton, who served as national security adviser in Trump's first term and was Patel's boss, compared the nomination to Joseph Stalin's secret police chief.",
      "\"Fortunately, the FBI is not\" Stalin's secret police, Bolton said. \"The Senate should reject this nomination 100-0.\"",
      "In response to Bolton's comments, Vice President-elect JD Vance posted on social media that \"John Bolton has been wrong about everything so I guess Kash must be pretty awesome.\"",
      "In addition to objections about Patel at the helm of the FBI, current FBI director Christopher Wray's 10-year term is not due to end until 2027. For Patel to become FBI director, Wray would have to resign or be fired by Trump and Patel would need to be confirmed by the Senate. Republicans are set to hold a 53-47 majority come January, giving incoming Majority Leader John Thune only a few votes to lose.",
      "Trump called Patel \"a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People\" in a post on social media Saturday. And some of his supporters echoed the sentiment, like Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, who said Patel is a \"very strong nominee\" whom he thinks will be approved by the Senate.",
      "\"I got to say, all of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all of the people pulling their hair out, are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a real reformer come into the FBI and clean out the corrupted partisans who sadly have burrowed into senior career positions at the FBI,\" Cruz said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee Republican, said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he \"encouraged President Trump to bring Kash Patel to the table,\" saying Patel \"represents the type of change that we need to see in the FBI.\"",
      "Other Republicans, like Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, took a more cautious approach. Rounds expressed support for Wray, who was nominated by Trump in his first term in 2017.",
      "\"I think the president picked a very good man to be the director of the FBI when he did that in his first term,\" Rounds said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"I don't have any complaints about the way that he's done his job right now.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats were highly critical of the pick. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said on NBC that he will vote no, expressing concern that Patel \"is going to only care about protecting Republicans.\" And Murphy pledged to help his colleagues and the American public \"understand what's happening here.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump told the American public during the campaign that he was going to turn the Department of Justice into a political operation, an arm of the White House, to destroy his political opponents,\" Murphy said. \"Kash Patel's only qualification is because he agrees with Donald Trump that the Department of Justice should serve to punish, lock up, and intimidate Donald Trump's political opponents. And so the cost to the American public is pretty simple\"",
      "In recent weeks, Trump's most controversial selections for top posts in his administration have faced intense scrutiny as they prepare for the Senate confirmation process. And one pick, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, already withdrew his name from consideration facing headwinds in the Senate.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the current majority whip in the upper chamber, urged his Senate colleagues in a statement to reject Trump's pick of Patel, noting that \"we already have a FBI director\" and accusing the president-elect of wanting to \"replace his own appointee with an unqualified loyalist.\"",
      "\"The Senate should reject this unprecedented effort to weaponize the FBI for the campaign of retribution that Donald Trump has promised,\" Durbin said.",

      "Trump announced Boulos as his pick for the advisory position in a post shared to his social media platform Truth Social on Sunday.",
      "\"Massad is an accomplished lawyer and a highly respected leader in the business world, with extensive experience on the International scene,\" Trump wrote. \"He has been a longtime proponent of Republican and Conservative values, an asset to my Campaign, and was instrumental in building tremendous new coalitions with the Arab American Community.\"",
      "His post went on to describe Boulos as \"a dealmaker, and an unwavering supporter of PEACE in the Middle East,\" who \"will be a strong advocate for the United States, and its interests.\"",
      "The selection comes as Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance continue their transition into the White House ahead of January's inauguration. Boulos will likely play a role in how Trump approaches Israel's ongoing war with Hamas in Gaza, which has triggered conflicts with Lebanon and Iran while threatening to spread more widely throughout the region. The Biden White House announced last week that it had helped broker a ceasefire deal between Israel and the Iran-backed group Hezbollah in Lebanon, although both Israel and Hezbollah have accused the other of violating the agreement. Negotiations for a similar deal with Hamas have long been stalled.",
      "Boulos already helped spearhead the Trump campaign's outreach efforts in Arab American communities in the U.S. this year, organizing meetings in Michigan and other states. He is also the second Trump in-law picked to serve in a leadership role in his next administration.",
      "In another Truth Social post shared on Saturday, the president-elect announced Charles Kushner, whose son Jared Kushner is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, was his choice for ambassador to France. Jared Kushner served as a senior adviser to Trump during his first term.",
      "On Truth Social, Trump called Charles Kushner \"a tremendous business leader, philanthropist, & dealmaker, who will be a strong advocate representing our Country & interests.\" Trump pardoned Kushner\u00a0in 2020 after he pleaded guilty years earlier to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations.",

Meanwhile, President Biden tries to secure last-minute diplomatic breakthroughs, Congress tackles unfinished business, and retailers slash prices to launch the holiday shopping season in this final month of 2024.",
      "But we begin this morning with the latest on the Trump transition with senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "WEIJIA JIANG (voice-over): Kash Patel's pending nomination for FBI director embodies president-elect Trump's desire to disrupt federal law enforcement agencies.",
      "KASH PATEL (Former Deputy Assistant to President Trump): I'd shut down the FBI Hoover building on day one and reopening the next day as a museum of the deep state.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Patel rose to prominence during Trump's first term when he helped lead the charge against the DOJ's investigation of Russia meddling in the 2016 election.",
      "DONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States (R) and Current U.S. President-Elect): And Kash Patel is here, one of our real warriors.",
      "(CHEERING)",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: The current FBI director, Christopher Wray, who was appointed by Trump in 2017, has three years left on a 10-year term. He would have to resign or be fired to create an opening.",
      "The FBI says: \"Director Wray's focus remains on the men and women of the FBI, the people we do the work with and the people we do the work for.\"",
      "Trump also announced he has selected son-in-law Jared Kushner's father, Charles Kushner, to serve as the next U.S. ambassador to France. Kushner was pardoned by Trump in 2020 after serving time in prison as part of a two-year sentence on federal criminal charges.",
      "As Trump fills his administration, he's also meeting with world leaders.",
      "JUSTIN TRUDEAU (Canadian Prime Minister): It was \u2013 it was an excellent conversation.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, then posted: \"I look forward to the work we can do together again.\"",
      "But Trump's threat to impose a 25 percent tariff on Canada and Mexico remains, unless, he says, the countries take action to stop migrants and drugs from entering the U.S. border.",
      "(End VT)",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Both North American allies say they are preparing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports.",
      "Now Trump has issued a new threat against a group of nine countries, including Brazil, Russia and China. He says, if they try to shy away from the U.S. dollar on international trade, he would impose a 100 percent tariff on their goods \u2013 Major.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Weijia Jiang in Palm Beach, Florida, thank you.",
      "We turn now to Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who joins us this morning from Houston.",
      "Senator, it's good to see you. Good morning to you.",
      "Let's pick up this thread on tariffs. I remember covering your presidential campaign in 2016, and you were a skeptic of tariffs then. I know the politics around tariffs have changed. President-elect Trump has done that. But have the economics changed?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ (R-Texas): Well, I will tell you, what hasn't changed is \u2013 is the importance of leverage.",
      "And I got to say, you look at the threat of tariffs against Mexico and Canada immediately has produced action. We've seen the president of Mexico stand up and promise that she is going to work hand in hand with the president of the United States, President Trump, to secure the border.",
      "I will tell you, representing Texas, we've seen four years of an invasion at our southern border. Let me ask you, Major, why hasn't Joe Biden done this? Why hasn't Joe Biden actually stood up and used leverage to secure the border?",
      "And the reason is, Joe Biden and the Democrats wanted this invasion to happen. And I got to say, this is a promise that I believe President Trump is going to deliver on and deliver quickly. We are going to secure the border. This is about using leverage to get Mexico and Canada to cooperate.",
      "And I will tell you, Major, I think one of the very first bills we're going to take up in the Senate, vote on, and I hope pass, is my legislation the Justice for Jocelyn Act that is a response to the horrific rape and murder of Jocelyn Nungaray, 12-year-old girl in Houston, Texas, killed by violent criminal illegal aliens released by Joe Biden and the Democrats.",
      "This is a promise the president needs to deliver on, and I think he's going to.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So, when you think about tariffs and president-elect Trump, you don't take them seriously as an economic matter; you take them seriously only as a diplomatic lever?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, look, I think the president was explicit with Mexico and Canada. He said he will impose these tariffs unless they secure the border.",
      "It was explicitly leverage. And, by the way, that is the same way that President Trump negotiated the remain-in-Mexico agreement. If you remember, during his first term, President Trump threatened tariffs against Mexico. And AMLO, then the president of Mexico, he was incredibly scared and concerned. He was scared of Trump, and he ended up signing the remain-in- Mexico agreement, which produced the lowest rate of illegal immigration in 45 years.",
      "It was incredibly successful. What did Joe Biden the Democrats do when they came in? The very first week in office, they ripped up that incredibly successful international agreement. I expect we will once again enter into remain-in-Mexico.",
      "And we are going to see \u2013 I'm going to make a prediction right now. We will see the numbers plummet of illegal immigration coming into this country, not in a year, not in six months, but in January and February, because we will have a president who will vigorously enforce the law.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: On that point. Senator Cruz, you would concede, in the last three or four months, numbers have gone down already, have they not?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: They have ticked down slightly. We have still seen over these four years the highest rate of illegal immigration in our nation's history. Twelve million illegal immigrants have come into this country.",
      "And I got to say, in a state like Texas, you want to see the consequences, this last election was an incredible landslide for President Trump. He won all seven of the swing states. And, in Texas, President Trump won Hispanic voters in Texas. I won Hispanic voters in Texas. I won statewide by a million votes, nine points.",
      "And South Texas, the Rio Grande Valley, has literally spent over 100 years as a bright blue Democrat bastion. This cycle, South Texas flipped Republican. And it is amazing what having 12 million people invade your home can do to change people's voting behavior. I think the president has a mandate to deliver on securing the border, and I look forward to working hand in hand with him to deliver on that promise.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Kash Patel suggested by President Trump as the new leader of the FBI, how enthusiastic are you about that?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Listen, I think Kash Patel is a very strong nominee. I think the entire slate of Cabinet nominees President Trump has put forward is very strong.",
      "I believe every one of these Cabinet nominees is going to be confirmed by the Senate. I think Kash Patel is going to be confirmed by the Senate. You look at his background, he has a serious professional background. He was a prosecutor. He was a public defender. He was a senior intelligence staffer on Capitol Hill. He was a senior intelligence staffer in the White House. He was the chief of staff of the Department of Defense.",
      "He was the deputy director of national intelligence. And I got to say, all of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all of the people pulling their hair out are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a real reformer come into the FBI and clean out the corrupted partisans who sadly have burrowed into senior career positions at the FBI.",
      "The FBI and the Department of Justice are two institutions incredibly important to the rule of law in the United States. I revere both. And one of the most tragic consequences of four years of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is, both the DOJ and the FBI have been politicized and weaponized, and I think Kash Patel is a very strong nominee to take on the partisan corruption in the FBI.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: As you know, Senator, there isn't a vacancy at the top of the FBI. What should become of Christopher Wray, appointed by President Trump?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, I think he'll make a choice. I think either he will resign or President Trump will fire him. But it's no secret to anybody, including Chris Wray, that he is not going to continue to serve as the head of the FBI under Donald Trump.",
      "Listen, if you look at James Comey and Chris Wray, there has never been a period in our nation's history where the FBI has suffered a greater loss of respect, where more Americans doubt the fundamental integrity of the FBI.",
      "And it's because James Comey and Chris Wray presided over allowing the FBI to become a partisan cudgel to be used to target parents at school board meetings, to be used to target people who chose not to take the COVID vaccine, to be used to target President Trump and to target the political opponents of Joe Biden and the White House.",
      "It is tragic. That is not what the FBI is for. That is not what the DOJ is for. And I got to say, Pam Bondi and Kash Patel, I think, together are a very strong slate of nominees to go and restore integrity to both institutions.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How do you place that up against the prosecutions of Bob Menendez, a congressman, a Democrat from Texas, Hunter Biden? Are those political prosecutions as well or not?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, first of all, let's be clear. Bob Menendez was \u2013 was literally caught with gold bars and a stack of cash with his fingerprints taking bribes, and it's why Bob Menendez is not my colleague anymore. At that point, the evidence was overwhelming.",
      "Look, Major, I wrote an entire book entitled \"Justice Corrupted: How the Left Has Weaponized the Legal System.\" And it broke down \u2013 it started, sadly, under Barack Obama, where he began using the federal government to target his political opponents.",
      "The book details how many of those partisans then burrowed in to senior career positions during the Trump administration. They waged war against President Trump during his first term. And now, under Joe Biden, they have been open and brazen, and I think it has done unbelievable damage to the integrity of the Department of Justice and the FBI.",
      "I think Merrick Garland will go down in history as the most partisan attorney general our nation has ever seen. And I got to say, I hear regularly from \u2013 from prosecutors, from FBI agents who are deeply dismayed about the institution they have devoted a lifetime working for, because, listen, I don't want a Republican Department of Justice.",
      "I don't want a Democrat Department of Justice. I want a Department of Justice and an FBI that enforces the law regardless of party. And, sadly, we haven't seen that these last four years.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What can you tell us about the three Americans released by China who are in San Antonio? Have you been in touch with them? And do you have any concerns about the contours of that swap?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, at this stage, we don't know all of the details of the contours of the swap, but I will tell you, I am celebrating the return of three Americans, especially Mark Swidan.",
      "Mark Swidan is a Texan from Houston. His mom, Katherine, is from Luling, Texas. I have talked with Katherine many times. I authored and passed a resolution in the Senate that passed unanimously calling for Mark Swidan's return to America. He spent 12 years unjustly imprisoned in communist China.",
      "I will tell you, I have raised it directly with the foreign minister of China. I have raised it with President Biden. I have raised it with Secretary of State Tony Blinken.",
      "And I will give them credit on this. Tony Blinken, just two weeks ago was the most recent time I spoke with him about Mark Swidan, and the administration has pressed the Chinese government. And Mark Swidan is back home with his mother, who has prayed for him, who has loved \u2013 loved him.",
      "I want to say, Mark, welcome home. Katherine, congratulations. I told you this day would come. This is a time where all Texans and all Americans should be celebrating.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Very quickly, Senator Cruz, because I also know you care about the case of Austin Tice.",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Yes.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you have any sense that the rebel gains in Syria of the recent vintage will have any chance of unlocking Austin Tice's freedom?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: I don't know. I certainly hope and pray. Austin Tice needs to come home. And I hope and pray.",
      "Listen, there's a combination of two things working. One, as Joe Biden is in the process of transitioning out, any \u2013 any outgoing president is looking to try to get some final wins. I would encourage him and I'm sure he is doing everything he can to bring Austin Tice home, to bring the hostages in Gaza home, both the Israelis and the Americans, bring them home in this window.",
      "I also think President Trump coming into office on January 20, the enemies of America, I think, are afraid of President Trump. That is a moment. I hope we have a moment right now that is very much like the end of the Jimmy Carter administration\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: \u2026 right before Ronald Reagan came in. And we saw, on January 20, our hostages in Iran released, I think in significant part because the ayatollah was afraid of Reagan.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes, sir.",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: I hope a similar dynamic is playing out. And if we can see more hostages come home, that would be cause for enormous celebration.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, thank you. Good morning.",
      "We'll be back with Face the Nation in just one moment. Please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "We go now to California Democratic Senator Alex Padilla. He joins us this morning from Porter Ranch, California.",
      "Senator, good to see you.",
      "Let's start with Kash Patel. Your reaction to that nomination or that suggested nomination from president-elect Trump?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA (D-California): Well, good morning. Great to be with you.",
      "And, look, the \u2013 this announcement that Kash Patel is going to be nominated for a high-ranking position at the FBI, very key to the Department of Justice, raises a lot of the same questions that other announcements and other nominations raise.",
      "Are they going to go in there and do the job of \u2013 that the Department of Justice calls for to truly, truly be independent of the president of the United States, or is he going in there to do Trump's bidding? That's the big question here. Is it a genuine, legitimate appointment or a political appointment to politicize the bureau and the Department in Trump's \u2013 in Trump's favor?",
      "That's just the beginning of the questions that we expect to raise in the con \u2013 in the confirmation hearings that will begin in January.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you expect that the current FBI director, who has three years remaining, will just have to resign?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Well, that's going to be a personal decision for Director Wray who, look, the public should remember, was a Trump appointee to begin with.",
      "And so he's got three years left. It's up to him to resign or not. Your prior guest suggested that Trump may very well fire him, which is just par for the course. Anybody who recalls the first Trump administration recalls a whole lot of Cabinet officials being named, being confirmed, and being sold as the greatest thing since sliced bread.",
      "And, as soon as they lose favor with Trump, as soon as they don't do 100 percent of what he's demanding, all of a sudden, you know, they're fired, a lot of times by social media posts. And so who knows what Donald Trump is going to decide to do, whether it's with Director Wray, Kash Patel or any of his other nominees this coming term.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: During the first Trump administration, California fashioned itself the resistance state. Some Democrats in the legislature have already begun to describe that as a cliche and say they don't even know what that means anymore.",
      "What does it mean?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Look, I think there's a lot of reason for concern of the second Trump administration, if the first administration is any indicator.",
      "I think, as the governor, as other legislative leaders and even the congressional delegation have said, if \u2013 if, you know, the federal government will continue to support California in its leadership in so many policy areas, there's a lot of good work to be done there.",
      "But Donald Trump has made it no secret that he has it in for California, whether it's the withholding of disaster funds, I mean, a lot of FEMA dollars that Donald Trump tried to keep from, not the state government of California, but from California families, simply because it's a state that did not vote for him in the presidential election. We're trying to inoculate ourselves from those types of threats.",
      "There's also a lot of good that \u2013 that can be finalized before the end of the Biden administration, whether it's Environmental Protection Agency waivers that will allow California to continue to grow our economy while tackling climate change aggressively, waivers at Health and Human Services that would give California a little bit of flexibility with our Medicare dollars to be able to also treat behavioral health issues, mental health issues of Californians, because when \u2013 we know that treating the whole body is good for both physical and mental health.",
      "We're trying to make sure those waivers\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Where do those \u2013 where \u2013 where\u2026",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: \u2026 are locked in before the end of the Biden administration.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Where do you stand with the Biden administration on that, Senator? Are they going to be responsive?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: They've been very encouraging that the technical work can and should be done before the end of the term.",
      "But we'll know it when there's signatures on the documents that we need. But, again, these are just examples that we want to lock into place before President Trump comes into office, and then can use it either as a threat, as a punishment, or, as Senator Cruz mentioned in the prior segment, simply leverage to get other things he would want out of California.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You know President elect Trump has promised mass deportations. You also know, in California, there is a state law that tells local law enforcement not to participate and cooperate with ICE agents in deportation or identification processes.",
      "The incoming Trump administration border czar, Tom Homan, has said any law enforcement who don't cooperate will be prosecuted under federal law. How is this going to be resolved?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes. Well, I think there's an important distinction here.",
      "No state government, not Texas, not California, not any state in the nation, has a constitutional authority to impose federal immigration law. That is the responsibility of the federal government. Some states like Texas want to push the envelope and try to find a way to assist, but there's no obligation to do so.",
      "And that's what California leaders and municipal leaders throughout the state are saying. You know, we're not going to utilize state and local resources to do the federal government's job for them, number one. I think there's a long history of this being smart public safety policy as well.",
      "California is the most populous state in the nation, the most diverse state in the nation, home to more immigrants than any state in the nation. And the last thing you want to do is have immigrants who are victims of crime afraid to come forward to report that crime. The last thing you want is immigrants who may be witnesses to crime to be afraid to come forward and share any information that they have in the investigation and prosecution of crimes.",
      "That's what we're talking about here. Let the federal government do the federal government's job, but have state and local officials do the state and local officials' job. There doesn't have to be a conflict, unless that's what Trump wants.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The governor has called a special session that will convene this week to set aside money to battle the Trump administration.",
      "Will some of that money also be set aside to protect migrants and undocumented immigrants in California as they seek either legal advice or continued legal financial backing to support their efforts to stay within California and the United States?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes, again, if the first Trump administration is any indicator, we know that there will continue to be a lot of fear in communities and communities that deserve to know what their rights are and what their rights are \u2013 are not.",
      "And so, if it's legal assistance, legal advice, legal support, that's just the California way. We embrace our diversity. Our diversity is what has made our communities thrive and our economy thrive. And so we will assist families against the threats of the Trump administration.",
      "If we wanted to sort of cut to the chase, you know, we're hearing a lot of bombast from Trump and his allies about the biggest deportation operation in our country's history, on the one hand, versus a \u2013 maybe a focus on violent criminals on the other.",
      "Nobody \u2013 nobody disagrees with a focus on violent criminals.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Democrats, Republicans agree. But that's very different\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: \u2026 than millions and millions of people being deported indiscriminately, not just tearing families apart, tearing communities apart\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes, Senator.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: \u2026 but tremendous damage to our economy that that would create.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Alex Padilla, Democrat from California, we thank you for your time this morning.",
      "And we'll be back right away with a lot more Face the Nation. I invite you to please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Be sure to tune in to CBS News on January 20 for full coverage of Donald Trump's inauguration here in Washington, D.C. You can watch live on CBS, on Paramount+, or on our CBS News app.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We will be right back with CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, and author H.W. Brands.",
      "Please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We're joined now by CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger. She's in Southampton, New York, this morning.",
      "Jill, Senator Ted Cruz described tariffs and the threat thereof as leverage. But what I'm curious about economically is, do retailers view it as only leverage, do consumers view it only as leverage, or are they beginning to change their behavior in anticipation?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, let's just talk about whether or not they're going to change their behavior. We know that t here were some retailers who were sort of dangling this out around this holiday weekend, saying, oh, buy now because tariffs could make prices go up. I don't know what the motivation of most people is when they shop, but I'm not sure it's tariffs.",
      "What we do know about tariffs is, remember, this is a fee that is imposed on an imported good. The importing company, the U.S. company that takes that good in has to make a decision in that moment. And that company has to decide, are we going to eat it and maybe make less money this year, or are we going to pass it along to consumers. So, that is why consumers are a little unnerved by this, and businesses are as well, because they're not really sure whether they can pass that along and have consumers pay that additional price.",
      "What we know is, over the long term, in history, tariffs tend to increase the price of certain goods. It's not necessarily across the board. But, you know, it is hard coming off of what we've just come through in the last few years with this inflationary spike to imagine that consumers are just going to take it in stride. It is a real hard thing to imagine that any company or consumer is going to feel like they want to absorb higher prices at this point.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, there was a tariff story in the first Trump administration. Do you foresee a deeper and different tariff story potentially in Trump 2.0?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, I think there's two parts of that question, which is, we don't know what these tariffs are. And as Senator Cruz said, this is a negotiation. So, we don't know whether we're going to land in that negotiation. But a big difference between where we are today and where we were back in 2017 and 2018 is, during the early Trump administration, what we had was incredibly low inflation. That was after the financial crisis. For all those years, inflation or prices only grew by about less than 2 percent a year.",
      "Now, compare that with where we are now. We had inflation spike at a 40- year high of 9 percent in the summer of 2022. Yes, that inflation rate has come down, but prices are still about 22 percent, 23 percent higher than they were just four or five years ago. So, the big difference between the first Trump administration and the second Trump administration is prices are already high, and there are many Americans who are struggling.",
      "So, I think that that is the real fear among economists that I speak to. They're worried that this is going to cause a real anxiety among consumers, and that consumers might pull back at a time where they - actually, the economy's doing pretty well.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Talking about the economy doing well. You crunch a lot of numbers, Jill, and always break them down so easily for our audience. When you look at the data, what's the best news you see and what's the most worrisome sign?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, the best news as - is that the labor market has grown really substantially and has kept up. So, I think that the labor market has been the driver of this economy. And it's been pretty consistent.",
      "The other part of the good news story is that the United States economy, more than any other developed nation, has come out of the Covid era and that post-Covid inflationary spike much stronger in a growth mode. So, we are seeing really good things from the labor market. We're seeing things in the economy. We're seeing that AI and technology is really in a boom period. These are all wonderful things.",
      "So, what's the downside here? I hate to be a kill joy, but why not, I play one on Sunday mornings. And what I can see is that these tariffs could cause a problem for a lot of consumers who are already struggling, and also this idea that we are going to see the extension of the tax cuts from the first Trump administration in the individual tax code. There is a fear among some investors that while we may not have a crisis right now when it comes to the debt and the deficit, that the extension of those tax cuts could start to really unnerve financial markets. Not happened yet, but those are the two worrisome things, the tariffs and the debt and deficit. I think those are the two looming things. And, of course, all the things we can't contemplate right now.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The three stock indexes have gone up pretty regularly since Election Day. Is that a methodical and well thought out reaction to an election or a kind of exuberance that may soon run its course?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Time will tell. I think that the initial investor reaction was a second Trump presidency would mean a drop in the tax rates - or the extension of the tax cuts and those tax rates would basically be in place for another four years. So, we'd have low taxes, which is good for especially the wealthier people out there. They love low taxes. And corporate taxes were already enshrined in the code. OK, so we have taxes staying low. That's a big factor when you come - when it comes to investing.",
      "The second part is the idea that a Trump administration would have a light regulatory touch. So, when you saw that first few trading - those first few trading days after the election, what went up a lot? The most highly regulated industries. So, that could be energy, that could be banking, that could be other areas where you could really need an industrial companies where you need a lot of regulatory prominence in the working of your business. Lighter regulatory touch will mean that those businesses will do well.",
      "OK, so is it exuberance or not? Who knows? I can only tell you that as someone who watches markets all the time, when everybody tells me that the sky is clear and the sun is shining and it's rainbows and unicorns, the only thing I can remember is what my father used to say is, well, no one ever rings a bell at the top or at the bottom. So, if you're an individual investor, don't count on everything being great. There's going to be a market slide. There is going to be a sell-off at some point. Don't count on everything being great all the time. Stick to your game plan and only change that game plan, not when the administration changes, but when your own life changes. That's it.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Breaking it down for us, as always, and beautifully so. Jill Schlesinger, thanks so very much.",
      "And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We' are joined now by President Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. He is in New Castle, New Hampshire, this morning.",
      "Jake, good morning. It's good to see you.",
      "The Hamas video release of Edan Alexander, I know the administration regards it as a cruel propagandistic maneuver, but do you detect anything tactical at all in the timing of the release of this video, Jake?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN (President Biden's National Security Adviser): Well, Major, first, thanks for having me.",
      "And as far as this video, it is a cruel reminder of the barbarity and the brutality of Hamas, holding so many innocent people hostage, including Americans, including Edan. We were in touch with Edan's family yesterday. I'll be talking to the families of all of the American hostages, including Edan's family, this week.",
      "And I do think that Hamas is feeling the pressure. They're feeling the pressure because one of their main partners in crime here, Hezbollah, has now cut a ceasefire deal and they thought that Hezbollah would be with them until the end. They're feeling the pressure, of course, because their top leader, Sinwar, has been killed. So, they may be looking anew at the possibility of getting a ceasefire and hostage deal, and we are working actively with all of the key players in the region, including Israel and Turkey and Qatar and Egypt to try to bring that about.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The fate of the hostages, of course, on the administration's mind, on the minds of all Americans and all in the region. But also, Jake, I'm sure you saw over the last couple of days the video from Gaza of Palestinians surging to try to get a loaf of bread, in some cases crushing one another unintentionally. All suggestions are that the humanitarian situation there is - if it already isn't past crisis stage, near famine crisis stage.",
      "How much does that intensify the need to get this thing across, as you just said, the finish line?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: The humanitarian situation in Gaza is a crisis. You have too many people who are suffering from shortages of food, water, medicine, access to sanitation. Innocent people who deserve a measure of peace and deserve access to all of those life-saving supplies in abundance. The United States has been working, week in, week out, month in, month out, to open crossings, to move trucks, to insure that humanitarian aid gets in. And at critical moments, we have been able to intervene in ways that have staved off the worst case scenarios of famine. But it's constantly stocking (ph) Gaza. And so more needs to be done to get aid in.",
      "Now, part of the problem, as we've seen just in the last 24 hours, is not actually moving aid from outside Gaza into Gaza, but moving it around Gaza once it's inside. The U.N., in fact, said it was suspending movement from certain areas of Gaza because of concerns about looting. These are all things that would be helped if there were a ceasefire in place.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, is the probability of a ceasefire enhanced or undercut when someone such as South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham says, President- elect Trump wants a ceasefire before inauguration deal. Does that help you or hurt you?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, I think the key actor right now holding the decision on the ceasefire is Hamas. And the key thing motivating Hamas is not American politics or the American presidential transition, it's their determination about whether or not it makes sense for them at this point, after Hezbollah has abandoned them, after their leader has been killed, after their military formations have been degraded to finally say yes to a ceasefire and hostage deal. That's going to be the telling thing more than anything that's said back here.",
      "But I will say this, there has been very good coordination between our team and the incoming team on all of the aspects of the crisis in the Middle East. We felt it was important that we be in touch with them, to keep them up to speed on what's happening, because this handoff has got to be smooth. And they, in turn, have reciprocated by being open and transparent and working with us. This is how it should be in a transition. This is what we're going to keep driving for, for every day that we have left in office.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, I want to have a conversation with you about leverage as regards to the Israeli government. I want to play for you something that Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen said on this program a week ago.",
      "Let's listen.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands of Prime Minister Netanyahu, only to be ignored or slapped down entirely. And then President Biden sends more bombs and more money. That is not an effective use of leverage.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Your response?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: First of all, I respect Senator Van Hollen. He knows these issues as well as any person in Washington, and he is passionate about them.",
      "But, of course, we have a different perspective. We have, at various points over the course of this conflict, made asks of the Israelis consistent with our values and our interests. Have we gotten everything we've asked for? No. Have we seen a change in Israeli behavior with respect to the movement of humanitarian assistance, with respect to how they conducted certain military operations, including in places like Rafah? Yes, we have.",
      "And so, we do believe that we've had a constructive engagement with the Israeli government and also been able to make a difference on the ground with respect to the flow of humanitarian aid.",
      "In addition, we worked closely with the Israeli government to bring about a ceasefire in Lebanon. A ceasefire people said wasn't possible until a new administration took office.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, I want to take - turn your attention to Ukraine, where the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to indicate in a recent interview that he could possibly be open to a peace settlement in which Russia retains the territory it has. Ukraine, meaning Kyiv, keeps all the rest, if that is swiftly brought under the umbrella of NATO. Is that the outline or the contours of something you believe the administration believes could be workable?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, Major, I'm sorry to disappoint you. I can't negotiate in public on your program, and I certainly can't negotiate on behalf of President Zelenskyy, who really should speak for himself when it comes to the destiny of his country. The future of Ukraine should be determined at the negotiating table by decisions of the Ukrainians, not imposed from the outside by the United States or anybody else.",
      "I will say, though, that we have been engaging with the Ukrainians over the course of this year on how you marry the support we provided them for use on the battlefield with a diplomatic strategy for the negotiating table.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And some recent decisions in the administration have been criticized by Republicans as setting the situation on fire, meaning ATACMS and anti-personnel mines. Those advocates for Ukraine say those decisions are way too late to change the battle space in any strategically important way. Where do you come down?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Anti-personnel land mines, which are nonpersistent mines that shut off after two weeks so they don't represent a long term threat to civilians, these could be helpful against the particular type of tactics that the Russian infantry is using right now in eastern Ukraine. So, he's sending them.",
      "The ATACMS permission into Russian territory, that was a decision he took after Russia escalated by introducing North Korean troops into this war, a foreign army into this war. So that was a responsible, coordinated step that we took with other allies to respond to that provocation, to that escalation by Russia.",
      "The president has been clear all along, we are going to give Ukraine the tools it needs. We are also going to do what we can to put them in the best possible position on the battlefield so they'll be in the best possible position at the negotiating table, and then this war will ultimately end in diplomacy.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, thanks so much for your time.",
      "And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION.",
      "Please, stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back.",
      "We turn now to author and historian H.W. Brands. He is the Jack S. Blanton senior chair at the University of Texas in Austin. And his latest book is \"America First: Roosevelt vs. Lindbergh in the Shadow of War.\"",
      "He joins us this morning from Austin, Texas.",
      "H.W., it's great to see you.",
      "First of all, what does this America first clash then tell us if anything about today and references to America first?",
      "H.W. BRANDS (Author, \"America Frist: Roosevelt vs. Lindbergh in the Shadow of War\"): The debate that I describe in the book is whether the United States should enter World War II. Between the time Germany started the war in September of 1939 and the United States entered the war in December of 1941, that was the narrow focus of the debate. The larger question and the one that persists today is, what do Americans think their country's role in the world ought to be? Should the United States, must the United States take a leading role in the world? Should the United States concern itself in conflicts among other nations that perhaps don't directly address American interests? This - this was the question then. It's a question we're dealing with again today.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: If you could, sketch out briefly Charles Lindbergh's stature at the time this debate with Franklin Delano Roosevelt was engaged.",
      "H.W. BRANDS: Lindbergh came to the attention of the American public, indeed to the world public, in 1927 when he flew a solo flight for the first time across the Atlantic Ocean. He became this national hero. He became a world celebrity for accomplishing this great technical feat, but it was also a feat of personal daring.",
      "He was a darling of the United States, a darling in other countries. He was decorated by foreign governments. He became an early celebrity in an age when celebrity was first starting to take form. So, that was his position as of 1927.",
      "His celebrity took a different turn in the early 1930s when his and his wife's infant son was kidnapped and murdered in what then was called the crime of the century, which gave rise to the trial of the century. And so, this golden boy, all of a sudden had a dark shadow cast across his life. And so he was, in some ways, this star-crossed hero at that point.",
      "He continued to be influential in aeronautical engineering circles. He knew a lot about aircraft. But in the American mind he was this - he was this great celebrity. And many people were surprised actually that he did take a leading role in the debate over American policy because he was not a political figure, he eschewed politics.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And in that debate with Roosevelt, did Roosevelt and his administration regard Charles Lindbergh as a potential political threat? And if so, how did they deal with it?",
      "H.W. BRANDS: It's a little bit hard to say. Franklin Roosevelt at some point decided that he wanted to run for a third term. This broke a long- standing, informal rule of American politics. And he knew that Republicans were constantly going up to Charles Lindbergh and saying, you could be president. You'd be a great candidate.",
      "Lindbergh's father had been a congressman, but Lindbergh took from his father's experience, which turned out badly because of his opposition to American policy during World War I, that he didn't want to have anything to do with politics or politicians. He considered politicians a bunch of liars, people who could not be trusted and he considered politics this low and sort of mean occupation that he wanted to have nothing to do with.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: When this debate began in 1931, Lindbergh was in one place. When it ended in 1941, he was in a different place in the public mind. Some accused him of being a Nazi sympathizer. Some editorialist described him as an anti-Semite. Where do you come down?",
      "H.W. BRANDS: The one thing I should say is that everybody who calls him an anti-Semite or a Nazi sympathizer, had political reasons for doing so because Lindbergh became the face of opposition to American intervention in the war. And it served his opponents' purposes to paint him in this negative category.",
      "In terms of his Nazi sympathy, he - there were American Nazis. There was an American Nazi party. They were clearly Nazi sympathizers. Lindbergh was not a member of the party. In fact, the America first committee, of which Lindbergh was a part, took pains to keep its distance from those. Lindbergh did not want Germany to win the war. His position was that the United States should not place its frontier of security in the middle of Europe the way Franklin Roosevelt and the interventionists appears to be doing.",
      "But because he took that position - and it was a position the Germans supported. The Germans didn't want the United States to enter the war. There was this objective sense in which one could say that when Lindbergh gave a speech, it served the purposes of the German government.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How about his appraisal of American Jews wanted to push America into the war and then exercising outsized influence culturally in our country?",
      "H.W. BRANDS: So, the charges of anti-Semitism against Lindbergh really are associated with a single speech he gave in the autumn of 1941, in which he identified three groups that in his opinion were most influential in pushing the United States toward war. One was the British government. Britain was already at war, and he explained it was natural that they would try to get the United States involved in the war. The second group he said was American Jews. And he said, it's perfectly understandable that they should want the United States to get into the war given what Hitler and the Nazis have done to their relatives, friends, co-religionists in Europe. And the third group was the Roosevelt administration. He was most critical of the Roosevelt administration because Lindbergh claimed that Roosevelt was using the excuse of the war to further his own political ambitions.",
      "Now, merely for mentioning American Jews in the context of war policy, the sky fell down upon Lindbergh. Everybody who wanted to make sure that they weren't accused of anti-Semitism, everybody who opposed Lindbergh's policy came down and pointed the finger of anti-Semitism at Lindbergh.",
      "To what extent was Lindbergh actually an anti-Semite? Well, I would - I would - I would - I would put him in the category of the sort of not in my country club kind of anti-Semite, which was extremely common in the United States at the time.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Very quickly, H.W., there's a clash over information and disinformation. Both sides warn each other and the American public about that. Unspool that for us, if you could, real quick.",
      "H.W. BRANDS: The British government and the germane government, the two antagonists in the war at that point, were both engaged in propaganda campaigns in the United States. And so, when the British government would plant editorials, features in American newspapers, often unknown to the reading public, then Lindbergh and his side would say, well, look what the British government is doing. When the German government would do something similar, then the Roosevelt administration would say, look at what the German government is doing. So, each side then, the governments of the two sides, they were doing their best to sway American public opinion because they realized that in the end it was American public opinion that had to be persuaded.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: H.W. - foreign interference in American public opinion then and now.",
      "H.W. Brands, it's been a pleasure. Thank you so much.",
      "And we'll be right back.",

    "story": [
      "President Biden will travel to Angola this week, becoming the first sitting president to do so and following through on a yearslong pledge to visit sub-Saharan Africa while in office, as his presidency nears the end.",
      "Mr. Biden's trip marks the first president to visit the region since 2015, and comes as he has long planned to make the trip to discuss economic partnerships and the vision for Africa's first transcontinental open-access rail network, among other issues.",
      "The president, who departs for the trip on Sunday night, had pledged to visit the African continent in 2023 before earlier this year saying he would visit after he was reelected. But the visit was thrown into question when he dropped out of the presidential race, before a trip in October was announced. Mr. Biden then\u00a0postponed that trip\u00a0to oversee the domestic response to Hurricanes Milton and Helene.",
      "This week, the president is set to meet with Angola President Joao Lourenco and deliver remarks. Mr. Biden is expected to discuss infrastructure and economic opportunities with leaders, while highlighting the investments in Angola and Africa more broadly, according to senior administration officials previewing the trip.",
      "The president is expected to announce among a number of things that the U.S. government will have closed 12 deals in Angola by the time he departs the White House, with a combined value of $6.9 billion. He'll also outline a new global health security partnership aimed at responding to infectious diseases, while touting U.S. investments aimed at increasing food access and storage. And the president is expected to support the nomination of Angola's Kwanza Corridor as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the officials said.",
      "During the three-day visit, the president will also tout an infrastructure and rail project with heavy U.S. investment known as the Lobito Corridor, which aims to increase the speed of transport of critical minerals used for electric vehicles and AI data centers, along with drastically speeding up shipment times for food deliveries and helping to alleviate food insecurity in Africa.",
      "The visit comes as China and Russia have made inroads in the region with infrastructure investments, adding to U.S.' urgency surrounding making investments on the continent.",
      "Mr. Biden's trip also comes as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, spurring questions about the longevity of Mr. Biden's achievements. But the Biden administration officials noted that U.S.-Africa policy has enjoyed bipartisan support in recent administrations, and said they expect the next administration to continue building on the policy.",
      "The president also pledged when he took office to mend relationships around the world, after Trump's first term. The White House has touted a deepening relationship with African leaders, including Lourenco, who met with Mr. Biden in the Oval Office last year. In 2022, Mr. Biden hosted the Africa Leaders Summit, and since then, the administration officials said more than 20 Cabinet and other senior leaders have also traveled to the continent.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:59:07 -0500",
    "summary": "Bluesky has added millions of new subscribers in the last month as some users leave X. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "It's unusual for a new social media service to get a foothold in a marketplace entrenched by the likes of X (formerly Twitter), Instagram and TikTok which, dominate people's phones. But Bluesky, a nearly 2-year-old app, is now grabbing attention amid a recent surge of new users, which the company says is likely due to growing frustrations with X.",
      "While the platform has grown since it opened as an invite-only service in February 2023, its membership snowballed following the November 5 presidential election. Bluesky currently has more than 22 million users, up from about 12 million people in mid-October, according to the company's data.",
      "Bluesky believes its recent growth is partly due to changes at X under billionaire owner Elon Musk, according to Bluesky Chief Operating Officer Rose Wang, who recently spoke to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Musk, who bought Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, has overhauled the service, changing its name to X\u00a0and\u00a0prioritizing accounts from people who pay for a blue checkmark \u2014 although accounts with more than 2,500 \"verified subscriber followers\" get access to Premium features for free.",
      "Ad sales almost immediately softened after Musk took over the platform, with companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Disney removing paid ads from X\u00a0last year. Most recently, The Guardian said it would no longer be posting its content under its official account on X. In its announcement, the British newspaper described X as \"toxic,\" adding that the platform has been used by Musk to shape political discourse.",
      "Musk became one of the most viral voices on elections during the 2024 campaign, frequently sharing conspiratorial narratives while promoting President-elect Donald Trump, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "When Twitter became X, \"it was no longer a public town square, and now it's more of a partisan microphone,\" Wang said, adding, \"that is a big reason why we think people are coming over.\"",
      "X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "What is the difference between X and Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky resembles the \"old Twitter\" in terms of layout and content,\u00a0wrote\u00a0PCWorld tech writer Dave Parrack in a recent column. He added, \"Bluesky feels like a safe haven. There's very little trolling, and when it does happen, people aren't biting.\"",
      "Bluesky users can find people to follow through so-called \"starter packs,\" or curated lists of people to follow by interest or fields, such as this group of garden writers. That enables users to quickly build a feed of posts from people that they pick, rather than being fed content by a corporate algorithm, the company says.",
      "Because people can tailor their interests and connect with other like-minded users, there's more interaction on the service than on X, according to Wang.",
      "Some companies are also reporting more engagement with their posts on the Bluesky app versus rival platforms. An executive for The Boston Globe, for instance\u00a0noted\u00a0that the newspaper's posts on Bluesky receive three times the traffic as on Meta's Threads.",
      "\"Thirty percent of users Bluesky are posters versus 1% on Twitter,\" Wang said.",
      "Even so, it's questionable whether Bluesky's jump in new users is making much of a dent in X's consumer base.",
      "The presidential election delivered a surge in traffic to Musk's social media service, according to tracking service Similarweb. It found that more than 46 million U.S. users visited X on November 6, the day after President-elect Donald Trump's win \u2014 more than any day in the prior year. About 115,000 people in the U.S. deactivated their accounts on X that same day, its data shows.",
      "How Bluesky makes money",
      "While Bluesky's user base is growing quickly, the company remains small in terms of its funding and staff, which Wang describes as \"a tiny team of 20\" employees, including herself and CEO Jay Graber. The service was created by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, although the business has been independent since 2021.",
      "In October, the company\u00a0raised $15 million in venture funding, which followed a seed round of $8 million in 2023. Wang noted that Bluesky is focused on figuring out how to sustain its business, which will soon include new revenue streams from subscriptions and financial transactions.",
      "\"We are launching subscriptions at the end of this year,\" Wang noted. \"It'll be custom aesthetics, custom avatar frames, maybe more video uploads.\"",
      "The company is also planning to enable financial transactions between users, such as if a game designer wants to sell his or her products to Bluesky users. The service would take a portion of the payment, Wang noted.",
      "Bluesky doesn't accept advertising, nor has it marketed itself in the wake of Musk's takeover of Twitter, she added.",
      "To be sure, Bluesky may never achieve the size of bigger social media networks, which advertisers flock to in order to reach much larger groups of users. For instance, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, had more than 3 billion daily users across its apps in the most recent quarter, and\u00a0booked almost $40 billion in revenue during that time.",
      "How do you sign up for Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky opened as an invitation-only platform in February 2023, but anyone can now sign up for the service.",
      "User handles on the service are a little bit different than X or other social media networks because they end with the site's domain, .bsky.social. Posts are limited to 300 characters, 20 more than on X. Photos and videos can also uploaded, though videos can't be longer than 60 seconds. GIFs and emojis are available, too.",
      "As with other platforms, you can tag people on Bluesky by typing \"@\" before their username, you can like posts by tapping a heart icon, and use hashtags to highlight a theme. Bluesky has added a\u00a0menu\u00a0to hashtags, so that when users click on one they'll get different options for seeing, or muting, posts on a particular topic.",
      "\"It's more of a community space \u2014 it's more of a Reddit model, where you land in those cosy corners,\" Wang added. \"At the end of the day it's all about the people, and what I encourage people to do is just come to Bluesky, give it a chance and see for yourself what the experience is like.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 23:09:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Canada's Competition Bureau says that an investigation found the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
    "story": [
      "Canada's antitrust watchdog said Thursday it is suing Google over alleged anticompetitive conduct in the tech giant's online advertising business and wants the company to sell off two of its ad tech services and pay a penalty.",
      "The Competition Bureau said that such action is necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
      "The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about non-compliance with the Competition Act.",
      "The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX. It estimates Google holds a market share of 90% in publisher ad servers, 70% in advertiser networks, 60% in demand-side platforms and 50% in ad exchanges.",
      "This dominance, the bureau said, has discouraged competition from rivals, inhibited innovation, inflated advertising costs and reduced publisher revenues.",
      "\"Google has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors, and distorting the competitive process,\" Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition, said in a statement.",
      "Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector.",
      "Dan Taylor, Google's vice president of global ads, said in a statement that the bureau's complaint \"ignores the intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice.\"",
      "The statement added that Google intends to defend itself against the allegation.",
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup, floated in a 23-page document filed this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" He outlined a timeline for a trial on proposed remedies next spring and plans to issue a decision by August 2025.",
      "Mehta also found that Google in 2021 Google paid about $26 billion to Apple and other partners to ensure its search engine would be the default one on internet browsers.",
      "His ruling stemmed from a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit first filed against Google in October 2020 during the first Trump administration.",
      "Google has already said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling, but the tech giant must wait until he finalizes a remedy before doing so. The appeals process could take as long as five years, predicts George Hay, a law professor at Cornell University who was the chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division for most of the 1970s.",
      "And in January 2023, the Justice Department and several states filed a separate lawsuit against Google claiming it has an illegal monopoly over online advertising.",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 08:03:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Australia's full legislature has now passed a bill that will soon ban children under the age of 16 from using most social media platforms.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's Senate passed legislation Wednesday that, once signed by the country's leader who has strongly endorsed it,\u00a0will ban children under the age of 16 from using most social media platforms. The new law will give Australia the tightest restrictions of any democracy in the world on children's use of hugely popular social media apps.",
      "The Senate passed the bill by 34 votes to 19 on Thursday, a day after Australia's House of Representatives\u00a0passed the same bill by a sweeping margin of 102 votes to 13.",
      "Australia's major parties in the House all supported the bill, which will see social media companies such as TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for failing to prevent people under 16 from creating accounts on their platforms.",
      "Tech giant Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, has called for the bill to be delayed. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0posted online Tuesday, Meta said it was \"concerned the government is rushing this legislation without adequate consultation or evidence and there are still many unknowns with respect to its implementation.\"",
      "\"The Government's approach will likely require each app provider to collect personal identification or biometric data from all Australians in order to prevent under 16s from accessing their services, an inefficient and burdensome process for everyone,\" a Meta spokesperson said.",
      "Meta also pointed to a policy it introduced earlier this year on its Instagram platform, Instagram teen accounts, which limits who can contact teenagers via their accounts and attempts to moderate the content that young users see.",
      "In a post shared last week on the X platform that he owns, tech billionaire Elon Musk also condemned the Australian bill and said it seemed to him \"like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\"",
      "Other independent bodies and non-profit organizations have also taken aim at the bill, voicing concern that young people's human rights could be restricted by it.",
      "The CEO of the Save the Children charity Mat Tinkler said in a statement\u00a0earlier this month that while he welcomes government efforts to protect children from harm online, the solution should be regulating social media companies, rather than introducing a blanket ban.",
      "\"We are asking the government to reconsider this legislative approach and instead use the momentum of this moment to hold the social media giants to account, to demand that they embed safety into their platforms rather than adding it as an afterthought, and to work closely with experts and children and young people themselves to make online spaces safer, as opposed to off-limits,\" Tinkler said.",
      "The Australian Human Rights Commission, an independent government body, expressed its own \"serious reservations\" over the proposed law in an analysis published last week.",
      "\"There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights. One example of an alternative response would be to place a legal duty of care on social media companies,\" the analysis said. \"We also need to help children and young people to better navigate online spaces by ensuring the national curriculum includes a specific focus on teaching digital literacy and online safety.\"",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese rejected criticism of the proposed law as he\u00a0addressed the parliament\u00a0Monday.",
      "\"There are common sense exemptions. We want to make sure that young people can continue to access health and education related services \u2014 Headspace, YouTube, Google Classroom \u2014 as well as messaging services and online games,\" he said.",
      "The Australian leader added that there would be \"very strong and strict privacy requirements to protect people's personal information, including an obligation to destroy information provided once age has been verified.\"",
      "Despite the criticism, the legislation remains popular among Australians, according to recent polling data.",
      "A YouGov survey released Tuesday showed 77% of Australians back the ban on under-16s, and 87% of said they supported the introduction of stronger penalties for social media companies that fail to comply with regulations.",

Earlier this year, he praised Trump's response to his first assassination attempt, calling it \"badass.\" Zuckerberg also complained that senior Biden administration officials pressured Facebook to \"censor\" some COVID-19 content during the pandemic.",
      "Still, Trump in recent months had continued to attack Zuckerberg publicly. In July, he posted a message on his own social network Truth Social threatening to send election fraudsters to prison in part by citing a nickname he used for the Meta CEO. \"ZUCKERBUCKS, be careful!\" Trump wrote.",

Mike Parson denied his clemency petition earlier this week and the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his request to hear an appeal, clearing the way for the procedure to go forward.",
      "Christopher Collings, 49, was pronounced dead at 7:10 p.m. Eastern Time at the state prison in Bonne Terre, the Missouri Department of Corrections said in a statement. Missouri uses high doses of a single drug, pentobarbital, to carry out executions by lethal injection. The heavy sedative is typically used to euthanize animals.",
      "Collings was convicted of first-degree murder in the death of Rowan Ford, his friend David Spears' 9-year-old stepdaughter, in a crime that Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey and others have described as \"vile, horrible and inhumane.\"",
      "On the evening of Nov. 2, 2007, Spears was drinking with Collings and another friend, Nathan Mahurin, at his home in Stella, a small village in southwestern Missouri, while the young girl slept and her mother worked an overnight shift at Walmart, court records show. The men relocated at one point to Collings' trailer in a different town, leaving Ford at home on her own.",
      "At the end of the night, when Mahurin drove Spears home, he took back roads to avoid police because he was intoxicated. In the meantime, Collings rushed to Spears' home, abducted Ford and brought her back to his trailer to rape her. Collings later testified he did not originally intend to kill the girl, but panicked when she recognized him. He said he spotted a cord in the bed of a nearby pickup truck and used that to strangle her to death, according to the records. Collings said he then disposed of her body in the cave where she was ultimately found.",
      "Ford knew Collings because he had lived with her and her family at their home for several months that year. The child's mother, Colleen Spears, reported her missing on Nov. 3 when her daughter did not return from school that afternoon. When she could not find Ford that morning, Colleen Spears' husband had told her the girl was at a friend's house. The child's body was eventually discovered after a massive search.",
      "David Spears was implicated in the child's murder alongside Collings, and investigators initially believed the stepfather was responsible for her killing. Court records show inconsistencies in Spears and Collings' respective accounts of the crime, with both men confessing to sexually assaulting and killing her, although Collings denied Spears' involvement.",
      "Spears pleaded guilty to a lesser charge. He served more than seven years in prison before his release in 2015.",

Parson and appeal to the Supreme Court also called into question the credibility of a law enforcement witness central to the prosecution's case against Collings during his trial.",

      "Washington \u2014 A number of Republican senators have expressed concern about Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Defense Department, potentially putting his intended nomination at risk.",
      "Hegseth, who has been meeting with Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill this week to try to build support ahead of his confirmation hearings, has faced a round of negative stories involving allegations of sexual misconduct, financial mismanagement at veterans' charities, repeated intoxication and infidelity.",
      "\"Some of these articles are very disturbing. He obviously has a chance to defend himself here, but some of this stuff is, it's going to be difficult,\" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told reporters Tuesday. \"Time will tell.\"",
      "Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, also said he found the allegations \"disturbing\" but added, \"We all love a good redemption story.\" Cramer suggested Hegseth's alleged behavior stemmed from alcohol abuse, adding that \"almost everything else can come from that one abuse.\"",
      "Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, who noted he has also read the reporting and is aware of the allegations, said Hegseth will have to address them.",
      "\"I want to know if they are true and I want to hear his side of the story and he is going to have to address them,\" he said Tuesday, adding that he wasn't sure if Hegseth's nomination would face headwinds.",
      "On Monday, the New Yorker reported that before he became a full-time Fox News host, Hegseth was forced to step down from two nonprofit advocacy groups \u2014 Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America \u2014 amid complaints about his alleged behavior that included repeatedly being intoxicated while on the job, leading a hostile work environment and mismanaging the charities' funds. CBS News reported that Jessie Jane Duff, a Marine veteran who served as one of Trump's 2024 campaign executive directors, was among those who pushed to have him ousted from Concerned Veterans for America in 2016.",
      "A lawyer for Hegseth has denied the allegations.",
      "Sen. Cynthia Lummis, a Wyoming Republican, said Tuesday that the allegations \"are a surprise to all of us\" and that his ability to be confirmed by the Senate \"depends on how he addresses the issues that have been raised.\" Lummis said the allegations also came as a surprise to Trump.",
      "\"Some of the earlier issues that were raised about an incident in California, I think were satisfactorily addressed and would not have interfered with his nomination, but some new things that have come to light in the last 12 to 14 hours are things he needs to address,\" she said.",
      "Hegseth, an Army veteran turned Fox News star, was investigated for sexual assault\u00a0in 2017 in Monterey, California. Authorities declined to file charges in the case, saying none were \"supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Hegseth told investigators that the sexual encounter with the woman was consensual and he has denied any wrongdoing. He paid a confidential settlement to the woman out of concern that her accusation could result in his firing from Fox News, his lawyer said after the claims became public in mid-November.",
      "But Sen. Tommy Tuberville pushed back on the notion that Trump may have concern about his pick.",
      "\"I talked to him last night,\" the Alabama Republican said Tuesday. \"I don't think there's any concern. Why would there be?\"",
      "Asked Monday whether he thought the Senate would confirm him to lead the Pentagon, Hegseth said he was \"taking it meeting by meeting.\"",
      "Trump has already had one Cabinet pick withdraw from the process. Former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida pulled his name from consideration amid scrutiny over allegations of sex trafficking and illicit drug use, which he denies.",

      "The travel industry is taking notice as well.",
      "\"We see Black Friday, Cyber Monday, now Travel deal Tuesday,\" Schwimmer said. \"We're seeing travel brands across the industry offer deep discounts on this day.\"",

      "Donald Trump's lawyers pointed to an unlikely person in demanding a judge dismiss the president-elect's New York criminal case: Hunter Biden.",
      "Trump's attorneys said in a court filing made public Tuesday that President Joe Biden's controversial pardon of his son echoed Trump's complaints about the prosecution.",
      "\"Yesterday, in issuing a 10-year pardon to Hunter Biden that covers any and all crimes whether charged or uncharged, President Biden asserted that his son was 'selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,' and 'treated differently,'\" they wrote, before claiming Trump was treated similarly.",
      "In the filing, which was submitted Monday night, they formally demanded a New York judge throw out the president-elect's criminal case and nullify a unanimous jury's conclusion that Trump committed dozens of felonies.",
      "Their argument struck at the quality of the case against Trump, but centers largely on a wholly unique argument in the history of America's legal system. Trump's lawyers said his conviction in state court should not stand because he was elected president after his conviction.",
      "Prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg have vowed to oppose the dismissal motion, and have been given a one-week deadline to file their response. They pursued the case amid a torrent of public threats of retribution by Trump's allies, and anonymous threats of violence by his supporters.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued in their filing that the Constitution requires dismissal of the case, even though it's already progressed though trial, because ongoing proceedings threaten to take Trump's attention from the presidency.",
      "\"Wrongly continuing proceedings in this failed lawfare case disrupts President Trump's transition efforts and his preparations to wield the full Article II executive power authorized by the Constitution pursuant to the overwhelming national mandate granted to him by the American people on November 5, 2024,\" wrote his attorneys, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, each of whom are slated to take on high-level positions at the Justice Department after Trump is inaugurated.",
      "Trump's sentencing was recently postponed for a third time. After he was convicted in May, Justice Juan Merchan scheduled sentencing for July 11. In the interim, the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling concluding that former presidents could not be charged for official acts, and evidence related to their official work as president could not be used as evidence against them.",
      "The first sentencing postponement came because Trump's attorneys wanted to file a motion to dismiss based on that Supreme Court ruling. Merchan has yet to rule on that motion.",
      "They then asked for and were granted a postponement of the second sentencing date, Sept. 18, arguing that it was too close to the election.",
      "After Trump won the presidency on Nov. 5, his attorneys quickly indicated they'd make Monday's request. In Trump's filing, his attorneys refer to his election victory as \"overwhelming.\"",
      "Bragg's office has floated postponing sentencing and other proceedings until after Trump's term in office, which ends in 2029.",
      "\"Consideration must be given to various non-dismissal options that may address any concerns raised by the pendency of a post-trial criminal proceeding during the presidency, such as deferral of all remaining criminal proceedings until after the end of defendant's upcoming presidential term,\" they wrote in a Nov. 19 letter to Merchan.",
      "The Manhattan case against Trump set a series of unprecedented firsts. He was the first person in American history to be elected president after being convicted of crimes. When the anonymous jury concluded in May he was guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records, he became the first former president ever convicted of crimes. The case against Trump began when a grand jury in March 2023 made him the first former president ever indicted.",
      "The case revolved around a coverup of a \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star before his first election to office in 2016. While in office, Trump authorized a scheme to conceal reimbursements to a lawyer who made the payment to the actress just days before Trump's first election.",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 16:29:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Levels of both the flu and COVID viruses are still low across much of the country, the CDC says.",
    "story": [
      "This year's winter surge of influenza and COVID-19 has yet to arrive for most of the country, data published this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, with trends so far a fraction of what they were at this time last year.",
      "\"COVID-19 activity remains low and is stable in most areas. Seasonal influenza activity is increasing slightly among children but remains low nationally,\" the CDC said this week, in its weekly report on data about the two viruses.",
      "The agency's updates are usually published every week by Friday, but were delayed until after the weekend because of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "A return to normal for flu?",
      "By this time last year, data tracking outpatient visits to places like emergency rooms and doctor's offices for the flu had already climbed above the agency's baseline for the season. This year's latest report suggests flu cases are only now starting to cross that threshold.",
      "\"We're maybe slightly later than last year, and maybe quite a bit later than the year before, but those years were unusually early,\" said University of North Carolina epidemiology professor Justin Lessler, a top expert in the CDC-backed network of disease forecasters.",
      "Lessler said this year's figures look \"much closer to about where you'd expect a normal flu season to be\" before the COVID-19 pandemic, when measures to curb the outbreak scrambled seasonal patterns of flu and other respiratory germs.",
      "Compared with last year, rates of weekly flu hospitalizations are around five times lower. Emergency room visits with flu from school-age kids have accelerated, the CDC's data shows, but remain less than a third of what they were at this time last year.",
      "One big factor that could be affecting the figures this year is immunity in the population from the last two waves of influenza, alongside vaccination.",
      "\"We have had two fairly substantial seasons, which could be driving this delay. Of course the question is, does that mean we're having a delay, or a milder season. That's really kind of uncertain at this point,\" said epidemiologist Shaun Truelove, associate scientist at Johns Hopkins University's public health school.",
      "Modeling of this year's flu season gathered from different experts make different assumptions about what the country's flu immunity looks like, as they try to play out different scenarios of how this year's flu season might look like.",
      "Truelove, who also helps lead the CDC-funded disease forecasting network, also thinks that this year could mark a \"return to normal\" for flu.",
      "\"That being said, flu is never consistent. We get early seasons and late seasons. So it's hard to say exactly what that means, and everything's a bit weird post-pandemic, in terms of scale and timing,\" said Truelove.",
      "Watching for another COVID-19 wave",
      "Several COVID-19 trends that the CDC tracks also remain below what was recorded at this time in 2023. This is a contrast with previous summer waves of the virus, which have only dipped slightly into the fall before picking up again during the winter.",
      "COVID-19 emergency room visits are \"low\" or \"minimal\" in nearly all states, after this year's late summer wave of the virus. Levels of the virus in wastewater are \"minimal\" in all regions, compared to \"high\" levels around this time last year.",
      "\"Does that mean that there was enough immunity built up in that summer wave that we're going to not see a winter wave? Does it mean the winter wave is going to come, but be a little bit later and maybe a little smaller,\" said Lessler.",
      "Both Truelove and Lessler said one major \"data gap\" making comparisons to previous seasons challenging has been the lapse in nationwide COVID-19 hospitalization data during the summer surge.",
      "A pandemic-era emergency requirement for health care providers to report COVID-19 hospitalizations lapsed earlier this year, and only recently resumed under a new rule issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Other factors muddying the figures include changes to how people test and seek care for COVID-19 infections.",
      "Another big unknown is the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Most circulating variants right now are a medley of closely related variants like XEC and KP.3.1.1.",
      "\"We don't know, like we do for flu, what the average pace of COVID's evolution away from our immune system will be, when it settles down,\" Lessler said.",
      "Early data released last month by researchers at The Ohio State University found XEC looked to be more infectious compared with the parent variant it shares upstream with KP.3.1.1, but not significantly more than its siblings.",
      "\"I actually have thought it had settled down a bit, after this year. We'll see what I think after the season's done. But right now, I'm a little less sure,\" he said.",
      "Other respiratory germs on the rise",

The new administration could review and respond to the comments and issue a final rule, or withdraw it entirely.",
      "Still, even if the proposal is not enacted, subminimum pay for those with disabilities could become a thing of the past, as more than a dozen states and the District of Columbia have already banned the program.

    "summary": "The gang and racketeering case involving rapper Young Thug ended as his co-defendants were acquitted of murder charges.",
    "story": [
      "The gang and racketeering case in Atlanta that previously involved the rap music star Young Thug ended on Tuesday, when a jury found the last two defendants not guilty of murder and gang-related charges in the culmination of Georgia's longest criminal trial.",
      "Deamonte Kendrick, who raps as Yak Gotti, was acquitted of all charges. Shannon Stillwell was found guilty only of a gun possession charge.",
      "The verdicts came nearly two years after jury selection began and a year after opening statements in a trial plagued with problems.",
      "Kendrick appeared in court this week despite having been stabbed and injured Sunday in jail, his attorney Doug Weinstein confirmed. Weinstein said in a social media post that he expected Kendrick, who \"sounded tired\" when they spoke in the wake of the incident, \"to make a full recovery.\" The stabbing occurred almost a year after Stillwell was also stabbed inside the jail, CBS News affiliate WANF reported.",
      "The original, sweeping indictment charged 28 people with conspiring to violate Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and used song lyrics and social media posts as evidence. Young Thug, a Grammy-winning artist whose real name is Jeffery Williams, was set free on probation after he\u00a0pleaded guilty in October to gang, drug and gun charges when negotiations with prosecutors broke down.",
      "Kendrick and Stillwell has been charged in the 2015 killing of Donovan Thomas Jr., also known as \"Big Nut,\" who prosecutors say was in a rival gang. Stillwell was also charged in the 2022 death of Shymel Drinks, who prosecutors say was killed in retaliation for the killings days earlier of two associates in a gang known as YSL, which they say was co-founded by Young Thug.",
      "Thomas was killed in a drive-by shooting outside an Atlanta barbershop. In the other killing, prosecutors alleged Stillwell pulled up next to Drinks and shot three rounds into his car.",
      "Stillwell was sentenced to the 10-year maximum for possessing a firearm as a convicted felon previously convicted of a felony involving a gun, with credit for the two years he already served and the balance to be served on probation.",
      "While a total of four defendants pleaded guilty before the end of the trial, the verdict for the final two was a major setback for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Critics had criticized her use of the state's anti-racketeering law, which she also used to bring charges against President-elect Donald Trump for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "\"We always respect the verdict of a jury,\" said Jeff DiSantis, a spokesman for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.",
      "Defense attorneys criticized the state for relying on song lyrics, saying they were among the faulty evidence prosecutors slapped together along with cherry-picked social media posts and unreliable witness testimony to create a misleading narrative about young men who turned to music to escape economic hardship and difficult pasts.",
      "Prosecutors say Williams and two others in 2012 founded Young Slime Life, which they said was associated with the national Bloods gang. The 33-year-old artist also has a record label called Young Stoner Life. Kendrick is featured on two of the most popular songs from the label's compilation album Slime Language 2, \"Take It to Trial\" and \"Slatty,\" as well as Young Thug's \"Slime Sh-t,\" which prosecutors presented as evidence at trial.",
      "Williams entered a risky \"blind\" plea \u2014 meaning he pleaded guilty without an agreement on his sentence \u2014 in October. Judge Paige Reese Whitaker let him out of jail on probation with tight restrictions, including a 10-year ban from metro Atlanta except for certain occasions.",
      "The trial has been fraught with problems and delays and shook the rap scene in Atlanta, where Williams grew up in a housing project ridden with violence.",
      "While defendants did commit crimes in the past, defense attorney Max Schardt said it was to make money for themselves in communities stripped of economic opportunity \u2014 not to advance a gang. And music let some of them move on.",
      "\"As a whole, we know the struggles that these communities have had,\" Schardt said. \"A sad, tacit acceptance that it's either rap, prison or death.\"",
      "Schardt sought to cast doubts on gang investigators and YSL associates the state brought in as witnesses. Several alleged YSL members testified they had lied to police to stay out of prison, and Schardt said officers had threatened them with long prison sentences if they didn't say the right thing. He suggested one of those witnesses could have killed Thomas.",
      "Jury selection for the trial took nearly 10 months. Nine people charged in the indictment accepted plea deals before the trial began. Charges against 12 others remain pending. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case.",

On top of that, some beneficiaries may see their annual cost-of-living adjustment kick in this month, earlier than the typical starting month of January.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 00:06:00 -0500",
    "summary": "South Korea's main opposition party on Wednesday urged South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol to resign immediately or face impeachment.",
    "story": [
      "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's government early Wednesday lifted the martial law he imposed during a tense night of political drama in which troops surrounded parliament and lawmakers voted to reject military rule.",
      "Yoon said his government withdrew military personnel following a bipartisan parliamentary vote that rejected martial law, and the measure was formally lifted around 4:30 a.m. during a Cabinet meeting. In all, martial law was in effect for about six hours.",
      "South Korea's main opposition party on Wednesday urged Yoon to resign immediately or face impeachment. Yoon has not publicly responded to the opposition's demand. But his office said senior presidential advisers and secretaries for Yoon offered to resign collectively and the president also put off his official Wednesday morning schedule.",
      "In the capital, tourists and residents walked around, traffic and construction were heard, and other than crowds of police holding shields, it seemed like a normal sunny, cold December morning.",
      "The liberal opposition Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the 300-seat parliament, said Wednesday that its lawmakers decided to call on Yoon to quit immediately or they would take steps to impeach him.",
      "\"President Yoon Suk Yeol's martial law declaration was a clear violation of the constitution. It didn't abide by any requirements to declare it,\" the Democratic Party said in a statement. \"His martial law declaration was originally invalid and a grave violation of the constitution. It was a grave act of rebellion and provides perfect grounds for his impeachment.\"",
      "Impeaching him would require support from two-thirds of the parliament, or 200 of its 300 members. The Democratic Party and other small opposition parties together have 192 seats.",
      "Why was martial law declared in South Korea?",
      "Late Tuesday, Yoon imposed martial law out of frustration with the opposition, vowing to eliminate \"anti-state\" forces as he struggles against opponents who control the country's parliament and who he accuses of sympathizing with communist North Korea.",
      "Yoon said during a televised speech that martial law would help \"rebuild and protect\" the country from \"falling into the depths of national ruin.\" He said he would \"eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.\"",
      "\"I will eliminate anti-state forces as quickly as possible and normalize the country,\" he said, while asking the people to believe in him and tolerate \"some inconveniences.\"",
      "Under South Korea's constitution, the president can declare martial law during \"wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states\" that require the use of military force to maintain peace and order. It was questionable whether South Korea is currently in such a state.",
      "When martial law is declared, \"special measures\" can be employed to restrict the freedom of press, freedom of assembly and other rights, as well as the power of courts.",
      "The constitution also states that the president must oblige when the National Assembly demands the lifting of martial law with a majority vote.",
      "Hours later, parliament voted to lift the declaration, with National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik declaring that lawmakers \"will protect democracy with the people.\" The resolution was passed with 190 of 300 members of the ruling and opposition parties in attendance, with all present in favor, the BBC\u00a0reported.",
      "Police and military personnel were seen leaving the Assembly's grounds after Woo called for their withdrawal. Lee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal Democratic Party, which holds the majority in the 300-seat parliament, said the party's lawmakers would remain in the Assembly's main hall until Yoon formally lifted his order.",
      "\"Democratic Party lawmakers, including me and many others, will protect our country's democracy and future and public safety, lives and properties, with our own lives,\" Lee told reporters.",
      "While announcing his plan to lift martial law, Yoon continued to criticize parliament's attempts to impeach key government officials and senior prosecutors. He said lawmakers had engaged in \"unscrupulous acts of legislative and budgetary manipulation that are paralyzing the functions of the state.\"",
      "Seemingly hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Assembly, waving banners and calling for Yoon's impeachment. Some protesters scuffled with troops ahead of the lawmakers' vote, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or major property damage. At least one window was broken as troops attempted to enter the Assembly building. One woman tried unsuccessfully to pull a rifle away from one of the soldiers, while shouting \"Aren't you embarrassed!\"",
      "The president's surprising move harkened back to an era of authoritarian leaders that the country has not seen since the 1980s, and it was immediately denounced by the opposition and the leader of Yoon's own conservative party.",
      "Following Yoon's announcement, South Korea's military proclaimed that parliament and other political gatherings that could cause \"social confusion\" would be suspended, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.",
      "The military also said that the country's striking doctors should return to work within 48 hours, Yonhap said. Thousands of doctors have been striking for months over government plans to expand the number of students at medical schools. The military said anyone who violates the decree could be arrested without a warrant.",
      "Soon after the declaration, the National Assembly speaker called in an emergency statement released on his YouTube channel for all lawmakers to gather at the National Assembly, where the opposition Democratic Party holds a majority. He urged military and law enforcement personnel to \"remain calm and hold their positions.\"",
      "All 190 lawmakers who participated in the vote supported the lifting of martial law. Television footage showed soldiers who had been stationed at parliament leaving the site after the vote.",
      "Hours earlier, TV footage showed police officers blocking the entrance of the National Assembly and helmeted soldiers carrying rifles in front of the building to restrict entrance to the building. Dozens of police patrol cars and riot police buses were assembled, the BBC reported.",
      "\"Open the gate, please. Your job is to protect the National Assembly. Why are you standing idly by while MPs are being trampled?\" a middle-aged man shouted at a group of policemen guarding the gate.",
      "An Associated Press photographer saw at least three helicopters, likely from the military, that landed inside the Assembly grounds, while two or three helicopters circled above the site.",
      "The leader of Yoon's conservative People Power Party, Han Dong-hoon, called the decision to impose martial law \"wrong\" and vowed to \"stop it with the people.\" Lee, the opposition leader who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, called Yoon's announcement \"illegal and unconstitutional.\"",
      "A White House National Security Council spokesperson told CBS News the Biden administration wasn't notified of the martial law declaration in advance but it was in contact with the South Korean government and \"is monitoring the situation closely.\"",
      "\"We are seriously concerned by the developments we are seeing on the ground in the ROK,\" the spokesperson said, referring to South Korea by its official name, the Republic of Korea.",
      "A White House official told CBS News that President Biden, who is traveling in Angola, has been briefed on the situation.",
      "Washington stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea to protect it from North Korea, its nuclear-armed neighbor. Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said there was no effect on the U.S. service members based in South Korea.",
      "\"We are watching the recent developments in the ROK with grave concern,\" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said. \"We have every hope and expectation that any political disputes will be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law.\"",
      "Yoon \u2014 whose approval rating has dipped in recent months \u2014 has struggled to push his agenda against an opposition-controlled parliament since taking office in 2022.",
      "Yoon's party has been locked in an impasse with the liberal opposition over next year's budget bill. The opposition has also attempted to pass motions to impeach three top prosecutors, including the chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, in what the conservatives have called a vendetta against their criminal investigations of Lee, who has been seen as the favorite for the next presidential election in 2027 in opinion polls.",
      "Yoon has also dismissed calls for independent investigations into scandals involving his wife and top officials, drawing quick, strong rebukes from his political rivals. The Democratic Party reportedly called an emergency meeting of its lawmakers following Yoon's announcement.",
      "Yoon's move is the first declaration of martial law since the country's democratization in 1987. The country's last previous martial law was in October 1979.",

      "A Chinese national living in California has been arrested and charged by federal law enforcement after he allegedly bought and exported guns and ammunition to North Korea at the direction of North Korean agents who funneled him $2 million to purchase the equipment, according to a newly unsealed criminal complaint.",
      "Shenghua Wen, 41, also admitted to trying to obtain military uniforms in an apparent attempt to help North Korean soldiers disguise themselves and conduct a \"surprise attack\" against South Korea, prosecutors said in an affidavit accompanying the complaint, which was filed on Nov. 26.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Wen came to the U.S. on a student visa in 2012 and lives in Ontario, California. During a series of interviews earlier this year, he allegedly told investigators that he met with North Korean officials in China before coming to the U.S., and they directed him to procure firearms, ammunition and technology on behalf of Pyongyang.",
      "Wen told the FBI he was \"good at smuggling,\" court records said, and he allegedly admitted he shipped two containers of guns in 2023 from Long Beach, California, to Hong Kong, where they were then smuggled into North Korea.",
      "Wen is charged with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on North Korea, which make it illegal to send American money or goods to the country without permission. An attorney for Wen could not immediately be identified.",
      "The affidavit filed in federal court in California revealed that FBI agents recovered 50,000 rounds of ammunition from Wen's car, and he allegedly admitted to having bought the ammo at the direction of North Korean officials. Law enforcement also seized a device used to detect chemical threats and a tool that can detect hidden surveillance devices, according to the affidavit. Investigators said they found photos of firearms and equipment that Wen sent in messages with co-conspirators, some of which they included in the affidavit.",
      "The criminal complaint did not detail the complete extent to which Wen allegedly worked on behalf of North Korea's government, but prosecutors wrote he communicated with his handlers via encrypted messaging apps where the officials directed his conduct and coordinated the smuggling operations.",
      "Wen allegedly bought some of the weapons he sent to North Korea via third-party straw purchasers and told investigators he drove on numerous occasions to Texas to obtain the firearms. To fund the allegedly illegal purchases and international shipments, Wen told authorities the North Korean government funneled about $2 million through a Chinese Bank into bank accounts belonging to Wen's partner, the criminal complaint said.",
      "\"During the interview on September 6, 2024, [Wen] explained that he believed the North Korean government wanted the weapons, ammunition, and other military-related equipment to prepare for an attack against South Korea,\" prosecutors wrote, adding his cellphone also contained numerous photos of U.S. military uniforms, pointing to his intent to ship the uniforms overseas.",
      "The Justice Department has charged other individuals living in the U.S. with similar conduct tied to the North Korean government. In May, federal prosecutors accused an Arizona woman of carrying out a scheme to help North Korean IT workers illegally obtain remote employment with American companies. The group allegedly used the identities of more than 60 individuals who lived in the U.S. to generate nearly $7 million for the North Korean government from more than 300 U.S. companies.",

The increasingly fragile truce aimed to end more than a year of war between Hezbollah and Israel \u2014 part of a wider regional conflict sparked by the devastating Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.",
      "In a possible sign of the ceasefire's frailty \u2014 and a clear warning of the implications for Lebanon of it failing \u2014 Israeli Defense Minister Israeli Katz was cited by the country's Army Radio network on Tuesday as warning that if the truce \"collapses, we will act strongly and stop separating Hezbollah from the state of Lebanon.\"",

      "Israel's military carried out a string of airstrikes late Monday against what it said were Hezbollah fighters, infrastructure and rocket launchers across Lebanon. The strikes were a response to Hezbollah firing two projectiles toward Mount Dov \u2014 a disputed Israeli-held territory known as Shebaa Farms in Lebanon where the borders of Lebanon, Syria, and Israel meet. Israel said the projectiles fell in open areas and no injuries were reported.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump said late Monday that he will travel to Paris for the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral, a grand celebration set to take place this weekend.",
      "\"It is an honor to announce that I will be traveling to Paris, France, on Saturday to attend the re-opening of the Magnificent and Historic Notre Dame Cathedral, which has been fully restored after a devastating fire five years ago,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \"President Emmanuel Macron has done a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!\"",
      "Notre Dame was damaged in a fire that raged for 12 hours on April 15, 2019, nearly destroying the iconic 1,200-year-old church. Although experts said at the time that the restoration could take up to 40 years, Macron vowed to rebuild in five years.",
      "\"The decision to rebuild Notre Dame was about our capacity to save, restore, sometimes reinvent what we are by preserving where we come from,\" Macron told 60 Minutes. \"This is a message of achievement.\"",
      "Paris has been preparing for the reopening of the cathedral, which will be marked by days of celebration starting on Saturday. Laurent Ulrich, the Archbishop of Paris, along with Macron, will preside over Saturday's service, which will be broadcast on French television. Nearly 170 bishops from France and around the world are expected to participate in the celebration, along with one priest from each of the 106 parishes in the Diocese of Paris, and one priest from each of the seven Eastern Catholic Churches, accompanied by Catholics from these communities, according to Notre Dame's website.",
      "The inaugural mass, with the consecration of the high altar, will be on Sunday.",
      "Trump was in the White House for his first term when the fire occurred, and tweeted at the time that it was \"So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.\"",
      "Macron, who has led France since 2017, was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Trump for winning the 2024 presidential election \u2014 posting on social media before Trump was projected the winner.

The pot itself was likely made at a pottery kiln in the region, the museum said.

      "\"It's the most miraculous thing I've seen over the last 100 years,\" he said. \"It's an important piece of archaeology. It tells us about what was happening here 2000 years ago, when the Malvern hills were maybe the boundary of the Roman Empire.\"",
      "This is the third hoard of coins to be found in the area in the past 25 years, according to the BBC. In 2011, two metal detectorists found a clay pot full of 3,784 coins, the BBC said, and in 1999, 434 silver coins and 38 pottery fragments were discovered.",

    "title": "Why is Trump threatening a 100% tariff on the BRICS nations?",
    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:41:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump said the U.S. would hit Brazil, Russia and six other countries with a crushing tariff if they sought to challenge the dollar.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 30 threatened to slap a 100% tariff on a group of nine nations \u2014 the so-called BRICS \u2014 if they try to replace the U.S. dollar with another currency.",
      "The BRICS countries include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Trump said he'll enact the tariffs if the countries either move to create a new rival currency to the dollar or back an alternative currency to replace the greenback as the world's reserve medium of exchange.",
      "\"We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Trump's move comes after he recently\u00a0threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all products from Canada and Mexico entering the U.S., along with an additional 10% tax on goods from China, in what he says would force the countries to do more to halt the flow of unauthorized migrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.",
      "Why do BRICS countries want an alternative currency?",
      "The BRICS \u2014 named after the original five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) \u2014 was formed in 2009 to advance the interests of emerging economies and to make them less dependent on the U.S. dollar, which is by far the most commonly used currency in global commerce.",
      "The primacy of the dollar in international trade gives the U.S. a number of advantages, including lower borrowing costs for the federal government and enormous geopolitical influence around the world.",
      "In October, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a new\u00a0 international payments system at a BRICS summit, saying \"the dollar is being used as a weapon,\" the Associated Press reported. In 2023, meanwhile, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva proposed creating a new, common currency in South America to reduce its reliance on the dollar in international trade.",
      "Would a BRICS currency threaten the dollar?",
      "Creating a competing new currency would be difficult given how widely used the dollar is to conduct business around the world. Despite the existence of the euro and growing importance of China's renminbi, the dollar remains the world's main reserve currency, representing roughly 58% of the world's foreign exchange reserves, according to the\u00a0IMF. Also, critical commodities like oil and gold are still mostly bought and sold using dollars.",
      "\"Economically, it's not a major issue because the idea of the BRICS countries being able to put together an alternative as a reserve currency for the U.S. dollar is not plausible in the short or intermediate term,\" said Mark Weinstock, a global trade expert and professor of economics at Pace University.",
      "In other words, BRICS nations would struggle to create a viable currency given the relative strength and stability of the U.S. economy and the faith that global investors and trading partners have in U.S. government debt. And while the group's members have some interests in common, unifying behind a single currency would be politically fraught and technically complex.",
      "\"Fundamentally, if you are going to create your own form of money, that desirability is commensurate with the economic strength and integrity of the issuer. BRICS countries don't have the type of institutions that inspire global confidence to convince people that it is a satisfactory alternative to the dollar,\" Weinstock said.",
      "Some BRICS members are already downplaying the push to get a new currency off the ground. After Trump's tariff threat last weekend, South Africa's government on Monday issued a statement on social media saying there are no plans to create a BRICS currency.",
      "\"Recent misreporting has led to the incorrect narrative that BRICS is planning to create a new currency,\" South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation said. \"This is not the case. The discussions within BRICS focus on trading among member countries using their own national currencies.\"",
      "What would stiff tariffs on BRICS goods mean for U.S. consumers?",
      "While economists largely agree that a 100% tariff on goods imported to the U.S. from BRICS nations is a long shot, if it came to pass the move would not benefit U.S. consumers, they say. Such levies would drive up the cost of goods from BRICS member nations, potentially fueling inflation and leading to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Like any tariffs, this would mean higher prices for consumers,\" Weinstock said. \"That's always the impact of the tariff.\"",
      "Among the leading products the U.S. gets from BRICS countries are coffee from Brazil, electronics and clothes from China, and minerals from South Africa, according to trade data.",
      "Why are some economists criticizing Trump for threatening the BRICS?",
      "Some experts criticized Trump's threat to punish the BRICS, saying it makes the U.S. look weak.",
      "\"It isn't a good look, as it indirectly elevates the stature of a non-threat and suggests a lack of confidence in the dollar,\" Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former Treasury Department economist,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Trump's threat could actually accelerate a move away from the dollar by other countries, according to Setser, who said that an effort to effectively coerce countries to use the dollar \"is actually a long-run threat to the dollar's global role.\"",
      "\"It makes the use of the dollar appear to be a favor to the U.S.,\" he added.",

    "summary": "Syria's civil war has taken a dramatic turn, with dictator Bashar Assad once again leaning on Russian support after a shock offensive by Islamist rebels in Aleppo.",
    "story": [
      "The Syrian military and its ally Russia conducted deadly joint air raids Monday on areas that Islamist-led rebels seized control of over the weekend. The strikes were a response to a lightning offensive by the rebels that saw them wrest control of swathes of northwest Syria from government forces.",
      "The conflict that started more than a decade ago took a significant turn several days ago, catching many \u2014 including, it seems, Syrian dictator Bashar Assad and his Russian backers \u2014 by surprise. On Saturday, rebels, including many with the U.S.-designated Islamic terrorist group Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), took control of the major city of Aleppo in northern Syria.",
      "The rebels seized Aleppo's airport and started pushing into towns and villages in the countryside around the city on Sunday after leaving piles of dead government soldiers in the streets. Observers said the rebel forces were often met with little to no resistance by regime forces, but by Monday the pace of the surprise offensive appeared to have slowed, with Assad and his Russian backers ramping-up their response.",
      "Syrian rebels' surprise offensive",
      "Syria's civil war began in 2011 after civilians led pro-democracy protests against Assad, and his government responded by opening fire on its own people. The ensuing war is thought to have killed around 500,000 people but, for the last several years, it had simmered as a stalemate. Government forces have controlled the west and south of the country, American-backed rebels have dominated the northeast, and Islamist rebel factions \u2014 including the ones now in control of Aleppo \u2014 have held most of the northwest.",
      "\"We are coming Damascus,\" the rebels chanted Sunday, threatening to push on next toward Syria's national capital and the Assad government's stronghold.",
      "The balance in the stalemate started changing last week, when the Islamist-led rebel alliance in the northwest launched its offensive. Over the weekend, HTS and allied factions took control of Aleppo city for the first time since the civil war started more than a decade ago, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitoring group's director Rami Abdel Rahman.",
      "Aleppo, an ancient city dominated by its landmark citadel, is home to two million people. It was the scene of fierce battles earlier in the conflict but, until Sunday, the rebels had never managed to totally seize it. Video showed rebels in military fatigues patrolling the streets of Aleppo, with some setting fire to a Syrian flag and others holding up the green, red, black and white flag of the revolution.",
      "While the streets appeared mostly empty, some residents came out to cheer the advancing rebel fighters. HTS is an alliance led by al Qaeda's former Syria branch. It's fighting alongside allied factions, with units taking orders from a joint command.",
      "Aron Lund of the Century International think tank said: \"Aleppo seems to be lost for the regime.\"",
      "He added: \"And a government without Aleppo is not really a functional government of Syria.\"",
      "The United States and its allies France, Germany and Britain called Sunday for \"de-escalation\" in Syria, and for the protection of civilians and infrastructure. The U.S. maintains hundreds of troops in northeast Syria as part of an anti-jihadist coalition, and it has also continued carrying out strikes against Islamist groups in the country.",
      "Russia and Iran vow to help Syria's Assad",
      "Assad's reaction to the surprise offensive was still building on Monday with the joint airstrikes carried out by his air force and his Russian allies, and expanded ground operations aimed at retaking towns and villages north of Aleppo said to be underway.",
      "Syrian-Russian air raids hammered several areas of both Aleppo and the neighboring Idlib provinces, killing at least 49 people, including 17 civilians, according to the Observatory.",
      "\"The strikes targeted... displaced families living on the edge of a displacement camp,\" said Hussein Ahmed Khudur, a 45-year-old teacher who sought refuge at a camp in Idlib after fleeing fighting in Aleppo province. He said one of the five people killed in one strike was a student of his, and the other four were his four sisters.",
      "Russia, which first intervened directly in the Syrian war in 2015, said Monday that it continued to support Assad.",
      "\"We of course continue to support Bashar al-Assad and we continue contacts at the appropriate levels, we are analyzing the situation,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists.",
      "Iran's top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, was in Syria on Sunday to deliver a message of support, state media said.",
      "On Monday, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei said the Islamic republic had entered Syria at the official invitation of Assad's government.",
      "\"Our military advisers were present in Syria, and they are still present. The presence of advisers from the Islamic Republic of Iran in Syria is not a new thing,\" he said.",
      "Same Syrian civil war, but very different times",
      "While the fighting is rooted in a war that began more than a decade ago, much has changed since then. Millions of Syrians have become displaced, with around 5.5 million living in neighboring countries.",
      "Most of those involved in the initial anti-Assad protests are either dead, living in exile or in jail.",
      "Russia, meanwhile, is nearing the third year of its incredibly costly full-scale war on Ukraine, and Iran's militant allies Hezbollah and Hamas have been massively weakened by more than a year of conflict with Israel.",
      "On Monday, Iran's foreign ministry said it would maintain its military support for the Syrian government.",
      "But the role of Lebanon's Hezbollah, which played a key role in backing the government particularly around Aleppo, remains in question particularly after it withdrew from several of its positions to focus on fighting Israel.",
      "HTS and its allies began their offensive Wednesday, just as a ceasefire took effect in Lebanon after more than a year of war between Hezbollah and Israel.",
      "The recent violence in Syria has killed some 244 rebels and 141 Syrian regime and allied fighters, along with at least 24 civilians, according to the Observatory, which has a network of sources inside Syria. The Observatory said rebel advances met little resistance.",

Police released photos and video of the operation, showing the cabin of the fishing boat loaded with huge packages of the alleged drugs.",
      "The smugglers made two attempts to transport the drugs to Australia by sea from a mothership floating hundreds of miles offshore, Jay said.

      "\"Add these things on a daily basis, and I promise this will help you gently get the bad stuff out and move you into a much healthier, stronger gut state,\" he said.",
      "1. Increase fiber intake",
      "Fiber is critical to digestive health, according to Gioffre.",
      "\"When we have more fiber-rich foods, it's like brushing the inner walls of our intestines \u2014 and that's going to help us remove the constipation and get to where we want to go,\" the doctor said.",

      "\"When you drink this on an empty stomach, it's going to go into all the little nooks and crannies of your gut \u2026 and it's going to help you start to detoxify and gently give you that \u2018internal shower\u2019 effect.\"",
      "2. Reduce inflammation",

      "\"Magnesium-rich powerhouses relax your intestinal muscles, soften stools and keep things moving, all while feeding your healthy gut bacteria.\" (iStock)",

      "\"It can also increase your happiness, improve your relationships and give you a boost in mental strength that you'll likely need during the day.\"",
      "2. Don\u2019t skip breakfast",
      "It might seem wise to forgo the meal leading up to Thanksgiving, with the idea of \"making room\" for the main food event, but experts say that\u2019s not a good idea.",
      "\"When you skip breakfast or lunch, you tend to be ravenous by the time you do eat, and that sets you up for overeating as you overindulge,\" Shelley Balls, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Consumer Health Digest based in Wyoming, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Instead, she recommends eating a balanced breakfast so you feel more satisfied throughout the day.",
      "\"When Thanksgiving dinner rolls around, you'll have more control of what and how much you choose to eat.\"",
      "3. Choose foods wisely",
      "Among the many options on the Thanksgiving table, some choices are better than others.",
      "\"Have a little bit of everything (because that's tradition), but tread lightly around the charcuterie board \u2014 and when you go for seconds, cut down on the butter, cream and fats,\" advised Dr. Michael Schopis, a New York gastroenterologist.",
      "\"Some patients have trouble digesting certain carbohydrates, which can lead to excessive bloating and gas, causing pain related to functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome,\" a doctor cautioned. (iStock)",

      "\"A slower pace of eating will help improve digestion and help you recognize comfortable fullness.\"",
      "Another reason to slow down is that the faster you eat (and the less you chew), the more stomach acids have to work to break down foods, which leads to gas, bloating and reflux, Schopis added.",
      "5. Drink water with dinner",
      "This tip comes from Christine Byrne, a registered dietitian and the owner of Ruby Oak Nutrition in Raleigh, North Carolina.",
      "GIVING THANKS CAN MAKE YOU HAPPIER AND HEALTHIER, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"Keeping alcohol to a minimum will help you feel much better while you eat and afterward,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Because alcohol is a toxin, your body (particularly your liver) prioritizes breaking it down and getting it out of your system,\" she went on. \"That means digesting other food gets put on hold while the alcohol is processed.\"",

      "\"Choose to speak about things you have in common and reminisce over good memories,\" Amodio recommended.",
      "Some other ideas include bringing old photo albums, playing board games and taking breaks throughout the day by stepping into another room as needed.",
      "7. Take guilt off the menu",
      "\"Remember that Thanksgiving is just one day and guilt is not a food group,\" said Elizabeth Harris, a registered dietitian in Maryland.",
      "\"Consider how you want to feel after your holiday meal and do your best to walk your choices backwards from there.\"",
      "\"Consider how you want to feel after your holiday meal and do your best to walk your choices backwards from there,\" an expert advised. (iStock)",
      "And if you miss the mark, it\u2019s not the end of the world, she noted.",
      "\"You get another chance at your very next meal to practice making feel-good choices that better support your needs.\"",
      "8. Make time to relax",
      "\"Amid the cooking, hosting and socializing, carve out small moments to recharge,\" suggested Morin.",

      "When things feel overwhelming throughout the busy day, the psychotherapist suggests taking five minutes to breathe deeply, meditate or just enjoy a quiet moment with your thoughts.",

FAIR\u2019s latest report, published in March 2023, estimated that the net cost of illegal immigration \u2013 including federal, state and local spending \u2013 was \"at least\" $150.7 billion, amounting to $1,156 per taxpayer. This was up by nearly $35 billion since 2017 when it was $116 billion.",
      "FAIR said it landed on this number by \"subtracting the tax revenue paid by illegal aliens \u2013 just under $32 billion \u2013 from the gross negative economic impact of illegal immigration, $182 billion.\" By its estimates, the federal government spent $66 billion while state and local expenditures amounted to well over $115 billion.",

      "\"The fact is we need a federal agency that investigates federal crimes, and that agency will always be at risk of having its powers abused,\" he continued, advocating the firing of \"corrupt actors,\" \"aggressive\" congressional oversight over the agency, complete overhauls to special counsels, and moving the FBI out of Washington, D.C.",

The fact that Kash Patel is profoundly unqualified for this job is not even, like, a matter for debate,\" McCabe said on CNN following the announcement. \"The installation, or the nomination, I guess we should say at this point, of Kash Patel as FBI director can only possibly be a plan to disrupt, to dismantle, to distract the FBI, and to possibly use it as a tool for the president\u2019s political agenda.\"\u200b",
      "Before Patel could assume the role as FBI chief, Wray would need to step down or be fired, as he is in the midst of a\u00a010-year appointment that does not end until 2027. The Senate would also have to confirm Patel.",

Well, get ready to have your mind blown! Scientists at the Technical University of Munich have cooked up something that might just change the game for anyone who's ever wished walking was a little easier.",
      "They call it the WalkON system, a pair of high-tech shorts that's not your average gym wear. These bad boys can cut down the energy you need for a stroll or jog by up to 18%! Whether you're a spring chicken or in your golden years, these shorts could be a game-changer, especially if stairs have become your nemesis or long walks leave you winded.",

      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the robotic shorts work",
      "The WalkON system combines sensors, artificial tendons and smart motors to enhance your natural walking motion. It starts with advanced sensors embedded in the shorts that continuously monitor the stress on your tendons. These sensors are incredibly precise, picking up on subtle changes in your movement, including how fast you\u2019re walking and the angle of your hips.",
      "Connected to these sensors are two thin artificial tendons that extend from your thighs to a specially designed waist belt. These tendons play a crucial role in how the system assists you. When you start to walk, the shorts analyze your gait pattern and can even detect the moment you transition from standing to walking. As each leg enters the \"swing phase,\" the system knows exactly when to kick in.",
      "At just the right moment, small but powerful motors activate and gently pull on the artificial tendons. This action helps lift your thigh, reducing the effort needed by your hip flexor muscles, making it feel much easier to move. What\u2019s really impressive is how adaptable WalkON is; whether you prefer a slow stroll or a brisk jog, the system adjusts its level of assistance based on your speed and leg weight. All of this happens seamlessly, so you experience a natural enhancement to your movement rather than feeling like you\u2019re being pushed or pulled by a machine.",

Additionally, individuals weakened by illness can find significant advantages in using WalkON to enhance their mobility and independence. Furthermore, the device is designed for those looking to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle, making it a versatile solution for a wide range of users.",

      "WEARABLE EXOSKELETON CAN TURN YOU INTO A SUPERHUMAN ATHLETE",
      "Comparison to other exoskeletons",
      "Unlike traditional rigid exoskeletons, WalkON's soft, flexible design offers several advantages over its more cumbersome counterparts. Conventional exoskeletons often feature rigid frames that can be difficult and time-consuming to put on, limiting their practicality for daily use.",
      "In contrast, WalkON's soft robotic shorts can be put on quickly and easily, similar to regular clothing, and are more than a mechanical device. Professor Lorenzia Masia, the lead researcher, aptly compares WalkON to an electric bike for walking. This analogy highlights the system's ability to enhance natural movement without overpowering it, making mobility more accessible and appealing to a wider range of users. The lightweight, tendon-driven design of WalkON allows for a more natural range of motion, adapting to the user's movements rather than constraining them.",
      "Furthermore, WalkON's compact and unobtrusive nature addresses a common concern with exoskeletons: social acceptance. Its design allows it to be worn discreetly under regular clothing, potentially increasing user comfort in social situations. This feature, combined with its efficiency in reducing metabolic cost, positions WalkON as a more practical solution for everyday use compared to bulkier exoskeleton systems.",
      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Availability and cost",
      "Given the current stage of development and testing, it's likely that WalkON could be available to you within the next three to five years, pending further research and regulatory approvals.",
      "While no exact price point is yet available, we can compare it to other assistive technologies. Current exoskeletons can cost anywhere from $40,000 to $100,000-plus. However, given WalkON's simpler design and intended widespread use, it's possible that it could be priced more affordably, perhaps in the range of $5,000 to $15,000 when it first hits the market. As with many technologies, the price could decrease over time as production scales up.",
      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The WalkON system's potential to enhance mobility for people of all ages, particularly older adults and those with health challenges, is immense. By making movement easier and more efficient, WalkON could encourage more active lifestyles, potentially improving overall health and quality of life for many individuals. While questions about availability and cost remain, the development of WalkON is a promising sign that we're moving towards more accessible and user-friendly mobility assistance solutions.",

      "Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to discuss what Americans should be concerned about with the data breach; he also talks about Apple's bold new move toward AI.",
      "There are companies whose entire business model is built around collecting personal data, including criminal records, employment details, addresses and more. They use this data to offer background check services to other businesses and individuals. However, while they profit from this information, they often fail to adequately protect it. Earlier this year, the National Public Data made headlines for\u00a0failing to secure 2.7 billion records of people whose data it collected. Now, on a smaller scale, another data aggregator has exposed the personal information of 600,000 Americans.",

      "Illustration of a hacker (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What information leaked?",
      "As reported by\u00a0Website Planet, the exposed database contained 644,869 PDF files, totaling 713.1 GB of sensitive data. These documents mainly consisted of background checks but also included court records, vehicle ownership details such as license plates and VINs, and property ownership reports. The background checks alone revealed highly sensitive personal data, including full names, home addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, employment details, information about family members, social media accounts and criminal histories.",
      "The worst part is that the database was left publicly accessible without password protection or encryption, allowing anyone to grab it. Anyone with the link could view and download the files. Plus, the files were named in a way that exposed personal details, using formats like \"First_Middle_Last_State.PDF.\" This made sensitive information visible even without opening the files.",

      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",

      "The database that exposed over 600,000 records belongs to SL Data Services LLC, an information research provider that appears to prioritize convenience over basic data security. The company operates a sprawling network of around 16 websites, including Propertyrec, which advertises real estate ownership data and property records. However, SL Data Services\u2019 business goes far beyond property records, offering services like criminal background checks, DMV records and even birth and death records.",
      "While Propertyrec promotes its affordability, claiming users can search for documents for as little as $1, customer reviews paint a different picture. Many users report being unknowingly enrolled in subscription services, resulting in recurring charges instead of the promised one-time fees. This predatory business practice raises further questions about the company\u2019s ethics and transparency.",

      "The exposure of sensitive personal info in this breach is a big deal for the people involved. The database has detailed data about them, and that\u2019s basically a jackpot for cybercriminals. This kind of leak can lead to various dangerous outcomes.",
      "For one, attackers could use this info to run phishing scams or social engineering tricks. If they know details like your job, family or even criminal history, they can send super convincing messages to trick you into sharing even more sensitive details, like your financial info. That\u2019s not all. Criminals could also use this leaked data to impersonate someone and apply for loans, credit cards or other services in their name.",
      "What really gets me, though, is that most people whose info got leaked probably won\u2019t even find out about it unless they\u2019re using a service to remove their data. A lot of them might not have even known they were being background-checked in the first place. For those with criminal records, this kind of leak could cause major reputational damage or lead to discrimination, even if the info is outdated or flat-out wrong.",

      "7 ways to protect yourself from data leaks",
      "1) Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0While no service can promise to completely erase your data from the internet, using a data removal service is one of the best steps you can take. They do the heavy lifting by actively scanning and removing your personal information from hundreds of websites. This helps protect you from scammers who may cross-reference data from breaches with other information they find on the dark web.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2) Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0With your address exposed, bad actors could try to scam you through physical mail. They may impersonate companies or people you trust and send fake urgent letters about things like missed deliveries, account suspensions or security alerts. Be skeptical of unexpected communications and verify any claims before taking action.",
      "3) Be cautious of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: The leaked data could lead to phishing attacks via email, phone calls or messages from unknown sources. Be on high alert for any requests for personal information, especially if they seem urgent or ask you to click on suspicious links. Always verify the legitimacy of any request before responding.",
      "To protect your devices from malicious links, make sure you have strong antivirus protection. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Monitor your accounts: Given the scope of this breach, it\u2019s crucial to start regularly reviewing your bank accounts, credit card statements and other financial accounts. Keep an eye out for any unauthorized transactions and report them immediately to your bank or credit card company to prevent further damage.",
      "5) Use strong, unique passwords: Create complex passwords for each of your online accounts and consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep track of them securely.",
      "6) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Implement this extra layer of security on all accounts that offer it to prevent unauthorized access.",
      "7) Regularly update your software: Keep your operating system, apps and security tools\u00a0up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It\u2019s alarming how many companies profit from collecting personal data, yet fail to protect it adequately. Recent breaches, including one exposing the sensitive information of 600,000 Americans, highlight this negligence. With unprotected databases containing everything from criminal records to addresses, cybercriminals have a treasure trove of information to exploit. This situation underscores the urgent need for you to take proactive steps to safeguard your privacy and demand better security practices from these data aggregators.",

Isn't it easy to find someone's number these days, no matter what?\" Yes. And if you've already had your fair share of telemarketers call you, maybe you feel like you've got it under control.",
      "The problem is that scammers with the right knowledge and the wrong intentions can wreak havoc just by having your phone number in their possession.",
      "Once they do, they can use it to trick you in all sorts of ways.",

      "Illustration of a scammer using SIM swapping\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "9 ways you can get scammed if your phone number falls into the wrong hands",
      "In today\u2019s digital age, your phone number is more than just a way for friends and family to reach you. It can be a gateway for scammers to access your personal information and wreak havoc on your life. From\u00a0phishing attempts to extortion, the risks are numerous and varied. Here are nine ways scammers can exploit your phone number if it falls into the wrong hands:",
      "Scammers can also use your phone number to launch rather easy\u00a0phishing attacks. They might send text messages or make calls posing as your bank or a popular online service that you subscribe to. The goal is to call you and trick you into providing login credentials, credit card details or other personal information, which they can then use for fraudulent activities. And once they have all your other information, they can do a lot more damage just by having your phone number as that initial segue.",
      "In some cases, scammers use your phone number for extortion or blackmail. They may claim to have compromising information about you and demand payment to keep it private. By contacting you directly, they can apply continuous pressure, making their threats seem more real and immediate.",
      "One unique way they do this to target elderly people is by pretending to be your grandchild or another relative in distress. The scammer often claims that your grandchild is in an emergency situation \u2014 such as needing bail money or medical assistance \u2014 and urgently requests financial help. With AI voice cloning technology, they may even be able to use your grandchild's voice. This emotional manipulation usually gets the victim to pay up.",
      "This one may not be as dramatic, but your phone number can be sold to\u00a0robocall and spam message services. These automated systems bombard you with unwanted calls and texts, often promoting scams or fraudulent products. While these may seem like minor annoyances, they can lead to bigger scams if you engage with the messages or follow their instructions. Hang up on them.",
      "HOW TO STOP ANNOYING ROBOCALLS",
      "Illustration of a scammer with cash in his hand\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Phone number spoofing is a common tactic where scammers disguise their caller ID to appear as a trusted contact by calling from what appears to be a familiar number as it may have the same area code where you live, an area code where your friends or family live or even the actual phone number of someone close which you can recognize.",
      "This makes it more likely that you'll answer the call, giving them the opportunity to deceive you into revealing personal information or transferring money. This is, of course, the case when phone spoofing is used against you. But in situations where they use YOUR phone number, they can be scamming those close to you without you even knowing!",
      "With these phone spoofing tactics, scammers can use your phone number to\u00a0impersonate government officials, such as IRS agents or Social Security administrators. They may call you claiming there\u2019s an urgent issue, like unpaid taxes or suspicious activity involving your Social Security number. This ploy often involves threats of legal action or arrest to pressure you into providing sensitive information or making immediate payments.",
      "Instead of pretending to be from a government agency, another trick is for scammers to try their luck by posing as a representative from a utility company, like an electric or water company. Scammers will claim that you have an overdue invoice and threaten to cut off your service unless you pay immediately. Using your phone number, they can contact you repeatedly, making the scam seem more legitimate (and pressing).",
      "SIM swapping or a\u00a0port-out scam is when scammers transfer your phone number to a new SIM card in their possession. By convincing your mobile carrier to reroute your number, they can receive all your calls and messages, including those containing two-factor authentication codes. This allows them to bypass security measures and take over your online accounts.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "With SIM swapping techniques/port-out, scammers can also use your phone number as a key to access sensitive data stored in your online accounts. By initiating password resets and intercepting verification codes sent via SMS, they can gain unauthorized access to your email, social media and banking accounts, leading to significant personal and financial damage.",
      "Finally, scammers can use all the tactics above to not only access the accounts you already have but also create fake online accounts in your name. These accounts can be used for a variety of malicious purposes, such as spreading malware, launching further scams or conducting identity theft. The presence of your phone number makes these accounts appear more legitimate, increasing the chances of deceiving others.",

      "How to protect yourself from these scams",
      "To protect your phone number from falling into the hands of scammers, here\u2019s what you can do:",
      "1. Be cautious about sharing your phone number publicly: Avoid posting your phone number on public forums, websites or social media platforms where it can be easily accessed by scammers.",
      "2. Limit exposure of your phone number on social media and other online platforms:\u00a0Use privacy settings to restrict who can see your contact information. Most social media platforms and online services offer privacy settings that allow you to control who can view your personal information. Make sure to review and adjust these settings regularly. Only share your phone number with trusted contacts.",
      "3. Consider using a secondary number for online registrations and transactions:\u00a0Services like Google Voice can provide you with a secondary number that you can use for online activities, keeping your primary number private.",
      "4. Monitor your accounts regularly for unusual activity: Check your bank accounts, email and other online accounts for any signs of unauthorized access or suspicious activity.",
      "5. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Use two-factor authentication apps instead of SMS-based verification where possible:\u00a0Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides an extra layer of security that is more difficult for scammers to bypass compared to SMS-based verification.",
      "7. Use an identity theft protection service: Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "8. Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with the information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "If you suspect that scammers already have your phone number, take the following steps:",
      "Contact your mobile carrier to alert them of the scam calls, especially if they come from the same number. Your carrier may be able to block the number or provide additional security measures.",
      "Consider changing your phone number if the issue persists: If scam calls continue despite your efforts, changing your phone number may be the best solution.",
      "Report any suspicious activity to the appropriate authorities:\u00a0Contact your local law enforcement or consumer protection agency to report scams and seek advice on further actions.",
      "Consider placing fraud alerts on your accounts:\u00a0Fraud alerts can help protect your credit and financial accounts from unauthorized access.",
      "Monitor your phone for unusual calls or messages: Keep an eye out for any unexpected calls or messages, and do not respond to them.",
      "Check your phone bill for unauthorized charges:\u00a0Regularly review your phone bill to ensure there are no unexpected charges, which could indicate that your number has been used fraudulently.",
      "By following these steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to phone number scams and protect your personal information.",

      "\"These are going to be the most powerful technologies of our century, probably more,\" Easterly said. \"Most of these technologies are being built by private companies that are incentivized to provide returns for their shareholders. So we do need to ensure that government has a role in establishing safeguards to ensure that these technologies are being built in a way that prioritizes security. And that's where I think that Congress can have a role in ensuring that these technologies are as safe and secure to be used and implemented by the American people.\"",

To put that into perspective, it's like carving out a small town's worth of earth annually. Currently stretching about 0.6 miles long and 0.5 miles wide at its widest point, this behemoth shows no signs of slowing down.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 2% decline in workers through 2033 despite the number of job openings remaining the same.",

Whether that has to do with production of different types of vegetables, fruits, nuts, other types of meats or other types of foods,\" Earles said. \"There\u2019s a lot of potential, we think, all the way from going from the research and lab side through startups, through corporate innovation. And we're here to kind of find a way to facilitate and integrate that along the way.\"",

    "story": [
      "\"The Five\" co-hosts react to Neil Young returning to Spotify and woke musicians bailing on Texas' SXSW festival over military ties.",
      "Many of us use Spotify every day, whether to listen to songs, podcasts or audiobooks. Some of us create playlists of our favorite songs, while others save playlists made by others.",
      "In case you didn\u2019t know, Spotify allows you to create public playlists that anyone can save and listen to. You\u2019d think this is a harmless feature, but spammers have found a way to misuse it.",
      "They\u2019re using Spotify playlists and podcasts to push pirated software, game cheat codes, spam links and malware sites. I\u2019ll discuss the details of this emerging online scam and share tips on how to stay safe.",

      "How the Spotify scam works",
      "As reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer, this scam works by misusing Spotify\u2019s popularity and trustworthiness. Scammers exploit Spotify playlists by injecting targeted keywords, such as \"free download,\" \"crack\" or \"warez,\" into titles and descriptions.",
      "These keywords are designed to align with popular search terms. Since Spotify\u2019s web player pages are indexed by search engines like Google, these spammy results appear in user searches, driving traffic to their links. For example, a Spotify playlist titled \"Sony Vegas Pro 13 Crack\u2026\" was found promoting \"free\" software sites in its title and description, directing users to questionable external links.",
      "The scam isn\u2019t limited to playlists. It extends to podcasts as well. Scammers create podcasts with multiple short episodes, typically under 20 seconds, using synthesized speech to direct listeners to click links in the description for free content. These podcasts often target users searching for pirated ebooks, audiobooks or game cheats. While the content may appear legitimate at first glance, clicking on the links often results in being redirected to unsafe pages that further exploit users.",
      "Scammers exploit Spotify playlists by injecting targeted keywords into titles (BleepingComputer)",
      "4.3 MILLION AMERICANS EXPOSED IN MASSIVE HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT DATA BREACH",
      "The end goal",
      "The main goal of this scam is to use Spotify\u2019s trusted reputation and search engine visibility to get people to click on shady links and visit sketchy websites. Scammers make money through fake ad clicks, bogus surveys and affiliate links, while also spreading malware by tricking users into downloading harmful software or extensions.",
      "They also try to steal personal info through fake sign-up forms or phishing pages, which can lead to identity theft or be sold to others. By using Spotify\u2019s indexed pages, they boost the search rankings of their spam sites, reaching more people. Some of these sites even run extra scams like fake crypto giveaways or phishing attempts to grab even more money or data from unsuspecting users.",

      "1. Avoid clicking on suspicious links: Be cautious when you come across playlists or podcasts with titles like \"Sony Vegas Pro 13 Crack\" or other promises of free software, audiobooks or game cheats. These often include links in the description that redirect to unsafe sites hosting malware, adware or phishing pages.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Stick to official sources: Always download software, eBooks or other digital content from trusted official websites or reputable platforms. If you see a Spotify playlist or podcast offering \"free\" versions of paid content, it\u2019s likely a scam. Cross-check the legitimacy of the content through known channels instead of relying on unverified links.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords: Create complex and unique passwords for your Spotify account and avoid using personal information like birthdays or pet names. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Be skeptical of synthesized speech and short episodes: Many scam podcasts feature short episodes (10-20 seconds) with synthesized speech directing you to click on a link in the description. These are a common tactic used to trick users into visiting unsafe pages. If the content feels automated, vague or overly promotional, it\u2019s best to avoid it.",
      "5. Verify curator credentials: Check the credentials of playlist curators. Legitimate curators usually have a verifiable online presence. If you can't find any information about them, it's best to avoid engaging with them.",
      "6. Recognize phishing attempts: Be cautious of emails claiming to be from Spotify that ask you to confirm account details or click on suspicious links. These are often phishing attempts designed to steal your credentials.",
      "7. Report and block suspicious content: If you come across playlists or podcasts that seem fraudulent or inappropriate,\u00a0report them directly to Spotify. Use Spotify\u2019s reporting tools to flag content that violates its platform rules. Blocking suspicious accounts or playlists also ensures you won\u2019t accidentally interact with them in the future, and reporting helps Spotify improve its filtering and moderation systems.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers will use any means possible to trick you. In the past, we\u2019ve seen bad actors weaponize\u00a0Google search results with malicious websites that install malware when links are clicked on. There have also been plenty of\u00a0SEO scams targeting users. Companies like Spotify need to implement measures to prevent their platforms from being misused by scammers. Google also has a responsibility to ensure the quality of its search results. Just because a webpage comes from a well-known organization doesn\u2019t mean it deserves to rank highly on the search results pages.",

      "He said the then-unknown political novice had been a fresh face on the scene who promised to work hard for the people of Corona, Jackson Heights and Elmhurst and to be an on-the-ground presence for them, unlike career politician Crowley, who at that point was a 10-term incumbent and eyeing to be the next House speaker.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez, Ramirez Baez said, reached out to him for help when she had about $39,000 in the bank, compared to Crowley\u2019s nearly $2 million war chest.",
      "Ramirez Baez, who is well-connected in the area, particularly among his fellow Dominican immigrants, introduced Ocasio-Cortez to many business owners, campaigned with her and even forked out the cash to pay for their debate venue, he said. The move proved crucial in swaying the electorate, as Crowley never turned up, and Ramirez Baez said it swung the momentum to Ocasio-Cortez.",
      "\"I paid for that debate, I have an invoice for everything I did for Ms. Alexandria,\" Ramirez Baez said, waving a document to the camera. He said he has all his expenses from her campaign documented in one of the many books he has written about her.",
      "But since Ocasio-Cortez rose to power, Ramirez Baez said she has been missing in action and has acted no differently from Crowley.",

      "\"What happened? You have to be [in the] community to do an event,\" he said. \"She never did any event. I never saw Alexandria come to do a town hall meeting, to listen to the community, nothing. She disappeared.\"",
      "\"She goes all over the place, like a movie star, she goes to Texas, all over the place, but what about the community?\"",
      "Ramirez Baez said Ocasio-Cortez did hold a town hall in the neighborhood in May 2023, but since then, crime, particularly prostitution, has exploded, and she has not engaged with the community on those matters. He said the rally was extremely limited and residents had to apply to attend, with her office denying entry to those it deemed as hostile to her positions. Even other local Democrats who told Fox News Digital they, too, were denied entry.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez spoke at a rally in support of illegal vendors a few months later and quickly left before questions could be asked, he said.",

      "\"If she said to me, she is socialist, I would never support it,\"\u00a0Ramirez Baez declared. He said that part of her socialist agenda is an open-border policy with regard to immigration, which he opined has contributed to the decline of the neighborhood as many illegal vendors and sex workers on Roosevelt Avenue are migrants who have no jobs or work permits and also clog up resources.",
      "\"She only defends the socialist agenda, which is not for the American people. \u2026 She doesn\u2019t understand what [socialism] means,\" said Ramirez Baez, who added that he understands it because he has lived in Cuba and the former Soviet Union. \"She was a little confused in her head, confused in that ideology.\"",
      "\"The Democrats opened the border, and a lot of people that nobody knows have come. Alexandria was in Texas [saying] \u2018Come on, people from New York have the money,\u2019 and that\u2019s why right now you have that situation in our neighborhood.\"",

You have failed to even speak about the crime that affects our neighborhood and you failed to protect the vulnerable women exploited by these criminal networks.\"",

    "summary": "In southern Lebanon, Israeli forces confront entrenched Hezbollah positions and question UNIFIL\u2019s ability to enforce its mandate even before the cease-fire agreement was drawn up.",
    "story": [
      "Israel says Hezbollah terrorists are firing rockets into the country close to UN peacekeeping forces. (Video: IDF Spokesman's Unit)",
      "As Israel and Hezbollah implemented a fragile cease-fire deal, questions are resurfacing about United Nations (U.N.) peacekeepers' failure to enforce U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 and whether its continued presence will continue to favor the Iran-backed terror group.",
      "The cease-fire, brokered by the U.S. and France, took effect on Nov. 27 and aims to halt over a year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Under its terms, Hezbollah is required to withdraw north of the Litani River, and Israeli forces will pull back from southern Lebanon within 60 days. The agreement marks a significant step but faces immediate challenges, with both sides accusing the other of violations. Against this backdrop, the role of the United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon (UNIFIL) is facing renewed scrutiny.",
      "On Monday, Hezbollah launched two projectiles at Mount Dov, alleging Israeli cease-fire violations. Responding to the launches, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated in Hebrew on X: \"Hezbollah\u2019s fire toward Mount Dov constitutes a serious violation of the cease-fire, and Israel will respond forcefully. We are determined to continue enforcing the cease-fire and to respond to any violation by Hezbollah-whether minor or severe.\"",

Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, highlighted UNIFIL\u2019s challenges in enforcing U.N. Security Council resolution 1701. \"The same issues are likely to manifest again under the revised UNSCR 1701, although in this current iteration, both the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL will be charged with overseeing the implementation of the resolution and ensuring that Hezbollah is unable to violate its terms or rebuild an operational infrastructure south of the Litani River that could once again threaten Israel.\"",
      "Ali also pointed to historical U.N. peacekeeping failures, such as those in Somalia, Rwanda and the Balkans, as cautionary examples. \"In decades past, there are other examples of the limitations of U.N. peacekeeping elements to prevent either the outbreak or dramatic escalation of armed conflict between combatants in similarly small countries with complex ethnic, tribal, or religious divisions.\"",

Gunfire erupted suddenly, forcing the troops to take cover as Hezbollah terrorists fired at them from nearby homes. The exchange intensified, with bullets cutting through the air, when an unexpected sight left the soldiers stunned: a UNIFIL convoy driving directly into the firefight.",
      "The white U.N. vehicle crossed the road separating the Israeli soldiers from Hezbollah fighters, coming to a halt amid the smoke and chaos. A UNIFIL peacekeeper stepped out, seemingly oblivious to the life-threatening battle unfolding around him. \"It was a total surprise. The IDF soldiers were shocked,\" said Itai Anghel, an Israeli journalist embedded with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). \"The timing of the convoy\u2019s arrival, as well as its route, made the soldiers suspect coordination with Hezbollah.\"",

      "Anghel, a veteran war reporter for the Israeli TV program \"Uvda,\" described the bizarre scene. \"This was not my first time in Houla. I documented the battle here during the Second Lebanon War 18 years ago, but this time, it was worse,\" he said. \"Every second or third house in the village was packed with weapons - RPGs, rockets, tunnels - all aimed at storming Israeli villages just a few kilometers away.\"",
      "As the battle raged, Anghel witnessed the soldiers\u2019 frustrations with UNIFIL\u2019s presence. \"They don\u2019t trust them,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"One soldier even told me, \u2018If we leave these villages for UNIFIL to manage, it will all revert to how it was before - nothing will change.\u2019\"",
      "An IDF official told Fox News Digital that during the 14 months of fighting in South Lebanon, \"We\u2019ve seen Hezbollah use U.N. convoys to get close to the border - a Hezbollah car just entered the convoy and tagged along with them to safely gather intelligence. Cameras operated by Hezbollah have even been found on the fences of UNIFIL facilities. In one case, we discovered a massive tunnel just a few meters from a UNIFIL base. Think of the noise and effort required to dig a tunnel in stone - it\u2019s impossible they didn\u2019t know.\"",
      "A former special unit IDF fighter, who asked to stay anonymous, described what he witnessed during his service in southern Lebanon. \"We\u2019d see UNIFIL on one side and Hezbollah just meters away on the other,\" he said. \"Over time, Hezbollah became bolder, setting up tents right on the border. Everyone played the game - they knew Hezbollah was there, walking freely among them. And nothing was done.\"",
      "UNIFIL responded to the criticism by emphasizing its limited mandate. \"The implementation of Resolution 1701 is the responsibility of the parties, Lebanon and Israel,\" Andrea Teneti, a UNIFIL spokesperson, said. \"UNIFIL supports the parties\u2019 implementation, monitors, and reports on violations. We do not have the mandate to enforce the resolution, nor to disarm Hezbollah by force.\"",
      "The spokesperson pointed to the unprecedented period of stability from 2006 to 2023 as evidence of UNIFIL\u2019s contributions, despite both parties failing to implement their obligations. UNIFIL acknowledged that the proliferation of weapons outside state control in southern Lebanon remains a violation of Resolution 1701, adding, \"The removal of unauthorized weapons can only be achieved through the full implementation of Resolution 1701. There is no military solution.\"",

      "\"Since UNSCR 1701\u2019s implementation, Hezbollah has successfully circumvented nearly all its conditions,\" Ali told Fox New Digital, adding \"By doing so, the group was able to create fortified bunkers, weapons caches, command posts for mobile fighting squads, and firing positions for rockets, mortars, and other projectiles used to attack Israeli civilian and military targets - which increased exponentially in the aftermath of October 7, 2023. By all accounts, UNIFIL did little to prevent this operational buildup or prevent the escalation in Hezbollah attacks after October 7.\"",
      "Following Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, Hezbollah opened another front in the war along the northern border, launching hundreds of rockets, anti-tank missiles and UAVs into Israeli territory. Alarmingly, many of these attacks originated near UNIFIL bases. \"Over 430 Hezbollah projectiles have landed in and around UNIFIL outposts,\" an IDF military official reported. \"Yet the U.N. has only twice named Hezbollah explicitly as responsible for these attacks.\"",
      "\"The actions of both the IDF and Hezbollah are putting peacekeepers in danger, whether through crossfire or deliberate acts\", said Teneti. \"We name a party only when we are sure about the source of fire impacting the mission and Hezbollah has been mentioned several times as responsible for some of those attacks.\"",
      "The IDF has provided Fox News Digital with further evidence of Hezbollah\u2019s violations, including fortified positions and training centers. In one instance, a Hezbollah facility packed with weapons and attack plans was discovered just 200 meters from a UNIFIL base. \"You had to walk past the facility to even reach the U.N. base,\" an IDF officer noted.",
      "The IDF said its \"soldiers are continuing to conduct limited, localized, targeted raids in southern Lebanon, eliminating Hezbollah terrorists and dismantling terror infrastructure and weapons stockpiles both above and below ground.\" (IDF spokesman's unit)",
      "Michael, a former Danish soldier who served with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, reflected on his time in southern Lebanon. \"Hezbollah controlled all the areas we were supposed to monitor,\" he told the Danish newspaper BT. \"We couldn\u2019t operate at night out of fear, and taking photos was prohibited. Despite daily reports of violations, nothing happened.\"",

      "Here is a breakdown of the plan's key elements as laid out in the report and how they are supposedly connected.",
      "Sowing doubt about Brazil\u2019s voting system",
      "Police allege that efforts to disseminate fake news about Brazil\u2019s electronic voting system began in 2019, Bolsonaro\u2019s first year in office, but were conducted more strategically and intensively as his 2022 reelection bid drew near.",
      "Police say so-called \"digital militias\" comprised of thousands of social media accounts linked to pro-Bolsonaro propaganda, as well as other prominent right-wing influencers and politicians, spread propaganda claiming the voting system could be tampered with. Bolsonaro also openly expressed admiration for Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship (1964-1985), which he claimed saved the country from communism.",
      "The narrative of an impending illegitimate election defeat helped Bolsonaro rally tens of thousands of supporters to multiple street demonstrations and also muster many to set up camp outside military barracks and headquarters to pressure leaders.",
      "Three months before the election, Bolsonaro invited dozens of diplomats to the presidential palace for a nationally televised meeting in which he presented supposed vulnerabilities of the voting system, without providing any evidence.",
      "Following Bolsonaro\u2019s loss in 2022 to leftist Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Bolsonaro's Liberal Party questioned results at the country's top electoral court, arguing voting devices made in specific years could have permitted fraud. The electoral court swiftly dismissed the claims.",
      "\"They spread false studies on the vulnerabilities of the electronic voting machines through the Liberal Party, in an attempt to create a factual basis for a presidential decree\" that would set the coup in motion, the report says.",
      "A draft decree to set the coup in motion",
      "In January 2023, Brazilian police found a draft decree in the home of Bolsonaro\u2019s former justice minister Anderson Torres. It was one of many versions drafted either at the far-right leader's behest or with his knowledge, police say. The former president presented the document, unsigned, to the commanders of the three divisions of the armed forces on Dec. 7, seeking their support.",
      "Investigators say the draft decree shows Bolsonaro and his allies sought to create a committee to probe alleged fraud and crimes in the October 2022 vote, so they could later suspend the powers of the nation\u2019s top electoral court and possibly convene a new election.",
      "The navy\u2019s commander was ready to comply with the decree, but army and air force leaders objected to any plan that would prevent Lula's inauguration, the report said. Those refusals are why the plan did not go ahead, according to witnesses who spoke to investigators.",
      "Many legal experts including say evidence that former president presented the draft to military leaders and supported for different versions of the document are very damaging.",
      "\"(The goal) was to unduly intervene in elections,\" said Luiz Henrique Machado, a law professor at the IDP university in the capital Brasilia. \"In Brazil, it is the electoral prosecutors' office and the top electoral court that have the final word about electoral legislation.\"",
      "In an interview with website UOL published Thursday, Bolsonaro said he discussed with military leaders moves including decreeing a state of emergency and other exceptional measures that would have suspended the rule of law for the public good. He said such measures are provided for by the constitution, so there is nothing unseemly about evaluating those options.",
      "\"What is being said is absurd. For my part, there has never been any discussion of a coup,\" Bolsonaro told journalists in Brasilia on Monday.",
      "Plan to assassinate the president-elect",
      "On Nov. 19, Brazil's Federal Police arrested four army special operations officers and a federal police officer accused of plotting in 2022 to assassinate Lula, vice-president-elect Geraldo Alckmin and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. The arrested men were all mentioned in a police report that was unsealed later.",
      "The assassination plan sought to leave Bolsonaro's ticket as the only remaining valid one in the 2022 runoff, police say. As for de Moraes, he led a five-year probe into fake news and threats against Supreme Court justices, which has led some far-right allies and supporters being barred from social media and even imprisoned. In early 2023, he presided over the nation\u2019s top electoral court when it declared Bolsonaro ineligible for office until 2030 over abuse of power related to a meeting he convened with foreign ambassadors to spread lies about the voting system.",
      "Gen. Walter Braga Netto, Bolsonaro\u2019s 2022 running mate and former defense minister, greenlit the assassination plan at a meeting with the plotters inside his home, investigators added. Federal Police portray the retired general as one of the plot's leaders, also involved in pressuring military leaders to sign onto the coup.",
      "Braga Netto said in a statement on Tuesday that he never plotted a coup. He added that several of the documents seized from one of his aides, including \"writings, drafts and media reports\" were \"preparatory material to answer media requests and to prepare for testimony in congressional hearings.\"",
      "The police report contains no indication that any attempt to assassinate Lula or Alckmin was put into motion. However, investigators found messages and documents indicating that the plotters were monitoring and following de Moraes at the time.",
      "Police said they found evidence that retired Brig. Gen. M\u00e1rio Fernandes, one of the officers arrested who had been serving as interim general secretary of the presidency, also visited the protest camps outside military installations, including at the army headquarters in Brasilia. Investigators said they have evidence that he gave instructions and financial support to the protesters.",
      "Jan. 8 uprising",
      "Federal Police linked Bolsonaro and some of his top ministers to the Jan. 8, 2023 riot in which supporters of the former president, many of whom had been camped outside army headquarters for months, ransacked the Supreme Court, Congress and presidential palace in Brasilia.",
      "The protesters had pleaded for the armed forces to keep the leftist leader out of office and their uprising \u2014 which came after Lula was sworn in \u2014 was an attempt to force military intervention and oust the new president, police say.",
      "The riot appears in the report as one of several \"other actions to pressure the army commander to join the coup d\u2019etat.\" Police also say that Brig. Gen. Fernandes sent a message in November 2022 to Gen. Marco Ant\u00f4nio Freire Gomes, then the Army's commander, discussing the need for a \"triggering event\" for a coup.",
      "Defendants, including Bolsonaro, have argued that the riot was an isolated event, and many legal experts have noted that the report's evidence of a connection between it and a broader plot is tenuous.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"It is clear that the alleged coup plotters had contacts with people camped outside military barracks, people who were there on Jan. 8. But how much of that contact was transformed into planning, coordination, stimulus for those people to take public buildings that day? That is to be debated, it is going to be discussed in the process and the collection of more evidence,\" said Jo\u00e3o Pedro P\u00e1dua, a professor of criminal law proceedings at the Universidade Federal Fluminense in Rio de Janeiro.",
      "Bolsonaro left for the United States days before Lula\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 1, 2023 and stayed there three months, keeping a low profile. The police report alleges he was avoiding possible imprisonment related to the coup plot and awaiting the fallout from the uprising."

      "\"We can\u2019t forget that one of these groups, HTS has been designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization. I think Israel\u2019s degradation of Hezbollah emboldened the anti-Assad forces as they smelled blood in the water with this assault on Aleppo. It\u2019s not only Hezbollah\u2019s losses, but also the IRGC\u2019s [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] losses which are testing the Quds Force\u2019s structures in Syria.",

      "\"Let\u2019s not forget that Israel decapitated the IRGC Quds Force Department 2000, which oversees operations in the Levant, twice in the last year alone, not to mention other key commanders in the Syrian theater. That is a loss of relationships, skills and networks that have placed the IRGC at a disadvantage, especially when Hezbollah has been under such strain,\" he said.",
      "The United States government has designated both Iran\u2019s regime and the Syrian Arab Republic as state-sponsors of terrorism.",
      "Phillip Smyth, an expert on Iranian regime proxy groups and Syria, who is with the Atlantic Council, told Fox News Digital, \"If you were thinking Assad was sending out or had anything elite and functional for fighting forces, recall that nearly every successful offensive for pro-Assad side was executed by Iran and Iran proxies and or Russia since 2013 and 2015, respectively.\"",

Smyth, however, noted that Assad\u2019s is the other side of the same dangerous coin\u00a0for U.S interests. He said regarding Assad and HTS, \"I don\u2019t think either is a good case.

      "This election includes a large crop of independent candidates, ranging from local campaigners to far-right activists and reputed crime boss Gerry \"the Monk\" Hutch.",
      "What are the main issues?",
      "As in many other countries, the cost of living \u2014 especially housing \u2014 has dominated the campaign. Ireland has an acute housing shortage, the legacy of failing to build enough new homes during the country\u2019s \"Celtic Tiger\" boom years and the economic slump that followed the 2008 global financial crisis.",

      "Tangled up with the housing issue is immigration, a fairly recent challenge to a country long defined by emigration. Recent arrivals include more than 100,000 Ukrainians displaced by war and thousands of people fleeing poverty and conflict in the Middle East and Africa.",
      "This country of 5.4 million has struggled to house all the asylum-seekers, leading to tent camps and makeshift accommodation centers that have attracted tension and protests.

      "Unlike many European countries, Ireland does not have a significant far-right party, but far-right voices on social media seek to drum up hostility to migrants, and anti-immigrant independent candidates are hoping for election in several districts. The issue appears to be hitting support for Sinn Fein, as working-class supporters bristled at its pro-immigration policies.",
      "What\u2019s the likely outcome?",
      "Opinion polls suggest voters\u2019 support is split into five roughly even chunks \u2014 for Fine Gael, Fianna Fail, Sinn Fein, several smaller parties and an assortment of independents.",
      "Fine Gael has run a gaffe-prone campaign, Fianna Fail has remained steady in the polls and Sinn Fein says it has momentum, but is unlikely to win power unless the other parties drop their opposition to working with it.",
      "Analysts say the most likely outcome is another Fine Gael-Fianna Fail coalition, possibly with a smaller party or a clutch of independents as kingmakers.",
      "\"It\u2019s just a question of which minor group is going to be the group that supports the government this time,\" said Eoin O\u2019Malley, a political scientist at Dublin City University. \"Coalition-forming is about putting a hue on what is essentially the same middle-of-the-road government every time.\"",

      "\"Trump\u2019s civic and financial contributions to this City and the Nation are too numerous to count,\" it says.",

    "summary": "Even with their success, this election revealed a challenge for Republicans going forward: The \u201cTrump coalition\u201d and the \u201cGOP coalition\u201d are not quite the same.",
    "story": [
      "Welcome to the online version of\u00a0From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "In today\u2019s edition, national political correspondent explains why Republicans may not be able to bank on Donald Trump's coalition moving forward. Plus, Republican senators grow skeptical of the president-elect's pick to lead the Defense Department.",
      "Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.",
      "The GOP\u2019s post-election challenge: Turning Trump voters into full-fledged Republicans",
      "Even with their success, this election revealed a challenge for Republicans going forward: The \u201cTrump coalition\u201d and the \u201cGOP coalition\u201d are not quite the same.",
      "By driving up support even further with white blue-collar voters and earning substantial new backing from nonwhite, young and first-time voters, President-elect Donald Trump swept the battleground states and secured a national popular vote victory.",
      "But in the five battlegrounds that also featured Senate races, GOP candidates all received far fewer votes than Trump \u2014 enough to cost the party four of them (and nearly all five). While it\u2019s customary for fewer total votes to be cast in down-ballot races, the drop-off was notably worse for Republicans than for the Democratic Senate candidates.",
      "Individual candidate and campaign dynamics can certainly account for some of this. In Arizona, for instance, Republican Kari Lake\u2019s broad unpopularity clearly gave an extra boost to Democrat Ruben Gallego, who actually received more votes than Vice President Kamala Harris did at the top of their party\u2019s ticket.",
      "But taken as a whole, the overall pattern is striking \u2014 especially in light of recent history. In the two previous presidential elections combined, just one state produced a split White House/Senate outcome. That was in Maine in 2020, when voters re-elected Republican Sen. Susan Collins while backing Democrat Joe Biden for president.",
      "There are likely several factors at work here, but two stand out as potential longer-term issues for the GOP.",
      "The first involves voters who were motivated to turn out for Trump, but then skipped all of the other races on the ballot. There\u2019s some evidence for this. My colleague Scott Bland found that in Nevada\u2019s Washoe County, the second largest in the state, 6.6% of Trump\u2019s voters either left the Senate race blank or went with a third-party candidate (or used the state\u2019s unique \u201cnone of these candidates\u201d option). Meanwhile, 4.9% of Harris\u2019 voters did the same.",
      "This only accounts for a small portion of the GOP drop-off in Nevada, but it\u2019s a result that\u2019s consistent with a feature of our NBC News polling this year. We found Trump faring best with infrequent voters (posting a 15-point advantage among those who hadn\u2019t voted in 2020) who expressed a lower level of interest in the election and were disproportionately young, nonwhite and male. It\u2019s plausible that a significant number of these people ended up being \u201cTrump-only\u201d voters, raising the question of whether the GOP can convert them into full-fledged Republican voters in the future, when Trump won\u2019t be on the ballot.",
      "The other factor the GOP will need to address involves Democratic defectors \u2014 traditionally Democratic voters who have essentially made an exception for Trump.",
      "This appears to have been at work in Wisconsin, where Trump won by about 30,000 votes even as Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin was re-elected by roughly the same margin. The drop-off from Trump to his party\u2019s Senate candidate (Eric Hovde) was most pronounced in rural, blue-collar counties, many of which had been Democratic territory until Trump\u2019s emergence. Here Trump expanded his support even further, which was key to his statewide victory, but those gains didn\u2019t trickle down the ballot.",
      "Republicans will need to find a way to make that happen in the future \u2014 without Trump.",
      "Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary is in peril in the Senate",
      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Defense Department, Pete Hegseth, is in peril as Senate Republicans grow increasingly concerned over reports about his alleged drinking and treatment of women.",
      "As many as six Senate Republicans, perhaps more, are currently not comfortable supporting Hegseth\u2019s bid to lead the Pentagon as new revelations about the former Fox News anchor\u2019s past continue to be made public, three Republican sources with direct knowledge of his nomination process tell NBC News. Given Republicans\u2019 slim Senate majority in the next Congress, Hegseth can only afford to lose three GOP votes, assuming all Democrats vote against him.",
      "Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who sits on the Armed Services Committee, would not commit to supporting Hegseth\u2019s nomination and said she planned to grill\u00a0him about news accounts of his alleged alcohol abuse, mistreatment of women and financial mismanagement.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just going to have a really frank and thorough conversation,\u201d Ernst said of Hegseth\u2019s nomination process.",
      "Hegseth, an Army National Guard veteran, was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in California in 2017, according to a police report made public after Trump announced he would nominate the former Fox host for defense secretary. Hegseth was not charged and denied the woman\u2019s allegations, stating the encounter was consensual, although he did pay an undisclosed amount as part of a settlement with her.",
      "Separately, NBC News reported on Tuesday that Hegseth\u2019s drinking concerned his colleagues at Fox News, according to 10 current and former Fox employees. Two of them said that Hegseth smelled of alcohol before he went on air on more than a dozen occasions. Hegseth did not respond when asked for comment on those allegations Tuesday evening at the Capitol.",
      "The initial allegations against Hegseth last month did not appear to put his planned nomination in danger. After his first round of meetings on Capitol Hill last month, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the chair of the Armed Services Committee, said he expected Hegesth to be confirmed. But on Tuesday, after a series of other reports about Hegseth\u2019s past but before NBC News reported on allegations concerning drinking at Fox News, Wicker sounded more cautious.",

    "story": [
      "The sister of 30-year-old Hannah Kobayashi said Tuesday the police conclusion that she is a \"voluntary missing person\" is not satisfactory.",
      "Appearing with family lawyer Sara Azari on NBC News NOW's \"Top Story With Tom Llamas,\" Sydni Kobayashi said relatives should have been shown the video that Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said shows Hannah crossing into Mexico alone at a pedestrian port of entry in San Diego on Nov. 12.",
      "McDonnell said that there\u2019s not much more the department can do and that it has classified the case as one of a voluntary detachment with no foul play suspected.",
      "\"We're just as confused and just as frustrated more than anything now,\" Sydni Kobayashi said.",
      "Azari agreed, questioning how police could come to such a conclusion without involving those closest to Hannah, who disappeared after she landed at Los Angeles International Airport from Honolulu on Nov. 8 and missed a connecting flight to her final destination, New York City.",
      "\"They just reached this conclusion \u2026 without showing them any footage,\" Azari said, referring to family members. \"It takes a lot more digging and investigation to be able to say it's voluntary.\"",
      "Sydni Kobayashi said she fears Hannah, who's from Maui, may be the victim of human trafficking, which McDonnell said Monday isn\u2019t suspected. She said she can't see how Hannah can remain out of touch nearly a month after she left Hawaii.",
      "\"She always kept close to me more than anyone in our lives,\" she said.",
      "Los Angeles police didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.",
      "Azari said the family would deploy supporters to look for Hannah in Mexico. Authorities said investigators are likely to be alerted if Hannah returns to the U.S. via an official U.S.-Mexico crossing or port.",
      "In the meantime, her sister urged her to reach out.",
      "\"I can't stress enough how loved you are, how supported you are,\" she said. \"We're really worried about you. No matter what situation you're in, you always have a home to come to.\"",
      "A collective statement from Hannah's family on Tuesday was less mistrusting, as it expressed gratitude to police and said the search will continue, if only to ensure she's safe.",
      "\"The search is far from over, and we are committed to doing everything possible to bring her home safely,\u201d the statement said.",
      "McDonnell said Monday at a news conference that he saw the need for relatives to communicate with Hannah, and he urged her to reach out.",
      "\"She has a right to her privacy, and we respect her choices, but we also understand the concern her loved ones feel for her,\" he said. \"A simple message could reassure those who care about her.\"",
      "After she missed her connecting flight, Hannah spent the next few days sightseeing in Los Angeles, sending texts that a family member described as \"alarming\" and being seen on security video with an unknown man, according to a family timeline on Facebook and other statements made by relatives.",
      "\u201cHannah\u2019s last message to us was alarming \u2014 she mentioned feeling scared, and that someone might be trying to steal her money and identity,\u201d aunt Larie Pidgeon said on Facebook last month.",
      "McDonnell said at Monday's news conference that family reported her missing Nov. 13 and that police took over the case two days later.",
      "On the morning of Nov. 12, police said, Hannah was seen unaccompanied at a Greyhound bus terminal at Union Station, the downtown Los Angeles train depot.",
      "At 12:13 p.m. that day, according to police, U.S. Customs and Border Protection video showed Kobayashi willfully crossing into Mexico at one of the busy land ports in San Diego. She hasn't been spotted since.",
      "On Monday evening, McDonnell announced that Hannah was voluntarily separated from her day-to-day world and isn\u2019t the subject of trafficking or foul play.",
      "He also said she had luggage that went to New York City rerouted back to Los Angeles International Airport, where she picked it up the day before she crossed into Mexico.",
      "Lt. Douglas Oldfield of the police department\u2019s Missing Persons Unit said at the news conference that investigators who reviewed her social media concluded, but not with total certainty, that Kobayashi \"wanted to disconnect.\"",
      "Relatives, including Kobayashi's father, Ryan, gathered in Los Angeles starting in mid-November to direct volunteer search efforts, they said.",
      "On Nov. 24, her father died by suicide near Los Angeles International Airport.",
      "\"I\u2019m very sorry to the family for all that they\u2019ve been through,\" McDonnell said Monday evening.",
      "Relatives and supporters paused their Facebook page on the search for Kobayashi, \"Help Us Find Hannah,\" saying in a statement Sunday that it was a channel for attacks and threats targeting relatives.",
      "Other relatives indicated the news that Kobayashi may be isolating herself from her everyday world hasn\u2019t detoured their search.",
      "\u201cWe want answers and a resolution that ensures Hannah\u2019s safety and urge law enforcement and the public to stay focused on finding her and to avoid speculative conclusions,\" the family said in its statement Tuesday.",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 23:31:02 GMT",
    "summary": "Short bursts of movement throughout the day \u2014 no matter how small \u2014 can help the heart, especially for women, research published Tuesday found.",
    "story": [
      "Short bursts of movement throughout the day \u2014 no matter how small \u2014 can help the heart, especially for women, research published Tuesday found.",
      "The study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, found that, in people who didn\u2019t exercise, these short bursts of vigorous activity in everyday life, such as carrying a load of groceries to the car or going up a flight of stairs, can have a big effect on heart disease risk.",
      "The research adds to a growing body of evidence showing that even small amounts of exercise are good for health. And it may be particularly beneficial, experts say, in the U.S., where about one-quarter of Americans don\u2019t do any physical activity outside of work, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\u201cThe big takeaway is, it doesn\u2019t matter how you move, all that matters is that you move more,\u201d said Dr. Meagan Wasfy, a sports cardiologist at Mass General Brigham in Boston who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study.",
      "The study looked at data from about 22,000 people ages 40 to 69 from the UK Biobank who were self-proclaimed \u201cnonexercisers.\u201d Everyone wore an activity tracker for one week in\u00a0 2013 to 2015. On average, men in the study did 11 short bursts of vigorous activity during the day, some which lasted less than a minute, and women did about nine. Vigorous activity meant it was high intensity, said Emmanuel Stamatakis, a professor of physical activity, lifestyle and population health at the University of Sydney, who led the study.",
      "The researchers then looked for any instances of heart attacks, heart failure or stroke through November 2022. A relatively small number of people \u2014 about 800 \u2014 had one of these major heart problems during the follow-up period. Women who got just under 3.5 minutes of vigorous movement a day, however, were found to have a 45% lower risk of any of the heart problems than women who didn\u2019t log any vigorous movement throughout the day.",
      "Most notably, these women were more than 50% less likely to have a heart attack and nearly 70% less likely to develop heart failure than women who did not log any vigorous activity.",
      "Men saw a smaller benefit. Getting about 5.5 minutes of vigorous movement per day reduced their risk of a major heart problem by 16%. When the researchers parsed out individual heart conditions, however, such as heart attack or stroke, there wasn\u2019t a clear benefit.",
      "Small bursts of activity in everyday life have the biggest positive effect on people who don\u2019t already regularly exercise, Wasfy, of Boston\u2019s Mass General Brigham, said.",
      "\u201cYou get the most benefits for cardiovascular disease risk when you go from not moving at all to doing any movement,\u201d she said.",
      "Women also get more \u201cbang for their buck\u201d as far as minutes spent doing physical activity, which can explain why women in the study, who got fewer minutes of vigorous activity, saw greater improvements in their risk for heart disease.",
      "\u201cWomen can accrue the same benefits of exercise as men but at lower doses,\u201d Wasfy said.",
      "One key way short bursts of activity improve heart health is by breaking up long periods of sedentary behavior, said Carol Ewing Garber, a professor of movement science and education at Columbia University in New York City.",
      "\u201cIf people break up their activity throughout the day, this can have a very powerful effect on things like blood glucose levels,\u201d Garber said, recommending that people who work desk jobs regularly get up and take a walk.",
      "Garber stressed that people should still strive to get at least 150 minutes of deliberate exercise every week.",
      "\u201cI would hate for people to think they can just do this for one or two minutes a day and be scot-free from heart disease,\u201d he said.",
      "Stamatakis, the study\u2019s author, said that people should aim to make these unplanned, short bursts of activity part of daily life.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about regular and frequent behavior, not something that is a quick fix that people can do once every few days,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe most important aspect is not the small amounts of activity,\u201d Stamatakis said. \u201cThe most important finding is the consistency of the activity.\u201d"

      "Two months ago, Haris Mujezinovic and Charlie Miller, who played for the Hoosiers in the 1990s under legendary coach\u00a0Bob Knight, sued in U.S. District Court for Southern Indiana. They alleged that their coaches and trainers were aware that Bomba was subjecting basketball players to unnecessary prostate examinations and did nothing to stop him.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Opposition lawmakers in South Korea moved to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday after he shocked the East Asian democracy by declaring martial law only to lift the order hours later under intense pressure.",
      "Six opposition parties, led by the Democratic Party that controls the parliament, submitted articles of impeachment against Yoon on Wednesday afternoon local time, swiftly responding to what the Democratic Party called the Yoon administration\u2019s \u201cunconstitutional and illegal declaration of martial law.\u201d",
      "Voting on the Yoon impeachment motion, which requires a two-thirds majority vote by members of the unicameral legislature to pass, could take place as early as Friday or Saturday. The Constitutional Court would then hold a trial to determine whether to confirm the impeachment motion.",
      "The Democratic Party will also start impeachment proceedings against Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun and Interior Minister Lee Sang-min, said Cho Seung-rae, the Democrats\u2019 chief spokesperson, adding that all three officials should also be charged with insurrection.",
      "Insurrection charges will also be filed against the martial law commander, Gen. Park Ahn-soo, National Police Commissioner Yoon Hee-keun and other key military and police participants, Cho said.",
      "The leader of Yoon\u2019s People Power Party (PPP), Han Dong-hoon, said the six hours of martial law \u201cnearly brought the nation to a halt,\u201d and that the party \u201crespects and abides by the spirit of our constitution.\u201d",
      "He said PPP officials were discussing whether Yoon should leave the party, but he stopped short of saying Yoon should step down as president, saying the party would investigate the full circumstances.",
      "Government officials rushed to reassure South Koreans, many of whom slept through the country\u2019s six hours of martial law, which began late Tuesday night and ended by Wednesday morning.",

      "\u201cWe continue to expect political disagreements to be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law,\u201d Blinken said in a statement.",
      "The South Korean stock market opened as normal on Wednesday, with stocks down about 2% in early trading, CNBC reported. South Korea\u2019s currency, the won, strengthened against the dollar in early trading but stayed close to the two-year low it hit late Tuesday after Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration.",
      "At a news conference in Seoul, officials from the S&P credit rating agency said the brief period of martial law was not expected to have an impact on South Korea\u2019s credit rating.",
      "Yoon, whose conservative government took office in 2022, has seen his approval ratings drop as he struggles to advance his agenda against the opposition Democratic Party, which controls parliament. Democratic lawmakers have sought to impeach multiple government officials and are in a fight with Yoon over next year\u2019s budget.",
      "Yoon made the surprise martial law announcement in a late-night TV address on Tuesday, accusing opposition lawmakers of paralyzing the government and saying he was declaring a state of emergency \u201cin order to protect the constitutional order based on freedom and eradicate shameful pro-North Korea anti-state groups, that are stealing freedom and happiness of our people.\u201d",
      "Yoon, who takes a harder line on North Korea than his Democratic Party predecessor, said his order would also protect South Korea from the nuclear-armed communist state, with which the South technically remains at war.",
      "Soon after Yoon\u2019s announcement, a martial law proclamation stated that all political activities, including demonstrations and the operations of the National Assembly, were prohibited. It also declared all media and publications under the control of the Martial Law Command, and ordered the country\u2019s striking doctors to return to work within 48 hours.",
      "It was the first time since 1980 that martial law had been declared in South Korea, a country of 50 million people that spent decades under military-authoritarian rule but has since transitioned into a vibrant democracy and the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy.",
      "U.S. officials said Tuesday that they had not been notified in advance about Yoon\u2019s announcement, but affirmed the \u201cironclad\u201d nature of the U.S. alliance with South Korea, which hosts about 28,500 American troops.",
      "Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said the martial law order had \u201cessentially no impact\u201d on U.S. forces.",
      "Within minutes of Yoon\u2019s announcement, lawmakers began arriving at the National Assembly in central Seoul, where police blocked them from entering. The Ministry of National Defense also deployed between 200 and 300 armed troops to the National Assembly grounds via helicopter, Kim Min-gi, secretary-general of the National Assembly, said Wednesday.",
      "Throngs of protesters also arrived at the building in opposition to the martial law declaration.",
      "Within a few hours lawmakers passed a resolution to nullify Yoon\u2019s declaration, and soldiers promptly followed an order to leave the National Assembly. Yoon\u2019s People Power Party urged the president to accept lawmakers\u2019 decision and rescind the martial law order.",
      "In a televised address to the nation as dawn approached, Yoon said he had accepted the National Assembly resolution and that martial law would be lifted as soon as a quorum of cabinet members could be reached at the odd hour.",
      "\u201cHaving said that, I strongly urge the National Assembly to immediately cease the repeated acts of impeachment, legislative manipulation and budgetary sabotage that paralyze the nation\u2019s functions,\u201d he said.",
      "The martial law order was lifted around 4:30 a.m. Wednesday local time (2:30 p.m. Tuesday ET). South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said deployed troops returned at 4:22 a.m. and that no unusual activity had been detected from North Korea.",

      "The sister of 30-year-old Hannah Kobayashi said Tuesday the police conclusion that she is a \"voluntary missing person\" is not satisfactory.",
      "Appearing with family lawyer Sara Azari on NBC News NOW's \"Top Story With Tom Llamas,\" Sydni Kobayashi said relatives should have been shown the video that Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said shows Hannah crossing into Mexico alone at a pedestrian port of entry in San Diego on Nov. 12.",
      "McDonnell said that there\u2019s not much more the department can do and that it has classified the case as one of a voluntary detachment with no foul play suspected.",
      "\"We're just as confused and just as frustrated more than anything now,\" Sydni Kobayashi said.",
      "Azari agreed, questioning how police could come to such a conclusion without involving those closest to Hannah, who disappeared after she landed at Los Angeles International Airport from Honolulu on Nov. 8 and missed a connecting flight to her final destination, New York City.",
      "\"They just reached this conclusion \u2026 without showing them any footage,\" Azari said, referring to family members. \"It takes a lot more digging and investigation to be able to say it's voluntary.\"",
      "Sydni Kobayashi said she fears Hannah, who's from Maui, may be the victim of human trafficking, which McDonnell said Monday isn\u2019t suspected. She said she can't see how Hannah can remain out of touch nearly a month after she left Hawaii.",

      "Los Angeles police didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.",

      "\"The search is far from over, and we are committed to doing everything possible to bring her home safely,\u201d the statement said.",
      "McDonnell said Monday at a news conference that he saw the need for relatives to communicate with Hannah, and he urged her to reach out.",
      "\"She has a right to her privacy, and we respect her choices, but we also understand the concern her loved ones feel for her,\" he said. \"A simple message could reassure those who care about her.\"",
      "After she missed her connecting flight, Hannah spent the next few days sightseeing in Los Angeles, sending texts that a family member described as \"alarming\" and being seen on security video with an unknown man, according to a family timeline on Facebook and other statements made by relatives.",
      "\u201cHannah\u2019s last message to us was alarming \u2014 she mentioned feeling scared, and that someone might be trying to steal her money and identity,\u201d aunt Larie Pidgeon said on Facebook last month.",
      "McDonnell said at Monday's news conference that family reported her missing Nov. 13 and that police took over the case two days later.",
      "On the morning of Nov. 12, police said, Hannah was seen unaccompanied at a Greyhound bus terminal at Union Station, the downtown Los Angeles train depot.",
      "At 12:13 p.m. that day, according to police, U.S. Customs and Border Protection video showed Kobayashi willfully crossing into Mexico at one of the busy land ports in San Diego. She hasn't been spotted since.",
      "On Monday evening, McDonnell announced that Hannah was voluntarily separated from her day-to-day world and isn\u2019t the subject of trafficking or foul play.",
      "He also said she had luggage that went to New York City rerouted back to Los Angeles International Airport, where she picked it up the day before she crossed into Mexico.",
      "Lt. Douglas Oldfield of the police department\u2019s Missing Persons Unit said at the news conference that investigators who reviewed her social media concluded, but not with total certainty, that Kobayashi \"wanted to disconnect.\"",
      "Relatives, including Kobayashi's father, Ryan, gathered in Los Angeles starting in mid-November to direct volunteer search efforts, they said.",
      "On Nov. 24, her father died by suicide near Los Angeles International Airport.",

      "With the new partnership, the IWF can effectively scan Telegram for exact matches of child sexual abuse material in its databases and automatically block it, the IWF said in a news release.

      "Rep. David Bedey was among the four Republicans who voted against the measure, arguing that the Legislature\u2019s rules are intended to allow the body to act on behalf of Montanans in an efficient manner.",
      "\u201cThis particular action will have the effect of making people famous in the national news and will not contribute to the effective conduct of our business,\u201d Bedey said before Tuesday\u2019s vote. He added that restroom access wasn\u2019t an issue for the female legislators he spoke with in the last legislative session.",
      "Rep. Brad Barker, also a Republican, agreed with Bedey, saying the issue was becoming \u201ca distraction.\u201d",
      "Republican Rep. Jedediah Hinkle supported the measure, saying that the Legislature has only one trans legislator but that it could have more in the future.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s time this body addresses this issue now as they are addressing it nationally,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to set that precedent right now that women have their spaces and they need to be comfortable in those spaces, and I think we ought to stand up for them.\u201d",
      "Hinkle appeared to be alluding to a recent debate in the U.S. Capitol following Delaware\u2019s election of Sarah McBride, who will become the country\u2019s first openly transgender member of Congress next month.",
      "Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., introduced a resolution last month to prohibit any lawmakers and House employees from \u201cusing single-sex facilities other than those corresponding to their biological sex.\u201d In remarks that misgendered her, Mace told reporters that the measure was, indeed, intended to target McBride, adding\u00a0that she is \u201cabsolutely 100% going to stand in the way of any man who wants to be in a women\u2019s restroom, in our locker rooms, in our changing rooms.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cI will be there fighting you every step of the way.\u201d",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he supports Mace\u2019s effort, though his statement of support doesn\u2019t formally change the rules package for the new congressional session, which starts in January.",
      "On Nov. 20, McBride responded to Mace\u2019s proposal and Johnson\u2019s response, writing on X:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not here to fight about bathrooms. I\u2019m here to fight for Delawareans and to bring down costs facing families. Like all members, I will follow the rules as outlined by Speaker Johnson, even if I disagree with them.",
      "She added, \u201cThis effort to distract from the real issues facing this country hasn\u2019t distracted me over the last several days, as I\u2019ve remained hard at work preparing to represent the greatest state in the union come January.\u201d",
      "In the days following McBride\u2019s statement, Zephyr encouraged her not to \u201ccede ground.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen we see policies targeting trans women just trying to live their lives in the restroom, trying to play sports with their friends \u2014 that is not where the hate stops from the right,\u201d Zephyr said in an interview with Scripps News at the time. \u201cThat hate is on display at every moment, which is why it\u2019s important for us to resist these efforts to target our community.\u201d"

    "summary": "Even with their success, this election revealed a challenge for Republicans going forward: The \u201cTrump coalition\u201d and the \u201cGOP coalition\u201d are not quite the same.",
    "story": [
      "Welcome to the online version of\u00a0From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "In today\u2019s edition, national political correspondent explains why Republicans may not be able to bank on Donald Trump's coalition moving forward. Plus, Republican senators grow skeptical of the president-elect's pick to lead the Defense Department.",
      "Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.",
      "The GOP\u2019s post-election challenge: Turning Trump voters into full-fledged Republicans",
      "Even with their success, this election revealed a challenge for Republicans going forward: The \u201cTrump coalition\u201d and the \u201cGOP coalition\u201d are not quite the same.",
      "By driving up support even further with white blue-collar voters and earning substantial new backing from nonwhite, young and first-time voters, President-elect Donald Trump swept the battleground states and secured a national popular vote victory.",
      "But in the five battlegrounds that also featured Senate races, GOP candidates all received far fewer votes than Trump \u2014 enough to cost the party four of them (and nearly all five). While it\u2019s customary for fewer total votes to be cast in down-ballot races, the drop-off was notably worse for Republicans than for the Democratic Senate candidates.",
      "Individual candidate and campaign dynamics can certainly account for some of this. In Arizona, for instance, Republican Kari Lake\u2019s broad unpopularity clearly gave an extra boost to Democrat Ruben Gallego, who actually received more votes than Vice President Kamala Harris did at the top of their party\u2019s ticket.",
      "But taken as a whole, the overall pattern is striking \u2014 especially in light of recent history. In the two previous presidential elections combined, just one state produced a split White House/Senate outcome. That was in Maine in 2020, when voters re-elected Republican Sen. Susan Collins while backing Democrat Joe Biden for president.",
      "There are likely several factors at work here, but two stand out as potential longer-term issues for the GOP.",
      "The first involves voters who were motivated to turn out for Trump, but then skipped all of the other races on the ballot. There\u2019s some evidence for this. My colleague Scott Bland found that in Nevada\u2019s Washoe County, the second largest in the state, 6.6% of Trump\u2019s voters either left the Senate race blank or went with a third-party candidate (or used the state\u2019s unique \u201cnone of these candidates\u201d option). Meanwhile, 4.9% of Harris\u2019 voters did the same.",
      "This only accounts for a small portion of the GOP drop-off in Nevada, but it\u2019s a result that\u2019s consistent with a feature of our NBC News polling this year. We found Trump faring best with infrequent voters (posting a 15-point advantage among those who hadn\u2019t voted in 2020) who expressed a lower level of interest in the election and were disproportionately young, nonwhite and male. It\u2019s plausible that a significant number of these people ended up being \u201cTrump-only\u201d voters, raising the question of whether the GOP can convert them into full-fledged Republican voters in the future, when Trump won\u2019t be on the ballot.",
      "The other factor the GOP will need to address involves Democratic defectors \u2014 traditionally Democratic voters who have essentially made an exception for Trump.",
      "This appears to have been at work in Wisconsin, where Trump won by about 30,000 votes even as Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin was re-elected by roughly the same margin. The drop-off from Trump to his party\u2019s Senate candidate (Eric Hovde) was most pronounced in rural, blue-collar counties, many of which had been Democratic territory until Trump\u2019s emergence. Here Trump expanded his support even further, which was key to his statewide victory, but those gains didn\u2019t trickle down the ballot.",
      "Republicans will need to find a way to make that happen in the future \u2014 without Trump.",
      "Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary is in peril in the Senate",
      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Defense Department, Pete Hegseth, is in peril as Senate Republicans grow increasingly concerned over reports about his alleged drinking and treatment of women.",
      "As many as six Senate Republicans, perhaps more, are currently not comfortable supporting Hegseth\u2019s bid to lead the Pentagon as new revelations about the former Fox News anchor\u2019s past continue to be made public, three Republican sources with direct knowledge of his nomination process tell NBC News. Given Republicans\u2019 slim Senate majority in the next Congress, Hegseth can only afford to lose three GOP votes, assuming all Democrats vote against him.",
      "Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who sits on the Armed Services Committee, would not commit to supporting Hegseth\u2019s nomination and said she planned to grill\u00a0him about news accounts of his alleged alcohol abuse, mistreatment of women and financial mismanagement.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just going to have a really frank and thorough conversation,\u201d Ernst said of Hegseth\u2019s nomination process.",
      "Hegseth, an Army National Guard veteran, was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in California in 2017, according to a police report made public after Trump announced he would nominate the former Fox host for defense secretary. Hegseth was not charged and denied the woman\u2019s allegations, stating the encounter was consensual, although he did pay an undisclosed amount as part of a settlement with her.",
      "Separately, NBC News reported on Tuesday that Hegseth\u2019s drinking concerned his colleagues at Fox News, according to 10 current and former Fox employees. Two of them said that Hegseth smelled of alcohol before he went on air on more than a dozen occasions. Hegseth did not respond when asked for comment on those allegations Tuesday evening at the Capitol.",
      "The initial allegations against Hegseth last month did not appear to put his planned nomination in danger. After his first round of meetings on Capitol Hill last month, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the chair of the Armed Services Committee, said he expected Hegesth to be confirmed. But on Tuesday, after a series of other reports about Hegseth\u2019s past but before NBC News reported on allegations concerning drinking at Fox News, Wicker sounded more cautious.",
      "\u201cI think there are questions that some members have and we\u2019re going to be looking for an answer,\u201d Wicker said.",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 23:31:02 GMT",
    "summary": "Short bursts of movement throughout the day \u2014 no matter how small \u2014 can help the heart, especially for women, research published Tuesday found.",
    "story": [
      "Short bursts of movement throughout the day \u2014 no matter how small \u2014 can help the heart, especially for women, research published Tuesday found.",
      "The study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, found that, in people who didn\u2019t exercise, these short bursts of vigorous activity in everyday life, such as carrying a load of groceries to the car or going up a flight of stairs, can have a big effect on heart disease risk.",
      "The research adds to a growing body of evidence showing that even small amounts of exercise are good for health. And it may be particularly beneficial, experts say, in the U.S., where about one-quarter of Americans don\u2019t do any physical activity outside of work, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\u201cThe big takeaway is, it doesn\u2019t matter how you move, all that matters is that you move more,\u201d said Dr. Meagan Wasfy, a sports cardiologist at Mass General Brigham in Boston who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study.",
      "The study looked at data from about 22,000 people ages 40 to 69 from the UK Biobank who were self-proclaimed \u201cnonexercisers.\u201d Everyone wore an activity tracker for one week in\u00a0 2013 to 2015. On average, men in the study did 11 short bursts of vigorous activity during the day, some which lasted less than a minute, and women did about nine. Vigorous activity meant it was high intensity, said Emmanuel Stamatakis, a professor of physical activity, lifestyle and population health at the University of Sydney, who led the study.",
      "The researchers then looked for any instances of heart attacks, heart failure or stroke through November 2022. A relatively small number of people \u2014 about 800 \u2014 had one of these major heart problems during the follow-up period. Women who got just under 3.5 minutes of vigorous movement a day, however, were found to have a 45% lower risk of any of the heart problems than women who didn\u2019t log any vigorous movement throughout the day.",
      "Most notably, these women were more than 50% less likely to have a heart attack and nearly 70% less likely to develop heart failure than women who did not log any vigorous activity.",
      "Men saw a smaller benefit. Getting about 5.5 minutes of vigorous movement per day reduced their risk of a major heart problem by 16%. When the researchers parsed out individual heart conditions, however, such as heart attack or stroke, there wasn\u2019t a clear benefit.",
      "Small bursts of activity in everyday life have the biggest positive effect on people who don\u2019t already regularly exercise, Wasfy, of Boston\u2019s Mass General Brigham, said.",
      "\u201cYou get the most benefits for cardiovascular disease risk when you go from not moving at all to doing any movement,\u201d she said.",
      "Women also get more \u201cbang for their buck\u201d as far as minutes spent doing physical activity, which can explain why women in the study, who got fewer minutes of vigorous activity, saw greater improvements in their risk for heart disease.",
      "\u201cWomen can accrue the same benefits of exercise as men but at lower doses,\u201d Wasfy said.",
      "One key way short bursts of activity improve heart health is by breaking up long periods of sedentary behavior, said Carol Ewing Garber, a professor of movement science and education at Columbia University in New York City.",
      "\u201cIf people break up their activity throughout the day, this can have a very powerful effect on things like blood glucose levels,\u201d Garber said, recommending that people who work desk jobs regularly get up and take a walk.",
      "Garber stressed that people should still strive to get at least 150 minutes of deliberate exercise every week.",
      "\u201cI would hate for people to think they can just do this for one or two minutes a day and be scot-free from heart disease,\u201d he said.",
      "Stamatakis, the study\u2019s author, said that people should aim to make these unplanned, short bursts of activity part of daily life.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about regular and frequent behavior, not something that is a quick fix that people can do once every few days,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe most important aspect is not the small amounts of activity,\u201d Stamatakis said. \u201cThe most important finding is the consistency of the activity.\u201d"

      "The 88-year-old doctor accused of\u00a0sexually assaulting Indiana University\u00a0basketball players in the 1990s will be deposed Wednesday after a judge ruled he was competent to be questioned about the allegations.",
      "Dr. Bradford Bomba Sr. \u201cwas able to accurately identify the difference between the truth and a lie,\u201d U.S. Magistrate Judge Mario Garcia\u00a0wrote in a ruling Tuesday after Bomba was questioned at the federal courthouse in Indianapolis.",

      "The judge disagreed.",

      "Two months ago, Haris Mujezinovic and Charlie Miller, who played for the Hoosiers in the 1990s under legendary coach\u00a0Bob Knight, sued in U.S. District Court for Southern Indiana. They alleged that their coaches and trainers were aware that Bomba was subjecting basketball players to unnecessary prostate examinations and did nothing to stop him.",
      "Kathleen Delaney, who represents Mujezinovic and Miller, said in the lawsuit that there could be \u201cat least one hundred\u201d alleged victims.",

      "Neither Knight, who died last year\u00a0at age 83, nor Bomba was listed as a defendant.",
      "Delaney declined to comment Tuesday on the latest legal development but confirmed that all of the lawyers involved agreed to conduct the deposition at the offices of William J. Beggs, the Bloomington, Indiana, lawyer who is representing Bomba.",
      "Beggs did not respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Indiana University is represented by the Indianapolis-based Barnes & Thornburg law firm, university spokesperson Mark Bode wrote in an email.",
      "The university hired Bomba to provide medical care to all its sports teams from 1962 to 1970, and from 1979 until the late 1990s he was the basketball team\u2019s doctor, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Mujezinovic and Miller said in their lawsuit that they \u201cwere routinely and repeatedly subjected to medically unnecessary, invasive, and abusive digital rectal examinations\u201d by Bomba.",
      "Bomba had\u00a0played football for Indiana University\u00a0and was nicknamed \u201cFrankenstein\u201d by coaches and players \u201cdue to the large size of his hands and fingers,\u201d the lawsuit added.",
      "\u201cDr. Bomba, Sr.\u2019s routine sexual assaults were openly discussed by the Hoosier men\u2019s basketball players in the locker room in the presence of IU employees, including assistant coaches, athletic trainers, and other Hoosier men\u2019s basketball staff,\u201d according to the lawsuit.",
      "Mujezinovic, who spent two seasons at Indiana from 1995 to 1997, and Miller, who played for the Hoosiers from 1994 through 1998, seek unspecified damages. They have also urged former teammates to come forward and join their lawsuit.",
      "The accusations that the university turned a blind eye to allegations that a team doctor was sexually abusing players echo a scandal involving a team doctor at a rival school.

      "Chad Chronister, President-elect Donald Trump's selection to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration, said Tuesday that he would withdraw from consideration.",
      "Chronister, who is the sheriff in Hillsborough County, Florida, said he would turn down Trump's planned nomination to be the next DEA administrator just three days after Trump announced it.",
      "He is the second of Trump's administration picks to take his name out of the running, after former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., dropped his bid to become attorney general last month.",
      "Chronister is a longtime Florida law enforcement official whose father-in-law is Edward DeBartolo Jr., the former owner of the San Francisco 49ers. The pick was widely praised by Republicans in Florida, including by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "But Chronister ran into a series of hurdles from Trump\u2019s political base because of how he handled the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 particularly his decision in 2020 to arrest Ronald Howard-Browne, a Tampa-area pastor, for the decision to flout pandemic-era lockdown orders. The charges were ultimately dropped.",
      "\"To have been nominated by President-Elect @realDonaldTrump to serve as Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration is the honor of a lifetime,\" Chronister wrote on X on Tuesday evening. \"Over the past several days, as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in, I\u2019ve concluded that I must respectfully withdraw from consideration.\"",
      "Chronister cited ongoing work that's needed in serving the people of Hillsborough County \"and a lot of initiatives I am committed to fulfilling.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Trump's transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump had tapped Chronister to be DEA administrator, a role within the Justice Department that requires Senate confirmation, over the weekend.",
      "Trump said Saturday on Truth Social that Chronister \"will work with our great Attorney General, Pam Bondi, to secure the Border, stop the flow of Fentanyl, and other Illegal Drugs, across the Southern Border, and SAVE LIVES.\"",
      "Chronister responded favorably to the intended nomination Saturday on X, writing, \u201cI am deeply humbled by this opportunity to serve our nation.\u201d",
      "Chronister was appointed sheriff by then-Gov. Rick Scott, who is now in the Senate, in 2017. Chronister has worked in the Hillsborough County Sheriff\u2019s Office for 28 years, according to the sheriff's website.",
      "Florida Republicans largely saw Chronister as a top-tier pick for Trump, but on late Tuesday, after he withdrew his name, many said they understood the rationale.",
      "\u201cHe was a target for the Covid stuff,\u201d a longtime Florida Republican said. \u201cHe is someone who is seen as a great sheriff here, but there were reasons I think that he got caught up in all this.\u201d",
      "Shortly after Trump nominated Chronister, his Covid-era track record became an immediate problem, but because DeSantis supported his nomination, he avoided Florida-level pushback.",
      "Congressional Republicans, though, were not as forgiving.",
      "\"This sheriff ordered the arrest of a pastor for holding services during the COVID panic. He was tapped by Trump to head the DEA,\" Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., said on X. \"Glad to see him withdraw from consideration. Next time politicians lose their ever-lovin minds, he can redeem himself by following the Constitution.\"",
      "Reached for comment, a spokesperson for the sheriff's office referred NBC News to Chronister's statement on X but did not respond to questions about whether the criticism played a role in Chronister's decision.",
      "Chronister told reporters in March 2020 that he sought an arrest warrant for the pastor because his \u201creckless disregard for human life put hundreds of people from his congregation at risk\u201d and threatened \u201cthousands of residents who may interact with them this week.\u201d",
      "Chronister is not the first of Trump's picks to withdraw his name from consideration for a post in his second term.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Defense Department, Pete Hegseth, is in peril over allegations concerning drinking and his treatment of women.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Defense Department, Pete Hegseth, is in peril as Senate Republicans grow increasingly concerned over allegations of drinking and reports about his treatment of women.",
      "As many as six Senate Republicans, perhaps more, are currently not comfortable supporting Hegseth's bid to lead the Pentagon as new revelations about his past continue to be made public, three Republican sources with direct knowledge of his nomination process said. Given Republicans' slim Senate majority in the next Congress, Hegseth, a former Fox News host, can afford to lose only three GOP votes, assuming all Democrats vote against him.",
      "Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who is on the Armed Services Committee, would not commit to support Hegseth's nomination and said she planned to grill him about news accounts of allegations of alcohol abuse, mistreatment of woman and financial mismanagement.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just going to have a really frank and thorough conversation,\u201d Ernst said.",
      "Hegseth, an Army National Guard veteran, was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in California in 2017, according to a police report made public after Trump announced he would nominate him for defense secretary. Hegseth, who was not charged, denied the woman's allegations, saying the encounter was consensual, although he did pay an undisclosed amount\u00a0as part of a settlement with her.",
      "Separately, NBC News reported Tuesday that Hegseth's drinking concerned his colleagues at Fox News, according to 10 current and former Fox employees. Two of them said Hegseth smelled of alcohol before he went on air on more than a dozen occasions. Hegseth did not respond when he was asked for comment on those allegations Tuesday evening at the Capitol.",
      "The initial allegations last month did not appear to put Hegseth\u2019s planned nomination in danger. After his first round of meetings on Capitol Hill last month, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the chair of the Armed Services Committee, said he expected Hegseth to be confirmed. On Tuesday, after a series of other reports about Hegseth\u2019s past but before NBC News reported on allegations concerning drinking at Fox News, Wicker sounded more cautious.",
      "\u201cI think there are questions that some members have, and we\u2019re going to be looking for an answer,\u201d Wicker said.",
      "The New Yorker published a story Sunday about a previously undisclosed 2015 whistleblower\u2019s report from a veterans\u2019 organization Hegseth ran, which claimed he was repeatedly intoxicated on the job. NBC News has not seen the report, which was shared with the nonprofit group\u2019s leadership, and Hegseth's lawyer did not respond to a request for comment on the article Monday. In a statement the lawyer provided to The New Yorker, an unidentified\u00a0Hegseth adviser called the claims \u201coutlandish\u201d and said they came from a \u201cpetty and jealous disgruntled former associate.\u201d",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he is still open to supporting Hegseth and believes he deserves a fair vetting, but he said Tuesday that Hegseth must explain media reports about his past conduct in a way that would make senators comfortable voting to confirm him.",
      "\u201cWe got a process where he can be asked questions. The articles I\u2019ve read, yeah, some of them are concerning,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it's true or not, but he\u2019ll go through the process. He\u2019ll be asked about it. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d",
      "Hegseth was on Capitol Hill on Tuesday meeting with multiple senators. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Another Trump pick to fill out his Cabinet dropped out of contention last month amid opposition from Senate Republicans. Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., had been Trump's choice for attorney general, but at least five Senate Republicans were prepared to vote against him, five people with direct knowledge told NBC News at the time, because of allegations of sexual misconduct with a minor (which Gaetz has denied and was not charged with).",
      "Several Republican senators have continued to downplay the allegations, saying they support Trump\u2019s prerogative to pick his own Cabinet.",
      "Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., called the allegations a \u201cside issue\u201d on Monday, saying Hegseth \"has earned a great deal of credibility.\"",
      "\"Are soldiers sometimes wild childs? Yeah, that can happen,\u201d Lummis said when she was asked whether the allegations concern her. \u201cBut it is very clear that this guy is the guy who, at a time when Americans are losing confidence in their own military, in our ability to project strength around the world, that Pete Hegseth is the answer to that concern.\u201d",
      "Asked Tuesday to respond to the allegations of womanizing and alcohol abuse, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, responded: \u201cThat would not be novel in Washington, D.C.\""

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., is forcing a floor vote this week to require the House Ethics Committee to release a report on its yearslong investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.",
      "Casten introduced a resolution Tuesday that would force the bipartisan ethics panel to act. Because the resolution is \u201cprivileged,\u201d it must be brought to the floor within two legislative days for a vote.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump named Gaetz, his close ally, as his pick for attorney general on Nov. 13. Gaetz also resigned from Congress that day.",
      "But Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration a little more than a week later over opposition from GOP senators, largely related to the ethics probe into allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
      "Gaetz has repeatedly denied he did anything improper or illegal.",
      "Before Gaetz bowed out, the Ethics Committee \u2014 five Republicans and five Democrats \u2014 had deliberated behind closed doors and ultimately deadlocked along party lines over making the report public. But Ethics Committee Chairman Michael Guest, R-Miss., said Gaetz's withdrawal \u201cshould end the discussion of whether or not the Ethics Committee should continue to move forward in this matter.\u201d",
      "At issue is whether the panel should release a report to the public about a former member of Congress. The committee has jurisdiction only over sitting members of Congress, but there is a precedent decades ago of the committee\u2019s publicizing a report about a former lawmaker months after he resigned from Congress.",
      "On Oct. 5, 1987, Rep. Bill Boner, D-Tenn., resigned to become mayor of Nashville. The Ethics Committee released an\u00a0initial staff report\u00a0the following December examining allegations that Boner misused campaign funds, failed to disclose gifts and accepted bribes.",
      "Casten introduced a similar resolution the week before Thanksgiving, but it expired as the House left for recess. The new version has been updated to include four examples of past instances when the Ethics Committee released reports after members had left office.",
      "\u201cThe Committee on Ethics has, on many occasions, released its reports on former members,\u201d Casten said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cResigning from Congress should not allow Members to avoid accountability for allegations as serious as those faced by Matt Gaetz. Withholding this report from the American people would impede the dignity and integrity of the legislative proceedings of the House.\u201d",
      "Since Gaetz withdrew his name for attorney general, there has been speculation \u2014 some of it fueled by Gaetz himself \u2014 that he could run for governor of Florida in 2026 or join the Trump White House in a position that would not require Senate confirmation."

      "Elizabeth Pollard, 64, has not been heard from since Monday, when authorities believe she fell into the manhole-size opening in Unity Township, roughly 40 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, officials said at a news conference.",
      "After they lowered rover and pole cameras into the former coal mine, authorities heard no sounds but saw what seemed to be a shoe, Pleasant Valley Volunteer Fire Chief John Bacha told reporters.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a modern shoe \u2014 not something you\u2019d find in a coal mine in Marguerite in 1940,\u201d Bacha said, noting the area where the sinkhole was discovered.",
      "He added that authorities are \u201cfairly confident that we\u2019re doing the right thing in the right place at this point.\u201d",
      "It isn\u2019t clear whether Pollard has a phone. State Police Trooper Steve Limani said officials have been unable to reach her.",
      "Officials learned that Pollard was missing after a relative called 911 around 1 a.m. Tuesday and reported not having heard from her since she'd gone to look for her cat the previous afternoon, Limani told reporters.",
      "Troopers discovered her car behind a local restaurant, Limani said. Inside was her 5-year-old granddaughter, who'd been there since 5 p.m. the previous day, Limani said.",
      "\"Thank God she stayed in the car,\" Limani said, noting that despite frigid temperatures the girl was in good condition.",

      "Because of the shaft's uncertain condition, Bacha said, authorities have to respond carefully. Although the circumference of the opening is only the size of a manhole, it quickly becomes significantly wider and challenging to traverse, he said.",
      "For now, Bacha said, the conditions appear favorable, with temperatures that are warmer than above ground and oxygen levels that have remained stable.",
      "Limani said he remains hopeful that the mission will end with a rescue.",

      "Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary, drank in ways that concerned his colleagues at Fox News, according to 10 current and former Fox employees who spoke with NBC News.",
      "Two of those people said that on more than a dozen occasions during Hegseth\u2019s time as a co-host of \u201cFox & Friends Weekend,\u201d which began in 2017, they smelled alcohol on him before he went on air. Those same two people, plus another, said that during his time there he appeared on television after they\u2019d heard him talk about being hungover as he was getting ready or on set.",
      "One of the sources said they smelled alcohol on him as recently as last month and heard him complain about being hungover this fall.",
      "None of the sources with whom NBC News has spoken could recall an instance when Hegseth missed a scheduled appearance because he\u2019d been drinking.",
      "\"Everyone would be talking about it behind the scenes before he went on the air,\u201d one of the former Fox employees said.",
      "On Sunday night, The New Yorker detailed concerns about Hegseth\u2019s drinking at two jobs he held at nonprofit veterans\u2019 groups before he joined Fox. \u201cA previously undisclosed whistle-blower report on Hegseth\u2019s tenure as the president of Concerned Veterans for America, from 2013 until 2016, describes him as being repeatedly intoxicated while acting in his official capacity \u2014 to the point of needing to be carried out of the organization\u2019s events,\u201d the magazine reported.",
      "According to The New Yorker, Tim Parlatore, a lawyer for Hegseth, responded: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to comment on outlandish claims laundered through The New Yorker by a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate of Mr. Hegseth\u2019s. Get back to us when you try your first attempt at actual journalism.\u201d",
      "This account of Hegseth\u2019s time at Fox News is based on NBC News interviews with three current and seven former Fox employees, all of whom asked not to be named because of fear of retaliation.",
      "Three current employees said his drinking remained a concern up until Trump announced him as his choice to run the Pentagon, at which point Hegseth left Fox.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s such a charming guy, but he just acted like the rules didn\u2019t apply to him,\u201d one of the former employees said.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump transition team said: \u201cThese disgusting allegations are completely unfounded and false, and anyone peddling these defamatory lies to score political cheap shots is sickening. As a decorated combat veteran, Pete has never done anything to jeopardize that, and he is treating his nomination as the most important deployment of his life.\u201d",
      "Parlatore, Hegseth's lawyer, referred NBC News to the statement from the Trump transition spokesperson. Fox News did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Round-the-clock duties",
      "The former colleagues\u2019 descriptions of Hegseth\u2019s behavior while he was employed at Fox News raise questions about his ability to carry out the round-the-clock duties involved in managing the Pentagon and its 3 million civilian and military employees.",
      "A secretary of defense is generally working at all hours and might need to respond to a crisis that arises suddenly at night or on a weekend.",
      "In February 2023, while he was traveling in Manila on the kind of trip that often requires socializing with other high-level officials, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was awakened at 3 a.m. local time for a phone call about a Chinese spy balloon flying over the continental U.S.",
      "Similarly, the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel began around midnight ET.",
      "And the Defense Department is responsible for protecting U.S. cities and infrastructure from potential airborne threats similar to the 9/11 attacks. At any time, day or night, the defense secretary might be called upon to decide whether a civilian aircraft should be shot down. The wrong decision could mean the deaths of innocent people.",
      "\u201cFor the sake of national security, I really hope he has stopped drinking,\u201d one of the former Fox employees said.",
      "\u201cHe should not be secretary of defense,\u201d another former Fox employee said. \u201cHis drinking should be disqualifying.\u201d",
      "In 1989, the Senate rejected President George H.W. Bush\u2019s nominee to be defense secretary, former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, in part over concerns about Tower\u2019s history of drinking.",
      "As a co-host, Hegseth needed to be at work early on weekend mornings. For a show that began at 6 a.m. ET, his female co-hosts would come in around 4 a.m. to prepare and have their hair and makeup done; male co-hosts typically arrived around 5 or 5:15 a.m., 45 minutes before they went on air, three sources said.",
      "One current and two former Fox employees said they felt like they needed to \u201cbabysit\u201d Hegseth because of his drinking and late nights. \u201cWe\u2019d have to call him to make sure he didn\u2019t oversleep because we knew he\u2019d be out partying the night before,\u201d one of them said. Another said, \u201cMorning TV is stressful, and more times than not Pete made it even more stressful.\u201d",
      "Hegseth sometimes arrived with only 20 minutes or less before the show began, according to those three sources, stressing out his colleagues. They said Hegseth\u2019s makeup would sometimes need to be done while he was on set because his late arrival left his colleagues with so little time. The sources could not say whether his lateness was caused solely by drinking.",
      "The whistleblower report detailed in The New Yorker alleged repeated instances of Hegseth drinking heavily at work events, including a team outing to a strip club in Louisiana in November 2014 in which he became so inebriated that he \u201chad to be restrained\u201d from climbing onstage to dance with the strippers.",
      "Hegseth drank heavily at some social events with Fox News colleagues, as well, according to two former employees, one of whom said he would get \u201cabsolutely wasted.\u201d",
      "Last month, the Monterey, California, Police Department released records of a 2017 investigation into an accusation that Hegseth sexually assaulted a woman in a hotel room following a Republican women\u2019s convention. The accuser, identified in the records as \u201cJane Doe,\u201d said she believed someone may have slipped something into her drink.",
      "Hegseth has denied any wrongdoing, and he was never charged.",
      "\u201cThis police report confirms what I\u2019ve said all along,\u201d Parlatore, Hegseth\u2019s lawyer, told NBC News last month. \u201cThe incident was fully investigated and police found the allegation to be false, which is why no charges were filed.\u201d",
      "Hegseth has also confirmed that he paid the woman an undisclosed settlement. Parlatore previously told NBC News that Hegseth \u201cultimately decided to enter into a settlement for a significantly reduced amount\u201d at the \u201cheight of the MeToo movement.\u201d Parlatore also said his client was \u201cinnocent collateral damage in a lie that the Complainant was holding onto to keep her marriage intact.\u201d"

    "summary": "What happened to Colby in Yellowstone? Denim Richards explains his character Colby's death in Yellowstone and his own reaction.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for \u201cYellowstone.\u201d",
      "\u201cYellowstone\u201d has never exactly been a safe space for characters. Violent, profane and deadly, the Paramount hit (which recently began the second half of its likely-final fifth season), has always had a high body count.",
      "But three deaths of long-term characters in the first four episodes alone! Clearly the show has gone on a killing spree, with the latest coming during Sunday\u2019s \u201cCounting Coup\u201d episode.",
      "Rest in peace, Colby. Here\u2019s how \u2014 and maybe why \u2014 you ultimately had to go.",
      "How did Colby die?",
      "A cast member since the show\u2019s first season, Colby Mayfield (Denim Richards) has been a regular ranch hand for the Duttons. We\u2019ve watched him play poker with the guys, develop a romance with one of the few female hands (Teeter, played by Jennifer Landon), get trampled by a horse while skinny-dipping, and overall be a solid, reliable character. He was also the show's sole Black ranch hand.",
      "Colby's dramatic exit comes soon after he and Teeter finally admitted their love for one another. But it\u2019s fitting: Colby goes out while coming to the aid of someone else.",
      "Carter (Finn Little), the young ranch hand who\u2019s being looked after by Beth (Kelly Reilly) and Rip (Cole Hauser), goes against orders and approaches a black stallion in a stall whose water has spilled.",
      "While helping that horse, Carter comes across a second, wild horse that corners him. Colby creates a distraction and Carter escapes \u2014 but the horse stomps on Colby, killing him. Carter does shoot the wild horse \u2014 but it\u2019s too late for Colby.",
      "After the episode aired, Richards posted on his Instagram with a shot of his on-set director\u2019s chair, complete with folded clothes, boots and hat and the caption, \u201cGrateful.\u201d The show then tagged him on a video from the aftermath of his death with the words, \u201cAbsolutely heartbroken.\u201d",
      "Some fans were left unhappy with the decision. In the comments of \"Yellowstone\" account's post, one Instagram user wrote, \u201cZero reason to kill Colby. Zero\u2026 What\u2019s happened to Yellowstone?\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat was the point?!\u201d wrote another in the same post. \u201cBeyond disappointed and angry. Colby & Teeter\u2019s love story was not only fun but warm & loving.\u201d",
      "Fan @iLEADFARMER wrote on X, \u201cThat was not cool. I hate that they killed Colby. If ANYONE deserved a happy ending when this series ends, it was these two. Felt so bad for Teeter upon hearing the news.\u201d",
      "Others celebrated Colby's legacy. In the comments of Richards' post, one user wrote a long ode to the character.",
      "\"He was the definition of a 'Yellowstone' loyal, a true cowboy at heart whose spirit resonated with every viewer who tuned in. His laughter, camaraderie, and bravery brought warmth to the cold, unforgiving world of the ranch, and his departure has left an undeniable void,\" the comment read, and said later, \"Colby\u2019s journey may have come to an end, but the legacy he leaves behind will echo through the valleys of Yellowstone for seasons to come. As we say goodbye to Colby, we carry with us the lessons of loyalty, love, and resilience.\"",
      "Why did the show kill Colby off? 'It's a dangerous job'",
      "As executive producer Christina Voros (who also directed the first four episodes of this second half of the season) told The Hollywood Reporter, Colby\u2019s death was very much a risk inherent in his profession.",
      "\u201cFor anyone who really understands the lifestyle of cowboys and working with animals and the risks of the job \u2014 and Rip says it about himself \u2014 it\u2019s a dangerous job, and this kind of thing happens and it happens in a split-second,\u201d she said. \u201cThis death comes as a shock because it\u2019s so simple, and it\u2019s so grounded in the world in which all these characters work that it\u2019s profoundly tragic \u2026 and the timing of it is just gut-wrenching.\u201d",
      "In an interview with Entertainment Weekly published the day after the episode aired, Richards shared his own take on his character's death, saying the season is \"really emphasizing the realities of cowboy life.\"",
      "\"We have this saying that everyone\u2019s going to fall off a horse at some point in their life. It\u2019s not if, it\u2019s just when and how bad. That is not a phenomenon. These things do happen, so I do think that there\u2019s that element where I think it is about really wanting to emphasize that this is a reality,\" he said.",
      "He called Colby's death \"poetic\" because in Season 3, Colby is trampled by a multiple horses. \"Maybe this was those horses\u2019 ancestors coming back to get retribution,\" he said.",
      "Who else has died on this season of \u2018Yellowstone\u2019?",
      "Colby\u2019s death comes on the heels of the exits of patriarch John Dutton (Kevin Costner) and fixer-turned-Jamie\u2019s-girlfriend Sarah Atwood (Dawn Olivieri).",
      "Dutton\u2019s farewell wasn\u2019t so much of a surprise, as Costner had already stated he wouldn\u2019t be returning to the show via Instagram reel in June. (He said in a Nov. 11 interview with Michael Smerconish for SiriusXM that he didn\u2019t quit the show.)",
      "Atwood\u2019s death was preordained before Costner\u2019s exit, according to The Hollywood Reporter, but \u201cwe had to wrap this all up at lightning speed\u201d once Costner exited, Olivieri told the publication.",
      "All of these losses, from co-workers to family alike, are bound to have huge repercussions for the season\u2019s (and likely series\u2019) final episodes. Are we done with the bloodbath yet? Knowing \u201cYellowstone,\u201d don\u2019t count anyone safe until the very end."

It just filled me with tremendous humility,\" he said."

    "story": [
      "Marissa Bode is addressing the derogatory comments made about her \u201cWicked\u201d character.",
      "Bode, who portrays the character Nessarose, the younger sister of Cynthia Erivo\u2019s Elphaba, posted a five-minute long video to her TikTok slamming the slew of negative comments she\u2019s received since the film premiered on Nov. 22.",
      "Despite enjoying seeing the outpouring of the love for the movie, Bode said there were reactions that made her feel \u201ca bit uncomfortable.\u201d",
      "In the video, Bode, who uses a wheelchair in real life and on screen, acknowledged that she is biased when it comes to her feelings about her own character. She said it was \"totally fine\" to make jokes about Nessarose\u2019s actions or personality because she is a fictional character.",
      "But, Bode explained, she was not okay with \u201caggressive comments and jokes about Nessa\u2019s disability,\u201d calling the messages \u201cdeeply uncomfortable because disability is not fictional.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, me, Marissa, is the person that is still disabled and in a wheelchair,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so it is simply a low hanging fruit that too many of you are comfortable taking.\u201d",
      "She continued, noting that in addition to her character, she's heard ableist jokes about herself. \u201cBefore even being cast in \u2018Wicked,\u2019 I had received comments just as me, Marissa,\u00a0not Nessa, around the words of \u2018Stand up for yourself,\u2019 \u2018I guess you can\u2019t stand him,\u2019 etc.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen these jokes are being made by non-disabled strangers with a punchline of not being able to walk, it very much feels like laughing at, rather than laughing with,\u201d she added.",
      "Bode said the most frustrating part about acknowledging such comments was how scared she was to voice her opinion.",
      "\u201cThese comments do not exist in a vacuum,\u201d she said. \u201cAggressive comments of wanting to cause harm and push Nessa out of her wheelchair, or that she deserves her disability are two very gross and harmful comments that real disabled people, including myself, have heard before.\u201d",
      "The actor noted that she has seen the repercussions that her peers have experienced when they have called out ableism.",
      "\u201cThese disabled creators\u2019 comments are flooded with ableist comments,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhen speaking on ableism, they\u2019re told to just take a joke and that they\u2019re asking for too much, and to stop complaining, to the point where some of my disabled peers have needed to take a break online for their own mental well being.\u201d",
      "Bode then implored those listening not to dismiss the feelings of others, but rather \u201clisten to the people or to the person that it is affecting and how it makes them feel.\u201d",
      "\u201cThankfully, I\u2019m at a place in my life today where I can recognize these jokes about disability are made out of ignorance,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say the same about Marissa 10 years ago, and it would have affected younger me a lot more, and I\u2019m worried that a younger version of myself is somewhere on the internet and is harmed by these comments.\u201d",
      "She concluded her message with a lesson she learned from \u201cWicked,\u201d adding, \u201cLastly, I want to say one of the major themes within \u2018Wicked\u2019 is having the ability to listen and to understand one another, and I truly hope that is something a lot of you can practice more and take with you.\u201d",
      "Bode made her feature film debut in the John M. Chu directed movie. The actor, who hails from Wisconsin, performed in plays in middle school and high school before she attended the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Los Angeles in order to study acting.",
      "Before landing the role of Nessarose, she worked as an after-school art teacher and mentor, telling TODAY.com that she felt \u201cbeyond privileged and lucky\u201d to be cast in \u201cWicked\u201d one year after she graduated from college. (Universal Pictures is owned by TODAY.com\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re not represented a lot and you don\u2019t see yourself, you still have \u2014 or at least I did have \u2014 a little bit of, \u2018I know what I\u2019m capable of. I know that I can act. I know other disabled talent that can act and can model,\u2019\u201d she explained. \u201cBut how much of the industry is willing to go for that and is willing to seek out disabled people and willing to listen? That was the one thing that I definitely bumped into.\u201d",
      "Bode is the first-ever physically disabled actor to take on the role of Nessarose, sharing that she was \u201cover the moon\u201d about the casting decision.",
      "She explained, \u201cIt\u2019s not something I saw a lot of when I was growing up, and if I did, it was like for one special episode and you never saw the character again.\u201d"

      "On Super Bowl Sunday, Samantha DiPippo,\u00a0Hallmark\u2019s senior vice president for programming, was at a watch party texting friends and fellow Hallmark executives.",
      "Their eyes were on the Kansas City Chiefs, a centerpiece of the NFL season if not for a star player\u2019s new courtship with the world\u2019s biggest pop performer, then for entering their fourth Super Bowl in five seasons. Those folks at Hallmark, a mainstay for romance lovers, had some ideas. Could another Lombardi Trophy for the Chiefs help bring those ideas to fruition?",
      "They were about to see \u2014 and the game was a nail-biter. The San Francisco 49ers held on to an early lead, 10-3, going into halftime. After Kansas City pulled ahead in the third quarter, the score was tied 19-19 by the fourth, sending the championship game into overtime.",

      "You\u2019re forgiven if you thought this movie would follow the true-to-life plot laid out by Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s romance, though.",
      "For the uninitiated, the Swift-Kelce timeline looks like this: In September 2023, Swift attended a Chiefs home game after rumors that Swift and tight end Travis Kelce were an item. Kelce notably had attended her \u201cEras Tour\u201d show in Kansas City just months before, and after the concert, used his podcast to tell the world that he tried (and failed) to give Swift his number.",
      "The rest, as many know, is history.",
      "Though Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s story produced an audience with an appetite for more football romance, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d isn\u2019t about a player and a pop star (Lifetime has that movie, and it's full of references to Swift); this follows a Chiefs employee and an NFL super fan.",
      "The screenwriter of \u201cHoliday Touchdown,\u201d Julie Sherman Wolfe, who\u2019s written more than 20 films for Hallmark, says she\u2019s always wanted to write \u201ca big football movie.\u201d The offer for this project came just a week after the Super Bowl, when her team, the 49ers, experienced that crushing defeat.",
      "When tackling the script, Wolfe says she leaned into her own family\u2019s unique superstitions and traditions.",
      "\u201cIt really was coming from a place in my heart about what we love the most about the game. I guess I would love people to know that you don\u2019t have to be a Chiefs fan to enjoy this movie,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThe Chiefs are in the movie, and it is about them, but it\u2019s about more than that. It\u2019s about things that are bigger than a team. It\u2019s about your team.\u201d",
      "\u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d first introduces Alana (Hunter King) and her family of Chiefs super fans who run a merch store. In comes Derrick (Tyler Hynes), who\u2019s in charge of fan engagement for the Chiefs and oversees the annual fan of the year contest (which is real, by the way). Alana\u2019s family is, of course, in the running.",
      "Though Wolfe says one doesn\u2019t have to love the Chiefs to appreciate the movie, its cameos will elate those who do: NFL mom Donna Kelce, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid and players Mecole Hardman, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and George Karlaftis all appear.",
      "The film even took inspiration from a real job in the Chiefs org. Jayne Martin has been the vice president of fan experience for 23 seasons. She says she is \u201cbridging the gap between the team and our fans.\u201d",
      "In March, Wolfe spoke with Martin to go over the premise of the storyline. They touched on Martin\u2019s job responsibilities and walked through potential scenarios that the film\u2019s leading man might encounter.",
      "\u201cIt was very important for (Wolfe) to ensure that the narrative was realistic,\u201d Martin says.",
      "Wolfe also brought aspects of her own football fandom to the plot. Alana\u2019s last name, Higman, came from her friend\u2019s maiden name, in honor of her family of Chiefs fans. Derrick\u2019s last name meanwhile is Young \u2014 a nod to the Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl competitors.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s for Steve Young from the 49ers,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cI had to put something in there.\u201d",
      "Then there\u2019s the Higmans\u2019 lucky Chiefs hat, which drives a subplot. Alana\u2019s family has a superstition: The Chiefs only go to the Super Bowl when that old beanie is worn by a family member on Christmas. Derrick doesn\u2019t believe it though \u2014 so when the hat goes missing, things go awry.",
      "Originally, Wolfe\u2019s draft referenced a vintage Chiefs baseball hat. After they sent a couple pages of the script to the Chiefs, DiPippo recalls one of the team\u2019s executives saying, \u201cI\u2019m reading this, and I\u2019m just thinking of my grandpa. My grandfather had a vintage Chiefs winter hat, and he would wear it all the time while he was shoveling snow, and that\u2019s my memory of him.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reading it, I\u2019m in my kitchen crying, and I text one of our other execs, and I said, \u2018It\u2019s a winter hat now, it\u2019s a winter hat now!\u2019\u201d DiPippo says.",
      "The Taylor Swift of it all",
      "It\u2019s undeniable that NFL experienced in 2023 season what has been dubbed the \u201cTaylor Swift effect,\u201d or the increase in exposure and female audience that follows the famous singer.",
      "\u201cThe magic, the romance of the Taylor Swift and Kelce union really got people in that romance mood \u2014 and romance plus football, right?\u201d Wolfe says.",
      "Exactly. For Hallmark, project ideas really started flowing in December 2023, after a pair of commercials leaned into just that.",
      "The first was a Hallmark ad, which aired Christmas Day on ESPN and stars Wolfe herself. In it, she sits at her computer as if typing a screenplay and lists the many ways the 2023 NFL season played out like a Hallmark movie, from \u201cincredible stories\u201d to \u201cunexpected romance.\u201d",
      "Then in January, the Chiefs released a postseason commercial titled \u201cFalling for Football,\u201d which is framed as a spoof trailer for a Hallmark-esque film about a diehard NFL fan who works at a Chiefs gift shop. (Sound familiar?) Hynes plays that fan, and Donna Kelce notably makes a cameo.",
      "DiPippo says the ESPN ad was a \u201cgreat catalyst\u201d to \u201cHoliday Touchdown.\u201d Then \u201cFalling for Football,\u201d which she calls a \u201clittle bit of a love letter to Hallmark,\u201d helped inspire the premise of the movie.",
      "Hynes says that when the Chiefs approached him for the \u201cFalling for Football\u201d commercial, it felt a little more \u201ctongue in cheek.\u201d But starring in \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d required him to treat the type of film spoofed in the commercial with integrity.",
      "\u201cThis is a legitimate Hallmark movie that is filled with all the heart, sincerity, warmth and joy that these movies always have,\u201d says Hynes, who has been in more than 15 Hallmark films, including six in the 2024 season.",
      "Martin says Chiefs fan demographics have changed since Swift first appeared at Arrowhead Stadium and is now about 57% female. \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d is an example of an attempt to reach and engage that new audience with the Chiefs and the NFL as a whole, Martin says.",
      "\u201cI honestly feel like everything about this movie was meant to happen when it happened.\u201d",
      "Screenwriter Julie Sherman Wolfe",
      "Though DiPippo believes Hallmark\u2019s partnership with the Chiefs could have happened without Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s 100% a pure Hallmark movie at heart,\u201d she says \u2014 Wolfe believes\u00a0a little of fate was still at play.",
      "\u201cI honestly feel like everything about this movie was meant to happen when it happened. It was meant to be,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThey got the right people and the right time and Travis and Taylor, and everything happened the way it was meant to happen for this movie.\u201d",
      "While appearing on TODAY Nov. 27, Hynes said it's \"impossible\" for the Swift-Kelce inspiration \"to not find its way into the movie.\"",
      "\"We're telling a multigenerational family story,\" he said. \"It feels like something quintessentially Hallmark while still servicing the people who want to see a big football movie.\"",
      "Christmas in July",
      "While \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d strays from Kelce and Swift's relationship, being part of the film is surreal for star Hunter King, who identifies as a Swiftie and has her own \u201cinvisible string\u201d connection to it all.",
      "Kelce and Swift\u2019s storybook romance notably started after he attended an \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert in Kansas City. On July 7, King attended a Kansas City show with her sister, actor Joey King, who appeared in Swift\u2019s \u201cMean\u201d music video in 2011, then in \u201cI Can See You\u201d almost 13 years later. At that July 7 concert, Joey King joined Swift onstage.",
      "\u201cThe day that we started filming I think was almost exactly a year later,\u201d Hunter King says. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Wait a second. It really is a full circle moment for me.\u2019\u201d",
      "The production kicked off shrouded in secrecy. Casting was \u201cincredibly difficult,\u201d DiPippo says, because they couldn\u2019t share many details about the project, and \u201ceverything had NDAs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the most secretive we\u2019ve ever had to be on any project,\u201d DiPippo says.",
      "So when production started up around Kansas City in July, it drew a crowd. In addition to Arrowhead Stadium, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d was filmed in the suburb of Independence, Missouri. The local pizzeria Square Pizza was transformed into a fictional barbecue restaurant called Norma & Nic\u2019s, managed by Donna Kelce\u2019s character. Inside, garlands with red ornaments bordered the ordering counter. Chiefs memorabilia hung on the walls, and wreaths decorated every door.",
      "The entire production involved about two dozen Christmas trees used in rotation \u2014 including 18 used in one day \u2014 as well as more than 400 yards of lights of \u201cevery color ornament bulb you can imagine,\u201d according to Daniel King, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u2019s\u201d production designer.",
      "Most behind the scenes were met with challenges, like set decorator Christi Whiteley, who was in charge of decorating and re-decorating up to 20 trees over the course of a few days, and property master Hunter Nelson, who made sure edible props like holiday meals and gingerbread houses were preserved at certain temperatures.",
      "And speaking of temperatures \u2014 the July heat was a hurdle for everyone.",
      "At Arrowhead, about 1,000 extras filmed inside the stadium, wearing parkas, scarves and other winter gear as the temperature reached 99 degrees, though felt more like 102, according to the Weather app.",
      "Hunter King filmed the Arrowhead Stadium scenes with an ice pack in her pants, a neck fan and an undershirt fan. On a discomfort scale of 1 to 10, Hunter King says filming in the sun felt like a 9.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s mostly the sweaters and then the coat over it, and in this heat and in the humidity, that\u2019s what really, really cranks it up a notch,\u201d she says.",
      "The heat didn\u2019t deter fans, though. At one point, while filming in Independence, there were about 70 people watching and standing in the sun, DiPippo recalls.",
      "\u201cThey were coming in Chiefs gear. There were kids, there were grandparents. It was just so cute to see how excited they were just because we\u2019re filming in their town,\u201d she says.",
      "TODAY\u2019s Jenna Bush Hager, who makes a cameo as a sports journalist, wore a heavy wool coat paired with a sweater-like tank top and white trousers. While rehearsing her scene on the field of Arrowhead, crew members held up umbrellas for the actors. One of the director\u2019s last calls before \u201caction\u201d was the cue to put on jackets. The first thing each actor did after hearing \u201ccut\u201d was rip those coats off.",
      "Chiefs players Mecole Hardman, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and George Karlaftis appear in the film during a game scene, so they got to dress in their Chiefs uniforms.",
      "And luckily for Andy Reid, the head coach\u2019s cameo only took about 15 minutes to film.",
      "Before he left Arrowhead after delivering his lines, Reid told Jenna that he never would have imagined his stadium as the setting for not one, but now two love stories.",
      "He adds, \u201cWhere we\u2019re at in today\u2019s world, this is a healthy thing.\u201d"

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Opposition lawmakers in South Korea moved to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday after he shocked the East Asian democracy by declaring martial law only to lift the order hours later under intense pressure.",
      "Six opposition parties, led by the Democratic Party that controls the parliament, submitted articles of impeachment against Yoon on Wednesday afternoon local time, swiftly responding to what the Democratic Party called the Yoon administration\u2019s \u201cunconstitutional and illegal declaration of martial law.\u201d",
      "Voting on the Yoon impeachment motion, which requires a two-thirds majority vote by members of the unicameral legislature to pass, could take place as early as Friday or Saturday. The Constitutional Court would then hold a trial to determine whether to confirm the impeachment motion.",
      "The Democratic Party will also start impeachment proceedings against Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun and Interior Minister Lee Sang-min, said Cho Seung-rae, the Democrats\u2019 chief spokesperson, adding that all three officials should also be charged with insurrection.",
      "Insurrection charges will also be filed against the martial law commander, Gen. Park Ahn-soo, National Police Commissioner Yoon Hee-keun and other key military and police participants, Cho said.",
      "The leader of Yoon\u2019s People Power Party (PPP), Han Dong-hoon, said the six hours of martial law \u201cnearly brought the nation to a halt,\u201d and that the party \u201crespects and abides by the spirit of our constitution.\u201d",
      "He said PPP officials were discussing whether Yoon should leave the party, but he stopped short of saying Yoon should step down as president, saying the party would investigate the full circumstances.",
      "Government officials rushed to reassure South Koreans, many of whom slept through the country\u2019s six hours of martial law, which began late Tuesday night and ended by Wednesday morning.",
      "\u201cI fully understand the great anxiety you must be feeling,\u201d Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said in a statement, adding that he took full responsibility \u201cfor all the processes that have led to the current situation.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe continue to expect political disagreements to be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law,\u201d Blinken said in a statement.",
      "The South Korean stock market opened as normal on Wednesday, with stocks down about 2% in early trading, CNBC reported. South Korea\u2019s currency, the won, strengthened against the dollar in early trading but stayed close to the two-year low it hit late Tuesday after Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration.",
      "At a news conference in Seoul, officials from the S&P credit rating agency said the brief period of martial law was not expected to have an impact on South Korea\u2019s credit rating.",
      "Yoon, whose conservative government took office in 2022, has seen his approval ratings drop as he struggles to advance his agenda against the opposition Democratic Party, which controls parliament. Democratic lawmakers have sought to impeach multiple government officials and are in a fight with Yoon over next year\u2019s budget.",
      "Yoon made the surprise martial law announcement in a late-night TV address on Tuesday, accusing opposition lawmakers of paralyzing the government and saying he was declaring a state of emergency \u201cin order to protect the constitutional order based on freedom and eradicate shameful pro-North Korea anti-state groups, that are stealing freedom and happiness of our people.\u201d",
      "Yoon, who takes a harder line on North Korea than his Democratic Party predecessor, said his order would also protect South Korea from the nuclear-armed communist state, with which the South technically remains at war.",
      "Soon after Yoon\u2019s announcement, a martial law proclamation stated that all political activities, including demonstrations and the operations of the National Assembly, were prohibited. It also declared all media and publications under the control of the Martial Law Command, and ordered the country\u2019s striking doctors to return to work within 48 hours.",
      "It was the first time since 1980 that martial law had been declared in South Korea, a country of 50 million people that spent decades under military-authoritarian rule but has since transitioned into a vibrant democracy and the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy.",
      "U.S. officials said Tuesday that they had not been notified in advance about Yoon\u2019s announcement, but affirmed the \u201cironclad\u201d nature of the U.S. alliance with South Korea, which hosts about 28,500 American troops.",
      "Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said the martial law order had \u201cessentially no impact\u201d on U.S. forces.",
      "Within minutes of Yoon\u2019s announcement, lawmakers began arriving at the National Assembly in central Seoul, where police blocked them from entering. The Ministry of National Defense also deployed between 200 and 300 armed troops to the National Assembly grounds via helicopter, Kim Min-gi, secretary-general of the National Assembly, said Wednesday.",
      "Throngs of protesters also arrived at the building in opposition to the martial law declaration.",
      "Within a few hours lawmakers passed a resolution to nullify Yoon\u2019s declaration, and soldiers promptly followed an order to leave the National Assembly. Yoon\u2019s People Power Party urged the president to accept lawmakers\u2019 decision and rescind the martial law order.",
      "In a televised address to the nation as dawn approached, Yoon said he had accepted the National Assembly resolution and that martial law would be lifted as soon as a quorum of cabinet members could be reached at the odd hour.",
      "\u201cHaving said that, I strongly urge the National Assembly to immediately cease the repeated acts of impeachment, legislative manipulation and budgetary sabotage that paralyze the nation\u2019s functions,\u201d he said.",

    "summary": "Syria's civil war has exploded back into life after Islamist rebels launched a lightning offensive on the northern city of Aleppo.",
    "story": [
      "In the messy patchwork of conflicts raging across the Middle East, one country has been absent from the spotlight: Syria.",
      "A civil war that dominated international headlines for more than a decade has now been reignited after a coalition of Syrian rebels launched a lightning offensive last week, seizing Aleppo, the country\u2019s second-largest city, from President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime.",
      "The rebels took only hours to recapture territory that Assad\u2019s forces had spent years reclaiming. Fighter jets from Syria and its ally Russia soon began bombing the area \u2014 killing hundreds of the rebels but civilians, too, according to a leading monitoring group.",
      "\u201cThis is a very unstable situation with a huge amount of flux,\u201d said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "Some anti-Assad activists hope it could herald the crumbling of a depleted regime; others fear the brutality of the Russia-Syrian response \u2014 as well as the hard-line ideology of the Islamist rebels themselves.",
      "It\u2019s also unclear how this may affect the 900 or so American troops still in the region, or the remnants of the Islamic State terror group that they are there to fight and that the Pentagon has warned may be regrouping.",
      "Here\u2019s what we do know:",
      "What happened?",
      "With little warning last Wednesday, a coalition of Syrian rebels launched a rapid assault that soon seized Aleppo as well as towns in the nearby Idlib and Hama provinces, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group.",
      "The rebels are being led by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which grew out of a former al Qaeda affiliate called Jabhat al-Nusra and is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., the United Nations and others.\u00a0The State Department has a $10 million bounty for information about its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Golani.",
      "However, some analysts say the group has \u201cgreatly moderated\u201d its positions, as Robin Yassin-Kassab, author of \u201cBurning Country: Syrians in Revolution and War,\u201d wrote this week. \u201cIt\u2019s still an authoritarian Islamist militia\u201d but \u201chas a much more positive policy towards sectarian and ethnic minorities than ISIS,\u201d he said.",
      "For these anti-Assad observers, the group presents an opportunity to topple the brutality of his regime and its Russian and Iranian benefactors.",
      "But after the rebels\u2019 offensive, Syrian and Russian fighter jets responded by launching airstrikes on the rebel-held areas, with Assad\u2019s government claiming to have killed more than 400 of the \u201cterrorists.\u201d",
      "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights puts the number of rebels killed in five days of fighting at 244, with 61 civilians killed alongside 141 government troops.",
      "Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi offered his full support to Assad and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would do likewise. And on Monday, Iran-backed militias based in Iraq crossed the border into Syria to support the government there, according to the Observatory.",
      "Why is this happening now?",
      "Syria\u2019s time on the back burner of international attention is also one  reason it has roared back into prominence, some experts say.",
      "Assad once looked like he might be toppled by the diverse group of rebels that rose up against him after the Arab Spring of 2011. That he has survived was largely because of the intervention of Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s Lebanon-based proxy.",
      "Russia\u2019s indiscriminate bombing, in particular, turned the tide against the rebels. It also transformed then rebel-held cities such as Aleppo and Homs into moonscapes of rubble and rebar. In all, the U.N. has documented more than 350,000 deaths but says this is \u201ccertainly an undercount.\u201d",
      "Today, however, Russia, Iran and Lebanon are distracted and depleted.",
      "Russia\u2019s primary focus is on the war in Ukraine, where it is locked in an attritional battle of trenches, tanks and mud with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s Washington-backed government in Kyiv. In recent years Moscow has withdrawn assets from Syria, potentially weakening Assad\u2019s grip on power, experts say.",
      "Likewise, Iran has taken a hit at the hands of Israel, which has gutted Hezbollah\u2019s leadership and targeted its missile arsenal, while also fighting Hamas in Gaza.",
      "\u201cIranians have also shown that their forces are stretched and perhaps not as powerful as people get them credit for,\u201d said Hellyer, the Russia analyst who was speaking from Cairo. All of this \u201cputs Assad in a much weaker position.\u201d",
      "But \u201cthe Syrian regime, in coordination with the Russians and less so the Iranians, will hit them with everything they\u2019ve got,\u201d he added.",
      "Washington and ISIS",
      "Less clear is what role, if any, the U.S. may play.",
      "As well as the American troops based in Syria, there are another 2,500 in neighboring Iraq that are part of a residual 80-country coalition to prevent ISIS from regrouping.",
      "However, it\u2019s far from certain these forces will remain there after President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. He twice threatened to withdraw these troops during his first term.",
      "But the ISIS threat has not gone away, despite the group being purged in 2017 from the vast swaths of Syria and Iraq over which it had governed.",
      "In July, the Pentagon warned ISIS attacks were on track to double year-on-year.",
      "If HTS were to seize the city of Deir el-Zour \u2014 a former ISIS stronghold \u2014 then ISIS could be freer to expand its influence across the east of the country, some analysts believe.",
      "\u201cAs Assad\u2019s regime moves resources to the northwest\u201d to try to fight off the rebels, \u201cISIS will reap the rewards, filling vacuums\u201d elsewhere,  Charles Lister, director of the Syria program at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank, said in a post on X.",
      "If Assad were to fall altogether, Iran may no longer be able to use Syria as a pipeline of weapons and other supplies to Hezbollah, the Council on Foreign Relations, a Washington-based think tank, said in a briefing.",
      "However, any hopes for Assad's ouster should be tempered by who or what might replace him.",
      "\u201cMuch as I oppose the Assad regime, its atrocities and abuses, what is happening in Aleppo right now is terrifying. Many will die,\u201d Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, posted on X. \u201cIf there was a chance of a lovely peaceful outcome to the benefit of Syrians, I will be thrilled. This is unlikely.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Australian lawmakers on Thursday approved a landmark ban on social media for children under 16 in some of the world\u2019s toughest such controls.",
      "The ban, which aims to address the impact of excessive social media use on children\u2019s physical and mental health, affects social media platforms including X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat and Reddit, but not YouTube.",
      "The platforms, which bear sole responsibility for enforcement, have one year to figure out how to implement the age limit, which is the highest set by any country. If there are systemic failures to keep children from having accounts, the platforms are liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million).",
      "Senators debated the legislation late into the night on the last day of their parliamentary session, which Prime Minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s center-left Labor government had targeted as the deadline for it to pass. The bill, which is also largely supported by the opposition Liberal Party, passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday by a vote of 102 to 13.",
      "Supporters of the ban have cited the effect of harmful depictions of body image on girls and the effect of misogynistic content on boys. Its passage comes after a series of Australian teenagers died by suicide over what their families said was online bullying.",
      "\u201cThe basis for this is that there is a feeling amongst the majority of Australians that social media does more harm than good,\u201d said Rob Nicholls, a senior research associate in media and communication at the University of Sydney.",
      "A YouGov poll released Tuesday found that 77% of Australians support the ban, up from 61% in August.",
      "Other countries have tried to impose limits on social media for children, including the U.S., which requires technology companies to obtain parental consent to collect data from children under 13.\u00a0But the Australian proposal goes further, with no exemptions for parental consent or pre-existing accounts.",
      "Opponents have criticized the Australian ban as too blunt an instrument and said its passage was too rushed.",
      "The bill, which was introduced in Parliament last week, allowed for only one day to submit opinions on it. Sen. Matt Canavan, who opposed the bill, said there had been 15,000 submissions about it during that day and that lawmakers had been able to review only a fraction of them.",
      "\u201cThis is a highly emotional issue and there is an understandable demand for politicians to be seen to be \u2018doing something\u2019 about it,\u201d he said Tuesday in a dissent that was published as part of a Senate committee report. \u201cYet it is also a highly complex area that should be examined carefully not in the hasty fashion that has beset this process.\u201d",
      "Google and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, had urged Australia to delay the legislation\u2019s passage Tuesday, saying more time was needed to assess the potential impact of the ban. ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, also said more consultation was needed.",
      "Elon Musk, the owner of X, blasted the ban last week as \u201ca backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all\u00a0Australians.\u201d",
      "Officials plan to enforce the age cut-off by trialing an age-verification system that could include biometrics or government identification, which no other country has tried, raising privacy concerns.",
      "A Senate committee signed off on the legislation late Tuesday but said social media platforms should find \u201calternative methods for assuring age\u201d rather than forcing users to submit personal information, such as their passports or other digital identification.",
      "Nicholls said the social media platforms would also be fined for failing to destroy personal information as soon as possible after they verifying users\u2019 ages.",
      "Outside the legislature, the ban has come under heavy scrutiny from parents and scholars who say social media can be a crucial source of support for young people, especially those who feel marginalized.",
      "\u201cSocial media provides vital connections for many young Australians, allowing them to access mental health resources, peer support networks, and a sense of community,\u201d Christopher Stone, executive director of Suicide Prevention Australia, said in a statement Wednesday.\u00a0\u201cCutting off this access risks exacerbating feelings of loneliness and isolation.\u201d",
      "The government has said it will ensure that young people have continued access to messaging apps such as WhatsApp, online gaming platforms such as Roblox and essential services related to health and education.",
      "\u201cYoung people, and in particular diverse cohorts, must be at the center of the conversation as an age restriction is implemented to ensure there are constructive pathways for connection,\u201d Sen. Karen Grogan, chair of the Senate committee on environment and communications legislation, said in its report.",
      "So far the government has not done enough to consult with young people, for whom social media is part of daily life, said Leo Puglisi, 17.",
      "\u201cThis is a government that is obviously not made up of teenagers, but it\u2019s making law about social media when they didn\u2019t grow up in the social media age,\u201d said Puglisi, the founder and chief anchor of 6 News Australia, a streaming news channel based in Melbourne that is majority-run by high schoolers.",
      "He said that while he is beyond the age cut-off, the ban would affect his audience, as well as the ability of some of the journalists on his team to do their work.",
      "In addition, he said, \u201cthere is certainly a possibility that every single Australian would need to use some form of ID to have social media. So in reality it would affect me, it would affect absolutely everyone.\u201d",
      "Daniel Angus, a professor of digital communication at Queensland University of Technology, said that the bill was \u201cillogical and uninformed\u201d and that it lacked critical details about how it will be implemented.",
      "The potential harms of social media the government cited are not sufficiently supported by high-quality research, Angus said in an email, noting that children who are disadvantaged, live in rural areas or are from minority groups rely on social media for community, education and advocacy.",
      "\u201cBy imposing a blanket ban, the government overlooks these essential and diverse experiences, thereby exacerbating existing inequalities,\u201d he said.",
      "He also said the exclusion from the ban of anonymous or web-based platforms such as 4chan \u201cparadoxically leaves young people vulnerable to some of the most harmful digital environments.\u201d",
      "The Heads Up Alliance, a grassroots collective of Australian parents seeking more restrictions on children\u2019s use of social media, said the bill was \u201cdeficient,\u201d giving it a grade of D+.",
      "The group said the ban would do nothing to address bullying on messaging apps, which also have \u201chighly addictive\u201d features.",
      "\u201cThese features are likely to end up resulting in the very downsides we are trying to avoid for our children: preoccupation with devices, less sleep, less nature, less sport, less real-life friendships, less concentration, exposure to sexualized content,\u201d the organization said in a statement.",
      "Exposure to sexual predators \u201cwill also remain a real risk\u201d on online gaming platforms and messaging apps, where many children banned from other social media are likely to migrate, the group said, adding: \u201cOur children will be jumping from the frypan into the fire.\u201d"

      "The group was arrested on Saturday night and early Sunday at three nightclubs \u2014 Arma, Inferno and Mono \u2014 in the Russian capital, according to a statement government officials gave to Tass, a Russian news agency.",

      "Baza, an anonymously run Telegram news channel that has over 1.5 million followers, reported that police blocked club exits and interrogated clubgoers at Arma before detaining dozens. Clubgoers who were not brought into custody were allowed to leave Arma roughly three hours after the raid began, according to Baza. (Arma, then known as Mutabor, was the site of the 2022 \u201calmost naked\u201d party, which drew fierce criticism after Russian celebrities, influencers and socialites attended clad in revealing clothing months after the invasion of Ukraine.)",
      "Monday was not the first time the Russian government has coordinated a clampdown on \u201cLGBT propaganda.\u201d Shortly after the Supreme Court ruling last year, gay bars in cities across Russia were similarly raided by police. Sporadic raids have reportedly persisted throughout the country since then.",
      "Critics viewed last year\u2019s Supreme Court ruling as part of a wider crackdown on LGBTQ rights in Russia under the leadership of President Vladimir Putin, who has been in power for roughly a quarter of a century. Notably, the Russian government passed legislation in 2013 known as the \u201cgay propaganda law,\u201d making it illegal \u201cto spread information about nontraditional sexual behavior\u201d to minors. The law was expanded to apply to adults, effectively banning public symbols or gestures of \u201cnontraditional sexual relations.\u201d Russians who violate the so-called propaganda law could face up to 400,000 rubles ($6,500) in fines.",
      "Last month, Putin signed additional legislation that bans nationals from countries that allow gender transitions to adopt Russian children."

      "Three mountain climbers from the United States and Canada are missing after they did not return from their planned summit of New Zealand\u2019s tallest mountain, Aoraki, officials said Tuesday.",
      "The Americans are Kurt Blair, 56, of Colorado and Carlos Romero, 50, of California. The Canadian national is not being named by New Zealand Police until his family is notified.",
      "Blair and Romero are listed on the American Mountain Guides Association website as certified alpine guides.",
      "The three men arrived by plane at a hut partway up Aoraki, also known as Mount Cook, on Saturday afternoon, with plans to ascend the 12,218-foot mountain, New Zealand Police said in a statement.",
      "The search for them began Monday after they failed to show up for their morning flight out, police said. Searchers have found several climbing-related items that are believed to belong to the trio.",
      "The search was temporarily halted Tuesday owing to severe weather conditions on the mountain. Police said the search was unlikely to resume until Thursday.",
      "They said they were working with the U.S. and Canadian embassies to inform and support the families of the three men.",
      "Aoraki, part of the Southern Alps mountain range that runs the length of New Zealand\u2019s South Island, is a popular destination for advanced climbers but has challenging terrain. Since the start of the 20th century, more than 240 deaths have been recorded\u00a0on the mountain and in the national park that surrounds it, according to The Associated Press."

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 06:40:36 GMT",
    "summary": "The United States on Monday launched its third crackdown in three years on China\u2019s semiconductor industry, curbing exports to 140 companies.",
    "story": [
      "The United States on Monday launched its third crackdown in three years on China\u2019s semiconductor industry, curbing exports to 140 companies, including chip equipment maker Naura Technology Group, among other moves.",
      "The effort to hobble Beijing\u2019s chipmaking ambitions also hits Chinese chip toolmakers Piotech, ACM Research and SiCarrier Technology with new export restrictions as part of the package, which also takes aim at shipments of advanced memory chips and more chipmaking tools to China.",
      "The move is one of the Biden administration\u2019s last large-scale efforts to stymie China\u2019s ability to access and produce chips that can help advance artificial intelligence for military applications, or otherwise threaten U.S. national security.",
      "It comes just weeks before the swearing-in of President-elect\u00a0Donald Trump, who is expected to retain many of Biden\u2019s tough-on-China measures.",
      "The package includes curbs on China-bound shipments of high-bandwidth memory chips, critical for high-end applications like AI training; new curbs on 24 additional chipmaking tools and three software tools; and new export curbs on chipmaking equipment made in countries such as Singapore and Malaysia.",
      "Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the action aims to prevent \u201cChina from advancing its domestic semiconductor manufacturing system, which it will use to support its military modernization.\u201d",
      "Reuters first reported many companies involved and key details of the plan.",
      "The tool controls will most likely hurt Lam Research, KLA\u00a0and Applied Materials, as well as non-U.S. companies like Dutch equipment maker ASM International. Chinese companies facing new restrictions include nearly two dozen semiconductor companies, two investment companies and over 100 chipmaking tool makers.",
      "The companies include Swaysure Technology Co., Si\u2019En Qingdao and Shenzhen Pensun Technology Co., which work with China\u2019s Huawei Technologies. The telecommunications equipment leader has been hobbled by U.S. sanctions and is now at the center of China\u2019s advanced chip production and development.",
      "They will be added to the entity list, which bars U.S. suppliers from shipping to them without first receiving a special license.",
      "Asked about the U.S. curbs, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said such behavior undermined the international economic trade order and disrupted global supply chains.",
      "China will take measures to safeguard the rights and interests of its firms, he added at a regular news briefing on Monday.",
      "China\u2019s commerce ministry described the U.S. restrictions as a clear example of \u201ceconomic coercion\u201d and \u201cnon-market practices,\u201d according to a statement published on its official website after the new curbs were announced.",
      "China has stepped up its drive to become self-sufficient in the semiconductor sector in recent years, as the U.S. and other countries have restricted exports of the advanced chips and the tools to make them. However, it remains years behind chip industry leaders like Nvidia\u00a0in AI chips and chip equipment maker ASML\u00a0in the Netherlands.",
      "The U.S. also is poised to place additional restrictions on Semiconductor Manufacturing International Co., China\u2019s largest contract chip manufacturer, which was placed on the Entity List in 2020 but with a policy that allowed billions of dollars\u2019 worth of licenses to ship goods to it to be granted.",
      "For the first time, the U.S. will add three companies that make investments in chips to the entity list. Chinese private equity firm Wise Road Capital, tech firm Wingtech Technology Co.\u00a0and JAC Capital were added, the department said, because of their role \u201cin aiding China\u2019s government\u2019s efforts to acquire entities with sensitive semiconductor manufacturing capability critical to the defense industrial bases of the United States and its allies with the objective of relocating these entities to China.\u201d",
      "Companies seeking licenses to ship to firms on the Entity List generally get denied.",
      "An aspect of the new package that addresses the foreign direct product rule could hurt some U.S. allies by limiting what their companies can ship to China.",
      "The new rule will expand U.S. powers to curb exports of chipmaking equipment by U.S., Japanese and Dutch manufacturers made in other parts of the world to certain chip plants in China.",
      "Equipment made in Israel, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan is subject to the rule, while Japan and the Netherlands will be exempt.",
      "The expanded foreign direct product rule will apply to 16 companies on the entity list that are seen as the most important to China\u2019s most advanced chipmaking ambitions.",
      "The rule will also lower to zero the amount of U.S. content that determines when certain foreign items are subject to U.S. control. That will allow the U.S. to regulate any item shipped to China from overseas if it contains any U.S. chips.",
      "The new rules are being released after lengthy discussions with Japan and the Netherlands, which, along with the United States, dominate the production of advanced chipmaking equipment.",
      "The Dutch government said it will study the new restrictions, adding that \u201cevery country has its own considerations\u201d on national security and export controls.",
      "ASML said on its website that it did not see a material impact on its business, adding that if the Dutch government makes a \u201csimilar security assessment,\u201d it could affect exports of some of its chip making tools.",
      "The latest rules are the third major package of chip-related export curbs on China adopted under the Biden administration.",
      "In October 2022, the United States published a sweeping set of controls on sale and manufacture of certain high-end chips that was considered to be the biggest shift in its tech policy toward China since the 1990s."

    "story": [
      "TOKYO \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump said Monday that he would block a Japanese company\u2019s $15 billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel, a contentious deal that faces widespread political opposition.",
      "Nippon Steel, Japan\u2019s largest steelmaker, announced the deal last December and has said it is determined to see it through despite concerns about the implications for employees, supply chains and U.S. national security.",
      "\u201cI am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan,\u201d Trump said in a late-night post on his Truth Social platform.",
      "\u201cAs President, I will block this deal from happening. Buyer Beware!!!\u201d",
      "Trump had expressed opposition to the deal during the presidential election campaign, along with President Joe Biden and Trump\u2019s Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, who all said the Pittsburgh-based company should remain American-owned. Trump\u2019s comments Monday night are his first on the subject since he won the election last month.",
      "A senior Nippon Steel executive told reporters last month that the company hoped to close the deal before Trump returns to the White House in January.",
      "Nippon Steel said in a statement Tuesday that it was \u201cdetermined to protect and grow U.S. Steel in a manner that reinforces American industry, domestic supply chain resiliency, and U.S. national security.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will invest no less than $2.7 billion into its unionized facilities, introduce our world-class technological innovation, and secure union jobs so that American steelworkers at U. S. Steel can manufacture the most advanced steel products for American customers,\u201d the company said.",
      "The deal is also opposed by the powerful United Steelworkers union, though some other U.S. Steel employees support it. U.S. Steel says the transaction should be approved on its merits and that its benefits are \u201coverwhelmingly clear.\u201d",
      "\u201cNippon Steel has committed to preserve U.S. Steel as a U.S. company headquartered in Pennsylvania and to contribute billions of dollars of investment to our mills and communities, securing the future of steelmaking in Pennsylvania and Indiana,\u201d the company said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cNo other party can do this.\u201d",
      "The company has said the collapse of the deal would make the American steel industry less competitive globally and could cost thousands of union jobs at blast furnace facilities that might otherwise have to shut down.",
      "Nippon Steel has argued that the acquisition would benefit both companies and their employees, as well as the U.S. and Japan, a\u00a0key U.S. ally. A Japanese government official declined on Tuesday to comment on matters concerning the management of individual companies.",
      "\u201cThat said, our understanding is that it is essential for both of our nations to further strengthen economic relations, including the expansion of mutual investment in both of our countries, to achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth in the Indo-Pacific region, and to cooperate with each other in the field of economic security,\u201d Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Kazuhiko Aoki told reporters in Tokyo.",
      "Nippon Steel says U.S. Steel would remain American-run, with Americans serving as three of the board\u2019s independent directors, as well as \u201ccore senior management members.\u201d It says it would prioritize production at U.S. Steel to meet demand in the American market, the company headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh, and there would be no layoffs or plant closures as a result of the deal.",
      "Experts say that the deal has been politicized and that its failure could inadvertently help China, which produces more than half of the world\u2019s steel, maintain its dominance of the global market. American and international business groups have also expressed concern that the deal is being politicized.",
      "Biden allowed Nippon Steel this year to resubmit its filing with a government panel that reviews foreign investments for national security risks, giving it more time to allay bipartisan concerns. The deadline for the review, by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, is at the end of this month, though it could also be extended.",
      "Trump said he would find a way to preserve U.S. Steel as it is.",
      "\u201cThrough a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs, we will make U.S. Steel Strong and Great Again, and it will happen FAST!\u201d he said.",
      "Arata Yamamoto reported from Tokyo and Jennifer Jett from Hong Kong."

    "story": [
      "It is the\u00a0world\u2019s rarest whale, with only seven of its kind ever spotted. Almost nothing is known about the enigmatic species. But on Monday a small group of scientists and cultural experts in New Zealand clustered around a near-perfectly preserved spade-toothed whale hoping to decode decades of mystery.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how extraordinary it is,\u201d said a joyful Anton van Helden, senior marine science adviser for New Zealand\u2019s conservation agency, who gave the spade-toothed whale its name to distinguish it from other beaked species. \u201cFor me personally, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Van Helden has studied beaked whales for 35 years, but Monday was the first time he has participated in a dissection of the spade-toothed variety. In fact, the careful study of the creature \u2014 which washed up dead on a New Zealand beach in July \u2014 is the first ever to take place.",
      "None has ever been seen alive at sea.",
      "The list of what scientists don\u2019t know about spade-toothed whales is longer than what they do know. They don\u2019t know where in the ocean the whales live, why they\u2019ve never been spotted in the wild, or what their brains look like. All beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers don\u2019t know how the spade-toothed kind processes its food. They don\u2019t know how this one died.",
      "Over the next week, researchers studying the 5-meter (16-foot) -long male at an agricultural research center near the city of Dunedin hope to find out.",
      "\u201cThere may be parasites completely new to science that just live in this whale,\u201d said van Helden, who thrilled at the chance of learning how the species produces sound and what it eats. \u201cWho knows what we\u2019ll discover?\u201d",
      "Only six other spade-toothed whales have ever been found, but all those discovered intact were buried before DNA testing could verify their identification.",
      "New Zealand is a\u00a0whale-stranding hotspot, with\u00a0more than 5,000 episodes recorded\u00a0since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation. The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand\u2019s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile\u2019s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986.",
      "DNA sequencing in 2002 proved that all three specimens were of the same species \u2014 and that it was distinct from other beaked whales. But researchers studying the mammal couldn\u2019t confirm whether the species was extinct until 2010, when two whole spade-toothed whales, both dead, washed up on a New Zealand beach. But none has been studied before.",
      "On Monday, the seventh of its kind, surrounded by white-aproned scientists who were measuring and photographing, appeared relatively unblemished, giving no clue about its death. Researchers pointed out marks from cookiecutter sharks \u2014 normal, they said, and not the cause.",
      "The dissection will be quiet, methodical and slower than usual, because it is being undertaken in partnership with M\u0101ori, New Zealand\u2019s Indigenous people. To M\u0101ori, whales are a taonga \u2014 a precious treasure \u2014 and the creature will be treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor.",
      "Members of the local iwi, or tribe, will be present throughout the dissection and consulted at each turn, allowing them to share traditional knowledge and observe customs, such as saying a karakia -\u2013 a prayer -\u2013 over the creature before the study begins.",
      "\u201cAccording to our beliefs and our traditions, this whale is a gift of Tangaroa, deity of the ocean,\u201d said Tumai Cassidy from the local people Te R\u016bnanga \u014ct\u0101kou. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for us to respect that gift and to honor the whale.\u201d",
      "The iwi will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale at the end of the dissection, before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts, using a CT scan taken of the whale\u2019s head this week.",
      "\u201cIt all builds a richer picture for that species but also tells us how it interacts with our oceans,\u201d Cassidy said.",
      "It\u2019s thought that spade-toothed whales live in the vast Southern Pacific Ocean, home to some of the world\u2019s deepest ocean trenches. Beaked whales are the ocean\u2019s deepest divers for food, and the spade-toothed may rarely surface, adding to its mystery.",
      "The assembled scientists on Monday included a few who had traveled from abroad to see the whale, which was put in refrigerated storage after its discovery.",
      "\u201cWhat we are interested in is not only how these animals died, but how they lived,\u201d said Joy Reidenberg, a comparative anatomist from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. \u201cIn discovering how they live, we are hoping to find discoveries that we can apply back to the human condition.\u201d"
