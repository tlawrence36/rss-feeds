      "House Republicans will look to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration seeks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are moving to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump's administration looks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk.",
      "The package to be voted on Thursday targets foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides money for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service, as well as thousands of public radio and television stations around the country.",
      "Republicans are characterizing the spending as wasteful and unnecessary, but Democrats say the rescissions are hurting the United States' standing in the world.",
      "\u201cCruelty is the point,\u201d Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said of the proposed spending cuts.",
      "The Trump administration is employing a tool rarely used in recent years that allows the president to transmit a request to Congress to cancel previously appropriated funds. That triggers a 45-day clock in which the funds are frozen pending congressional action. If Congress fails to act within that period, then the spending stands.",
      "The benefit for the administration of a formal rescissions request is that passage requires only a simple majority in the 100-member Senate instead of the 60 votes usually required to get spending bills through that chamber. So, if they stay united, Republicans will be able to pass the measure without any Democratic votes.",
      "The administration is likening the first rescissions package to a test case and says more could be on the way if Congress goes along.",
      "Republicans, sensitive to concerns that Trump's sweeping tax and immigration bill would increase future federal deficits, are anxious to demonstrate spending discipline, though the cuts in the package amount to just a sliver of the spending approved by Congress each year. They are betting the cuts prove popular with constituents who align with Trump's \u201cAmerica first\u201d ideology as well as those who view NPR and PBS as having a liberal bias.",
      "In all, the package contains 21 proposed rescissions. Approval would claw back about $900 million from $10 billion that Congress has approved for global health programs. That includes canceling $500 million for activities related to infectious diseases and child and maternal health and another $400 million to address the global HIV epidemic.",
      "The Trump administration is also looking to cancel $800 million, or a quarter of the amount Congress approved, for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation, and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country.",
      "About 45% of the savings sought by the White House would come from two programs designed to boost the economies, democratic institutions and civil societies in developing countries.",
      "The Republican president has also asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it\u2019s slated to receive during the next two budget years. About two-thirds of the money gets distributed to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Nearly half of those stations serve rural areas of the country.",
      "The association representing local public television stations warns that many of them would be forced to close if the Republican measure passes. Those stations provide emergency alerts, free educational programming and high school sports coverage and highlight hometown heroes.",
      "Advocacy groups that serve the world's poorest people are also sounding the alarm and urging lawmakers to vote no.",
      "\u201cWe are already seeing women, children and families left without food, clean water and critical services after earlier aid cuts, and aid organizations can barely keep up with rising needs,\u201d said Abby Maxman, president and CEO of Oxfam America, a poverty-fighting organization.",
      "Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the foreign aid is a tool that prevents conflict and promotes stability but the measure before the House takes that tool away.",
      "\u201cThese cuts will lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, devastating the most vulnerable in the world,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cAnd at a time when China and Russia and Iran are working overtime to challenge American influence.\u201d",
      "Republicans disparaged the foreign aid spending and sought to link it to programs they said DOGE had uncovered.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said taxpayer dollars had gone to such things as targeting climate change, promoting pottery classes and strengthening diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Other Republicans cited similar examples they said DOGE had revealed.",
      "\u201cYet, my friends on the other side of the aisle would like you to believe, seriously, that if you don't use your taxpayer dollars to fund this absurd list of projects and thousands of others I didn't even list, that somehow people will die and our global standing in the world will crumble,\u201d Roy said. \"Well, let's just reject this now.\u201d",

      "Sometimes death, as life, brings strange symmetries",
      "Sometimes there are strange symmetries in death, as in life. The twin passings of Sly Stone and Brian Wilson this week brought that into sharp relief.",
      "Both were musical geniuses who paid a high price for their gifts. They burned bright, with art they created at their peaks that became more moving and meaningful with time, only to see their creative lights extinguished suddenly through mental health and addiction issues. Both were 82 when they died \u2014 Stone on Monday and Wilson on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt's such an unsettling coincidence,\u201d said Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. \u201cThese two figures, they were very different and massively influential, and each ran into a wall of their own problems in many ways. As much as they achieved, it's hard not to think that they could have done more.\u201d",
      "With his late brothers Carl and Dennis, Beach Boys co-founder Wilson was the architect of the California sound that captured surfing and sun, beaches and girls. Yet for all the \u201cFun, Fun, Fun,\u201d there was something much deeper and darker in Brian's abilities as a composer.",
      "It was more than disposable music for teen-agers. He had an unparalleled melodic sense, hearing sounds in his mind that others couldn't. He could worm his way into your head and then break your heart with songs like \u201cIn My Room\u201d and \u201cGod Only Knows.\u201d The tour de force \u201cGood Vibrations\u201d \u2014- had anyone ever heard of the theremin before he employed its unearthly wail? \u2014 is a symphony both complex and easily accessible.",
      "\u201cHe was our American Mozart,\u201d musician Sean Ono Lennon wrote on social media.",
      "The 1966 album \u201cPet Sounds\u201d was a peak. Wilson felt a keen sense of competition with the Beatles. But they had three writers, including Sean's dad, John Lennon. Wilson was largely alone, and he heard impatience and doubt from other Beach Boys, whose music he provided.",
      "He felt the pressure in trying to follow up \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d and \u201cSmile\u201d became music's most famous unfinished album. Wilson, a damaged soul to begin with because of an abusive father, never reached the heights again. He descended into a well-chronicled period of darkness.",
      "Stone's skills came in creating a musical world that others only dreamed of at the time. The Family Stone was an integrated world \u2014 Black and white, men and women \u2014 and the music they created was a potent mixture of rock, soul and funk. It made you move, it made you think.",
      "For a period of time from 1967 to 1973, their music was inescapable \u2014 \u201cDance to the Music,\u201d \u201cEverybody is a Star,\u201d \u201cHigher,\u201d \u201cHot Fun in the Summertime,\u201d \u201cSing a s Simple Song,\u201d \u201cFamily Affair,\u201d \u201cThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin).\u201d Their performance at Woodstock was a milestone.",
      "\u201cHis songs weren't just about fighting injustice, they were about transforming the self to transform the world,\u201d musician and documentarian Questlove, who lovingly tended to Stone's legacy, wrote this week. \u201cHe dared to be simple in the most complex ways \u2014 using childlike joy, wordless cries and nursery rhyme cadences to express adult truths. His work looked straight at the brightest and darkest parts of life and demanded we do the same.\u201d",
      "From his peak, the fall was hard. Years of drug abuse took its toll. Periodic comeback attempts deepened a sense of bewilderment and pity.",
      "Music is littered with stories of sudden, untimely and early deaths. Yet until this week, both men lived on, somewhat improbably passing average life expectancies.",
      "Wilson, by many measures, achieved some level of peace late in life. He had a happy marriage. He was able to see how his music was revered and appreciated and spent several years performing it again with a younger band that clearly worshiped him. It was a postscript not many knew, said journalist Jason Fine, who befriended Wilson and made the 2021 documentary, \u201cBrian Wilson: Long Promised Road.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat sort of simple message he really wanted to give people through his music going back to the \u201860s \u2014 a sense of warmth, a sense that it\u2019s going to be OK in the same way that music lifted him up from his darkness, he'd try to do for other people,\u201d Fine told The Associated Press in an interview then. \u201cI think now, more than earlier in his career, he accepts that he does that and that's a great comfort to him.\u201d",
      "Stone emerged to write an autobiography in 2023. But less is known about his later years, whether he found peace or died without the full knowledge of what his music meant to others.",
      "\u201cYes, Sly battled addiction,\u201d Questlove wrote. \u201cYes, he disappeared from the spotlight. But he lived long enough to outlast many of his disciples, to feel the ripples of his genius return through hip-hop samples, documentaries and his memoir. Still, none of that replaces the raw beauty of his original work.\u201d",
      "Did Sly Stone and Brian Wilson live lives of tragedy or triumph? It's hard to say now. One suspects it will become easier with the passage of time, when only the work remains. That sometimes brings clarity.",
      "\u201cMillions of people had their lives changed by their music,\u201d DeCurtis said. \u201cNot just enjoyed it, but had their lives transformed. That's quite an accomplishment.\u201d",

      "Vance met with the group at the Murdoch family ranch in southwest Montana near Dillon, according to the people. They confirmed the visit to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it.",
      "It\u2019s not clear why the vice president addressed the group or what they spoke about.",
      "A spokesperson for Fox News Channel did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "The vice president's office does not release a schedule for Vance and did not offer advance notice of the trip, so the surprise arrival of Air Force Two in Butte, Montana, set off local speculation as his motorcade was seen driving away.",
      "The Murdoch ranch near Dillon is roughly 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Butte. The ranch, which Murdoch purchased in 2021, is spread across two valleys and a mountain range and has some 12,000 cattle. It sits near Yellowstone National Park along the Montana-Idaho border.",
      "According to flight restrictions issued by the Federal Aviation Administration, the vice presidential aircraft was only on the ground for a matter of hours.",
      "Vance was scheduled to have lunch with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, according to the president's publicly released schedule, meaning the vice president presumably returned to Washington shortly after meeting the Murdochs 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) away on Tuesday night.",
      "Rupert Murdoch and his media organization have long been friendly with Republicans and have, for the most part, had a friendly relationship with Trump. He appeared at Trump's inauguration and was spotted earlier this year in the Oval Office.",
      "Rupert Murdoch, 94, stepped down as the head of Fox News and News Corp. in 2023 and handed control over to son Lachlan.",
      "Montana state Auditor James Brown told the Montana Talks radio show that he helped Vance\u2019s staff arrange the trip.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is set to take a seat at Wednesday's opening night of the award-winning musical \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\" at the Kennedy Center, where he replaced the previous leadership with loyalists, had himself installed as chairman and pledged to rid the performing arts venue of programming he has complained is \u201cwoke\u201d and too focused on leftist ideology and political correctness.",
      "The Republican president's attendance at the sold-out showing of the Tony Award-winning tale of redemption in 19th century France comes as he has focused more than any recent predecessor on the arts center along the Potomac River that is a memorial to a slain Democratic president.",
      "Presidents' involvement in the Kennedy Center's affairs had been limited to naming members to the board of trustees and attending the taping of its annual honors program in the fall.",
      "But after returning to office in January, Trump stunned the arts world by firing the Kennedy Center's longtime director and board and replacing them with loyalists, who then named him as chairman, and promising to overhaul its programming, management and even appearance as part of an effort to put his stamp on the national arts scene.",
      "Trump's appearance in the Opera House on Wednesday, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, will also mark his first time at a Kennedy Center performance as president. He avoided the venue after entertainment industry pushback to his policies in his first term in office, breaking with presidential tradition by never attending the annual Kennedy Center Honors taping.",
      "His moves have upset some of the center's patrons and performers.",
      "In March, the audience booed Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, after they slipped into upper-level seats in the Concert Hall to hear the National Symphony Orchestra. Trump appointed Usha Vance to the Kennedy Center board along with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Fox News Channel hosts Maria Bartiromo and Laura Ingraham, among other supporters.",
      "Sales of subscription packages are said to have declined since Trump's takeover, and several touring productions, including \u201cHamilton,\u201d have canceled planned runs at the center. Artists such as actor Issa Rae and musician Rhiannon Giddens scrapped scheduled appearances, and Kennedy Center consultants including musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming have resigned.",
      "Understudies may perform Wednesday night due to boycotts by \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d cast members.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has adopted a more aggressive posture toward the arts. The White House has taken steps to cancel millions of dollars in previously awarded federal humanities grants to arts and culture groups, and Trump\u2019s budget blueprint proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.",
      "Trump has also targeted Smithsonian museums by signing executive orders to restrict their funding and by attempting to fire the director of the National Portrait Gallery.",
      "Trump hosted the board at the White House for dinner in May and said congressional Republicans have pushed for more than $250 million for repairs and maintenance at the Kennedy Center. He claimed that \u201ctremendous amounts of money\u201d had been spent at the center but \u201cthey certainly didn't spend it on wallpaper, carpet or painting.\u201d",
      "He characterized previous programming as \u201cout of control with rampant political propaganda\u201d and said it featured \u201csome very inappropriate shows,\u201d including a \u201cMarxist anti-police performance\u201d and \u201cLesbian-only Shakespeare.\u201d",
      "Trump cited some drag show performances as a reason to take control of the center, though next season's theater lineup includes \u201dMrs. Doubtfire,\" which tells the story of a divorced man who disguises himself as a female nanny so he can spend time with his children.",
      "Trump also visited the Kennedy Center in March to preside over a board meeting and take a tour.",
      "The Kennedy Center, which is supported by government money and private donations, opened in 1971 and for decades has been seen as an apolitical celebration of the arts.",
      "It was first conceived in the late 1950s, during the administration of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, who backed a bill from the Democratic-led Congress calling for a National Culture Center. In the early 1960s, Democratic President John F. Kennedy launched a fundraising initiative, and his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, signed into law a 1964 bill renaming the project the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Kennedy had been assassinated the year before.",

      "BERLIN -- German artist G\u00fcnther Uecker, one of the country's most important post-war artists who was world-famous for his large-format nail reliefs, has died. He was 95.",
      "German news agency dpa reported that his family confirmed he died at the university hospital in his hometown of D\u00fcsseldorf in western Germany Tuesday night. They did not give a cause of death.",
      "For decades, Uecker, who was often dubbed \u201cthe nail artist,\u201d created art by hammering carpenter\u2019s nails into chairs, pianos, sewing machines and canvases. His works can be found in museums and collections across the globe.",
      "In his art work, seemingly endless numbers of nails, which would by themselves perhaps be perceived as potentially aggressive and hurtful, turned into harmonic, almost organic creations. His reliefs with the tightly hewn nails are reminiscent of waving grasses or fields of algae in a marine landscape.",
      "Uecker himself described his nail art as diary-like landscapes of the soul, which he called an \u201cexpression of the poetic power of man,\u201d dpa reported.",
      "Hendrik W\u00fcst, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia which includes state capital D\u00fcsseldorf, called Uecker \u201cone of the most important and influential artists in German post-war history\u201d and said that with his life\u2019s work, he influenced generations of young artists and \u201ccontributed to an open and dynamic society.\"",
      "Born on March 13, 1930, in the village of Wendorf on the Baltic Sea, Uecker moved to D\u00fcsseldorf in the mid-1950s, where he studied and later also taught at the city's prestigious art academy.",
      "In one of his most spectacular appearances or art happenings, he rode on the back of a camel through the hallways of the venerable academy in 1978. Together with fellow artist Gerhard Richter, he \u201coccupied\u201d the Kunsthalle Baden-Baden museum in 1968, with both kissing in front of the cameras.",
      "The son of a farmer, he traveled the world with a humanitarian message of peace and exhibited in countless countries, including dictatorships and totalitarian states. He painted ash pictures after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1986, and exhibited human rights messages painted on fabric in Beijing.",
      "He also painted \u201cVerletzungsw\u00f6rter,\u201d or words of violence, killing and torment in many languages and foreign scripts on large canvases. In 2023, Uecker erected a stone memorial in Weimar in memory of the victims of the Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald.",
      "\u201cThe theme of my artistic work is the vulnerability of man by man,\u201d he said.",

      "The \u201cbones\u201d of Theo Jansen\u2019s \u201cstrandbeesten\u201d \u2014 beach animals in Dutch \u2014 have taken over a former cable factory in Delft, the small city in the western Netherlands that Jansen has called home for decades.",
      "\u201cDuring the years, there has been a sort of evolutionary history, you could say. And you could see these animals as sort of natural historical objects,\u201d the 77-year old artist told The Associated Press before the installation\u2019s opening.",
      "The Strandbeesten Mortuary, as the exhibition is called, follows the various versions of the mobile sculptures since 1990 when Jansen created the first one from plastic pipes and tape. As the animals evolved, Jansen incorporated plastic bottles, wooden planks, cloth and cardboard.",
      "The life and death cycle of these famous animals \u2014 formed mostly out of PVC pipes \u2014 has left behind an impressive fossil record, which is on display at the exhibition.",
      "Marloes Koster, who organized the exhibition for Delft\u2019s Prinsenhof Museum, said that Jansen\u2019s ultimate goal is to create a beast that will live forever.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not there yet, so these are the ones that didn\u2019t make it,\u201d she added.",
      "The museum is undergoing major renovations, so Koster and her colleagues have been putting together arts and culture events at alternative venues around the city while the building is shut.",
      "Born near the North Sea, Jansen grew up captivated by the wind that often hits the Dutch coastline. He harnessed it to allow his animals to \u201cwalk\u201d along the beach. Every year, he creates a new strandbeest and, at the end of the summer, declares the animal dead.",
      "\u201cAll summer I do experiments, and in the fall I\u2019m a little bit wiser (about) how these animals should survive in the future,\u201d Jansen said.",
      "Many of the visitors to the opening of the exhibition had followed Jansen\u2019s work for years and were keen to understand how the strandbeesten had changed over time.",
      "\u201cYou see a kind of development in the way he does things. So they start out very simple, and then it gets increasingly complicated. So they evolve,\u201d said Cor Nonhof, a Delft local who had come to see the exhibition with his wife.",
      "Even at the opening, Jansen was already keen to return to the beach to work on the latest evolution of his strandbeesten.",
      "\u201cI cannot do anything else,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cAnd I am very happy with that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In the heart of Spain\u2019s capital, the famous Sobrino de Bot\u00edn restaurant proudly holds the title of being the world\u2019s oldest restaurant",
      "MADRID -- In the heart of Spain's capital, Sobrino de Bot\u00edn holds a coveted Guinness World Record as the world's oldest restaurant. Exactly three hundred years after it opened its doors, Bot\u00edn welcomes droves of daily visitors hungry for Castilian fare with a side of history.",
      "But on the outskirts of Madrid, far from the souvenir shops and tourist sites, a rustic tavern named Casa Pedro makes a bold claim. Its owners assert the establishment endured not just the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s and the Napoleonic invasion in the early 1800s, but even the War of Spanish Succession at the start of the 18th century \u2014 a lineage that would make Casa Pedro older than Bot\u00edn and a strong contender for the title.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating when you say, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve been around since 1702,\u2019 but ... you can\u2019t prove it,\u201d said manager and eighth-generation proprietor Irene Gui\u00f1ales. \u201cIf you look at the restaurant\u2019s logo, it says \u2018Casa Pedro, since 1702,\u2019 so we said, \u2018Damn it, let\u2019s try to prove it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Gui\u00f1ales, 51, remembers her grandfather swearing by Casa Pedro\u2019s age, but she was aware that decades-old hearsay from a proud old-timer wouldn't be enough to prove it. Her family hired a historian and has so far turned up documents dating the restaurant's operations to at least 1750.",
      "That puts them within striking distance of Bot\u00edn\u2019s record.",
      "Both taverns are family-owned. Both offer Castilian classics like stewed tripe and roast suckling pig. They are decorated with charming Spanish tiles, feature ceilings with exposed wooden beams and underground wine cellars. And both enjoy a rich, star-studded history.",
      "Bot\u00edn's celebrated past includes a roster of literary patrons like Truman Capote, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Graham Greene. In his book \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d Ernest Hemingway described it as \u201cone of the best restaurants in the world.\" While Casa Pedro may not have boasted the same artistic pedigree, it boasts its own VIPs. Its walls are adorned with decades-old photographs of former Spanish King Juan Carlos I dining in one of its many rooms. The current Spanish monarch, King Felipe VI dines there, too, albeit more inconspicuously than his father.",
      "But the similarities between the two hotspots end there.",
      "Casa Pedro was once a stop on the only road heading north from the Spanish capital toward France. Its clientele is largely local regulars, like David Gonz\u00e1lez and Mayte Villena, who for years have spent every Friday lunching at the tavern.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn't change a thing for us,\u201d Villena said about the restaurant someday securing the Guinness title.",
      "Bot\u00edn, on the other hand, is a stone\u2019s throw from Madrid\u2019s famed Plaza Mayor, where any day of the week tour guides are herding groups around town \u2014 and often straight through the restaurant's front door.",
      "Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, a third-generation proprietor of Bot\u00edn, concedes that the Guinness accolade awarded in 1987 has helped business, but said the restaurant had enough history to draw visitors even before.",
      "\u201cIt has a certain magic,\u201d he said.",
      "The question then becomes: How can either restaurant definitively claim the title? Guinness provides its specific guidelines for the superlative only to applicants, according to spokesperson Kylie Galloway, noting that it entails \u201csubstantial evidence and documentation of the restaurant\u2019s operation over the years.\"",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said that Guinness required Bot\u00edn show that it has continuously operated in the same location with the same name.",
      "The only time the restaurant closed was during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did Casa Pedro.",
      "That criteria would mean that restaurants that are even older \u2014 Paris' Le Procope, which says it was founded in 1686, or Beijing\u2019s Bianyifang, founded in 1416, or the 1673-established White Horse Tavern in Newport, Rhode Island \u2014 aren't eligible for the designation.",
      "La Campana, in Rome\u2019s historic center, claims over 500 years of operation, citing documents on its menu and in a self-published history. Its owners say they have compiled the requisite paperwork and plan to submit it to Guinness.",
      "Gui\u00f1ales and her husband couldn't consult archives from the former town of Fuencarral, now a Madrid neighborhood. Those papers went up in flames during the Spanish Civil War. Instead, they delved into Spanish national archives, where they found land registries of the area from the First Marquess of Ensenada (1743-1754) that showed the existence of a tavern, wine cellar and inn in the small town as of 1750.",
      "In their spare time, the couple continues to hunt for records proving that Casa Pedro indeed dates back to 1702, as is proclaimed on its walls, takeout bags and sugar packets.",
      "But even if they dig up the final documents and wrest the Guinness honor from Bot\u00edn, Gui\u00f1ales concedes that her restaurant's quiet location makes it unlikely to draw Bot\u00edn\u2019s clientele in central Madrid.",
      "\u201cTo think that we could reach that public would be incredible,\u201d Gui\u00f1ales said. \u201cIt's a dream, but it's a dream.\u201d",

      "So he went to a megachurch youth group, which promised teenage shenanigans without much danger. The \u201csanitized mischief,\u201d as he describes it, was perfect for Morris, who grew up as a nerdy, nervous kid.",
      "\u201cYouth group was great for me,\u201d Morris said. \u201cWe can put on a show, we can sing little songs, we can do little skits.

      "Morris also said he\u2019d rarely seen stories set in the kind of youth group he\u2019d grown up in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve just never seen that little world written about in a way that I thought was like, accurate or, like, that got what it was about,\u201d he said.",
      "Published last year by New York-based First Second Books, \u201cYouth Group\u201d tells the story of Kay Radford, a theater kid who winds up joining the Stone Mission megachurch youth group after her parents split up. Her mom is a true believer but lonely. Kay is more skeptical but lonely as well and angry at her dad.",
      "\u201cChurch might help with all this,\u201d Kay\u2019s mom tells her early on. \u201cI think we both could use some community.\u201d",
      "At the youth group, Kay is met by youth leader Meg Parks, a kind but sometimes over-the-top youth leader in pink; a bearded, hippy pastor who turns the \u201cPina Colada song\u201d \u2014 the Rupert Holmes hit \u201cEscape\u201d \u2014 into a metaphor for spiritual seeking; and a band that churns out parodies like \u201cI Saw the Christ\u201d sung to the melody of Ace of Base\u2019s \u201cThe Sign.\u201d",
      "Though fictional, the songs fit the kind of pop culture reference \u2014 sometimes known as a \u201cJesus juke\u201d \u2014 that youth groups can be known for.",
      "\u201cI always think there\u2019s something funny about that move, where you take a secular piece of entertainment, like a song that\u2019s in the zeitgeist, or a popular movie and try and give the hidden religious message,\u201d Morris said.",
      "Kay eventually discovers the youth pastor and some of the older Stone Mission kids also fight demons. That fight becomes personal after one of the demons goes after her dad, and Kay decides to join the battle. Along the way, the Stone Mission kids team up with youth groups from other faiths \u2014 Temple Beth Israel, Immaculate Heart parish and the Polaris Coven \u2014 to fight off a demon invasion with the help of some training by an order of nuns.",
      "Morris said he and illustrator Bowen McCurdy wanted to tell a story that was more than just satire. And while he no longer embraces the faith of his youth, Morris still sees value in the lessons he learned, like the importance of loving your neighbor.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to tell a story of people from a lot of different religions coming together with a common goal,\u201d he said.",
      "Matthew Cressler, a religion scholar and creator of the webcomic series \u201cBad Catholics, Good Trouble,\u201d said comics with evangelical or denominational settings like \u201cYouth Group\u201d are uncommon. Religion in comics, he said, is often seen as \u201ca marker of difference\u201d: for example, Kamala Khan, the Muslim-American hero known as Ms. Marvel, or Matt Murdock, better known as Daredevil, who is Irish-Catholic. In the 1960s, when Daredevil was created, Catholics were still seen as outsiders to the American mainstream, and many of the most popular heroes, like Batman, were seen as Mainline Protestants.",
      "While there were comics for evangelicals, they were often evangelistic, like the controversial Jack Chick tracts or the Christianized adventures of Archie and his friends, published by Spire Comics starting in the 1970s. And evangelicals have often downplayed the kind of sacramental imagery and architecture found in mainline or Catholic settings and try to avoid the kind of visuals needed for comics, said Cressler.",
      "Matthew Brake, founder and editor of online publication Pop Culture and Theology, said non-denominational churches often have a \u201clet\u2019s go to the mall aesthetic\u201d and lack the visual clout of Catholicism.",
      "\u201cNondenominational churches are sort of a cultural underdog,\u201d he said.",
      "That may change, Brake said, as creators like Morris, who grew up in non-denominational settings, come of age. And those settings often contain surprises. Although they are most known for things like worship music and purity culture, megachurches also provide space to talk about things like social justice.",
      "Still, he wonders if many nondenominational Christians would be the kinds of fans that would enjoy a book like \u201cYouth Group\u201d or \u201cPreacher,\u201d a late-1990s comic about an evangelical pastor who ends up possessed by a supernatural being.",
      "David Canham, who reviews comics for the secular pop-culture website AIPT \u2014 short for \u201cAdventures in Poor Taste\u201d \u2014 had mixed feelings about \u201cYouth Group.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst off, there\u2019s plenty of \u201990s nostalgia \u2014 a good-natured tongue-in-cheek look back at many of the silly and absurd things about \u201990s culture, with a focus on evangelical Christian culture,\u201d he wrote when the book came out. \u201c\u2018Youth Group\u2019 delivers on this point.\u201d",
      "But the book\u2019s take on pluralism \u2014 the idea that all religion is on the same side \u2014 turned him off as an evangelical Christian. \u201cI don\u2019t want to recommend a book that promotes a worldview that so strongly disagrees with my own beliefs,\u201d he wrote.",
      "At first, Morris said he was worried the book might offend Christians and atheists alike. Some evangelicals might feel the book mocks their faith, while atheists might think the book overlooks the shortcomings of religious groups.",
      "Both those criticisms would be fair, he said. Religious groups get a lot of things wrong, and yet churches and other faith groups remain important to their members. Morris said he tried to walk a fine line of gently poking fun at faith while showing why it still has an impact on people\u2019s lives, and how the friendships made in youth groups may long endure.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want the humor to be like, church is stupid, or say, \u2018look at this dumb church stuff,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted it to be funny and familiar.\u201d",
      "Morris said he wanted to capture the mixed feelings people have about the faiths in which they grew up. While he appreciated Bible teachings like caring for the needy, some of the politics and social messages, especially about LGBTQ+ folks, were a turnoff, he said.",
      "Religion, he said, is complicated.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of wonderful memories, and there\u2019s a lot of stuff that gives me the ick,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that\u2019s in the book. I hope you can see how a religious upbringing can be upsetting and wonderful \u2014 comforting but also makes you mad.\u201d",

      "YEONCHEON, South Korea -- Hundreds of fans gathered in the early morning hours to catch a glimpse of K-pop superstars Jimin and Jung Kook, the latest and final members of BTS to be discharged from South Korea\u2019s mandatory military service.",
      "The pair wore their military uniforms Wednesday, saluted and addressed fans who had assembled to see the pair after their discharge.",
      "Jung Kook thanked the journalists and fans who traveled to see him and Jimin after their discharge and acknowledged how different it was to be back in the spotlight. \u201cActually, it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been in front of cameras, and I didn\u2019t even put on makeup, so I\u2019m a bit embarrassed,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d",
      "The pair enlisted in December 2023, one day after RM and V did the same. The latter were discharged on Tuesday.",
      "Supporters traveled from around the world to the public sports ground where the meet-and-greet took place. It was moved from the military base\u2019s gate for safety reasons. Color-wrapped buses bearing BTS members\u2019 faces lined the streets while red and yellow balloons floated above and a decorated food truck provided free coffee and water, adding to the festive atmosphere.",
      "Many supporters wore masks, conscious of potential backlash after the band\u2019s label discouraged attendance citing safety concerns. Despite the challenges, fans like Anaesi from Portugal said the 20-hour journey to Yeoncheon, a town near the tense border with North Korea, was worth it.",
      "\u201cPortugal is a small country, but inside of Portugal, BTS is a king,\u201d she said. Anaesi, who discovered BTS on YouTube, said the group \u201csaved\u201d her from depression. \u201cSo for me BTS is my angel,\u201d she said. She displayed a colorful upper arm tattoo featuring a golden shield emblazoned with \u201cARMY\u201d and an eagle above it, complemented by Korean text listing BTS members\u2019 names and those of her friends.",
      "V thanked fans Tuesday for their patience in waiting for him and RM's return and teased the band's reunion. \"If you can just wait a little bit longer, we will return with a really amazing performance.\u201d",
      "The seven singers of the popular K-pop band plan to reunite as a group sometime in 2025 after they finish their service.",
      "Six of the group\u2019s seven members served in the army, while Suga is fulfilling his duty as a social service agent, an alternative form of military service. He will be discharged later this month.",
      "Jin, the oldest BTS member, was discharged in June 2024. J-Hope was discharged in October.",
      "In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18 to 28 are required by law to perform 18-21 months of military service under a conscription system meant to deter aggression from rival North Korea.",
      "The law gives special exemptions to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers if they have obtained top prizes in certain competitions and are assessed to have enhanced national prestige. K-pop stars and other entertainers aren\u2019t subject to such privileges.",
      "However, in 2020, BTS postponed their service until age 30 after South Korea\u2019s National Assembly revised its Military Service Act, allowing K-pop stars to delay their enlistment until age 30.",
      "There was heated public debate in 2022 over whether to offer special exemptions of mandatory military service for BTS members, until the group\u2019s management agency announced in October 2022 that all seven members would fulfill their duties.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Country musician Conner Smith fatally hit a pedestrian while driving his truck in Nashville over the weekend, and he currently faces no charges as an investigation continues, police said.",
      "Metro Nashville Police said Smith, 24, hit Dorothy Dobbins, 77, Sunday evening while she was crossing the road inside a marked crosswalk. Dobbins, a retired attorney, later died at a hospital. The Tennessee Bar Association posted on its website that Dobbins had been out walking her dog when she was hit.",
      "Police say Smith showed no signs of impairment. They believe the \u201cpreliminary contributing factor\u201d appears to be that Smith did not yield the right of way to the pedestrian.",
      "Smith\u2019s attorney, Worrick Robinson, said his client is cooperating with the investigation.",
      "\u201cHis heart goes out to Ms. Dobbins\u2019 family during this incredibly difficult time,\" Robinson said in a statement.",
      "Dobbins was a leader in the city\u2019s legal aid and family law communities, where she practiced for over 40 years, according to posts by the Bar Association and the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands. She played a \u201cfoundational role in opening Nashville\u2019s first domestic violence shelter,\u201d according to a Facebook post from the Legal Aid Society, and she wrote the state\u2019s first order of protection legislation.",

      "Lame arrived in the U.S. on April 30 and \u201coverstayed the terms of his visa,\u201d the ICE spokesperson said. The Associated Press sent a message seeking comment Tuesday to the email address listed on Lame\u2019s Instagram account. He has not publicly commented on his detainment.",
      "His detainment and voluntary departure from the U.S. comes amid President Donald Trump\u2019s escalating crackdown on immigration, including raids in Los Angeles that sparked days of protests against ICE, as the president tests the bounds of his executive authority.",
      "A voluntary departure \u2014 which was granted to Lame \u2014 allows those facing removal from the U.S. to avoid a deportation order on their immigration record, which could prevent them from being allowed back into the U.S. for up to a decade.",
      "The 25-year-old rose to international fame during the pandemic without ever saying a word in his videos, which would show him reacting to absurdly complicated \u201clife hacks.\" He has over 162 million followers on TikTok alone.",
      "The Senegal-born influencer moved to Italy when he was an infant with his working class parents and has Italian citizenship.",
      "His internet fame quickly evolved. He signed a multi-year partnership with designer brand Hugo Boss in 2022. In January, he was appointed as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador.",

      "The admission from Victoria Heuermann isn\u2019t made on camera but through a statement from producers near the end of \u201cThe Gilgo Beach Killer: House of Secrets,\u201d a three-part documentary on NBC\u2019s streaming service Peacock.",
      "\u201cA week before the series release, Victoria Heuermann told the producers that based on publicly available facts that have been presented and explained to her, she now believes her father is most likely the Gilgo Beach killer,\u201d reads a statement at the close of the final episode of the documentary.",
      "Bob Macedonio, an attorney for Heuermann\u2019s now ex-wife, Asa Ellerup, said in a statement after the documentary\u2019s release that \u201ctime will only tell\u201d whether his client will ever accept that her husband may have been a serial killer.",

      "In the documentary, Victoria Heuermann struggles to reconcile her childhood memories with the portrait of the killer described by authorities.",
      "She says her father was around the family \u201c90% of the time\u201d and was never violent toward any of them.",
      "At the same time, Victoria Heuermann acknowledged there were times when he stayed home while the family went on vacation and that she was around 10 to 13 years old when the killings happened. Prosecutors say Heuerman committed some of the killings in the basement while his family was out of town.",
      "\u201cWhether or not I believe my dad did it or not, I\u2019m on the fence about that,\u201d said the now 28-year-old. \u201cPart of me thinks he didn\u2019t do it, but at the same time, I don\u2019t know, he could have just totally had a double life.\u201d",
      "Ellerup, for her part, maintained she saw no \u201cabnormal behavior\u201d in their nearly three decades of marriage.",
      "She dismissed a computer file prosecutors claim is a \u201cblueprint\u201d of his crimes as \u201cabsurd.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors say the document features a series of checklists for before, during and after a killing, such as a \u201cbody prep\u201d checklist that includes among other items a note to \u201cremove head and hands.\u201d",
      "Ellerup also shrugged off other evidence prosecutors have enumerated in court documents, including a vast collection of bondage and torture pornography found on electronic devices seized from their home, and hairs linked to Heuermann that were recovered on most of the victims\u2019 bodies.",
      "At the same time, she revealed that in July 2009, around the time one of his alleged victims went missing, Heuermann suddenly renovated a bathroom while she and their two children visited her family in Iceland. But she noted her former husband eventually joined the family for their final week of the trip.",
      "\u201cMy husband, he\u2019s a family man. He\u2019s my hero,\u201d Ellerup said. \u201cWhat I want to say to him is, \u2018I love you, no matter what.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ellerup divorced Heuermann after his arrest in 2023. But in the documentary, Victoria Heuermann says the separation was for financial reasons to protect the family\u2019s assets.",
      "Indeed, the filmmakers captured the family speaking to Heuermann by phone from jail, and the mother and daughter have been regularly attending court hearings with their attorney.",
      "The family, which also includes Ellerup\u2019s adult son from a prior marriage, is also planning to put up its notoriously ramshackle house in well-to-do Massapequa Park for sale as they look to move to a property they own in South Carolina.",
      "Ryan McCormick, an NBCUniversal spokesperson, declined to say how much family was compensated, though he said the payments could not go toward Heuermann or his defense funds.",

      "Before Celine Song was an Oscar-nominated filmmaker, she was a playwright in New York who needed day jobs to pay rent. That\u2019s how she found herself as a professional matchmaker.",
      "What may have begun as a purely transactional gig, a way for her to keep making her art in an expensive city, taught her more about people\u2019s wants and needs and the true contents of their hearts than she could have ever imagined.",
      "\u201cI always wanted to write something about it because there seemed to be a story in it that is massive and very epic in proportion,\u201d Song said. \u201cIt affects every human being on Earth.\"",
      "And while waiting for her breakout film \u201cPast Lives\u201d to debut, she did. That film is \u201cMaterialists,\u201d a modern-day New York love story starring Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans that\u2019s heading to theaters this weekend. Johnson is the matchmaker presented with two different types of men for herself \u2014 one a poor struggling actor and ex-boyfriend, the other a wealthy \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 and the internet has already been drawing battle lines. But, like \u201cPast Lives\u201d wasn\u2019t really about a love triangle, \u201cMaterialists\u201d is about something more than the question of which guy is the \u201ccorrect\u201d choice.",
      "Song and Johnson spoke with The Associated Press about the film, falling in love and the modern marketplace of dating. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "SONG: We met up thinking that we were just going to get to know each other and be friends and I walked away from that conversation \u2014 this is just from my perspective \u2014 but I think I was still sitting there when I texted my producers and the studio being like, \u201cI think I\u2019ve found my Lucy.\u201d That\u2019s how casting works for me, it\u2019s always about falling in love. It\u2019s very connected to what we talk about in the film. Like, there\u2019s no mathematical anything. It just the feeling that you get talking to someone and you\u2019re like, oh I just know.",
      "JOHNSON: I knew you had this movie that you were about to start making. I was basically told it was too late. I was like, but I really want to meet her because she\u2019s so smart, and I\u2019ve seen interviews and obviously had seen \u201cPast Lives.\u201d I just wanted talk and get to know her as an artist and a person and so I went into this being like there\u2019s no chance that I\u2019ll be in this movie, but maybe she\u2019ll make another one. We just had such a good time talking, I didn\u2019t even know that I was someone she was thinking about. A few weeks later we spoke. It was very romantic.",
      "JOHNSON: She\u2019s sort of at the top of her game in her work and is very disconnected from her heart and focused on being a perfectionist and getting people to get married. On the surface, you see her as a very transactional person and not really invested in people\u2019s souls, but she actually is and really does want the best for them. She\u2019s also on her own journey of trying to figure out what it is she wants for herself in this life, and, essentially, do you fight for the thing that you think you want, or do you fight for that thing that you know you need? Is that right, Celine?",
      "SONG: That\u2019s so good.",
      "SONG: It was never going to be a conversation about which flavor of a person. It\u2019s actually so much more about this marketplace of dating that all of us live in if you\u2019re single, and also the marketplace that Dakota\u2019s character is navigating. She knows the math better than anyone else in the film. She\u2019s an excellent matchmaker.",
      "Pedro plays somebody who is probably, in straight dating, someone of the highest possible value. Chris\u2019 character, in the spectrum in the marketplace of values of dating, is someone who is of the lowest value possible. I find them to be such adorable characters, very worthy of an adoration.",
      "Lucy knows exactly where they fall in the in the stock market of men. It\u2019s actually about the way that the math around that is going to blow up.",
      "JOHNSON: Celine speaks so eloquently about the marketplace of dating and I glitch at those words because I\u2019m like, you can\u2019t explain love that way. But that\u2019s actually how people are. Marriage used to be a business deal. It was like, my father wants your cows and my mother needs your wheat and whatever. It was a trade-off. But now there\u2019s all these books about how we expect our partner to fulfill every single aspect of our needs. And the world being dominated by social media, people don\u2019t meet in real life anymore. They don\u2019t behave normally in public.",
      "People are in a very strange place in evolution, and I think the difference between these two characters and these two men, sure they are different ends of the spectrum in terms of like technical value, materialistic value. But also each of them have the opposite in terms of psycho-spiritual value and emotional value and what they can offer the other person in terms of soul evolution and growth.",
      "Perhaps because she works in this world of trying to understand people and what they want, she\u2019s forced to go more inward and really interrogate herself and say, what do I really want and what is actually important in this life? Is it how much money I have or is it how truly loved I am?",
      "SONG: To me, it\u2019s about this contradiction, right? It\u2019s this thing of how we talk about what we want in our partner, when we\u2019re asked to use language to describe it, and how we literally, spiritually fall in love. The gap between those two things is terrifyingly big. To me, that\u2019s where the mystery of the film is.",

Just a few years ago, their inclusion might've been unthinkable amid murky regulations and a lack of public awareness surrounding harm reduction.",
      "Advocates say drugs are commonly consumed at music festivals, making them ideal locations for harm reduction activities. While more music festivals are allowing such activities, activists are pushing for expanded efforts as some festivals remain cautious.",
      "Founded by William Perry and Ingela Travers-Hayward in 2022, This Must Be The Place has since given away an estimated $4.5 million in naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal medication, at festivals and smaller community events.",
      "In the very beginning, without a \u201cproof of concept,\u201d as Perry describes it, they had trouble partnering with festivals. Eventually, a few festivals in the Midwest agreed to let them table, which \u201cgot us in the door with Bonnaroo in 2022,\u201d says Perry, referring to the major U.S. festival operated by C3 Presents, one of the largest concert promoters on the planet. Now they have a presence at 35 major U.S. festivals \u2014 including Lollapalooza, Governors Ball and Besame Mucho \u2014 where they collaborate directly with C3 and their security personnel.",
      "The organization's growth overlaps with advancing federal regulations. According to Daliah Heller, vice president of overdose prevention initiatives at the global public health nonprofit Vital Strategies, naloxone distribution used to be determined by state regulations until 2023, when the Food and Drug Administration approved the first over-the-counter nasal spray.",
      "\u201cWe no longer need the prescription laws to be amended to allow for the distribution of naloxone,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it's like buying aspirin \u2014 it's over the counter.\u201d",
      "Last year, This Must Be the Place gave away 46,146 units of Narcan \u2014 a brand name for naloxone \u2014 through their national festival outreach.",
      "Emmett Beliveau, chief operating officer of C3 Presents, says working with This Must Be the Place was C3\u2019s first time implementing public-facing harm reduction strategies, in addition to the promoter's existing medical programs.",
      "Bringing the organization into C3\u2019s festivals was \u201cnot in response to anything that has happened at one of our festivals,\u201d he says, but rather because of the \u201cnumber of fatalities happening in our communities.\u201d",
      "Some activists believe attendees are most responsive to receiving harm reduction education from peers instead of authority figures. And so, for the last three years, a nonprofit dedicated to combating accidental drug overdoses among young adults, Team Awareness Combating Overdose, has distributed fentanyl test strips and Narcan at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.",
      "Former TACO CEO Kameran Mody says that music festivals are ideal locations for distribution and education because \u201cmusic and the use of drugs are synonymous with each other.\u201d",
      "TACO distributes through what Mody describes as \u201cguerrilla-style marketing.\u201d They enlist volunteers, train them on how to use naloxone, and ship Narcan and test strips to them to bring into the festival.",
      "They do not involve the festival organizers. Representatives for Coachella did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment.",
      "In 2023, a TACO volunteer administered Narcan to an unresponsive Coachella attendee exhibiting signs of an overdose. The organization says the attendee regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cThat was one of our biggest successes,\u201d Mody says.",
      "In 2019, at Bonnaroo, a 27-year-old man was found dead at his campsite \u2014 right after harm reduction activists had picketed the Tennessee festival because it didn't allow drug testing. The toxicology report found ecstasy and fentanyl in his system.",
      "At the time, under state law, test strips were criminalized and classified as drug paraphernalia. That\u2019s changed: In 2022, Tennessee decriminalized fentanyl test strips. By the end of 2023, 44 other states and D.C. had done the same.",
      "But in some states, drug paraphernalia laws are written in a way that isn't completely transparent \u2014 there are test strips that are not fentanyl-specific, Heller points out \u2014 and criminalization and social stigmas endure.",
      "Some have found workarounds. \u201cEven in the states where the legalities were a bit unclear, instead of just coming in and hoping things worked out, we would reach out to the health department, and say \u2018We run this project, how do feel about it?\u2019\u201d says Perry. \u201cWe would end up with letters from the highest-ranking health official, either in the county or in the state, saying \u2018We approve of this.\u2019 That circumvented any roadblocks.\u201d",
      "Some festivals, though, might be hesitant to use test strips because \u201cit\u2019s tough for them to admit that drugs are being used,\u201d Mody says. Some festivals have even banned naloxone.",
      "While This Must Be The Place distributes fentanyl test strips at some Ohio events, C3 doesn't distribute test strips at its events and does not plan to. Beliveau doesn't believe fentanyl test strips are effective and expressed concern they could encourage drug use. Test strips, which can detect fentanyl in pills, powders or injectables, are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a low-cost means of helping prevent drug overdoses.",
      "At a three-day electronic music festival in Mexico City earlier this year, a booth provided free, anonymous drug testing. The initiative, known as \u201cCheca tu Sustancia\u201d (Check Your Substance), was spearheaded by the Instituto RIA, a Mexico-based drug policy research and advocacy organization.",
      "When unexpected substances are detected, users received detailed information on what they are, their risks, potential interactions with other substances and dosage adjustments, empowering them to make informed choices.",
      "Perry says they are aware of smaller festivals in the United States conducting drug checking, but \u201cthey do it in a very underground and whisper network way\u201d to avoid criminalization.",
      "What Perry says his organization would like to see at music festivals in the future would be harm reduction areas \u2014 sections where attendees who have taken drugs can be monitored, not to \u201cget them into trouble\u201d but to ensure safety.",
      "Heller says there are a number of groups working to destigmatize drugs, promote decriminalization, and promote drug checking.",
      "\u201cWe already have drug checking happening in cities,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes perfect sense to expand the settings where you would offer that to include music festivals. It's the same rationale. ... The issue is this idea of liability. You\u2019d have to create a law, essentially, that would protect the festival from liability.\u201d",

      "Jurors in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sex crimes retrial appear to be focusing on one of his three accusers as they deliberate for a fourth day",
      "NEW YORK -- Jurors in Harvey Weinsteinn'ssex crimes retrial appeared to be focusing on one of his three accusers as deliberations stretched into a fourth day Tuesday, with no further sign of interpersonal tensions that flared earlier.",
      "The jury had requested to start off Tuesday with electronic copies of emails and other evidence pertaining to Jessica Mann \u2014 the accuser with arguably the most complex history with Weinstein. Jurors deliberated through the morning without sending any further requests.",
      "During days of testimony, Mann said the Oscar-winning movie producer raped her in 2013 amid a consensual relationship that continued for years afterward. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers emphasized that she kept seeing him, accepting invitations and sending warm messages to him. Mann said she \u201ccompartmentalized\u201d the pain he caused her.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges in the case. In addition to the rape charge, he's accused of sexually assaulting two other women, Mimi Haley and Kaja Sokola.",
      "Weinstein didn't testify during the current trial, but maintained through his attorneys that he had completely consensual encounters with his accusers, who wanted his help building show business careers.",
      "Weinstein was one of the movie industry's most powerful figures until a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him became public in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement and eventually leading to criminal charges.",
      "The jury is made up of seven women and five men. Their closed-door discussions began Thursday and apparently have been fractious at times.",
      "One juror asked Friday to be excused because he felt one member of the group was being treated unfairly. Then on Monday, the foreperson complained to the judge, prosecutors and defense lawyers that some jurors were \u201cpushing\" others to change their minds, talking about Weinstein's past and going beyond the charges.",
      "The foreperson didn't specify what was said. Trial evidence has included some testimony about allegations outside the scope of the current charges, such as mentions of the groundswell of claims against the ex-studio boss in 2017.",
      "Yet another juror soon asked to speak to the court, where she opined that things were \u201cgoing well.\u201d By the end of Monday, the jury as a whole said in a note that it was \u201cmaking good progress.\u201d",
      "There was progress Tuesday on at least one front: Jurors ultimately were given coffee, as requested, Judge Curtis Farber said. He hadn't initially thought the state court system could provide it.",
      "Weinstein originally was convicted in New York in 2020 of raping Mann and forcing oral sex on Haley. Sokola's allegation was added last year, after New York state's highest court overturned the 2020 conviction and sent the case back for retrial.",
      "Meanwhile, Weinstein is appealing a 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not identify people without their permission if they say they have been sexually assaulted. Sokola, Mann and Haley have agreed to be named.",

      "A Connecticut judge has settled a bitter feud over the estate of the late legendary blues guitarist Johnny Winter, ordering his managers to pay $226,000 in damages for improper payments they received after his 2014 death and rejecting their claim to the rights to his music.",
      "Relatives of Winter's late wife, Susan, sued Winter's manager, Paul Nelson, and his wife, Marion, in 2020, claiming the Nelsons swindled more than $1 million from Winter's music business. The Nelsons denied the allegations and countersued. They accused the relatives of improperly having Paul Nelson ousted as the beneficiary of Winter's estate, and they claimed ownership of his music rights.",
      "After a seven-day trial before a judge in January 2024, Judge Trial Referee Charles Lee ruled Friday that the Nelsons received improper payments and made improper withdrawals from Winter's accounts, but rejected claims they committed fraud, mismanagement and breach of contract.",
      "\u201cThe court finds that the conduct for which it has awarded the damages set forth above was negligent or at least arguably legitimate,\u201d Lee wrote in a 54-page decision that also rejected the claims in the Nelsons' countersuit.",
      "The judge said the Nelsons' most serious impropriety was withdrawing $112,000 from Winter's business account and depositing it into one of their own accounts in 2019, without listing Susan Winter as a signatory on their account. Susan Winter owned all of her husband's assets \u2014 valued at about $3 million at the time of his death. The judge said punitive damages may be imposed on the Nelsons because of that transfer.",
      "Paul Nelson, who managed Johnny Winter's business from 2005 to 2019 and played guitar in his band, died in March 2024 from a heart attack during a music tour. Marion Nelson, who did bookkeeping for the Winters and the music business, did not immediately return an email message Monday. The Nelsons' lawyers did not immediately return phone and email messages. It wasn't clear if they planned to appeal.",
      "Susan Winter died from lung cancer in October 2019. Months before her death, she removed Paul Nelson as her successor trustee to her family trust, which included all of her late husband's assets. She named her sister and brother, Bonnie and Christopher Warford, from Charlotte, North Carolina, as her new successor trustees, and they sued the Nelsons.",
      "The Warfords' lawyers did not immediately return phone and email messages Monday. Phone numbers for the Warfords listed in public records were no longer in service.",
      "The Nelsons claimed the Warfords took advantage of Susan Winter and had her sign legal documents while she was medicated near the end of her life. They also alleged the Warfords soured their relationship with Susan Winter with false embezzlement claims. The Warfords denied those allegations.",
      "The judge ruled that the Warfords were entitled to damages because of improper payments the Nelsons received, including $68,000 in royalty payments from a 2016 auction of Winter's assets, $69,000 in cash withdrawals, $18,000 in expense reimbursements and $15,000 in other royalty payments.",
      "The Warfords also were awarded $56,000 that remains in one of the Nelsons' accounts, the same account used in the $112,000 transfer criticized by the judge. In 2020, the Nelsons transferred about $151,000 out of that account to the Warfords\u2019 lawyers.",
      "Lee also rejected claims by the Warfords that Paul Nelson should not have received $300,000 in auction proceeds from the sale of three of Johnny Winter's guitars, because Winter promised those guitars to Paul Nelson.",
      "John Dawson Winter III was born and raised in Beaumont, Texas. He burst onto the world blues scene in the 1960s, dazzling crowds with his fast licks while his trademark long, white hair flew about from under his cowboy hat. He and his brother Edgar \u2014 both born with albinism \u2014 were both renowned musicians. Johnny Winter, who played at Woodstock in 1969, was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1988.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine listed him as the No. 63 best guitar player of all time in 2015. He released more than two dozen albums and was nominated for several Grammy Awards, winning his first one posthumously in 2015 for Best Blues Album for \u201cStep Back.\u201d Nelson produced the album and also took home a Grammy for it.",
      "Johnny Winter, who spent two decades living in Easton, Connecticut, before his death, battled heroin addiction for years and credited Nelson, whom he met in 1999, with helping him get off the opioid methadone and revive his career, according to the 2014 documentary, \u201cJohnny Winter: Down & Dirty.\u201d",

      "Trailblazing ballerina Misty Copeland has decided to move on to what she calls \u201cthe next stage\u201d in her career",
      "NEW YORK -- Ten years ago this month, Misty Copeland sat in front of a hastily arranged news conference at American Ballet Theatre, fighting back tears of pride over her new role: principal dancer.",
      "\u201cThis is it,\u201d she said, with emotion. \u201cThis has been my dream since I was 13.\u201d",
      "The occasion was highly unusual \u2014 normally, when a dancer is promoted, a brief press release is issued. But this was Copeland, a crossover star with fame far beyond the insular world of ballet. And now she was becoming the first Black female principal in the company\u2019s 75-year history \u2014 just days after her New York debut as the lead in \u201cSwan Lake\u201d brought a refreshingly diverse, packed audience to the Metropolitan Opera House.",
      "Now, a decade and many accomplishments later, Copeland is retiring from the company she joined as a teenager.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years at ABT, and I think it\u2019s time,\u201d Copeland, 42, told the Associated Press last week ahead of Monday\u2019s official announcement of her move. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to move to the next stage.\u201d",
      "The company is planning a splashy farewell on Oct. 22, featuring performances by Copeland \u2014 for the first time in five years \u2014 and other dancers. There will be speeches and film clips. And Copeland, who's been heavily involved in the planning, will get a chance to venture one more time onto that balcony in Verona; she\u2019ll dance again in the beautiful \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d pas de deux. Honorary chairs for the evening will be Caroline Kennedy and Oprah Winfrey.",
      "A lot has happened in a quarter-century. Copeland, whose success brought new energy to an art form that has always been overwhelmingly white, has authored a number of books, including a memoir and and several works for young people. The second installment of \u201cBunheads\u201d arrives in September, and more are already planned in a series she calls \u201ca reflection of my journey, showing the range of cultures and types of people that can be a part of the ballet world.\u201d",
      "Copeland has also made a short film with her production company. And her philanthropic organization, The Misty Copeland Foundation, works on increasing diversity in the dance world and giving more kids who grew up economically disadvantaged, like she did, the chance to dance.",
      "\u201cIt was so important for children growing up and seeing somebody like Misty and saying, \u2018Oh my gosh, she looks like I do,\u2019\u201d says Susan Jaffe, ABT\u2019s artistic director, who is overseeing the farewell performance. \u201cThrough her books, through her lectures, even her endorsements, she has really been a trailblazer.\"",
      "Still, progress moves slowly. When Copeland exits ABT, there will no longer be a Black female principal dancer at the company \u2014 nor at many ballet companies around the globe. Copeland discussed that continued challenge in the dance world, among other topics, in the AP interview last week. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "COPELAND: You know, I\u2019ve become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying thank you to the company. So it\u2019s a farewell. (But) it won\u2019t be the end of me dancing. \u2026 Never say never.",
      "COPELAND: I\u2019ve noticed that the conversation is not something we shy away from anymore in terms of the lack of equity, the lack of diversity in this (dance) world. That\u2019s one of the biggest shifts I\u2019ve seen \u2026 a lot of young people that just can imagine being part of it in some way. They can imagine stepping into Lincoln Center and being at the Metropolitan Opera House.",
      "COPELAND: It's definitely concerning, and I think I\u2019ve just gotten to a place in my career where there\u2019s only so much I can do on a stage. There\u2019s only so much that visual representation like that can do. I feel like it\u2019s the perfect timing for me to be stepping into a new role, and hopefully still shaping and shifting the ballet world and culture.",
      "COPELAND: I think about my partnership with (former ABT principal) Roberto Bolle and him giving me so many opportunities to travel the world with him \u2026 (Former ABT principal) Marcelo Gomes, he\u2019s been such a such a big part of my journey, and of course Herman Cornejo. We\u2019ve had a beautiful partnership throughout my career and I\u2019m excited to dance with him again (at the October farewell,)",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s made me even more patient. I just have a lighter and brighter outlook on life because it\u2019s just such an incredible thing to experience and witness... I think ballet has prepared me for being a mother in so many ways. I think it\u2019s ... prepared me for life and being resilient and patient and sensitive and empathetic and strong, and all of these things.",
      "COPELAND: He doesn\u2019t understand at all! (laughs) He\u2019s seen very little of me dancing. \u2026 But he\u2019s very drawn to it. He is a mover. He\u2019s very athletic. He is so drawn to music. He started violin on Monday. We live in the museums. He really is drawn to art. I think he\u2019s definitely on the artist\u2019s track.",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s been pretty evenly split between all of then. I think it just depends on what\u2019s at the forefront and what needs my focus. ... But it\u2019s exciting to be able to utilize dance in so many different mediums, and to me, that\u2019s how you get true diversity \u2014 by giving people different entry points into learning about dance and feeling like they can be a part of it, which has been my goal. How do I bring dance to as many people as possible in a way that really works for them?",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s a difficult time. And I think all we can really do is keep our heads down and keep doing the work. \u2026 we\u2019re fortunate in that way that we\u2019ve built great relationships and can continue to do the work right now through my foundation. There\u2019s no way to stop the people that feel passionate about this work. We will continue doing it. It is so necessary for the well-being of our societies and communities. I think there are times to speak out and yell from the rooftops. And for me, I feel like this is a time to keep my head down and really stay focused and do the work.",

      "NEW YORK -- Even the ushers at Radio City Music Hall seemed thrilled to be in the room where it happened.",
      "A few of them could be seen grooving, like everyone else at Sunday\u2019s Tony Awards, to the \u201cHamilton\u201d reunion performance \u2014 a medley of some of that blockbuster musical\u2019s biggest songs, performed by the original cast. The occasion was the 10th Broadway anniversary of Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s juggernaut that spawned multiple touring companies, a West End production and a live-capture film \u2014 and is still going strong.",
      "But while the theater was buzzing to songs like \u201cMy Shot,\u201d \u201cThe Schuyler Sisters,\u201d \u201cHistory Has Its Eyes on You\u201d and \u201cThe Room Where It Happens,\u201d some people were unfortunately NOT in the room where, er, it was happening. They were the ones who\u2019d taken a trip to the bar or a stroll around the lobby, and were then held from entering until the next commercial break \u2014 missing perhaps the night\u2019s most anticipated highlight.",
      "They also missed the entire audience singing along with Jonathan Groff, aka King George, \u201cDa-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da, Da-da, dat, dat, da-ya-da.\u201d Note for next year: Exit at your own peril!",
      "Some other notable moments from Tony night:",
      "Most award winners thank Mom, their agents, their co-stars and their spouses.",
      "Cole Escola, one of the major stars of this Tony night, promised Mom a call, but also decided to thank \u201cTeebo from Grindr\u201d \u2014 the dating app \u2014 when accepting the award for lead actor in a play.",
      "Escola is star and writer of the riotous \u201cOh, Mary!\u201d \u2014 a reimagining of the life of Mary Todd Lincoln (and her beleaguered husband, Abe) that addresses the question: What if the Lincoln assassination wasn\u2019t such a bad thing for Mary? (Mary wants to be a cabaret star, you see.) The show is seeing audiences collapse in laughter for 80 minutes every night on Broadway.",
      "Escola, a downtown cabaret star, beat out high-wattage competitors like George Clooney and Daniel Dae Kim for the acting award. They mentioned their co-nominees in their speech, saying they had enjoyed sharing \u201cwarm salads\u201d at pre-awards lunches.",
      "Escola is the first nonbinary actor to win a Tony in the category.",
      "When \u201cMaybe Happy Ending\u201d writers Hue Park and Will Aronson accepted the award for best book of a musical, the first handed out, Park felt it necessary to point out that they weren\u2019t an actual couple. \u201cI am very much single,\u201d he clarified, for anyone wondering.",
      "Then later, when the duo won for best score, Park deemed a reminder necessary: \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m still single.\u201d",
      "And then at the end of the night, \u201cMaybe Happy Ending,\u201d the charming and quirky romance between decommissioned robots in a futuristic Korea, won the big prize: best musical. Park did not get the mic. But producer Jeffrey Richards did, and he reminded the crowd: \u201cHue is still single.\u201d",
      "Cynthia Erivo, the \u201cWicked\u201d star and powerhouse vocalist hosting the evening, said it first: \u201cAs they apparently say in a very fertile piece of intellectual property,\" she said with a wink, \u201cthere\u2019s no place like home. And Broadway has always been mine.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a familiar theme on Tony night: the theater community as a welcoming haven for those who may feel different or unseen. It was echoed by Harvey Fierstein, winner of a lifetime achievement award, describing how he joined the theater after being welcomed by a company in Brooklyn. And it was expressed very emotionally by Nicole Scherzinger, winning best actress in a musical for \u201cSunset Blvd.\u201d",
      "\u201cGrowing up, I always felt like I didn\u2019t belong,\u201d said Scherzinger, former lead singer of the pop group Pussycat Dolls who plays Norma Desmond in the minimalist version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber show. \u201cBut you all have made me feel like I belong, and I have come home at last.\u201d Those last words echo the lyrics of one of Desmond\u2019s big numbers, \u201cAs If We Never Said Goodbye.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo if there\u2019s anyone out there who feels like they don\u2019t belong, or your time hasn\u2019t come, don\u2019t give up,\u201d Scherzinger continued. \u201cJust keep on giving and giving because the world needs your love and your light now more than ever.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s always lots of chatter going on during an awards show. But the way the crowd quieted down during Audra McDonald\u2019s powerful, agonized performance of \u201cRose\u2019s Turn\u201d from \u201cGypsy\u201d was striking. In the song's quiet moments, you heard utter silence in the vast room.",
      "McDonald, the Tonys' most awarded actor, is clearly revered by the theater community, who cheered her with standing ovations. But the award she was up for went to Scherzinger.",
      "It\u2019s been two years since HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession\u201d ended, but its stars keep turning up at awards shows \u2014 and often winning. Jeremy Strong won a Tony last year and was nominated for an Oscar this year. Kieran Culkin won an Oscar this year and is appearing on Broadway this season, though he wasn\u2019t nominated. And now it was the turn of Sarah Snook \u2014 Emmy and Golden Globe winner \u2014 to win a Tony.",
      "Snook, who played mercurial sibling Shiv Roy in the series, took the Tony for best actress in a play for \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray,\u201d in which she plays all 26 roles.",
      "Tony winner and musical theater regular Gavin Creel, who died last year of cancer, was a friend to many in the theater community, and was remembered more than once on Tony evening.",
      "During the early pre-show, actor Celia Keenan-Bolger was honored with the Isabelle Stevenson award, for her advocacy work in the arts. She spoke movingly of her deep friendship with Creel and their advocacy work together.",
      "Later, singer and actor Sara Bareilles performed a soulful duet of \u201cTomorrow\u201d from \u201cAnnie,\u201d harmonizing with Erivo, during the memorial segment. That segment ended with a photo of Creel, also a dear friend to Bareilles, who teared up.",
      "Both Bareilles and Keenan-Bolger are involved with the Gavin Creel Fellowship, an initiative that plans to provide $25,000 grants to five emerging theater actors each year.",
      "The final award had been announced by presenter Miranda \u2014 best musical to \u201cMaybe Happy Ending\u201d \u2014 and the audience started to disperse. But Erivo had another idea.",
      "Riffing on the concept of leaving, she launched into the famous \u201cDreamgirls\u201d ballad \u201cAnd I Am Telling You I\u2019m Not Going\u201d \u2014 with rewritten lyrics.",
      "It was a yet another powerhouse performance from someone who has one of the best voices on the planet. The audience stopped dispersing \u2014 and started cheering.",

      "Every month, thousands of women evade abortion bans in their home states by turning to telehealth clinics willing to send them pregnancy-ending drugs through the mail",
      "Every month, thousands of women thwart abortion bans in their home states by turning to telehealth clinics willing to prescribe pregnancy-ending drugs online and ship them anywhere in the country.",
      "Whether this is legal, though, is a matter of debate. Two legal cases involving a New York doctor could wind up testing the shield laws some states have passed to protect telehealth providers who ship abortion pills nationwide.",
      "Dr. Margaret Carpenter faces a felony charge in Louisiana for supplying abortion medication through the mail to a pregnant teen in that state. The patient's mother also faces criminal charges. A Texas judge fined the same physician $100,000 after the state accused her of prescribing abortion medication for a woman near Dallas.",
      "So far, the prosecution hasn't progressed thanks to New York's shield law, which has protected Carpenter from extradition to Louisiana. But other telehealth centers operating in states with similar legal protections for abortion providers are watching closely.",
      "\"We have great legal counsel who have advised us that what we are doing is legal,\u201d said Dr. Angel Foster, co-founder of The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, which is among a handful of telehealth providers that facilitate abortions from afar in states with bans.",
      "As more states consider enacting shield laws or expanding existing ones, whether one state can shield providers from liability for breaking another state's laws around abortion is still an unsettled area of law.",
      "Erik Baptist, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which opposes abortion, said shield laws violate a constitutional requirement that states respect the laws and legal judgments of other states.",
      "\"What these shield law states are doing are undermining the prerogative of these pro-life states to implement and enforce pro-life laws,\u201d said Baptist, director of the group\u2019s Center for Life. \u201dAnd so I think the Supreme Court ultimately will want to take this.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is inherently a challenge with shield laws and telehealth,\u201d said Carmel Shachar, faculty director of the Health Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School. \u201cAt a certain point, for the purposes of abortion bans, the courts will need to decide: Do we treat a telehealth abortion as happening within the state of the provider or within the state of the patient?\u201d",
      "Decades ago, the FDA approved the use of two prescription medicines \u2014 mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 to terminate pregnancies.",
      "But it wasn't until 2023 that telehealth abortions across states became more popular, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "The Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights, said that between April and June 2024 there were an average of 7,700 telehealth abortions performed each month in states that either ban abortion totally or after six weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The prescribing process at telehealth clinics varies by provider, but usually takes place entirely online, with the patient answering a series of health-related questions and consent forms.",
      "At some telehealth clinics, medical providers don't come face-to-face with patients, even via videoconferencing, and patients don't necessarily know the prescriber's name unless requested.",
      "For instance, when Foster's clinic, also known as The MAP, puts pills in the mail, only the name of the practice appears on the label, as allowed under the Massachusetts shield law. If patients have follow-up questions, they can talk or text the doctor working that day, but may not know that doctor's name either.",
      "Pills can arrive in a less than a week.",
      "\u201cThis has been the safety net, post-Dobbs, of allowing people who don\u2019t have the ability to travel out of state to get abortion care,\u201d said Greer Donley, a University of Pittsburgh law professor and abortion law expert.",
      "When dealing with medications not related to abortion, doctors are often able to write prescriptions for patients in other states. However, in most states, if the patient is located within its borders, the doctor must have a license issued by that state, according to Mei Wa Kwong, executive director of the The Center for Connected Health Policy.",
      "Twenty three states and Washington, D.C., currently have shield laws protecting abortion providers.",
      "Of those, eight have specific provisions protecting them from criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits even if the patient is in another state, according to the nonprofit research organization KFF. They include California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s request to extradite Carpenter hit a roadblock when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected it, citing the state\u2019s shield law. (A county clerk also cited the shield law as he refused to file the civil judgment from Texas.)",
      "\u201cThese are not doctors providing health care. They are drug dealers,\u201d Republican Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told state lawmakers as she promoted a bill that would expand who can sue and be sued in abortion medication cases. \u201cThey are violating our laws. They are sending illegal medications for purposes of procuring abortions that are illegal in our state.\u201d",
      "Julie Kay, the executive director of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, the nationwide organization co-founded by Carpenter, said providers won\u2019t be \u201cbullied and intimidated\u201d into ceasing operations.",
      "Other telehealth abortion providers said they also won't be deterred by legal threats.",
      "\u201cI have been working in this field for 25 years and this is part of the work,\" said Dr. Rebecca Gomperts, founder and director of Aid Access, an abortion pill supplier. \u201dIt\u2019s something that we all anticipated would happen,\" she said of the legal challenges.",
      "A doctor who is part of A Safe Choice, a network of California-based physicians that prescribes abortion pills to women in all 50 states, told The Associated Press he believes he is protected by the state's shield law, but is also taking precautions.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to be traveling outside of California for a very long time,\u201d said the doctor, who spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he wanted to protect his identity for safety reasons.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday named eight new vaccine policy advisers to replace the panel that he abruptly dismissed earlier this week.",
      "They include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines, a leading critic of pandemic-era lockdowns, and a professor of operations management.",
      "Kennedy's decision to \u201cretire\u201d the previous 17-member Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was widely decried by doctors' groups and public health organizations, who feared the advisers would be replaced by a group aligned with Kennedy's desire to reassess \u2014 and possibly end \u2014 longstanding vaccination recommendations.",
      "On Tuesday, before he announced his picks, Kennedy said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring great people onto the ACIP panel \u2013 not anti-vaxxers \u2013 bringing people on who are credentialed scientists.\u201d",
      "The new appointees include Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director for the National Association of Catholic Nurses, who has been listed as a board member and volunteer director for the National Vaccine Information Center, a group that is widely considered to be a leading source of vaccine misinformation.",
      "Another is Dr. Robert Malone, the former mRNA researcher who emerged as a close adviser to Kennedy during the measles outbreak. Malone, who runs a wellness institute and a popular blog, rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as he relayed conspiracy theories around the outbreak and the vaccines that followed. He has appeared on podcasts and other conservative news outlets where he\u2019s promoted unproven and alternative treatments for measles and COVID-19.",
      "He has claimed that millions of Americans were hypnotized into taking the COVID-19 shots and has suggested that those vaccines cause a form of AIDS. He\u2019s downplayed deaths related to one of the largest measles outbreaks in the U.S. in years.",
      "Other appointees include Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm. Dr. Cody Meissner, a former ACIP member, also was named.",
      "Abram Wagner of the University of Michigan\u2019s school of public health, who investigates vaccination programs, said he\u2019s not satisfied with the composition of the committee.",
      "\u201cThe previous ACIP was made up of technical experts who have spent their lives studying vaccines,\u201d he said. Most people on the current list \u201cdon\u2019t have the technical capacity that we would expect out of people who would have to make really complicated decisions involving interpreting complicated scientific data.\u201d",
      "He said having Pebsworth on the board is \u201cincredibly problematic\u201d since she is involved in an organization that \u201cdistributes a lot of misinformation.\u201d",
      "Kennedy made the announcement in a social media post on Wednesday.",
      "The committee, created in 1964, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC directors almost always approve those recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The CDC\u2019s final recommendations are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "The other appointees are:",
      "\u2014Dr. James Hibbeln, who formerly headed a National Institutes of Health group focused on nutritional neurosciences and who studies how nutrition affects the brain, including the potential benefits of seafood consumption during pregnancy.",
      "\u2014Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies business issues related to supply chain, logistics, pricing optimization and health and health care management. In a 2023 video pinned to an X profile under his name, Levi called for the end of the COVID-19 vaccination program, claiming the vaccines were ineffective and dangerous despite evidence they saved millions of lives.",
      "\u2014Dr. James Pagano, an emergency medicine physician from Los Angeles.",
      "\u2014Dr. Michael Ross, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist.",
      "Of the eight named by Kennedy, perhaps the most experienced in vaccine policy is Meissner, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, who has previously served as a member of both ACIP and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory panel.",
      "During his five-year term as an FDA adviser, the committee was repeatedly asked to review and vote on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that were rapidly developed to fight the pandemic. In September 2021, he joined the majority of panelists who voted against a plan from the Biden administration to offer an extra vaccine dose to all American adults. The panel instead recommended that the extra shot should be limited to seniors and those at higher risk of the disease.",
      "Ultimately, the FDA disregarded the panel\u2019s recommendation and OK\u2019d an extra vaccine dose for all adults.",
      "In addition to serving on government panels, Meissner has helped author policy statements and vaccination schedules for the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "ACIP members typically serve in staggered four-year terms, although several appointments were delayed during the Biden administration before positions were filled last year. The voting members all have scientific or clinical expertise in immunization, except for one \u201cconsumer representative\u201d who can bring perspective on community and social facets of vaccine programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. government\u2019s top health official, has accused the committee of being too closely aligned with vaccine manufacturers and of rubber-stamping vaccines. ACIP policies require members to state past collaborations with vaccine companies and to recuse themselves from votes in which they had a conflict of interest, but Kennedy has dismissed those safeguards as weak.",
      "Most of the people who best understand vaccines are those who have researched them, which usually requires some degree of collaboration with the companies that develop and sell them, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher.",
      "\u201cIf you are to exclude any reputable, respected vaccine expert who has ever engaged even in a limited way with the vaccine industry, you\u2019re likely to have a very small pool of folks to draw from,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "The U.S. Senate confirmed Kennedy in February after he promised he would not change the vaccination schedule. But less than a week later, he vowed to investigate childhood vaccines that prevent measles, polio and other dangerous diseases.",
      "Kennedy has ignored some of the recommendations ACIP voted for in April, including the endorsement of a new combination shot that protects against five strains of meningococcal bacteria and the expansion of vaccinations against RSV.",
      "In late May, Kennedy disregarded the committee and announced the government would change the recommendation for children and pregnant women to get COVID-19 shots.",
      "On Monday, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the ACIP, saying he would appoint a new group before the next scheduled meeting in late June. The agenda for that meeting has not yet been posted, but a recent federal notice said votes are expected on vaccinations against flu, COVID-19, HPV, RSV and meningococcal bacteria.",

      "The nation\u2019s first experiment with food stamps began in 1939. But the modern version of the program dates to 1979, when a change in federal law took effect eliminating a requirement that participants purchase food stamps. There currently is no cost to people participating in the program.",
      "A little over 42 million people nationwide received SNAP benefits in February, the latest month for which figures are available. That's roughly one out of every eight people in the county. Participation is down from a peak average of 47.6 million people during the 2013 federal fiscal year.",
      "Often, more than one person in a household is eligible for food aid. As of February, nearly 22.5 million households were enrolled SNAP, receiving an average monthly household benefit of $353.",
      "Legislation passed by the House is projected to cut about $295 billion of federal spending from SNAP over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "A little more than half of those federal savings would come by shifting costs to states, which administer SNAP. Nearly one-third of those savings would come by expanding a work requirement for some SNAP participants, which the CBO assumes would force some people off the rolls. Additional money would be saved by eliminating SNAP benefits for between 120,000 and 250,000 immigrants legally in the U.S. who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents.",
      "Another provision in the legislation would cap the annual inflationary growth in food benefits. As a result, the CBO estimates that the average monthly food benefit would be about $15 lower than it otherwise would have been by 2034.",
      "To receive SNAP benefits, current law says adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents would need to work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don't do so are limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation that passed the House would expand work requirements to those ages 55 through 64. It also would extend work requirements to some parents without children younger than age 7. And it would limit the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas that lack sufficient jobs.",
      "The combined effect of those changes is projected by the CBO to reduce SNAP participation by a monthly average of 3.2 million people.",
      "The federal government currently splits the administrative costs of SNAP with states but covers the full cost of food benefits. Under the legislation, states would have to cover three-fourths of the administrative costs. States also would have to pay a portion of the food benefits starting with the 2028 fiscal year.",
      "All states would be required to pay at least 5% of the food aid benefits, and could pay more depending on how often they make mistakes with people\u2019s payments.",
      "States that had payment error rates between 6-8% in the most recent federal fiscal year for which data is available would have to cover 15% of the food costs. States with error rates between 8-10% would have to cover 20% of the food benefits, and those with error rates greater than 10% would have to cover 25% of the food costs.",
      "Many states could get hit with higher costs. The national error rate stood at 11.7% in the 2023 fiscal year, and just three states \u2014 Idaho, South Dakota and Vermont \u2014 had error rates below 5%. But the 2023 figures are unlikely to serve as the base year, so the exact costs to states remains unclear.",
      "As a result of the cost shift, the CBO assumes that some states would reduce or eliminate benefits for people.",
      "House Resolution 1, containing the SNAP changes and tax cuts, passed the House last month by a margin of just one vote \u2014 215-214.",
      "A vote also could be close in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of the 100 seats. Democrats did not support the bill in the House and are unlikely to do so in the Senate. Some Republican senators have expressed reservations about proposed cuts to food aid and Medicaid and the potential impact of the bill on the federal deficit. GOP Senate leaders may have to make some changes to the bill to ensure enough support to pass it.",

      "A top aide to Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Calley Means has built a following within the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement by railing against the failings of the U.S. health system, often pinning the blame on one issue: corruption.",
      "Means, a top aide to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was hired as a White House adviser in March. He has used that perch to attack the nation\u2019s leading physician groups, federal agencies and government scientists, claiming they only protect their own interests in the nation\u2019s $4.9 trillion-a-year industry.",
      "In recent interviews, speeches and podcasts he has called the American Medical Association \u201ca pharma lobbying group,\u201d labeled the Food and Drug Administration \u201ca sock puppet of industry,\" and said federal health scientists have \u201coverseen a record of utter failure.\u201d",
      "Means, however, has his own financial stake in the sprawling health system. He\u2019s the co-founder of an online platform, Truemed, that offers dietary supplements, herbal remedies and other wellness products. Some of the vendors featured on Truemed\u2019s website are supporters of Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement, which downplays the benefits of prescription drugs, vaccines and other rigorously tested medical products.",
      "Kennedy has pledged to run the Department of Health and Human Services with \u201cradical transparency,\u201d but Means has never had to publicly disclose his own financial details or where exactly they intersect with the policies he's advancing.",
      "\u201cIt reeks of hypocrisy,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, a health researcher at Yale University. \u201cIn effect, he is representing another industry that is touting nonregulated products and using his platform within the government to financially benefit himself.\u201d",
      "In a written statement, Means said his government work has not dealt with matters affecting Truemed and has focused on issues like reforming nutrition programs and pressuring companies to phase out food dyes.",
      "\u201cPursuing these large-scale MAHA goals to make America healthy has been the sole focus in my government work,\u201d Means said.",
      "Truemed helps users take tax-free money out of their health savings accounts, or HSAs, to spend on things that wouldn\u2019t normally qualify as medical expenses, such as exercise equipment, meal delivery services and homeopathic remedies \u2014 mixtures of plants and minerals based on a centuries-old theory of medicine that's not supported by modern science.",
      "The business model caught the attention of the IRS last year, which issued an alert: \u201cBeware of companies misrepresenting nutrition, wellness and general health expenses as medical care.\u201d",
      "Truemed co-founder and CEO, Justin Mares, said in a statement the company is \u201cin full alignment\u201d with IRS guidelines.",
      "\u201cTruemed enables patients to work with providers to use medical funds for root cause interventions like exercise and vitamin D to reverse disease under current law,\u201d Mares said.",
      "The full extent of Means\u2019 potential conflicts \u2014 including his personal investments\u2014 are unclear because of his status as a special government employee.",
      "Unlike presidential appointees and other senior officials, special government employees are temporary staffers who do not have to leave companies or sell investments that could be impacted by their work. Also, their financial disclosure forms are shielded from public release.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d says Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush now at the University of Minnesota. Painter and other experts have raised alarms over a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails.",
      "Still, part-time government employees are subject to the same law that bars all federal staffers from working on issues that could directly benefit their finances. When such cases arise, they must recuse themselves or risk criminal penalties.",
      "Means regularly opines on matters before HHS, including rethinking the use of drugs for depression, weight loss, diabetes and other conditions. Recently he's been promoting a new government report that calls for scaling back prescription medications in favor of exercise, dietary changes and other alternatives.",
      "\u201cIf we rely less on our medical system, less on drugs, it necessitates the spiritual, cultural conversation about what we\u2019re doing to our children\u2019s bodies,\u201d Means said in a recent podcast appearance.",
      "Experts note that government ethics rules are intended to both prevent financial conflict violations, but also the appearance of such conflicts that might undermine public trust in government.",
      "\u201cIf I were running the ethics office over at HHS, I sure as heck wouldn\u2019t want anybody going around giving interviews and speeches about government matters that could have an effect on their own financial interests,\u201d Painter said.",
      "Means\u2019 rapid rise reflects the seeming contradictions within the MAHA movement itself, which urges followers to distrust both big corporations and the government agencies which regulate them.",
      "Means rails against big pharma and food conglomerates, two industries that he says he spent years working for as a consultant in Washington.",
      "Means has no medical training. A graduate of Harvard Business School, he previously ran a bridal gown startup with his wife. On Wednesday, he's scheduled to be the keynote speaker at FDA's annual science forum, according to a copy of the program shared with The Associated Press.",
      "He traces his passion for health care reform to the death of his mother from pancreatic cancer in 2021. Shortly thereafter, Means and his sister, Dr. Casey Means, took psychedelics together and had \u201ca mind-blowing, life-changing experience,\u201d which led them to co-author a wellness book, launch separate health startups and begin appearing on podcasts.",
      "Casey Means was recently nominated to be surgeon general and has faced scrutiny over her qualifications, including an unfinished medical residency.",
      "Asked about her nomination, President Donald Trump said: \u201cBobby thought she was fantastic,\u201d adding that he did not know her.",
      "Meanwhile, her brother has stepped up his rhetoric for the MAHA agenda, recently declaring that Kennedy has \u201ca spiritual mandate to reform our broken system.\"",
      "While promoting the administration\u2019s accomplishments, Means does not shy away from plugging his own brand or those of his business partners.",
      "When asked to offer health advice to listeners of a sports podcast, Outkick The Show, in April, Means said: \u201cRead our book, \u2018Good Energy.\u2019\u201d",
      "He also recommended blood tests sold by Function Health, which provides subscription-based testing for $500 annually. The company was cofounded by Dr. Mark Hyman, a friend of Kennedy and an investor in Truemed, which also offers Hyman's supplements through its platform. Casey Means is also an investor in Hyman's company.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re sick, most likely you have some kind of nutrient deficiency, some kind of biomarker that you can actually then target with your diet and your supplements,\u201d Calley Means said.",
      "Like dietary supplements, the marketing claims on laboratory tests sold by Hyman are not approved by the FDA. The agency has warned for years about the accuracy of such tests and tried to start regulating them under President Joe Biden.",
      "Experts say MAHA entrepreneurs like Hyman are following a playbook common to the wellness industry: Identify a health concern, market a test to diagnose it and then sell supplements or other remedies to treat it.",
      "\u201cIt ends up favoring these products and services that rest on flimsy grounds, at the expense of products that have actually survived a rigorous FDA approval process,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, a former FDA official who is now president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "Many of the items sold via Truemed, including sweat tents, cold plunge tanks and light therapy lamps, wouldn\u2019t typically qualify as medical expenses under rules for HSAs, tax-free accounts created by Congress to manage medical costs.",
      "The IRS generally states that HSA purchases must help diagnose, cure, treat, mitigate or prevent disease.",
      "Truemed allows users to request a \u201cletter of medical necessity\u201d from a doctor, stating that the product in question could have medical value for them. Like other telehealth services, there\u2019s usually no real-time communication with the patient. The physician reviews a \u201csimple survey solution,\u201d filled out by the Truemed user, according to the company\u2019s website.",
      "Industry representatives say customers should be careful.",
      "\u201cYou need to be prepared to defend your spending habits under audit,\u201d said Kevin McKechnie, head of the American Bankers Association\u2019s HSA council. \u201cCompanies are popping up suggesting they can help you manage that process and maybe they can \u2014 so the debate continues.\u201d",
      "Americans have an estimated $147 billion in HSA accounts, a potential windfall for companies like Truemed that collects fees for transactions made using their platforms.",
      "Means sees an even bigger opportunity \u2014 routing federal funds out of government programs and into more HSAs.",
      "\u201cThe point of our company is to steer medical dollars into flexible spending,\u201d Means told fitness celebrity Jillian Michaels, on her podcast last year. \u201cI want to get that $4.5 trillion of Medicare, Medicaid, everything into a flexible account.\u201d",
      "Means\u2019 pitch for expanding HSAs echoes two decades of Republican talking points on the accounts, which were created in 2003 to encourage Americans in high-deductible plans to be judicious with their health dollars.",
      "But HSAs have not brought down spending, economists say. They are disproportionately used by the wealthiest Americans, who have more income to fund them and a bigger incentive to lower their tax rate.",
      "Americans who earn more than $1 million annually are the group most likely to make regular HSA contributions, according to an analysis by the nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than half Americans with HSAs have balances less than $500.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d would further expand HSA purchases, making gym memberships and other fitness expenses eligible for tax-free spending. That provision alone is expected to cost the government $10 billion in revenue.",
      "\u201cThese are really just tax breaks in the guise of health policy that overwhelmingly benefit people with high incomes,\u201d said Gideon Lukens, a former White House budget official during the Obama and Trump administrations, now with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Expanding HSA eligibility was listed as a goal for a coalition of MAHA entrepreneurs and Truemed partners, founded by Means, which lobbied Congress last year, according to the group's website.",
      "Means said in a statement that the group focused only on broad topics like \u201chealth care incentives and patient choice \u2014 but did not lobby for specific bills.\u201d",
      "In total, the HSA expansions in Trump's bill are projected to cost the federal government $180 billion over the next 10 years. As HSAs expand to include more disparate products and services, Lukens says the U.S. government will have fewer dollars to expand medical coverage through programs like Medicaid.",
      "\u201cWe have a limited amount of federal resources and the question is whether we want to spend that on health and wellness products that may or may not be helpful for wealthy people,\u201d Lukens said.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s National Institutes of Health director says some employees\u2019 critical letter to him has \u201cfundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- In his confirmation hearings to lead the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya pledged his openness to views that might conflict with his own. \u201cDissent,\" he said, \u201dis the very essence of science.\u201d",
      "That commitment is being put to the test.",
      "On Monday, scores of scientists at the agency sent their Trump-appointed leader a letter titled the Bethesda Declaration, challenging \u201cpolicies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.\u201d",
      "It says: \"We dissent.\"",
      "In a capital where insiders often insist on anonymity to say such things publicly, 92 NIH researchers, program directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on the letter \u2014 and their careers on the line. An additional 250 of their colleagues across the agency endorsed the declaration without using their names.",
      "The four-page letter, addressed to Bhattacharya, also was sent to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and members of Congress who oversee the NIH. White House spokesman Kush Desai defended the administration's approach to federal research and said President Donald Trump is focused on restoring a \u201cGold Standard\u201d of science, not \u201cideological activism.\u201d",
      "The signers went public in the face of a \u201cculture of fear and suppression\u201d they say Trump's administration has spread through the federal civil service. \u201cWe are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Bhattacharya responded to the declaration by saying it \u201chas some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months.\"",
      "\u201cNevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive,\u201d he said in a statement. \"We all want the NIH to succeed.\u201d",
      "Named for the agency's headquarters location in Maryland, the Bethesda Declaration details upheaval in the world\u2019s premier public health research institution over the course of mere months.",
      "It addresses the termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12 billion and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants.",
      "In one case, an NIH-supported study of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti had to be stopped, ceasing antibiotic treatment mid-course for patients.",
      "In a number of cases, trials that were mostly completed were rendered useless without the money to finish and analyze the work, the letter says. \u201cEnding a $5 million research study when it is 80% complete does not save $1 million,\u201d it says, \u201cit wastes $4 million.\u201d",
      "Jenna Norton, who oversees health disparity research at the agency's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, recently appeared at a forum by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., to talk about what's happening at the NIH.",
      "At the event, she masked to conceal her identity. Now the mask is off. She was a lead organizer of the declaration.",
      "\u201cI want people to know how bad things are at NIH,\" Norton told The Associated Press.",
      "The signers said they modeled their indictment after Bhattacharya\u2019s Great Barrington Declaration in 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.",
      "His declaration drew together likeminded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive COVID-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracized by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH.",
      "\u201cHe is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,\" said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration.",
      "As chief of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch, Kobrin provides scientific oversight of researchers across the country who've been funded by the cancer institute or want to be. Cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimizing its destruction. \"So much of it is gone \u2014 my work,\u201d she said.",
      "The 21-year NIH veteran said she signed because she didn't want to be \"a collaborator\u201d in the political manipulation of biomedical science.",
      "Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, also signed the declaration. \u201cWe have a saying in basic science,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go and become a physician if you want to treat thousands of patients. You go and become a researcher if you want to save billions of patients.",
      "\u201cWe are doing the research that is going to go and create the cures of the future,\u201d he added. But that won\u2019t happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing grant cuts.",
      "The NIH employees interviewed by the AP emphasized they were speaking for themselves and not for their institutes nor the NIH.",
      "Employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants.",
      "The letter asserts \u201cNIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety\u201d and the agency is shirking commitments to trial participants who \u201cbraved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has gone at public health research on several fronts, both directly, as part of its broad effort to root out diversity, equity and inclusion values throughout the bureaucracy, and as part of its drive to starve some universities of federal money.",
      "At the White House, Desai said Americans \u201chave lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",
      "This has forced \u201cindiscriminate grant terminations, payment freezes for ongoing research, and blanket holds on awards regardless of the quality, progress, or impact of the science,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Some NIH employees have previously come forward in televised protests to air grievances, and many walked out of Bhattacharya's town hall with staff. The declaration is the first cohesive effort to register agency-wide dismay with the NIH's direction.",
      "The dissenters remind Bhattacharya in their letter of his oft-stated ethic that academic freedom must be a lynchpin in science.",
      "With that in place, he said in a statement in April, \u201cNIH scientists can be certain they are afforded the ability to engage in open, academic discourse as part of their official duties and in their personal capacities without risk of official interference, professional disadvantage or workplace retaliation.\"",
      "Now it will be seen whether that's enough to protect those NIH employees challenging the Trump administration and him.",
      "\u201cThere's a book I read to my kids, and it talks about how you can't be brave if you're not scared,\u201d said Norton, who has three young children. \"I am so scared about doing this, but I am trying to be brave for my kids because it's only going to get harder to speak up.",
      "\u201cMaybe I'm putting my kids at risk by doing this,\" she added. \"And I'm doing it anyway because I couldn't live with myself otherwise.\u201d",
      "e and noy on",
      "\u201cIn recent years, Americans have lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago,\u201d spokesman Kush Desai said. \u201cThe Trump administration is focused on restoring the Gold Standard of Science \u2014 not ideological activism \u2014 as the guiding principle of HHS, the NIH, and the CDC to finally address our chronic disease epidemic.\u201d",

      "The August Egg Company recalled about 1.7 million brown organic and brown cage-free egg varieties distributed to grocery stores between February and May because of the potential for salmonella, according to a posted announcement Friday on the Food and Drug Administration's website.",
      "At least 79 people in seven states have gotten a strain of salmonella that was linked to the eggs, and 21 people have been hospitalized. the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.",
      "The recall covers Arizona, California, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, Washington and Wyoming. A list of brands and plant codes or Julian dates can be found on the FDA and CDC websites.",
      "Symptoms of salmonella poisoning include diarrhea, fever, severe vomiting, dehydration and stomach cramps. Most people who get sick recover within a week.",
      "Infections can be severe in young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems, who may require hospitalization.",
      "The CDC advises people to throw away recalled eggs or return them to the store where they were purchased. Consumers should also wash and disinfect any surfaces that came in contact with the eggs.",

      "The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency is taking aim at dozens of rules aimed at protecting the environment, including one that requires big polluters to report greenhouse gas emissions",
      "LEOPOLD, Ind. -- On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman\u2019s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.",
      "Outside, the real sky isn\u2019t always blue. Sometimes it\u2019s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that\u2019s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.",
      "\u201cIndustry and government is very, very, very powerful. It\u2019s more powerful than me. I\u2019m just an English teacher,\u201d Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.",
      "In a way, Brockman\u2019s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.",
      "That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump\u2019s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.",
      "But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data \u2014 at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere \u2014 would make it tougher to fight climate change.",
      "At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.",
      "And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.",
      "The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.",
      "\"We can\u2019t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that\u2019s changing over time,\" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.",
      "Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.",
      "But the registry \u201cdoes put pressure on companies to ... document what they\u2019ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.",
      "Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.",
      "\"It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.\u201d",
      "The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these \u201cmonitoring deserts,\u201d said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.",
      "\"The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can\u2019t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.",
      "The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.",
      "CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It\u2019s human rights,\u201d said Daisha Wall, the group's community science program manager. \u201cWe all deserve a right to clean air.\u201d",
      "Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what\u2019s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.",
      "Indiana says it \u201cmaintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,\u201d but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren't satisfied. She and other members of local advocacy groups Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life and Valley Watch install and maintain their own air and water quality monitors. It\u2019s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.",
      "Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven\u2019t eaten breakfast.",
      "\u201cBut you also don\u2019t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,\u201d she said.",

      "Officials say the former student who killed nine students and a teacher at a school in Austria and then took his own life planned the attack in detail",
      "GRAZ, Austria -- The former student who killed nine students and a teacher at a school in Austria and then took his own life planned the attack in detail, but he appears to have shot his victims at random and investigators still haven't been able to ascertain his motive, officials said Thursday.",
      "The 21-year-old had left the BORG Dreiersch\u00fctzengasse high school in Graz three years ago, breaking off his studies after attending for three years, police said. They said they knew of no personal connection between the gunman and the students he shot, but that one of the two teachers he shot had once taught him. They were still investigating whether that was a factor.",
      "The attack prompted Austria to declare three days of national mourning, and large numbers of candles have been laid in Graz's main square and outside the school.",
      "The assailant, an Austrian who lived with his mother near Graz and whom officials have declined to identify, used a Mercury double-barreled shotgun and a Glock 19 handgun in the shooting. Michael Lohnegger, the head of Styria province's criminal police office, said that he arrived at the school Tuesday morning with a backpack containing the weapons, and put on equipment including shooting glasses and a headset in a bathroom before starting a roughly seven-minute shooting spree.",
      "He opened fire indiscriminately on the building's third floor before shooting open the locked door of a fourth-floor classroom and again firing indiscriminately, Lohnegger told a news conference. Lohnegger said that he had enough ammunition to continue shooting and it was unclear why he hadn't; the assailant then returned to the bathroom and shot himself fatally in the head.",
      "A search of his home uncovered a farewell letter and video, which Lohnegger said added up to \u201can apology directed to his family for the crime and a general thank-you,\u201d but offered no \u201cindication for a motive.\u201d",
      "They also found a handwritten note that showed he had planned the attack \u201cdown to the smallest detail\" \u2014 setting out how he would proceed, but giving no date for the crime. It suggested that he had lacked enough time to build a fully functional pipe bomb, and investigators found one that wouldn't have worked.",
      "Lohnegger said a picture had emerged of \u201ca very introverted person\u201d who largely didn't take part in real-world activities, and that his great passion was taking part in online first-person shooter games.",
      "\u201cBut even here, there is no information from his personal surroundings that he ever expressed any anger or resentment toward the school, students or teachers,\u201d he added. The man had no previous police record and \u201cthere were definitely no particular problems with him at this school.\u201d",
      "The shooter was in unspecified vocational training at the time of the attack, investigators said.",
      "He had bought the shotgun legally in Graz in early April, and the handgun from another shop in the city in late May. He had a license to own weapons that required a report from a psychological expert, which apparently was produced in March.",
      "Starting in March, he took part in shooting practice five times at a shooting club in Graz, using a hired firearm, Lohnegger said.",
      "The slain students were six girls and three boys aged between 14 and 17. Eleven people were wounded in the attack, and authorities said on Wednesday that their lives weren't in danger.",

      "A group of migrants was rescued by the humanitarian organization Sea Watch and were taken to Italy.",

      "The coast guard launched an aerial firefighting operation Thursday morning using a helicopter from the Indian air force, Commandant Amit Uniyal, a spokesperson for the coast guard, said. The helicopter dispersed 1,000 kilograms of dry chemical powder onto the core fire areas of the ship, he added.",

      "The Rapid Support Forces said in a statement Wednesday that they captured the triangular zone, fortifying their presence along Sudan\u2019 s already volatile border with chaos-stricken Libya.",
      "The RSF\u2019s announcement came hours after the military said it had evacuated the area as part of \u201cits defensive arrangements to repel aggression\u201d by the paramilitaries.",
      "On Tuesday the military accused the forces of powerful Libyan commander Khalifa Hifter of supporting the RSF\u2019s attack on the area, in a \u201cblatant aggression against Sudan, its land, and its people.\u201d",
      "Hifter\u2019s forces, which control eastern and southern Libya, rejected the claim, saying in a statement that the Sudanese accusations were \u201ca blatant attempt to export the Sudanese internal crisis and create a virtual external enemy.\u201d",
      "The attack on the border area was the latest twist in Sudan\u2019s civil war which erupted in April 2023 when tensions between the Sudanese army and RSF exploded with street battles in the capital, Khartoum that quickly spread across the country.",
      "The war has killed at least 24,000 people, though the number is likely far higher. It has driven about 13 million people from their homes, including 4 million who crossed into neighboring countries. It created the world's worst humanitarian crisis, and parts of the country have been pushed into famine.",
      "The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in Darfur, according to the U.N. and international rights groups.",

      "According to the Ukrainian air force, Russia launched a barrage of 63 drones and decoys at Ukraine overnight. It said that air defenses destroyed 28 drones while another 21 were jammed.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s police said two people were killed and six were injured over the past 24 hours in the eastern Donetsk region, the focus of the Russian offensive. One person was killed and 14 others were also injured in the southern Kherson region, which is partly occupied by Russian forces, police said.",
      "The head of the Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, said that 15 people, including four children, were injured by Russian drone attacks overnight.",

      "While Russian missile and drone barrage have struck regions all across Ukraine, regions along the front line have faced daily Russian attacks with short-range exploding drones and glide bombs.",
      "Ukraine hit back with drone raids. Russia's Defense Ministry said that air defenses downed 52 Ukrainian drones early Thursday, including 41 over the Belgorod region that borders Ukraine. Regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said three people were injured by Ukrainian attacks Thursday.",

      "BANGKOK -- Australia's defense minister dismissed concerns Thursday that a deal between the U.S., Australia and Britain to provide his country with nuclear-powered submarines could be in jeopardy, following a report that the Pentagon had ordered a review.",
      "Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles told Sky News Australia that he had known about the review of the deal \u201cfor some time,\" saying that it was a \u201cvery natural step for the incoming administration to take.\u201d",
      "He noted that the UK's government also reviewed the deal, the centerpiece of a three-way alliance known as AUKUS after it was elected, and that his own government had looked at it as part of its own review of Australia's entire defense posture.",
      "\"I think an incoming government having a look at this is something that they have a perfect right to do and we welcome it and we\u2019ll work with it,\u201d he said.",
      "The deal, worth more than $200 billion, was signed between the three countries in 2021 under then President Joe Biden, designed to provide Australia, one of Washington's staunchest allies in the region, with greater maritime capabilities to counter China's increasingly strong navy.",
      "The deal also involves the U.S. selling several of its Virginia-class submarines to Australia to bridge the gap as the new submarines are being jointly built.",
      "In January, Australia made the first of six $500 million payments to the U.S. under the AUKUS deal, meant to bolster American submarine manufacturing.",
      "Marles met with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on the sidelines of a defense conference in Singapore less than two weeks ago, and told reporters afterward that he had come away with \u201ca sense of confidence about the way in which AUKUS is proceeding.\u201d",
      "\u201cAUKUS is on track and we are meeting all the timelines that are associated with it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very optimistic.\u201d",

      "Hegseth did urge allies in the Indo-Pacific to increase their defense spending, and underscored the need for a \u201cstrong, resolute and capable network of allies and partners\u201d as the U.S. seeks to counter China.",

      "TORKHAM, Afghanistan -- The order was clear and indisputable, the timeline startling. You have 45 minutes to pack up and leave Pakistan forever.",
      "Sher Khan, a 42-year-old Afghan, had returned home from his job in a brick factory. He stared at the plainclothes policeman on the doorstep, his mind reeling. How could he pack up his whole life and leave the country of his birth in under an hour?",
      "In the blink of an eye, the life he had built was taken away from him. He and his wife grabbed a few kitchen items and whatever clothes they could for themselves and their nine children. They left everything else behind at their home in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.",
      "Born in Pakistan to parents who fled the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the ensuing war, Khan is one of hundreds of thousands of Afghans who have now been expelled.",
      "The nationwide crackdown, launched in October 2023, on foreigners Pakistan says are living in the country illegally has led to the departures of almost 1 million Afghans already.",
      "Pakistan says millions more remain. It wants them gone.",
      "\u201cAll our belongings were left behind,\u201d Khan said as he stood in a dusty, windswept refugee camp just across the Afghan border in Torkham, the first stop for expelled refugees. \u201cWe tried so hard (over the years) to collect the things that we had with honor.\u201d",
      "Pakistan set several deadlines earlier this year for Afghans to leave or face deportation. Afghan Citizen Card holders had to leave the capital Islamabad and Rawalpindi city by March 31, while those with Proof of Registration could stay until June 30. No specific deadlines were set for Afghans living elsewhere in Pakistan.",
      "Khan feared that delaying his departure beyond the deadline might have resulted in his wife and children being hauled off to a police station along with him a blow to his family\u2019s dignity.",
      "\u201cWe are happy that we came (to Afghanistan) with modesty and honor,\u201d he said. As for his lost belongings, \u201cGod may provide for them here, as He did there.\u201d",
      "At the Torkham camp, run by Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban government, each family receives a SIM card and 10,000 Afghanis ($145) in aid. They can spend up to three days there before having to move on.",
      "The camp\u2019s director, Molvi Hashim Maiwandwal, said some 150 families were arriving daily from Pakistan \u2014 far fewer than the roughly 1,200 families who were arriving about two months ago. But he said another surge was expected after the three-day Islamic holiday of Eid Al-Adha that started June 7.",
      "Aid organizations inside the camp help with basic needs, including healthcare. Local charity Aseel provides hygiene kits and helps with food. It has also set up a food package delivery system for families once they arrive at their final destination elsewhere in Afghanistan.",
      "Aseel\u2019s Najibullah Ghiasi said they expected a surge in arrivals \u201cby a significant number\u201d after Eid. \u201cWe cannot handle all of them, because the number is so huge,\u201d he said, adding the organization was trying to boost fundraising so it could support more people.",
      "Pakistan accuses Afghans of staging militant attacks inside the country, saying assaults are planned from across the border \u2014 a charge Kabul\u2019s Taliban government denies.",
      "Pakistan denies targeting Afghans, and maintains that everyone leaving the country is treated humanely and with dignity. But for many, there is little that is humane about being forced to pack up and leave in minutes or hours.",
      "Iran, too, has been expelling Afghans, with the UNHCR, the UN\u2019s refugee agency, saying on June 5 that 500,000 Afghans had been forced to leave Iran and Pakistan in the two months since April 1.",
      "Rights groups and aid agencies say authorities are pressuring Afghans into going sooner.",
      "In April, Human Rights Watch said police had raided houses, beaten and arbitrarily detained people, and confiscated refugee documents, including residence permits. Officers demanded bribes to allow Afghans to remain in Pakistan, the group added.",
      "Fifty-year-old Yar Mohammad lived in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir for nearly 45 years. The father of 12 built a successful business polishing floors, hiring several workers. Plainclothes policemen knocked on his door too. They gave him six hours to leave.",
      "\u201cNo way a person can wrap up so much business in six hours, especially if they spent 45 years in one place,\u201d he said. Friends rushed to his aid to help pack up anything they could: the company\u2019s floor-polishing machines, some tables, bed-frames and mattresses, and clothes.",
      "Now all his household belongings are crammed into orange tents in the Torkham refugee camp, his hard-earned floor-polishing machines outside and exposed to the elements. After three days of searching, he managed to find a place to rent in Kabul.",
      "\u201cI have no idea what we will do,\u201d he said, adding that he would try to recreate his floor-polishing business in Afghanistan. \u201cIf this works here, it is the best thing to do.\u201d",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to silence anyone who voices an opinion \u2014 professionals, ideologues, anyone who is critical \u2014 now they\u2019re jailed.\u201d Quintanilla said. \u201cIt\u2019s a vendetta.\u201d",
      "Bukele\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Observers see a worrisome escalation by the popular president, who enjoys extremely high approval ratings due to his crackdown on the country's gangs. By suspending fundamental rights, Bukele has severely weakened gangs but also locked up 87,000 people for alleged gang ties, often with little evidence or due process. A number of those detained were also critics.",
      "Bukele and his New Ideas party have taken control of all three branches of government, stacking the country's Supreme Court with loyalists. Last year, in a move considered unconstitutional, he ran for reelection, securing a resounding victory.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t care if you call me a dictator,\" Bukele said earlier this month in a speech. \"Better that than seeing Salvadorans killed on the streets.\u201d",
      "In recent weeks, those who have long acted as a thorn in Bukele\u2019s side say looming threats have reached an inflection point. The crackdown comes as Bukele has garnered global attention for keeping some 200 Venezuelan deportees detained in a mega-prison built for gangs as part of an agreement with the Trump administration.",
      "Anaya was detained by authorities on unproven accusations of money laundering. Prosecutors said he would be sent to \u201crelevant courts\" in the coming days. Quintanilla, his lawyer, rejects the allegations, saying his arrest stems from years of vocally questioning Bukele.",
      "Quintanilla, a longtime colleague of Anaya, said he decided to represent his friend in part because many other lawyers in the country were now too afraid to show their faces. On Tuesday, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d over Anaya\u2019s arrest.",
      "Anaya, 61, is a respected lawyer and commentator in El Salvador with a doctorate in constitutional law. He has criticized Bukele's crackdown on the gangs and Bukele stacking of El Salvador's high court. Last year, he was among those who unsuccessfully petitioned the country\u2019s top electoral authority to reject Bukele\u2019s re-election bid, saying it violated the constitution.",
      "Days before his arrest, Anaya railed on television against the detention of human rights lawyer Ruth L\u00f3pez, who last week shouted, \u201cThey\u2019re not going to silence me, I want a public trial,\u201d as police escorted her shackled to court.",
      "\u201cOf course I\u2019m scared,\u201d Anaya told the broadcast anchor. \u201cI think that anyone here who dares to speak out, speaks in fear.\u201d",
      "While some of Bukele\u2019s most vocal critics, like Anaya and L\u00f3pez, have been publicly detained, other human rights defenders have quietly slipped out of the country, hoping to seek asylum elsewhere in the region. They declined to comment or be identified out of fear that they would be targeted even outside El Salvador.",
      "Last month, a protest outside of Bukele\u2019s house was violently quashed by police and some of the protesters arrested. He also ordered the arrest of the heads of local bus companies for defying his order to offer free transport while a major highway was blocked.",
      "In late May, El Salvador\u2019s Congress passed a \u201cforeign agents\u201d law, championed by the populist president. It resembles legislation implemented by governments in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Russia, Belarus and China to silence and criminalize dissent by exerting pressure on organizations that rely on overseas funding.",
      "Ver\u00f3nica Reyna, a human rights coordinator for the Salvadoran nonprofit Servicio Social Pasionista, said police cars now regularly wait outside her group\u2019s offices as a lingering threat.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been little-by-little,\u201d Reyna said. \u201cSince Trump came to power, we\u2019ve seen (Bukele) feel like there\u2019s no government that\u2019s going to strongly criticize him or try to stop him.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s influence extends beyond his vocal backing of Bukele, with his administration pushing legal boundaries to push his agenda, Reyna, other human rights defenders and journalists said.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in El Salvador, which once regularly denounced the government's actions, has remained silent throughout the arrests and lingering threats. It did not respond to a request for comment. In its final year, the Biden administration, too, dialed back its criticism of the Bukele government as El Salvador's government helped slow migration north in the lead up to the 2024 election.",
      "On Tuesday, Quintanilla visited Anaya in detention for the first time since his arrest while being watched by police officers.",
      "Despite the detention, neither Anaya nor Quintanilla have been officially informed of the charges. Quintanilla worries that authorities will use wide ranging powers granted to Bukele by the \u201cstate of emergency\u201d to keep him imprisoned indefinitely.",
      "\u00d3scar Mart\u00ednez, editor-in-chief of news site El Faro, and four other journalists have left the country and are unable to return safely, as they face the prospect of arrest stemming from their reporting.",
      "At a time when many other reporters have fallen silent out of fear, Mart\u00ednez's news site has investigated Bukele more rigorously than perhaps any other, exposing hidden corruption and human rights abuses under his crackdown on gangs.",
      "In May, El Faro published a three-part interview with a former gang leader who claimed he negotiated with Bukele's administration. Soon after, Mart\u00ednez said the organization received news that authorities were preparing an arrest order for a half-dozen of their journalists. This has kept at least five El Faro journalists, including Mart\u00ednez, stranded outside their country for over a month.",
      "On Saturday, when the reporters tried to return home on a flight, a diplomatic source and a government official informed them that police had been sent to the airport to wait for them and likely arrest them.",
      "The journalists later discovered that their names, along with other civil society leaders, appeared on a list of \u201cpriority objectives\" held by airport authorities. Mart\u00ednez said Anaya's name was also on the list.",
      "Now in a nearby Central American nation, Mart\u00ednez said he doesn't know when he will be able to board another flight home. And if he does, he doesn't know what will happen when he steps off.",
      "\u201cWe fear that, if we return \u2014 because some of us surely will try \u2014 we'll be imprisoned,\u201d he said. \u201cI am positive that if El Faro journalists are thrown in prison, we'll be tortured and, possibly, even killed.\"",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Wednesday bypassed legislative opposition and signed a decree summoning voters to the polls in August to decide changes to the country\u2019s labor laws, including whether workdays should be limited to eight hours.",
      "The decree fulfilled Petro\u2019s threat to Congress to put his labor system overhaul before voters should senators not approve the 12-question referendum themselves. He issued the measure in a tense political climate following the Saturday shooting of opposition senator and presidential candidate Miguel Uribe Turbay during a public event.",
      "The referendum has become the crux of long-running tensions between the executive and legislative branches.",
      "After Congress rejected Petro\u2019s labor reform twice, most recently in March, he sent lawmakers a 12-question referendum proposal on May 1 as Colombian law requires that the Senate rule on the advisability of referendums. The legislative body two weeks later voted 49-47 against the measure, prompting Petro to accuse lawmakers of fraud.",

      "The referendum\u2019s questions include whether workers should receive double pay if they work during holidays; whether daytime workdays should end at 6 p.m.; and whether open-ended contracts should be offered to workers to prioritize job stability.",
      "The disagreements between Petro and Congress date back to the start of his term in 2022, but they have heightened as he seeks to consolidate his legacy ahead of next year\u2019s legislative and presidential elections.",
      "Uribe remained in critical condition Wednesday following his shooting in broad daylight Saturday during a political rally in the capital, Bogota. Authorities investigating the motive have not ruled out the possibility that it was a targeted attack on the opposition. They are also considering whether it was an attempt to destabilize the current government, or retaliation by illegal armed groups.",
      "In anticipation of court challenges, Petro on Wednesday said his government will send the decree to Colombia\u2019s Constitutional Court for review. At the same time, the Council of State is considering a lawsuit seeking to annul the Senate\u2019s vote.",

      "He was addressing tens of thousands of fans at a stadium built for the 1936 Olympic Games that still bears the scars of World War II and contains relics from the country\u2019s dark Nazi past.",
      "\u201cTonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experiment to rise with us, raise your voices, stand with us against authoritarianism, and let freedom reign,\u201d he said.",
      "Springsteen has made increasingly pointed and contentious public statements in recent concerts. He peppered Wednesday's performance with mentions of the American democracy's system of checks and balances designed to ward against authoritarianism.",
      "His short speeches \u2014 referencing recent headlines about immigration raids, the freezing of federal funds for universities and measles outbreaks \u2014 came between songs that were also captioned in German on large screens beside the stage. The set was flanked by an American flag on one side and a German flag on the other.",
      "Still, the Boss remained hopeful: \u201cThe America that I've sung to you about for the past 50 years of my life is real. And regardless of its many faults, it's a great country with great people. And we will survive this moment.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019m not here for or against any government. I\u2019ve come to play rock \u2019n\u2019 roll for you in the hope that one day all the barriers will be torn down,\u201d Springsteen said in German at the time, before launching into a cover of Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cChimes of Freedom.\u201d",

      "The Berlin Wall fell the following year, and some experts credit the concert for its part in fueling the protest movement that brought the end of the Communist government.",
      "Almost four decades later, Springsteen issued a stark warning: \u201cThe America that I love, the America that I\u2019ve sung to you about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- The first thing Alison Jones does when she wakes up is to name three things she\u2019s grateful for. It can be as simple as the breeze from a fan or as meaningful as the way a friend showed up for her emotionally.",
      "Jones, an organizational development consultant, said the daily practice has helped her through hardships and the anxiety and vulnerability of starting her own business as a single mom.",
      "\u201cWhen you practice gratitude, you train your brain to always look for the positive in anything. It just completely shifts everything you\u2019re going through,\u201d she said. \u201cYou start to see the lessons in the pain. You start see the beauty in the very difficult times because you realize, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m growing stronger.\u2019\u201d",
      "Practicing and encouraging gratitude can be a simple way to boost morale at a time when layoffs and economic uncertainty are causing stress and anxiety. Some employers have found that workers who receive expressions of gratitude show more engagement and willingness to help others.",
      "Other proponents say expressing and receiving appreciation can help reduce stress, as well as improve a person's mood and outlook.",
      "But despite its benefits, promoting gratefulness is often overlooked as a valuable way to spend time and resources in the workplace.",
      "Experts in organizational change shared ways to incorporate more gratitude into the workday.",
      "If you\u2019re new to practicing gratitude, you can start at home with a routine such as Jones\u2019 custom of expressing gratitude before getting out of bed.",
      "She made her gratitude practice easy so it would become a sustainable habit. Her one rule is avoiding repetition and stretching her mind to find new things to be grateful for each day.",
      "Jones also recommends finding a \u201cgratitude buddy\u201d to share with. A buddy may be a friend from work or your social circles, and ideas can be exchanged in person, by text or email, or during a phone call. Many people find it helpful to list what they\u2019re grateful for in a journal.",
      "At work, a team leader can begin a staff meeting by expressing gratitude for what went well in the last week, suggested Peter Bonanno, a consultant who helps companies design mindfulness-based programs.",
      "As humans, we often have a bias toward negativity, but gratitude \u201cjust does an enormous amount to shift people\u2019s mindsets and the way they engage with each other,\u201d he said. \u201cGratitude is especially powerful in that way. It doesn\u2019t take a long time for people to notice an impact.\u201d",
      "O.C. Tanner Institute, a software and service company, helps organizations find effective ways to show appreciation to their employees, such as managers giving handwritten notes of thanks. The company helped American Airlines develop a system for managers and colleagues to recognize good work with points that can be applied to a catalog order.",
      "It also helped Amway create gift boxes to celebrate workers' accomplishments and important personal milestones, such as buying a home or adopting a child.",
      "\u201cRecognition impacts so many facets of the employee experience. And when you do it well, it connects people back to a deep sense of purpose and meaning,\u201d said Meghan Stettler, a director at O.C. Tanner.",
      "Some companies donate their own products to thank nurses, doctors, police officers, firefighters and other workers who serve their communities. Frontline Builders, a nonprofit organization launched during the pandemic, connects donors of snacks, drinks and personal care items with recipients.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all worked in that job where we weren\u2019t shown gratitude and realized how much that stinks,\u201d said Jason Lalack, partnership director at Frontline Builders. \u201cShowing someone gratitude or showing appreciation doesn\u2019t really cost anything, and shouldn\u2019t be that difficult of a thing, and yet it\u2019s rarer than it should be.\u201d",
      "Registered nurse Denise Whittsell remembers how quiet the hospital where she works became during the pandemic. The hallways of Denver Health, typically busy with families and guests, were suddenly empty as visits from outsiders were curtailed and patients battled illnesses alone.",
      "Once in a while, someone from the community would deliver gifts of gratitude: tasty snacks or handmade cards from schoolchildren.",
      "\u201cThose spontaneous recognitions were really sweet,\u201d Whittsell said. \u201cIt just felt really kind, and it felt like there was a lot of wrapping around us, a very supportive feeling.\u201d",
      "Whittsell is part of a team of volunteers at Denver Health's RESTORE program, which connects front-line hospital workers with trained peer responders for confidential emotional support and training.",
      "The hospital started the program as a way to improve and sustain the emotional well-being of its workforce, said Tia Henry, the program's director. Volunteers take shifts so someone is available around-the-clock to answer calls from hospital personnel who are struggling with stressful events such as losing a patient or witnessing violence.",
      "Volunteers and staff regularly express gratitude for the program, Henry said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had calls on my way to work: \u2018I\u2019m having a hard time and I need to talk with somebody who gets it,\u2019\u201d Whittsell said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way to give back to the people that I work with.\"",
      "Aside from peer support, RESTORE also provides training and education to employees about stress, burnout and techniques to deescalate violence, Henry said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not doing counseling or therapy, but we\u2019re using components of psychological first aid to truly engage timely with our teammates when they\u2019re distressed, helping them calm their nervous system and get back to the place of regulation where they can show back up and do what it is they need to do or they can lay something down and go back home,\u201d Henry said. \u201cThat is gratitude from my lens.\u201d",
      "Indy Public Safety Foundation, an Indianapolis nonprofit organization that supports front-line workers, shows gratitude to police, firefighters and paramedics through awards banquets, trainings, and showing up with food, shaking hands and saying thank you after a community tragedy.",
      "Foundation staff members take gratitude a step further by providing tools and equipment such as electric bikes for police patrols.",
      "While front-line workers were applauded during the pandemic, \"their work has continued and arguably not gotten any less stressful, and some of that support has waned,\u201d said Dane Nutty, the foundation's president and CEO.",
      "While practicing gratitude may make for a more pleasant on-the-job environment, it's not a replacement for better working conditions. It's good to be grateful to have a job that pays the bills. It's also important to ask for what's fair.",
      "\u201cBeing grateful absolutely doesn\u2019t mean that we accept anything subpar or inappropriate,\u201d Jones said, adding that people should advocate for basic needs such as meal breaks. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to confuse gratitude with being passive.\"",

      "The three items are among new products that have gotten stuck in the pipeline due to President Donald Trump's unpredictable trade policies, according to the brand founders behind the stalled items. They say that instead of fostering U.S. innovation, Trump\u2019s tariffs are stifling it with extra costs and unexpected work.",
      "At Learning Resources in Vernon Hills, Illinois, Made Plus in Annapolis, Maryland, and Dorai Home in Salt Lake City, research and development have taken a backseat to recalculating budgets, negotiating with vendors and tracking shipments in the shifting tariff environment.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t have enough cash to cover just the restocks of the things that we know we need, do we want to take a risk on this new thing when we don\u2019t know how well it will sell yet?\u201d Dorai Home founder Kelsey O\u2019Callaghan said.",
      "O\u2019Callaghan started the eco-friendly home goods company with a stone bath mat and now offers about 50 kitchen and bathroom accessories, which are made in China with a non-toxic material that dries quickly. New launches are critical to increasing sales and attracting customers, she said.",
      "As Trump increased the tariff on Chinese goods to 20% and as high as 145% before reducing the import tax rate to 30% for 90 days, Dorai Home postponed introducing new merchandise. O'Callaghan said she had to lay off the CEO as well as the head of product development, who helped the company jump on new trends.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t really put the time or the emphasis on (innovation) because I\u2019m covering too many other people\u2019s roles,\u201d she said.",
      "The company paused shipments from China in early April but resumed some on a staggered basis after the president's rate reduction. On Wednesday, Trump touted progress  in U.S.-China trade talks.",
      "With details still sketchy and a deal not finalized, entrepreneurs interviewed by The Associated Press said they viewed the tariffs war as an ongoing threat.",
      "The potential stunting of innovation follows an economic slowdown during the coronavirus pandemic, when companies also had to put projects on hold. Some experts think the on-again-off again tariffs may have more enduring consequences because they rewire markets and upend business strategies.",
      "\u201cWhen executive attention shifts from innovation to regulatory compliance, the innovation pipeline suffers. Companies end up optimizing for the political landscape rather than technological advancement,\u201d economists J. Bradford Jensen, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and Scott J. Wallsten, president of the Technology Policy Institute think tank, wrote in an April blog post.",
      "Trump has argued that curtailing foreign imports with tariffs would help revive the nation's diminished manufacturing base. Analysts and various trade groups have warned that fractured trade ties and supply chains may depress R&D activity of U.S. tech and health care companies that rely on international partnerships or foreign suppliers.",
      "Small companies, which often drive the innovations that create jobs and economic growth, already are under strain.",
      "With fewer people on staff and tighter budgets compared to large corporations, entrepreneurs say they are spending more time on cutting costs, suspending or arranging orders, and deciding how much of their tariff-related costs to charge customers. That means they\u2019re spending less time thinking of their next big ideas.",
      "Schylling Inc., a Massachusetts company that produces modern versions of Lava lamps, Sea-Monkeys, My Little Pony and other nostalgic toys, has its products made in China. As part of its strategy to account for tariffs, the company put a group of employees on temporary unpaid leave last month to reduce expenses.",
      "Marketing director Beth Muehlenkamp said she and other furloughed workers typically would have been planning products for the final months of 2026. But Schylling isn't focusing on designing new products given the unstable trade outlook.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to focus on innovation and creativity when you\u2019re consumed with this day-to-day of how we\u2019re just going to balance the books and deal with the changing rates,\u201d Muehlenkamp said.",
      "Even some companies that do their manufacturing in the U.S. are scaling back investments in new products. Made Plus, a Maryland company that makes athletic shoes at a small factory in the state capital, put a planned golf line on hold because two key components \u2014 a foam insole and the tread for the bottom of the shoe \u2014 currently are made in China, founder Alan Guyan said.",
      "The company customizes its shoes on demand and charges $145 to $200 a pair. The footwear is made from recycled plastic bottles with advanced knitting, 3D printing and computerized stitching techniques. It's looking into getting components from Vietnam instead of China.",
      "Embracing new technology is essential to restoring manufacturing capability in the U.S. and competing with Asia, Guyan said. But given ongoing trade frictions, he said he does not want to invest time or money evaluating the latest embroidery and knitting machines, which come from Germany, Italy, China and the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just battening down the hatches a little bit and just hoping that there\u2019s enough influence in the community of footwear that it will somewhat change and get resolved and we can move forward,\u201d he said of the tariff roller coaster.",
      "In contrast, many big companies are forging on. Google parent Alphabet confirmed late last month that it still planned to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures this year, with most of the money going toward artificial intelligence technology.",
      "Sonia Lapinsky, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners, has advised her clients to limit tariff discussions to a small group of executives and to keep their product creation cycles in motion.",
      "Businesses have an even greater imperative to come up with attention-grabbing innovations when consumers may be reluctant to open their wallets, she said.",
      "Yet smaller companies may struggle to wall off tariff discussions from the rest of the business.",

While exploring factories in countries besides China, he said, Learning Resources is delaying the next generation of its interactive robots that help children develop computer programming skills through games and other activities.",
      "The family-run business and Woldenberg's other toy business, hand2Mind, are locked in a legal battle with the Trump administration. The jointly owned companies filed a lawsuit accusing the president of exceeding his authority by invoking an emergency powers law to impose tariffs.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. President Donald Trump wants China to lift restrictions on exporting rare earths and other critical minerals that Beijing imposed as part of a yearslong trade war",
      "GANZHOU, China -- China\u2019s dominance over critical minerals in global supply chains was a powerful bargaining chip in trade talks between Beijing and Washington that concluded with both sides saying they have a framework to pursue a deal.",
      "China has spent decades building the world's main industrial chain for mining and processing such materials, which are used in many industries such as electronics, advanced manufacturing, defense and health care.",
      "Mines and factories in and around Ganzhou, a key production hub for rare earths, underpin China's control over the minerals. Many residents grew up collecting rocks containing the valuable minerals from the forested hills surrounding the southern city and today make a living from mining, trading or processing them.",
      "Responding to ever higher tariffs and other controls on advanced technology, China told exporters of certain key rare earths and other critical minerals to obtain licenses for every shipment abroad. Approvals can take weeks, leading to supply chain disruptions in the U.S. and other countries.",
      "President Donald Trump said Wednesday that China would make it easier for American industry to obtain much-needed needed magnets and rare earth minerals, clearing the way for talks to continue between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. In return, Trump said, the U.S. will stop efforts to revoke the visas of Chinese nationals on U.S. college campuses.",
      "But details remain scarce. Beijing has not confirmed what the negotiators agreed to, and Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump himself have yet to sign off on it.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said Saturday it had approved a \u201ccertain number\u201d of export licenses for rare earth products, apparently acknowledging Trump\u2019s personal request to Xi during a phone call last week. And on Wednesday, the Ganzhou-based rare-earth conglomerate JL MAG Rare-Earth Co. confirmed it had obtained some export licenses for shipments to destinations including the U.S., Europe and Southeast Asia.",
      "Experts say, however, Beijing is unlikely to do away with the permit system enabling it to control access to those valuable resources.",
      "The only scenario in which China might deregulate its critical minerals export is if the U.S. first fully removes tariffs imposed on Chinese goods as part of the trade war, said Wang Yiwei, a professor of international affairs at Renmin University, echoing the Chinese government\u2019s earlier stance.",
      "\u201cWithout that,\u201d he said, \u201cit will be difficult to blame China for continuing to strengthen its export controls.\u201d",
      "In 1992, Deng Xiaoping, the leader who launched China's ascent as the world's biggest manufacturing power, famously said \u201cthe Middle East has oil, China has rare earths,\u201d signaling a desire to leverage access to the key minerals.",
      "Several generations later, Beijing has made its rich reserves of rare earths, a group of 17 minerals that are abundant in the earth\u2019s crust but hard, expensive and environmentally polluting to process, a key element of China's economic security. In 2019, during a visit to a rare earth processing plant in Ganzhou, Xi described rare earths as a \u201cvital strategic resource.\u201d",
      "China today has an essential monopoly over \u201cheavy rare earths,\u201d used for making powerful, heat-resistance magnets used in industries such as defense and electric vehicles.",
      "The country also produces around 80% of the world\u2019s tungsten, gallium and antimony, and 60% of the world\u2019s germanium -\u2013 all minerals used in the making of semiconductors, among other advanced technologies.",
      "The risks of dependency on Chinese suppliers first came into focus in 2010, when Beijing suspended rare earths exports to Japan due to a territorial dispute. The ban was lifted after about two months, but as a precaution, Japan invested in rare earths processing plants in other countries and began stockpiling the materials.",
      "Beijing's across-the-board requirement for export licenses for some critical minerals has put pressure on world electronics manufacturers and automakers.",
      "Some auto parts makers in Europe have shut down production lines due to delays in supply deliveries, according to the European Association of Automotive Suppliers. In the U.S., Tesla CEO Elon Musk said a shortage of rare earths is affecting his company\u2019s work on humanoid robots.",
      "In the drab industrial hub of Ganzhou, cradled by the scenic Dayu Mountains, the U.S.-China trade war is still a distant stressor. Miners and small mineral traders interviewed by The Associated Press said they are more concerned about depleting the mountains' once-abundant resources.",
      "Zhong, a tungsten factory manager in Ganzhou who would only give his last name, worked his way up to manager from a miner, but he's unsure there is a future for him and others in the industry.",
      "\u201cI find growing difficulties to source tungsten these days,\u201d he said, adding that smaller mines and trading companies are slowly disappearing as the resources are dwindling. Tungsten is an ultra-hard metal used in armor-piercing ammunition, nuclear reactors and semiconductors.",
      "At least five tungsten mines have closed in the area in recent years, according to state media. Remaining reserves are deeper and harder to extract and process after decades of exploitation, said Li Shangkui, chairman of the Ganzhou-based Jiangxi Yuean Advanced Materials Co., Ltd.",
      "Processing factories in Ganzhou now routinely source materials from other provinces or other countries. Zhong\u2019s plant imports some raw materials from places like Africa and Cambodia.",
      "Major state-owned and private companies in Ganzhou are also ramping up investments abroad. Tungsten producer Ganzhou Haisheng, for instance, announced last year a $25 million investment in a new tungsten plant in Thailand.",
      "Whatever the challenges in procuring raw materials, China likely will seek to maintain its dominance in critical minerals, said Fabian Villalobos, an engineer and critical minerals expert at the RAND think tank.",
      "Between 2020 and 2023, the U.S. imported at least 70% of the rare earth compounds it used from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It has diversified its sources in recent years, but still mainly relies on China.",
      "Since beginning his second term in office, Trump has made improving access to critical minerals a matter of national security. But the U.S. has an incredibly long way to go to catch up with China, experts say.",
      "The sole operational U.S. rare earths mine, in Mountain Pass, California, is unable to separate heavy rare earths. It sends its ore to China for processing. The U.S. Defense Department has provided funding to the mine's owner, MP Materials, to build new separation facilities. It will take months to build and still only produce a fraction of what is needed.",
      "Friction over the issue has opened the way for government-backed financing that was unavailable before, said Mark Smith, who ran the Mountain Pass mine in the early 2010s and now leads NioCorp. It's seeking about $780 million in financing through the U.S. Export-Import Bank to build a processing facility in Nebraska for critical minerals including rare earths.",
      "The Defense Department has committed $439 million to building domestic rare earth supply chains, but building a complete mining and processing industrial chain like China's could take decades.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be some real issues here unless we can figure out how to get along with China for a period of time while we're developing our own resources and our mainstream processing,\u201d Smith said.",
      "The spotlight on critical minerals also provides opportunities for smaller miners to invest in extracting and processing some critical minerals, such as tungsten, considered \u201cniche\u201d because they are needed in relatively small amounts in key industries, said Milo McBride, an expert on sustainability and geopolitics at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\u201cFor many of these companies, the business strategy hedges on a scenario where the U.S. and China become more confrontational and where trade relations become more uncomfortable,\u201d McBride said. \u201cAnd all of a sudden, what was once an uneconomic project somewhere outside of China starts to make more sense.\u201d",

      "The owner of an Omaha food packaging company says his business has been unfairly hamstrung by Tuesday's raid carried out by federal immigration officials",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The owner of an Omaha food packaging company says his business has been unfairly hamstrung by federal immigration officials, who raided the plant and arrested more than half its workforce.",
      "The raid took place despite the company meticulously following the government's own system for verifying the workers were in the country legally, owner Gary Rohwer said Wednesday.",
      "Glenn Valley Foods now is operating at about 30% of capacity as the business scrambles to hire more workers, Rohwer said as he stood outside the plant.",
      "Asked how upsetting the raid was, Rohwer replied, \u201cI was very upset, ma\u2019am, because we were told to e-verify, and we e-verified all these years, so I was shocked.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe did everything we could possibly do,\" he said.",
      "E-Verify is an online U.S. Department of Homeland Security system launched in the late 1990s that allows employers to quickly check if potential employees can work legally in the U.S., often by using Social Security numbers.",
      "Some of America\u2019s largest employers use it, including Starbucks and Walmart, but the vast majority of employers do not. Critics say the system is fairly easy to cheat, particularly with false documents.",
      "Rohwer noted that federal officials have said his company was a victim of those using stolen identities or fake IDs to get around the E-Verify system, which lead agents conducting the raid described as \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cflawed\u201d to Glenn Valley executives.",
      "But that does nothing to repair the company\u2019s bottom line, Rohwer said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to see the United States government ... come up with a program that they can communicate to the companies as to how to hire legitimate help. Period,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed that more than 70 people were arrested during the Glenn Valley Foods raid on Tuesday. It also said one of the workers, described as a Honduras national, assaulted federal agents as he was being detained.",
      "The Omaha raid comes amid an immigration crackdown under President Donald Trump. The administration has been intensifying its efforts in recent weeks, and Trump deployed more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines this week to respond to ongoing protests in Los Angeles over his immigration policies.",
      "The raid, in the southeastern section of Omaha where nearly a quarter of residents are foreign born according to the 2020 census, led to hundreds of people turning out to protest Tuesday evening. But it also had a chilling effect on the south Omaha community.",
      "The Metropolitan Community College\u2019s South Omaha campus and an Omaha library branch in the area closed Tuesday afternoon, and several businesses along south Omaha's normally bustling 24th Street closed as news of the raid spread. Several of them remained closed Wednesday, said Douglas County Board of Commissioners Chairman Roger Garcia, whose district covers south Omaha.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s still on alert, waiting to see what happens today and in the coming days,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cSo there\u2019s still a lot of anxiety and fear out there.\u201d",
      "That fear will show up in the form of a weakened economy in Omaha, he added.",
      "\u201cYou know, when products are not being sold, taxes are not being collected, and people are not able to get their goods as well. So it affects all of us,\u201d he said.",
      "An aunt of Garcia's wife was among those taken away by ICE during the Omaha raid, he said. They have been unable to determine where she is being held.",
      "The raid came on the same day of the inauguration of newly elected Omaha Mayor John Ewing, a Democrat who unseated three-term Republican Jean Stothert last month.",
      "During a news conference Wednesday to address the raid, Ewing declined to speculate on whether the timing of it was intended to distract from his swearing-in. But he denounced the action by federal authorities, saying, \u201cMy message to the public is that we are with them.\u201d",
      "Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer also declared that his department will play no part in checking immigration or the legal status of residents in the community.",
      "\u201cThat is not our mission. Our mission is public safety,\u201d the chief said. \u201cI need victims to come forward. They will not come forward if they\u2019re fearful of Omaha Police Department being immigration officers.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump is expected to sign a measure Thursday that blocks California\u2019s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is expected to sign a measure Thursday that blocks California\u2019s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, a White House official told The Associated Press.",
      "The resolution Trump plans to sign, which Congress approved last month, aims to quash the country\u2019s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. He also plans to approve measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.",
      "The timing of the signing was confirmed Wednesday by a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to share plans not yet public.",
      "The development comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump's move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It's the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over everything from tariffs to the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s a day ending in Y, it\u2019s another day of Trump\u2019s war on California,\u201d Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villase\u00f1or said in an email. \"We\u2019re fighting back.\"",
      "According to the White House official, Trump is expected to sign resolutions that block California\u2019s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and ending the sale of new ones by 2035. He will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.",
      "The president is scheduled to sign the measures and make remarks during an event at the White House on Thursday morning.",
      "Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal and said the state plans to sue.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin are expected to attend, along with members of Congress and representatives from the energy, trucking and gas station industries.",
      "The signings come as Trump has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.",
      "The move will also come a day after the Environmental Protection Agency proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas. Zeldin said it would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help \u201cunleash\u201d American energy.",
      "California, which has some of the nation\u2019s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.",
      "In his first term, Trump revoked California\u2019s ability to enforce its standards, but President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.",
      "Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.",
      "That\u2019s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California\u2019s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.",
      "California, which makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, has significant power to sway trends in the auto industry. About a dozen states signed on to adopt California's rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.",
      "The National Automobile Dealers Association supported the federal government\u2019s move to block California\u2019s ban on gas-powered cars, saying Congress should decide on such a national issue, not the state.",
      "The American Trucking Associations said the rules were not feasible and celebrated Congress\u2019 move to block them.",
      "Chris Spear, the CEO of the American Trucking Associations, said in a statement Wednesday: \u201cThis is not the United States of California.\u201d",
      "It was also applauded by Detroit automaker General Motors, which said it will \u201chelp align emissions standards with today\u2019s market realities.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have long advocated for one national standard that will allow us to stay competitive, continue to invest in U.S. innovation, and offer customer choice across the broadest lineup of gas-powered and electric vehicles,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "Dan Becker with the Center for Biological Diversity, in anticipation of the president signing the measures, said earlier Thursday that the move would be \u201cTrump\u2019s latest betrayal of democracy.\u201d",
      "\u201cSigning this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people\u2019s health and their wallets,\u201d Becker said in a statement.",

    "summary": "&ldquo;Take Me out to the Ball Game&rdquo; is more than just a song sung every summer in baseball stadiums around the United States",
    "story": [
      "\u201cTake Me out to the Ball Game\u201d is more than just a song sung every summer in baseball stadiums around the United States",
      "NEW YORK -- It's sung every summer in baseball stadiums around the United States. But the impact of \u201cTake Me Out to the Ball Game\u201d goes much further than simply getting fans out of their seats for the 7th-inning stretch.",
      "More than a century after Jack Norworth penned the lyrics, a nonprofit founded with the song's royalties is celebrating 50 years of supporting young musicians \u2014 including the talent behind some of today's most popular musicals. The ASCAP Foundation, the charitable arm for the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, was established in 1975 after Norworth's estate left a bequest of the licensing payments for baseball's unofficial anthem and his other hits.",
      "\u201cJust as all music begins with a song, the ASCAP Foundation began with a song,\u201d said Paul Williams, the group's president and a composer-lyricist whose award-winning career includes \u201cRainbow Connection.\u201d",
      "The organization provides money, lessons and mentorship at all career stages in an industry where that support is badly needed by artists who often toil for years working other gigs while trying to get their music before the right ears. To reach its semicentennial, however, the foundation has had to identify new funding streams and reinvent programming.",
      "\u201cTake Me Out to the Ballgame,\u201d written in 1908, has since entered the public domain and no longer generates revenue. The foundation nowadays relies on a mix of philanthropies, corporate sponsors and general public donations. The Louis Armstrong Educational Foundation is a longtime backer and storied New York law firm Paul Weiss is another sponsor.",
      "And, according to Williams, \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot of stingy songwriters out there.\u201d The late Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, as well as Herb Alpert, are among those with named scholarships and awards. Williams said other bequests, which are charitable gifts left through a will, have come from \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d composer-lyricist Jerry Herman and \u201cTea for Two\u201d lyricist Irving Ceasar.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really a way of making a mark on the world and extending their values forward,\u201d fundraising coach Claire Axelrad said of bequests, which she added have consistently made up about one-tenth of charitable gifts.",
      "With dwindling arts funding and millions of children reportedly going without music education, the ASCAP Foundation is also trying to reach underserved communities. Leaders count nearly 60,000 K-12 students who participated in last year's programs. They help teach guitar to New York summer campers and bring students to free Broadway-caliber productions. Youth are learning to play the djembe, a drum originally from West Africa, through a collaboration with urban farming nonprofit Harlem Grown.",
      "Tax filings show the foundation gave away more than $325,000 in grants for scholarships, fellowships and cash awards in 2023. Award-winning songwriter Emily Bear, who co-wrote the soundtrack for Disney\u2019s \u201cMoana 2,\u201d said the foundation took her \u201cvery seriously\" when she was a five-year-old prodigy receiving its young composer award.",
      "\u201cThat kind of validation at that kind of age means so much when you\u2019re just a little girl with very big dreams and you\u2019re in a room full of people that you idolize,\" she said.",
      "Composer Stephen Schwartz, who was honored this week with the ASCAP Foundation Champion Award during a June 10 fundraiser at Tony winner Adam Guettel\u2019s Manhattan home, said the nonprofit is filling gaps as the government \u201csupports the arts less and less.\u201d",
      "This April also marked the third year that Schwartz has hosted the foundation\u2019s two-day Musical Theatre Fest in Los Angeles. The location allows participants to get feedback from prominent guests and connect with Hollywood studios \u2014 one way the foundation is trying to stay relevant by serving the renewed interest in musicals for television and film screens.",
      "It's emblematic of the mentorship younger composers say Schwartz \u2014 a Broadway icon whose hits include \u201cGodspell,\u201d \u201cPippin\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d \u2014 has offered to emerging artists over the years.",
      "Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the songwriting duo behind \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d credited the ASCAP Foundation for \u201ccementing\u201d their connection with Schwartz. Pasek said such close proximity to a hero, who then became a \"living, breathing person who gives you advice,\u201d made the profession \u201cmore plausible.\u201d",
      "\u201cTypically, you\u2019re working on projects on a wing and a prayer and hoping that someday it reaches the stage,\u201d Paul said. \"So, an organization like the ASCAP Foundation breathing life into not just your work, but your pocketbooks, is a huge, huge support.\u201d",
      "Schwartz said it was \u201cscary and bewildering\u201d when he first started out without any connections. He sees an important role for himself as someone who can \u201cease the way a bit\u201d to help newcomers\u2019 \u201ctalents flourish earlier and more completely.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s also another motivation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s slightly selfish because I get to see good work and enjoy it,\u201d Schwartz added.",

      "Much of the industry, including the major airlines and their trade groups, supports Bryan Bedford\u2019s nomination. But pilots unions and Democrats have raised concerns that he might weaken pilot training standards.",
      "Bedford has been CEO of regional airline Republic Airways since 1999 and has more than three decades of experience in the industry. He has pledged to make safety the FAA\u2019s top priority and work to restore public confidence in flying. Bedford also said he'll work with Congress on Trump\u2019s multi-billion-dollar plan to overhaul the nation\u2019s air traffic control system.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has said the FAA should have acted before the crash in Washington, D.C., because there had been 85 near misses reported around Ronald Reagan National Airport in the years before the disaster. The FAA has since banned some helicopter routes to make sure helicopters and planes no longer share the same airspace, but there have still been additional near misses in recent months.",
      "FAA's acting administrator and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have acknowledged the FAA's shortcomings in not recognizing the risk and pledged to review all the agency's data to identify any similar concerns nationwide about helicopter traffic near airports. That review prompted the agency to put new limits on helicopter flights around Las Vegas' airport.",
      "Even the air traffic controllers union backed Bedford's nomination because of his support for the effort to modernize the outdated system and bolster controller hiring. Two different radar outages this spring in a facility that directs planes in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport highlighted the problems because the FAA had to limit flights at the airport after five controllers took trauma leave after the problems.",
      "\u201cFlying is safe, but as you know the system that manages our skies is showing its age,\" Bedford said in his prepared statement to the committee. \u201cThe stresses of this antiquated system truly came into view as we all returned to the skies after COVID.\u201d",
      "Pilots\u2019 unions and Democrats have raised concerns that Bedford may support weakening the 1,500-hour experience standard for airline pilots that was adopted after a 2009 crash or even might consider allowing some airlines to operate with only one pilot. Republic previously asked for permission to hire pilots with less experience because the standard was making it hard to find enough pilots.",

These hidden gems boast a special combination of attractive qualities and can potentially make excellent choices for savvy folks who want their ride to stand out from the sea of mainstream vehicles. Certain slower-selling cars don\u2019t get the respect they deserve, whether due to styling, the type of vehicle, or brand image. Edmunds explores five hidden gems and the wow factor that makes them shine. Our choices are ordered by starting price, including destination fees.",
      "The Ioniq 6 is an electric sedan that does almost everything right. It\u2019s sporty and fun to drive, yet it\u2019s also comfortable and has a smooth ride over rough dips and potholes. Inside, you\u2019ll find a well-built interior that\u2019s easy to use. The Ioniq 6 touts a long EPA-estimated range of up to 342 miles. It\u2019s also one of the quickest-charging EVs on the market when using a powerful fast-charging machine.",
      "The electric Hyundai\u2019s drawbacks are mostly minor, with one big exception. Its styling isn\u2019t for everyone and attracts attention for good and bad reasons. However, the upcoming 2026 model has updated styling that\u2019s easier on the eyes.",

It\u2019s more comfortable, has more passenger room and handles better than its rivals.",
      "The Ridgeline\u2019s towing capacity is certainly good enough for most uses, such as pulling a small camper trailer or toy hauler.

If you charge regularly, trips to the gas station will be rare thanks to the Outlander PHEV\u2019s lengthy 38-mile electric range. When the battery runs low, you\u2019ll get a respectable 26 mpg combined.",
      "With the third row folded down, the Outlander PHEV offers lots of cargo space. When it\u2019s up, you\u2019ll have room for seven passengers, but the third row is only large enough for kids.

Its styling is similar to a sedan\u2019s, but the Crown has a raised ride height that\u2019s more like a crossover SUV\u2019s. Oh, and it\u2019s a hybrid too. The base engine is a fuel sipper that gets an EPA-estimated 41 mpg combined. The optional Hybrid Max engine produces an impressive 340 horsepower for quick acceleration, but fuel economy dips to 30 mpg combined.",

      "2025 Crown starting price: $42,575",
      "The G90 has everything you want in a large, lavish sedan except for brand cachet. Genesis is still relatively new in the luxury world, but its vehicles, especially the flagship G90, shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. This South Korean sedan touts style, power, exceptional comfort, and an opulent cabin with superb fit and finish. Some rivals offer the same but require an arm and a leg for payment. And you\u2019re mistaken if you think the G90 skimps on features.",
      "The top 3.5T E-Supercharger version doesn\u2019t offer any optional features because it comes equipped with many features, including many that usually cost thousands more than they would on a luxury rival.

      "FEMA is \u201cfully activated in preparation for Hurricane Season,\u201d and is \u201cshifting from bloated DC-centric dead weight to a lean, deployable disaster force that empowers state actors to provide relief for their citizens,\" according to a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the agency.",
      "Leaders in disaster relief say FEMA\u2019s absence would make it harder to coordinate resources across federal government, set up effective communications, and deploy emergency supplies. \u201cFEMA is a key partner, we need them,\u201d said David Guadalupe, chair of the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster.",
      "They worry the sudden policy changes could leave many states unprepared and under-resourced, intensifying the need for donations and volunteers.",
      "\u201cThe worst case scenario is that that money gets pulled back and we have to fill in those gaps,\u201d said Ann Lee, CEO of the relief organization CORE.",
      "It would be especially difficult, they say, to replace the services under FEMA\u2019s Individual Assistance program, like temporary housing and grants to repair or replace damaged homes and vehicles.",
      "For direct assistance alone, FEMA has approved over $460 million for 160,000 households in North Carolina since Hurricane Helene, and more than $136 million for 34,500 households after the Los Angeles fires.",
      "\u201cIf the funding to the people gets eliminated, that\u2019s all they have,\u201d said Michael Capponi, president of Global Empowerment Mission, adding that while nonprofits are often faster and more efficient at getting people help, they still need the money to make it happen. \u201cThe private sector can never take that on,\u201d he said.",
      "FEMA also funds disaster case managers, who help survivors navigate paperwork, and legal and mental health support. Providing those services \u201cwill require even more robust volunteer organization,\u201d said Byard.",
      "Other needs could include supporting smaller, less experienced emergency management departments, collecting data about survivor needs, or hauling away debris if federal dollars don't pay for the pickup.",
      "Even when FEMA help is available, it could look different than recent years, said Coleman. He points out that the agency already canceled its door-to-door canvassing program that helped survivors enroll with FEMA, and worries the feds could give survivors less time to apply. \u201cThe effort to get the word out about FEMA assistance is critically important,\u201d he said. \u201cNonprofits will have to move quickly.\u201d",
      "Relief organizations like CORE and Good360 are also pre-positioning more supplies in storm-vulnerable areas, in part in case FEMA supplies arrive more slowly. Trump took up to eight weeks to approve some declaration requests this spring, making aid groups even more important as survivors waited for help. \u201cThat preparation is the biggest thing to focus on,\u201d said Lee.",
      "The new responsibilities could come at a time when states, nonprofits and funders are already under strain from worsening disasters and federal funding cuts across government.",
      "A United Way Worldwide survey of the 211 network found that referrals for disaster-related assistance rose over 50% in 2024. Nonprofits have also been weakened by losing federal grants as well as staff from AmeriCorps cuts.",
      "\u201cThe groups in the community 365 days a year are getting beat up significantly,\u201d said Noah Patton, director of disaster recovery at the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, adding community-based organizations are already under pressure from housing shortages and other crises.",
      "\u201cWhen you're working at a homeless shelter that is 100% utilized and then you drop a disaster on it, it\u2019s \u2018How will I continue to do my job,\u2019 not \u2018How can I expand my mission.\u2019\u201d",
      "Funders that fuel recovery work say they can\u2019t replace federal money. \u201cIt\u2019s not just unrealistic, it\u2019s a dangerous abdication of public responsibility,\u201d said Ryan Eller, executive director of the Appalachia Funders Network. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason these agencies were brought about in the first place when local resources just can\u2019t meet the need.\u201d",
      "Philanthropy committed over $300 million to recovery to Hurricane Helene alone, and hundreds of millions more each for the fires in LA and on Maui. Eller said it\u2019s getting harder to fundraise for recovery. \u201cThere is a general fatigue around disaster philanthropy because of the volume and frequency of storms,\u201d he said.",
      "Even if a nonprofit can't take on more, simply building relationships with state and local government, residents, and fellow relief groups ahead of an emergency will make everyone more prepared, said Byard. \u201cTake FEMA out of it, now we\u2019re really looking at communities supporting communities,\u201d he said. \u201cThat can build some really really strong resilience.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- Britain's Labour government hopes to regain the political initiative Wednesday when Treasury chief Rachel Reeves sets out her spending plans for the coming years, with big increases expected for health, defense and housing.",
      "Reeves, who has been blamed by many for Labour's decline in popularity since it returned to power after 14 years in July, will outline the government's spending and investment priorities for lawmakers. There will be no tax announcements.",

      "Labour won a landslide victory last year on a slogan of \u201cchange\u201d and voter anger at the Conservative administration in power at the time, but its vote share was historically low for a winning party at 35%.",
      "In the months since, Labour has been overtaken in opinion polls by the anti-immigration and recently formed Reform U.K. Reeves has been blamed by many for Labour's struggles, not least her decision in July to withdraw a winter fuel subsidy to all but the poorest retirees.",

Billions more are expected for social housing as the government aims to meet its target of building 1.5 million new homes by the next election.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s military has shut down loudspeakers broadcasting anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border, marking the new liberal government\u2019s first concrete step toward easing tensions between the war-divided rivals.",
      "The South resumed the loudspeaker broadcasts in June last year following a yearslong pause in retaliation for North Korea flying trash-laden balloons toward the South in a psychological warfare campaign.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry said Wednesday that the move was part of efforts to \u201cto restore trust in inter-Korean relations and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d",
      "North Korea, which is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its authoritarian leadership and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong Un, didn't immediately comment on the step by Seoul.",
      "From May to November last year, North Korea flew about 7,000 balloons toward South Korea in 32 separate events to drop substances such as wastepaper, cloth scraps, cigarette butts and even manure. The North said that its balloon campaign came after South Korean activists sent over balloons filled with anti-North Korean leaflets, as well as USB sticks filled with popular South Korean songs and dramas.",
      "Trash carried by at least one North Korean balloon fell on the South Korean presidential compound in July, raising concerns about the vulnerability of key South Korean facilities. Officials said that the balloon contained no dangerous material and no one was hurt.",
      "South Korea, in response to the North Korean balloons, reactivated its front-line loudspeakers to blast propaganda messages and K-pop songs toward the North. The playlist was clearly designed to strike the nerve of Pyongyang, as Kim\u2019s government since the COVID-19 pandemic has been intensifying a campaign to eliminate the influence of South Korean pop culture and language among the population in a bid to strengthen his family\u2019s dynastic rule.",
      "The Cold War-style psychological warfare campaigns added to tensions fueled by North Korea\u2019s growing nuclear ambitions and South Korean efforts to expand joint military exercises with the United States and strengthen three-way security cooperation with Japan.",
      "South Korea\u2019s new liberal president, Lee Jae-myung, who took office last week after winning an early election to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, has vowed to improve relations with Pyongyang, which reacted furiously to Yoon\u2019s hard-line policies and shunned dialogue.",
      "During the election campaign, Lee promised to halt the loudspeaker broadcasts, arguing that they created unnecessary tensions and discomfort for South Korean residents in border towns. In recent months, those residents had complained about North Korea\u2019s retaliatory broadcasts, which included howling animals, pounding gongs and other irritating sounds.",
      "In a briefing on Monday, South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, also called for South Korean civilian activists to stop flying anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets across the border. Such activities \u201ccould heighten tensions on the Korean Peninsula and threaten the lives and safety of residents in border areas,\u201d said Koo Byoungsam, the ministry\u2019s spokesperson.",
      "In his inaugural address last week, Lee vowed to reopen communication channels with North Korea to ease tensions. But prospects for an early resumption of dialogue between the rival Koreas remain dim, as North Korea has consistently rejected offers from South Korea and the United States since 2019, when nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang collapsed over sanctions-related disagreements.",

      "Spain\u2019s economy minister Carlos Cuerpo says the millions of tourists who visit the country every year pose a challenge for Spain's residents that the government can no longer afford to ignore",
      "MADRID -- Spain's economy minister says the millions of tourists who visit the country every year present a challenge for Spain's residents that the government can no longer afford to ignore.",
      "Last year, Spain received a record 94 million international visitors, making it one of the most visited countries in the world. It could receive as many as 100 million tourists this year, according to some projections.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that these record numbers in terms of tourism also pose challenges,\u201d Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said in an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd we need to deal with those challenges also for our own population.\u201d",
      "Tourism is a key sector for the Southern European nation's economy, which grew faster than any major advanced economy last year at 3.2%, and is projected to grow at 2.4% this year, according to the Bank of Spain, well ahead of the expected eurozone average of 0.9%.",
      "But a stubborn housing crisis in which home and rental costs have skyrocketed in cities such as Madrid, Barcelona and elsewhere has led to growing frustration about one aspect tied to tourism in particular: the proliferation of short-term rental apartments in city centers.",
      "The country has seen several large protests that have drawn tens of thousands of people to demand more government action on housing. Signs at demonstrations with slogans such as \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods\u201d point to the growing anger.",
      "In response, the government recently announced it was cracking down on Airbnb listings that it said were operating in the country illegally, a decision that the company is appealing.",
      "\u201cWe are a 49 million-inhabitants country,\" Cuerpo said. The record numbers of tourists illustrate the \u201cattractiveness of our country, but also of the challenge that we have in terms of dealing and providing for a good experience for tourists, but at the same time avoiding overcharging (for) our own services and our own housing,\u201d he said.",
      "The Bank of Spain recently said the country has a deficit of 450,000 homes. Building more public housing is critical to solve the problem, Cuerpo said. Spain has a lower stock of public housing than many other major European Union countries.",

      "The report by the Netherlands-based Global Rights Compliance says companies including Avon, Walmart, Nescafe, Coca-Cola and paint supplier Sherwin-Williams may be linked to titanium sourced from Xinjiang, where rights groups allege the Chinese government runs coercive labor practices targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities.",
      "The report comes as China and the United States, the world's two largest economies, continue talks aimed at easing their trade dispute.",
      "The report found 77 Chinese suppliers in the titanium, lithium, beryllium and magnesium industries operating in Xinjiang.

      "A federal judge has tossed out a lawsuit over President Donald Trump's dismantling of a U.S. federal agency that invests in African small businesses.",
      "U.S. District Judge Richard Leon in Washington, D.C., dismissed the case on Tuesday, finding that Trump was acting within his legal authority when he fired the U.S. African Development Foundation's board members in February. In March, the same judge ruled that the administration's removal of most grant money and staff from the congressionally created agency was also legal, as long as the agency was maintained at the minimum level required by law.",

In 2023, Congress allocated $46 million to the agency to invest in small agricultural and energy infrastructure projects and other economic development initiatives in 22 African countries.",
      "On Feb. 19, Trump issued an executive order that said USADF, the U.S. Institute of Peace, the Inter-American Foundation and the Presidio Trust should be scaled back to the minimum presence required by law. At the time, USADF had five of its seven board seats filled. A few days later, an administration official told Ward Brehm that he was fired, and emails were sent to the other board members notifying them that they had also been terminated.",
      "Those emails were never received, however, because they were sent to the wrong email addresses. The four board members, believing they still held their posts because they had not been given notice, met in March and passed a resolution appointing Brehm as the president of the board.",
      "But Trump had already appointed Pete Marocco as the new chairman of what the administration believed to now be a board of one. Since then, both men have claimed to be the president of the agency, and Brehm filed the lawsuit March 6.",
      "Leon said that even though they didn't receive the emails, the four board members were effectively terminated in February, and so they didn't have the authority to appoint Brehm to lead the board.",

      "That lawsuit is still pending before the same judge. In that case, two USADF staffers and a consulting firm based in Zambia that works closely with USADF contend that the Trump administration's efforts to deeply scale back the agency wrongly usurps Congress' powers. They also say Marocco was unlawfully appointed to the board, in part because he was never confirmed by the Senate as required.",

      "U.S. inflation likely picked up a bit last month as President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs start to bite, but lower prices for gas and possibly for air fares and used cars may limit the overall increase",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. inflation likely picked up a bit last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs start to bite, but lower prices for gas and possibly for air fares and used cars may limit the overall increase.",
      "The government's inflation report, to be released Wednesday, is forecast to show that consumer prices rose 2.5% in May compared with a year ago, according to economists surveyed by data provider FactSet. That would be the first increase in four months and up from 2.3% in April. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices are projected to have risen 2.9% in May from a year earlier, up from 2.8% in April.",
      "Trump's tariffs are expected to contribute to the uptick by raising the cost of some imports, including clothes, furniture, appliances, and possibly new cars. Many retailers and some consumer products companies have said they have plans to raise prices or have already done so to cover the cost of the import duties.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices are expected to have moved up 0.2% from April to May, while core prices are forecast to have increased 0.3%. At that pace, core prices would rise much faster than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Economists and the inflation-fighters at the Fed focus on core inflation because it often provides a better sense of where inflation is headed.",
      "Inflation has cooled in the past year and, excluding the impact of tariffs, economists say it would be on track to return to the Fed's target, which would allow the central bank to cut its key interest rates. Yet core prices have been more stubborn and were stuck between 3.2% and 3.4% for nearly a year until February, when they started to decline a bit.",
      "Last week, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the inflation data, said it is reducing the amount of data it collects for each inflation report. Economists have expressed concern about the cutback, and while it isn't clear how sharp the reduction is, most analysts say it is likely to have a minor impact. Still, any reduction in data collection could make the figures more volatile.",
      "Nearly all economists expect Trump's duties will make many things more expensive in the second half of this year, including cars and groceries, though by how much is still uncertain. Trump has slapped 30% tariffs on all imports from China, plus a 10% baseline tariff on imported goods from every other country, and 50% import taxes on steel and aluminum.",
      "Given the potential for higher prices in the coming months, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have made clear they will keep their key rate unchanged until they have a better sense of how tariffs will affect the economy.",
      "The full impact of the tariffs likely won't be felt until the second half of the year, analysts say, even though many tariffs have been in place, in one form or another, since March and April. There are several reasons it can take months for the duties to fully pass through into retail prices.",
      "To begin with, many companies tried to beat the clock by bringing in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s tariffs took effect, producing a flood of imports in March. As a result, they have stockpiled goods in warehouses that weren't hit by tariffs and so don't have to raise prices yet.",
      "Many companies also held off on hiking prices during the chaos of April and May, when Trump announced sweeping tariffs on imports from nearly 60 countries, only to put them on hold a week later. He also ramped up duties on China to 145%, essentially cutting off trade with the United States' third-largest trading partner. Imports fell sharply in April as a result. The U.S. and China last month agreed to lower duties, with the U.S. now taxing Chinese imports 30%.",
      "For many firms, it wasn't worth it to raise prices until they had a better sense of where tariffs would settle. It's possible some duties could fall further if the Trump administration is able to reach trade deals in negotiations with China, the European Union, Japan and other countries.",
      "Still, Bryan Eshelman, a partner and managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners, said higher prices \u201care coming.\u201d",
      "Eshelman expects that shoppers will start feeling the impact in July, and predicts prices for back-to-school items like clothing and backpacks could go up anywhere from 5% to 15%. Retailers may add surcharges tied to higher tariffs costs at the cash register starting in September, he said.",
      "\u201cI think that that\u2019s something that retailers are going to be loathe to pull out and do. And so I think they will wait to see how things unfold, \u201d he said.",
      "Most imported goods are actually parts or raw materials for larger products, such as the steel and aluminum goods now facing 50% duties. It will take time for those costs to filter through the supply chain and affect prices.",
      "Some stores, however, have already said they will implement higher prices, including Best Buy, Walmart and Lululemon.",
      "It was only last month when Trump ripped into Walmart after the nation\u2019s largest retailer boldly warned that prices are already starting to go up on items like bananas. Walmart\u2019s chief financial officer John David Rainey told The Associated Press that a car seat that currently sells for $350 at Walmart will likely cost customers another $100.",
      "Rainey also told analysts at an Oppenheimer investor conference on Monday that for some items, Walmart will reduce inventory by as much as 20% because it expects higher prices will reduce demand, and it doesn\u2019t want to be stuck with leftover inventory.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump likes to say he's bringing in trillions of dollars in investments from foreign countries, but a provision in his tax cuts bill could cause international companies to avoid expanding into the United States.",
      "The House-passed version of the legislation would allow the federal government to impose taxes on foreign-parented companies and investors from countries judged as charging \u201cunfair foreign taxes\u201d on U.S. companies.",
      "Known as Section 899, the measure could cause companies to avoid investing in the the U.S. out of concern they could face steep taxes. The fate of the measure rests with the Senate \u2014 setting off a debate about its prospects and impact.",
      "A new analysis by the Global Business Alliance, a trade group representing international companies such as Toyota and Nestl\u00e9, estimates that the provision would cost the U.S. 360,000 jobs and $55 billion annually over 10 years in lost gross domestic product. The analysis estimates that the tax could cut a third off the economic growth anticipated from the overall tax cuts by Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation.",
      "\"While proponents say this punitive tax hike is intended as a retaliatory measure against foreign governments, this report confirms that the real victims are American workers in states like North Carolina, South Carolina, Indiana, Tennessee and Texas,\" said Jonathan Samford, president and CEO of the Global Business Alliance.",
      "Republican Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, has defended the provision as protecting U.S. interests by giving the president a tool that can be used against countries with tax codes that, in the federal government's opinion, put American companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\u201cIf these countries withdraw these taxes and decide to behave, we will have achieved our goal,\" Smith said in a statement last week. \"It\u2019s just common sense. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to move quickly to pass this bill and protect Americans from economic bad actors around the world.\u201d",
      "The tax gets at a fundamental tension within Trump's policy agenda: a contradiction in the broad strokes of Trump simultaneously trying to tax imports and foreign profits at higher rates while also seeking investments from companies headquartered abroad.",
      "In late May, Trump defended his approach by saying that his tariffs were causing more countries to invest in the U.S. to avoid imports getting taxed. While some countries and companies have made announcements, there is not evidence of the investments pushing up spending on new factories as measured in the government's monthly report on construction spending.",
      "The Republican president said his tendency to impose steep tariffs, then retreat to lower rates, had succeeded.",
      "\u201cWe have $14 trillion now invested, committed to investing,\u201d Trump said then. \u201cYou know we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. I went to Saudi Arabia, the king told me, he said, you got the hottest -- we have the hottest country in the world right now.\u201d",
      "The Global Business Alliance was among the groups that signed a letter on Monday warning of the consequences of Section 899 to Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo of Idaho, both Republicans.",
      "The Investment Company Institute, representing financial firms, said the provision \u201ccould limit foreign investment to the U.S. \u2014 a key driver of growth in American capital markets that ultimately benefits American families saving for their futures.\u201d",
      "The analysis performed by EY Quantitative Economics and Statistics notes there is a degree of uncertainty in how the taxes under Section 899 could be implemented. But they could be charged against companies based in countries that tax digital services, as is the case in parts of Europe.",
      "If the U.S. judged the taxes unfair, there would be a 30% tax rate on foreign companies' profits and income. People working in the U.S. for the companies who are not citizens could also be taxed, among other provisions.",
      "The possibility of the taxes and seemingly arbitrary nature by which they could be imposed is also a challenge, said Chye-Ching Huang, executive director of New York University's Tax Law Center.",
      "\u201cSection 899 creates a game of political chicken with trade partners that risks harming businesses, consumers, and workers in the hopes of securing US multinationals the ability to shift more of their profits out of the US to tax havens,\" Huang said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s a high-risk strategy that could expand the damage of the failed tariff war.\u201d",
      "There could also be political repercussions if key states in Trump's political coalition from 2024 suffer layoffs or simply find job growth slowing. The Global Business Alliance finds job losses could amount to 44,200 in Florida, 27,700 in Pennsylvania, 24,500 in North Carolina and 23,500 in Michigan.",

      "All 27 EU member countries must all agree for the sanctions to enter force.",
      "In 2023, Ukraine\u2019s Western allies limited sales of Russian oil to $60 per barrel but the price cap was largely symbolic as most of Moscow\u2019s crude \u2014 its main moneymaker \u2014 cost less than that. Still, the cap was there in case oil prices rose.",
      "Oil income is the linchpin of Russia\u2019s economy, allowing President Vladimir Putin to pour money into the armed forces while avoiding worsening inflation for everyday people and a currency collapse.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she assumed that the price cap would be discussed and agreed among the leaders of the Group of Seven major world economic powers when they meet in Canada on June 15-17.",
      "She said the United States and its G7 partners realize \u201cthat the oil price has lowered so much that the effectiveness of the cap is to be questioned, and therefore we all want to lower the oil price from $60 per barrel down to $45 per barrel.\u201d",
      "The Nord Stream gas pipelines were built to carry Russian natural gas to Germany but are not in operation. They were sabotaged in 2022, but the source of the underwater explosions has remained a major international mystery.",
      "The Commission has said that it wants to impose sanctions on the operating consortium to discourage investors from trying to use the pipelines in future.",
      "The blasts happened as Europe attempted to wean itself off Russian energy sources following the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and contributed to tensions that followed the start of the war.",
      "Von der Leyen noted on Tuesday that at the beginning of the war in 2022, \u201cRussia had 12 billion euros ($14 billion) of energy revenues from fossil fuels\" from Europe per month. \"And now we\u2019re down to 1.8 billion (euros).\u201d",
      "The new EU sanctions would also target Russia\u2019s banking sector, with the aim of limiting the Kremlin\u2019s ability to raise funds or carry out financial transactions. A further 22 Russian banks will be hit with measures, von der Leyen said.",
      "An export ban worth some 2.5 billion euros would also be imposed, and the assets frozen of more than 20 Russian and foreign companies alleged to be providing support to the Kremlin\u2019s war machine.",
      "Von der Leyen said the sanctions are aimed at forcing Russia into serious talks about peace with Ukraine. \u201cWe need a real ceasefire, and Russia has to come to the negotiating table with a serious proposal,\u201d she told reporters.",
      "The EU has imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russia since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Around 2,400 officials and \u201centities\u201d \u2013 often government agencies, banks and organizations \u2013 have been hit.",
      "It\u2019s last raft of sanctions, imposed on May 20, targeted almost 200 ships in Russia\u2019s sanction-busting shadow fleet of tankers, and tightened trade restrictions to stop produce that could be used for military purposes from reaching Russia\u2019s armed forces.",

      "The toughest test in golf is underway at the course reputed to be the toughest in America",
      "OAKMONT, Pa. -- The first shot of the 125th U.S. Open on Thursday embodied so much of what this championship is about. Matt Vogt, an Indiana dentist who went through 54 holes of qualifying, sent his tee shot soaring into the rough at Oakmont.",
      "Vogt, who once caddied at Oakmont before moving on to root canals, managed to use the severe slope of the first fairway for his ball to tumble onto the green for a par.",
      "There are high expectations everywhere at the major known as the toughest test in golf \u2014 for Scottie Scheffler, the world No. 1; for Bryson DeChambeau, the defending champion; and for everyone to face an Oakmont course reputed to be the toughest in the land.",
      "\u201cOakmont is relentless,\u201d said John Bodenhamer, the chief championships officer at the USGA who sets up the course. \u201cThere\u2019s no let up. It\u2019s a grind. That\u2019s the U.S. Open.\u201d",
      "The USGA is particularly fond of Oakmont, a big reason why the U.S. Open returns to his course for a record 10th time.",
      "It has been on the minds of all 156 players \u2014 from Scheffler and Masters champion Rory McIlroy to the 15 amateurs, and for the 16 players, like Vogt, who had to make it through 18 holes of local qualifying and then 36 holes.",
      "Zac Blair had the first birdie of this championship, holing a putt from nearly 45 feet on the 10th hole after starting his round on the back nine.",
      "Alistair Docherty suffered the first of what figures to be plenty of crashes. From just short of the 10th green, it took him two hacks to get it out of the cabbage-like rough, the second chip rolling and rolling some 12 feet by the hole.",
      "That's what Oakmont does \u2014 thick, gnarly rough and some of the fastest putting surfaces around. The USGA pointed out on the eve of the championship that only 27 of the 1,385 players who have competed in a major championship at Oakmont finished under par.",

      "\u201cWe want to finish the season in style with the cherry on the cake,\u201d coach Luis Enrique said.",
      "PSG had already qualified for the rebooted Club World Cup in the United States, but its Champions League triumph may still have come as a relief to FIFA.",
      "That's because, while the winner of the bumper tournament will officially be crowned the best club soccer team in the world, there are some notable absentees from the 32-team roster.",
      "The Club World Cup will be without the champion of the most popular league in the world \u2014 the Premier League \u2014 given Liverpool's failure to meet the qualifying criteria.",
      "The same goes for Barcelona and Napoli -- champions of Spain and Italy, respectively.",
      "No place either for current Asian champion Al-Ahli from Saudi Arabia or Pyramids \u2014 the African champion from Egypt.",
      "FIFA likely breathed a sigh of relief then when PSG and Inter Milan advanced to the final of the Champions League, with both teams having already secured their place at the Club World Cup via ranking points for recent runs in Europe's top club competition. Had either of the losing semifinalists \u2014 Barcelona or Arsenal \u2014 gone on to lift the trophy, then the flagship new tournament would have been without the reigning champion of Europe as well.",
      "The qualifying criteria were based on winners of continental trophies in the four years prior to the tournament, but not including the season directly before it.",
      "That's why Chelsea \u2014 Champions League winner in 2021 \u2014 has a seat at the table despite finishing fourth in the Premier League last month. Chelsea is arriving at the Club World Cup with a new team, coach and even owners since it won the Champions League four years ago.",
      "The club is one of 12 from Europe, including stellar names like Real Madrid, PSG, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Inter and Juventus.",
      "Some of Latin America's biggest teams are in the tournament \u2014 including reigning Copa Libertadores champion Botafogo from Brazil. Three other Brazilian teams have qualified: Palmeiras, Flamengo and Fluminense.",
      "Argentina's famous rivals River Plate and Boca Juniors will also be there \u2014 and are expected to be backed by thousands of fans traveling to the U.S.",
      "It is the Latin American contingent that likely will likely present the biggest challenge to the European teams.",
      "\u201cEveryone wants to compete \u2014 the question is how you prepare to win, to try to win. That\u2019s what challenges me,\u201d said Marcelo Gallardo, River Plate head coach. \u201cI want to win. I don\u2019t want to just go and see what happens.\u201d",
      "FIFA president Gianni Infantino believes the tournament is what the sport has been waiting for \u2014 a world championship for club soccer.",
      "\u201cFor the first time in history, the 32 best clubs in the world will compete in a tournament to determine finally who is the best club in the world,\u201d he said this week.",
      "In its previous format, which involved a mini-tournament of just seven teams instead of 32, it never fully captured global interest. Played in the middle of the season for Europe\u2019s top leagues, it had the feel of an exhibition, rather than a serious tournament. European teams dominated the modern era, winning all but one of the last 17 editions.",
      "The new format will be a much more exacting examination of the eventual winner \u2014 not least because there are so many teams from Europe, but also because there has been a marked drive to improve levels in countries like the U.S. and Saudi Arabia following a slew of star signings such as Lionel Messi, who has transformed Inter Miami.",
      "However, it remains unclear how much of an appetite there is among fans for another elite tournament in a calendar that is already saturated.",
      "Details on ticket sales have not been released, but prices have dropped as the tournament has drawn closer and seats for the opening game between Al Ahly and Inter Miami on Saturday were still available this week.",
      "Marriott Bonvoy, a U.S. Soccer Federation partner, has been offering free tickets to some of its elite members for some games.",
      "It also remains to be seen what the television viewing figures will be, with the tournament broadcast globally on streaming service DAZN, which has also made 24 matches available with English-language commentary to TNT in the U.S.",
      "Al Ahly vs. Inter Miami, June 14, Miami",
      "Five years after its MLS debut, Inter Miami \u2014 the team owned by David Beckham \u2014 will kick off in the first game of the Club World Cup. Its opponent in the opener is Egypt's Al Ahly \u2014 the winner of a record 12 African championships. It's likely to be party time at the Hard Rock Stadium, but the chance of Al Ahly spoiling Miami's big day is very real.",
      "PSG vs. Atletico Madrid, June 15, Los Angeles",
      "It will be an early test for PSG against Atletico. This is the type of match that could grace the later stages of any Champions League campaign between two of Europe's finest.",
      "Chelsea vs. LAFC, June 16, Atlanta",
      "LAFC got in through the back door via a playoff against Club America of Mexico and its reward is an opening game against two-time Champions League winner Chelsea.",
      "Real Madrid vs. Al-Hilal, June 18, Miami",
      "The anticipation around this one would have been so much more intense had Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal not released Neymar in January, but it still has other star signings like striker Aleksandar Mitrovic. Madrid has a new coach in Xabi Alonso, who can get off to a flying start by winning the world title.",
      "PSG vs. Botafogo, June 19, Los Angeles",

      "The Panthers were upbeat and relaxed at their final full practice before the potential swing game, with players downplaying the gravity of the situation.",
      "\u201cI feel like every game\u2019s so big during this time,\" center Anton Lundell said Wednesday. \u201cThe stakes gets higher. Everybody wants to win. But we both know for both teams it\u2019s a big game, and we want to be good.\u201d",
      "They were more than good in Game 3, routing the Oilers 6-1 to take control of a series that looked evenly matched after a bunch of overtime hockey and a split in Edmonton.",

That\u2019s a dangerous combination. We have to make sure that we bring our best.\u201d",

The Oilers are missing Zach Hyman because of his playoff-ending wrist injury, and fellow top-line forward Ryan Nugent-Hopkins is dealing with something that is keeping him off the ice for practices and making him a game-time decision.",

      "In a June 7 Boston Herald feature on Dobbins that ran the day before he allowed three runs and four hits in five innings of an 11-7 win over the Yankees, he said that his father, Lance Dobbins, had been drafted twice by the Yankees before being traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks. The story also makes reference to Dobbins saying his father was friends with Andy Pettitte, who played 15 major league seasons with New York.",
      "But the Post report found no evidence of any of that, citing multiple official databases and the Yankees' own records that couldn't substantiate Lance Dobbins having played with the organization. Lance Dobbins' own profile on Baseball-Reference.com doesn't list any Yankees affiliation. The 2025 Red Sox Media Guide does mention him on Hunter Dobbins' biography page, but says only that Lance \"pitched for 2 seasons (1996-97) in the Diamondbacks organization.\u201d",
      "Dobbins, who is scheduled to pitch again against the Yankees on Saturday at Fenway Park, said he has since spoken to his father \u201ca little, but not really\u201d about the Post story that first noted the discrepancies.",
      "\u201cMy whole focus is on Saturday and getting ready to face the Yankees,\" Hunter Dobbins said. \"This is my first time in the big leagues facing a team for a second time, let alone back-to-back. So that's where my focus is 100%. I imagine we'll talk in the future or something like that. But it's been a bigger deal than it ever really needed to be. But at the end of the day I really just need to get ready to go for Saturday\u201d",
      "The 25-year-old is 3-1 with a 4.20 ERA this season.",
      "He said he isn't surprised the story has gotten the attention it has in recent days.",
      "\u201cThis is a great rivalry,\" Dobbins said. \"Two cities that have a long history together. Anything that's kind of in the news that goes with both of them, that's going to turn into a story. It adds to the game and we just have to embrace it and keep rolling.\u201d",

      "Eight female athletes have filed an appeal of a landmark NCAA antitrust settlement",
      "Eight female athletes filed an appeal Wednesday of a landmark NCAA antitrust settlement, arguing that women would not receive their fair share of $2.7 billion in back pay for athletes who were barred from making money off their name, image and likeness.",
      "U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken approved the settlement last week, clearing the way for direct payments from universities to athletes and the end of the NCAA's amateurism model.",
      "The athletes who appealed the settlement competed in soccer, volleyball and track. They are Kacie Breeding of Vanderbilt; Lexi Drumm, Emma Appleman, Emmie Wannemacher, Riley Hass, Savannah Baron and Elizabeth Arnold of the College of Charleston; and Kate Johnson of Virginia. They have standing to appeal because they previously filed objections to the proposed settlement.",
      "Ashlyn Hare, one of the attorneys representing the athletes, said in a statement that the settlement violates Title IX, the federal law that bans sex-based discrimination in education.",
      "\u201cWe support a settlement of the case, but not an inaccurate one that violates federal law. The calculation of past damages is based on an error that ignores Title IX and deprives female athletes of $1.1 billion,\u201d Hare said. \u201cPaying out the money as proposed would be a massive error that would cause irreparable harm to women\u2019s sports.\u201d",
      "The law firm representing the plaintiffs in the settlement issued a statement saying the appeal would delay payments to hundreds of thousands of athletes by a minimum of several months.",
      "\u201cThese attorneys are pursuing an appeal based on a Title IX issue that Judge Wilken already disposed of correctly, quickly and multiple times,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The House settlement figures to financially benefit football and basketball stars at the biggest schools, who are likely to receive a big chunk of the $20.5 million per year that colleges are permitted to share with athletes over the next year. Some athletes in other sports that don't make money for their schools could lose their partial scholarships or see their roster spots cut.",
      "\u201cThis is a football and basketball damages settlement with no real benefit to female athletes,\u201d Hare said. \u201cCongress has expressly rejected efforts to exempt revenue-generating sports like football and basketball from Title IX\u2019s antidiscrimination mandate. The NCAA agreed with us. Our argument on appeal is the exact same argument the conferences and NCAA made prior to settling the case.\u201d",
      "The appeal was filed by the law firm Hutchinson Black and Cook of Boulder, Colorado, and was first reported by Front Office Sports. It would be heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.",

      "Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey, who share the American goals record with 57 each, are among those who have been critical of current regulars not in the struggling roster preparing for the CONCACAF Gold Cup.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about that internally as a group,\" Adams said Wednesday during a Zoom interview with The Associated Press. \"The noise on the outside is the noise on the outside. I think we need to focus on what we need to do as a group and continue to build.\u201d",
      "Star Christian Pulisic is skipping the June camp and Gold Cup to rest after playing about 120 games for club and country over two seasons.",
      "\u201cWhether it was Gold Cup, whether it was Copa (Am\u00e9rica), whether it was Confederations Cup, whether it was the World Cup, I wasn\u2019t going to miss competitions,\u201d Dempsey said last week on the \u201cMen in Blazers\u201d podcast. \u201cFor me, I don\u2019t understand it because that wasn\u2019t my mentality. I always wanted to play in those games.\u201d",
      "Watching Portugal celebrate its win over Spain in Sunday\u2019s European Nations League final, Donovan said on the Fox postgame show: \u201cI can\u2019t help but think about our guys on vacation not wanting to play in Gold Cup.\u201d",
      "Pulisic has not spoken publicly of his decision.",
      "The U.S. has lost four straight games, its longest skid since 2007, following a 4-0 rout Tuesday night by Switzerland.",
      "\u201cThis is part of the process,\u201d Adams said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to win games. You\u2019re going to lose games. It\u2019s about continuing to build that. I think we\u2019re on the right path. We have to continue to build and try the things that we\u2019ve been training. It\u2019ll take a little bit of time, but it will come together.\u201d",
      "Adams didn't dress for the Switzerland friendly but is confident he will be ready for the Gold Cup, where the Americans open Sunday against Trinidad and Tobago.",
      "\u201cA little turf toe-type injury. More of an overuse thing probably than anything \u2014 overload. It was something that I picked up when I came into camp,\u201d Adams said. \u201cProgressing well right now, but just trying to be smart and manage it.\u201d",
      "Adams, who captained the U.S. at the 2022 World Cup, funded a pair of mini-pitches at Pulaski Park in Poughkeepsie, New York, near his home in Wappinger. He spoke on the Zoom about his work with Allstate, the U.S. Soccer Foundation and Black Star Soccer to construct fields about the size of basketball courts at the Fisher Magnet Upper Academy in Detroit and The Bell Avenue School in Yeadon, Pennsylvania.",
      "\u201cBefore the World Cup hopefully we plan to do one more with a city unnamed yet,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I think has real impact, continues to grow the sport, serves underserved communities.\u201d",
      "Now 26, Adams is feeling back to his old self. He had back surgery last July with Dr. Robert Watkins and returned to the field with England's Bournemouth on Oct. 26. Adams played in 28 Premier League matches this season after being limited to three in 2023-24 because of leg injuries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely enjoyable when you\u2019re healthy,\u201d he said. \"The 16-to-18 months that it was just on and off inconsistency is something I never had in my career and never had to battle. And then when it hits you and you go through that, you just learn different ways to navigate things, enjoy life, just not take things for granted, all the little things.\"",
      "Since Mauricio Pochettino took over as U.S. coach last fall, players have had more autonomy to break away from rigid positioning employed by his predecessor, Gregg Berhalter.",
      "\u201cFrom a positional standpoint, obviously we had probably a little bit of a different structure under Gregg,\u201d Adams said. \u201cMaurizio gives the players freedom to find spots they\u2019re comfortable in and see how they can affect the game in different ways. I think our attacking players definitely have freedom to try and find the ball and create things in the right areas of the field. So, yeah, I think he gives everyone freedom, but there\u2019s still structure to the way that we want to play.\u201d",
      "Adams will be with the U.S. team in Austin, Texas, next Wednesday, and following intently when the Premier League releases its 2025-26 schedule at 3 a.m. CDT. He feels improved because of his time with Leeds in 2022-23 and Bournemouth the past two seasons.",
      "\u201cAfter you play in the Premier League, every game feels slow,'\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter what game I play in now the game feels slow. You look at your schedule when the season comes out and you have to play in a row Arsenal, Tottenham, Man City, Liverpool, Manchester United, all these big games back to back to back you just learn how to make decisions quicker and if you don\u2019t, you get punished.\"",

      "A salvage company plans to lift the luxury yacht Bayesian in late June from the Sicilian seabed where it sank last summer, killing seven people",
      "MILAN -- A salvage company expects to lift the wreck of the luxury Bayesian yacht in late June from the seafloor off Sicily where it sank last summer, killing seven people, according to a recovery plan agreed with Italian maritime and investigating authorities, the TMC salvage company said Wednesday.",
      "Salvage teams in the past week have recovered 17 pieces of suspected Bayesian debris from the sea floor identified using a remote-controlled submersible. They have been transferred to shore in Termini Imerese as part of the investigation.",
      "The British-flagged superyacht sank in August, killing U.K. tech magnate Mike Lynch, his daughter and five others.",
      "Several days before the 56-meter (183-foot) long 473-ton yacht is lifted to the surface, crews will use precision tools to remove the 72-meter mast. After that, the Bayesian will be set upright and then gradually lifted to the surface with eight main steel lifting strops that will be installed under the hull. The whole process is expected to take several days.",
      "Marine salvage experts began the operation in early May to recover the superyacht, which is on the seafloor at a depth of about 49 meters (160 feet.) The operation was temporarily halted after a diver\u2019s death a few days later, and the new recovery plan was approved on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe salvage teams will now hopefully be able to make more systematic progress in preparations for the ultimate safe recovery of Bayesian, whilst ensuring the safety of those working on this very complex lifting and recovery operation,\u2019\u2019 said Marcus Cave, a TMC Marine director.",
      "British investigators in an interim report issued last month said that the yacht was knocked over by \u201cextreme wind\u201d and couldn\u2019t recover. The report stated that the Bayesian had chosen the site where it sank as shelter from forecast thunderstorms. Wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph.) at the time of the sinking at 4:06 a.m. on Aug. 19 and \u201cviolently\u201d knocked the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds.",
      "Italian authorities are conducting a full criminal investigation.",
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Lynch, 59, and his daughter Hannah, 18, were among the dead when the Bayesian sank. The boat trip was a celebration of Lynch\u2019s acquittal in a fraud case in the U.S. in June. Fifteen people survived the accident.",

      "Pavel appointed Eva Decroix after her predecessor Pavel Bla\u017eek resigned from the post on May 30. He was under fire from the opposition because his ministry accepted a donation of bitcoins and sold them for almost 1 billion Czech koruna ($46 million) earlier this year.",
      "Bla\u017eek said that he wasn\u2019t aware of any wrongdoing, but didn\u2019t want the four-party coalition government led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala to be harmed by the scandal. Fiala said that he appreciated his resignation and believed that Bla\u017eek acted with goodwill.",
      "Bla\u017eek was a close ally of Fiala in the government and also in his conservative Civic Democratic Party. The new minister is from the same party.",
      "Decroix said she will order an independent probe into the ministry\u2019s activities in the case.",
      "\u201cThe public trust in the institutions and the state is at stake,\u201d Pavel said.",
      "The issue focused on the fact that the bitcoins were donated to the ministry by a person who was previously convicted of drug dealing and other crimes while it was not clear why he did it.",
      "The opposition has accused Bla\u017eek of possible money laundering, because it wasn\u2019t clear where the bitcoins originated.",
      "The opposition parties demand the resignation of the entire government and are planning to request a parliamentary no-confidence vote. It could take place later in June.",
      "The issue has been investigated by the national police's organized crime unit.",
      "The scandal is taking place just months before the Oct 3-4 parliamentary election. The main opposition ANO (YES) party led by former populist Prime Minister Andrej Babi\u0161 is predicted to win the vote.",

      "Satellite photos show emperor penguins in one region of Antarctica declined 22% in the past 15 years",
      "WASHINGTON -- The population of emperor penguins in one part of Antarctica appears to be declining faster than previously thought, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery released Tuesday.",
      "The estimated population of 16 penguin colonies \u2014 visible in satellite photos taken between 2009 and 2024 \u2013 had declined 22% during that period mainly because of climate change that's shrinking the amount of available sea ice. It's unclear whether this drop is seen across the continent, scientists said.",
      "\u201cSea ice is very important for the penguins because they breed on sea ice and forage on sea ice,\u201d said Peter Fretwell with British Antarctic Survey, who helped analyze the data.",
      "Scientists previously estimated that the total emperor penguin population declined about 10% across all of Antarctica over the past decade and a half. The latest survey included a region covering the Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea and Bellingshausen Sea.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely alarming that the numbers are so much worse than predicted,\u201d said Daniel Zitterbart, a penguin researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "There are uncertainties in the latest estimate. The analysis relies on a calculation of how densely the penguins are clustered in each area where they're detected in a single satellite photo taken each year.",
      "The colonies studied represent about 30% of the total emperor penguin population, which lives only in Antarctica. The loss of stable sea ice may be affecting the penguins in ways beyond shrinking their breeding grounds.",
      "\u201cMore predators like leopard seals and orcas may be able to come in closer to the colonies if sea ice breaks up earlier in the year,\u201d said Fretwell.",
      "Warming ocean temperatures and changing rainfall patterns may also impact the survival of penguin chicks, he added.",

      "The red fox is such a fixture of life in London that it has its own ambulance service",
      "PADDOCK WOOD, England -- The injured fox is cornered in a cage, teeth bared and snarling at the woman trying to help it.",
      "Nicki Townsend is unfazed. Wearing only rubber gloves and an outfit suitable for a yoga class, she approaches with soothing words. \u201cAll right, baby,\" she coos as she deftly drapes a towel over his head, grabs him by the scruff of his neck, scoops up his wounded legs and moves him to a clean cage.",
      "It\u2019s not the way her day typically begins, but there\u2019s nothing routine about rescuing foxes.",
      "\u201cYou can never predict what you\u2019re going to arrive at,\u201d Townsend said.",
      "While not as visible as phone boxes or double-decker buses, the red fox is a fixture in London, a city not known for its wildlife. But living on the streets, alleys and back gardens of a dense urban environment can be rough and when foxes need help, they have their own ambulance service \u2014 and Townsend may be on her way.",
      "The foxes didn't invade London so much as adapt and expand their range inward as the city spread to their habitat in the 1930s and suburbs grew.",
      "But people and the bushy-tailed member of the canine family have not always lived in harmony, and the species has admirers and adversaries.",
      "For everyone enchanted seeing a fox trotting nonchalantly down their street at dusk or basking in a sunny backyard, there are plenty who see them as pests. They poop where they like, tear into garbage and the vixens in heat let out terrifying shrieks in the dead of winter when attracting a mate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like Marmite with foxes,\u201d Townsend said, referring to the food spread that is an acquired and divisive taste. \u201cYou either love them or hate them.\u201d",
      "The divide between the two camps led Trevor Williams to found what became The Fox Project nearly 35 years ago.",
      "Once a bass player in the rock group Audience that opened for Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, Williams had been active in the campaign to stop fox hunting when he redirected his protection efforts to the city, where foxes were once routinely killed.",
      "\u201cBecause of the myths that have occurred over the years, there\u2019s still a lot of suspicion about what foxes might be,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou know, they\u2019re going to bite the baby, they\u2019re going to eat the cat, they\u2019re going to run away with your husband.\u201d",
      "The project has since grown from providing information on deterring foxes to rescuing 1,400 a year, including 400 cubs, though only about half survive to be released.",
      "There are estimated to be 15,000 foxes in London. The project covers a swath of south London and its leafy suburbs while other organizations not devoted solely to foxes handle other parts of the city.",
      "While the omnivores survive on small animals, bugs and berries in the wild, they favor easily scavenged leftovers in the city and handouts that make them more dependent on humans.",
      "Their main urban menaces are cars, getting snagged in soccer nets or getting stuck in tight spaces. In their effort to get free, they often get nasty abrasions that can become infected. Many also suffer from mange, a parasitic infestation that leads to all kinds of problems.",
      "Townsend pilots her VW Caddy on city streets, highways and narrow lanes that roll through lush hills, responding to calls about injured or ill foxes or cubs that have lost their mothers.",
      "She's seen a bit of everything since her first humbling call 2 1/2 years ago when the supposedly injured fox bolted.",
      "\u201cIn my inexperience, I chased after him, which is comical because you\u2019re never going to outrun a fox,\u201d she said. \u201cI just remember he ran very fast and I looked silly running after him.\u201d",
      "Despite many challenging situations \u2014 she once managed to rescue a fox that lost its footing atop a fence and ended upside down at eye level with its paw lodged between boards \u2014 she's only been bitten once.",
      "Her van carries the distinctly musky scent of foxes. The odor becomes unpleasant when an anxious passenger in a litter of cubs relieves itself enroute to being delivered to a foster care pen where they will stay until being released in the wild.",
      "\u201cFeel free to open the window,\u201d said Townsend, who is accustomed to the stench. \u201cThis is a stinky job.\"",
      "On a recent day, she was dispatched to meet a heartbroken couple who found a cub with a puncture wound collapsed on their back lawn.",
      "\u201cWe thought he was asleep at first, so we went to go and have a close look because we love them,\" Charlotte English said. \u201cThen he just didn\u2019t move, so we knew something was wrong.\u201d",
      "That cub had to be put to sleep, as did the adult Townsend transferred at the start of her shift.",
      "Cubs that recover are socialized in packs of five until they mature and are then released in a rural location while the adults are freed in the neighborhoods where they were found.",
      "Given a second chance, it's not clear how well the foxes fare, because they are rarely tracked. A 2016 study in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science found that rehabilitated foxes were more likely to behave as if they had been displaced when returned to their original territory. They were tracked wandering farther away, potentially exposing them to more traffic and greater stress.",
      "\u201cIt is a gap in the knowledge and there\u2019s an assumption that when you release them, they thrive and I think that that assumption needs to be challenged more,\u201d said Bryony Tolhurst, a University of Brighton honorary research fellow and lead author of the study.",
      "For Townsend, fox deaths are offset by the joy of seeing little ones venture into the unknown or an adult darting into a neighborhood it instantly recognizes.",
      "\u201cSometimes they look back and people like to romanticize that they\u2019re saying \u2018thank you,'\" she said. \"They\u2019re just making sure we\u2019re not chasing after them.\u201d",

      "Financial aid fraud is exploding, thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence",
      "It was an unusual question coming from a police officer. Heather Brady was napping at home in San Francisco on a Sunday afternoon when the officer knocked on her door to ask: Had she applied to Arizona Western College?",
      "She had not, and as the officer suspected, somebody else had applied to Arizona community colleges in her name to scam the government into paying out financial aid money.",
      "When she checked her student loan servicer account, Brady saw the scammers hadn't stopped there. A loan for over $9,000 had been paid out in her name \u2014 but to another person \u2014 for coursework at a California college.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine how many people this is happening to that have no idea,\u201d Brady said.",
      "The rise of artificial intelligence and the popularity of online classes have led to an explosion of financial aid fraud. Fake college enrollments have been surging as crime rings deploy \u201cghost students\u201d \u2014 chatbots that join online classrooms and stay just long enough to collect a financial aid check.",
      "In some cases, professors discover almost no one in their class is real. Students get locked out of the classes they need to graduate as bots push courses over their enrollment limits. And victims of identity theft who discover loans fraudulently taken out in their names must go through months of calling colleges, the Federal Student Aid office and loan servicers to try to get the debt erased.",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Education Department introduced a temporary rule requiring students to show colleges a government-issued ID to prove their identity. It will apply only to first-time applicants for federal student aid for the summer term, affecting some 125,000 borrowers. The agency said it is developing more advanced screening for the fall.",
      "\u201cThe rate of fraud through stolen identities has reached a level that imperils the federal student aid program,\u201d the department said in its guidance to colleges.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of fraud reports obtained through a public records request shows California colleges in 2024 reported 1.2 million fraudulent applications, which resulted in 223,000 suspected fake enrollments. Other states are affected by the same problem, but with 116 community colleges, California is a particularly large target.",
      "Criminals stole at least $11.1 million in federal, state and local financial aid from California community colleges last year that could not be recovered, according to the reports.",
      "Colleges typically receive a portion of the loans intended for tuition, with the balance going directly to students for other expenses. Community colleges are targeted in part because their lower tuition means larger percentages of grants and loans go to borrowers.",
      "Scammers frequently use AI chatbots to carry out the fraud, targeting courses that are online and allow students to watch lectures and complete coursework on their own time.",
      "In January, Wayne Chaw started getting emails about a class he never signed up for at De Anza Community College, where he had taken coding classes a decade earlier. Identity thieves had obtained his Social Security number and collected $1,395 in financial aid in his name.",
      "The energy management class required students to submit a homework assignment to prove they were real. But someone wrote submissions impersonating Chaw, likely using a chatbot.",
      "\u201cThis person is typing as me, saying my first and last name. ... It\u2019s very freaky when I saw that,\u201d said Chaw.",
      "The fraud involved a grant, not loans, so Chaw himself did not lose money. He called the Social Security Administration to report the identity theft, but after five hours on hold, he never got through to a person.",
      "As the Trump administration moves to dismantle the Education Department, federal cuts may make it harder to catch criminals and help victims of identity theft. In March, the Trump administration fired more than 300 people from the Federal Student Aid office, and the department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, which investigates fraud, has lost more than 20% of its staff through attrition and retirements since October.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just nervous that I\u2019m going to be stuck with this,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThe agency is going to be so broken down and disintegrated that I won\u2019t be able to do anything, and I\u2019m just going to be stuck with those $9,000\u201d in loans.",
      "Criminal cases around the country offer a glimpse of the schemes' pervasiveness.",
      "In the past year, investigators indicted a man accused of leading a Texas fraud ring that used stolen identities to pursue $1.5 million in student aid. Another person in Texas pleaded guilty to using the names of prison inmates to apply for over $650,000 in student aid at colleges across the South and Southwest. And a person in New York recently pleaded guilty to a $450,000 student aid scam that lasted a decade.",
      "Brittnee Nelson of Shreveport, Louisiana, was bringing her daughter to day care two years ago when she received a notification that her credit score had dropped 27 points.",
      "Loans had been taken out in her name for colleges in California and Louisiana, she discovered. She canceled one before it was paid out, but it was too late to stop a loan of over $5,000 for Delgado Community College in New Orleans.",
      "Nelson runs her own housecleaning business and didn\u2019t go to college. She already was signed up for identity theft protection and carefully monitored her credit. Still, her debt almost went into collections before the loan was put in forbearance. She recently got the loans taken off her record after two years of effort.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like if someone came into your house and robbed you,\u201d she said.",
      "The federal government's efforts to verify borrowers' identity could help, she said.",
      "\u201cIf they can make these hurdles a little bit harder and have these verifications more provable, I think that\u2019s really, really, really going to protect people in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Delgado spokesperson Barbara Waiters said responsibility for approving loans ultimately lies with federal agencies.",
      "\u201cThis is an unfortunate and serious matter, but it is not the direct or indirect result of Delgado\u2019s internal processes,\u201d Waiters said.",
      "In San Francisco, the loans taken out in Brady's name are in a grace period, but still on the books. That has not been her only challenge. A few months ago, she was laid off from her job and decided to sign up for a class at City College San Francisco to help her career. But all the classes were full.",
      "After a few weeks, Brady finally was able to sign up for a class. The professor apologized for the delay in spots opening up: The college has been struggling with fraudulent applications.",

      "Now called Strategy, the software company first started buying bitcoin in 2020 with reserve cash. Now, its software business is a small part of a perpetual bitcoin-buying machine that uses a variety of strategies \u2013 like selling shares or issuing debt \u2013 to keep growing its bitcoin holdings.",

      "Geoff Kendrick, the bank\u2019s head of digital assets research, said in the report that restrictions on investors buying bitcoin directly help explain the popularity of bitcoin treasury companies, as their stocks can serve as bitcoin proxies. But as crypto becomes more mainstream, the case for investing in bitcoin treasury companies becomes weaker, Kendrick said.",
      "He added that bitcoin\u2019s volatility could force some newer bitcoin treasury companies to sell their holdings to satisfy their debts if it falls under the purchase price.",

      "Nintendo's Switch 2 video-game console is out, and it makes some substantial improvements over its predecessor",
      "WASHINGTON -- I'm cruising around Bowser's Castle with my old pal Toad. It's not exactly relaxing, what with all the lava pits and banana peels and turtle shells littering the road. Add 23 other characters \u2014 is that a cow driving? \u2014 who are trying to get to the finish line first, and it's chaos.",
      "The hectic, high-speed insanity of any race in the new Mario Kart World would have caused the eight-year-old Switch console to wheeze a bit. And that's why we've got the Switch 2 ($449.99), the souped-up sequel to Nintendo's popular home-and-portable hybrid.",
      "It looks prettier, too. The 7.9-inch portable display (up from 6.2 inches) boosts the resolution to 1020p (from 720p), and while the LCD screen isn't quite as sharp as an OLED screen might have been, it's much cleaner than the original recipe Switch. It looks even better when connected to an HDTV since it now supports 4K and HDR.",
      "Nintendo has always stood apart from the technological arms race that fans of Sony\u2019s PlayStation and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox obsess over, insisting that first-rate games don\u2019t necessarily depend on high-powered computer chips. But you could feel the strain in 2023\u2019s The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, with its at-times blurry graphics and sluggish framerate. The Switch 2, with a faster framerate of 120 fps, corrects much of the fuzziness.",
      "That's not to say it comes close to matching the high-definition performance of the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox X/S. If you're expecting the jaw-dropping graphics of, say, Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows ... well, no.",
      "There is good news for those of us who have gotten weary of the old Switch's dinky 32 gigabytes of internal storage. The Switch 2 multiplies that by eight, for 256 GB. Of course, flashier games take up more space, so if you want more room you'll have to invest in a microSD Express card \u2014 which is a bit pricier than the standard memory card used in most portable devices.",
      "The Switch 2's Joy-Con controllers have undergone some tinkering. As before, you can attach them to the sides of the screen if you're playing on the go. If you're at home, you can attach them to a doohickey that feels more like a traditional joystick. Either way, they're now more firmly connected with magnets, which provide a satisfying snap.",
      "Both the left and right Joy-Cons now include an optical mouse, which you can use by placing the controller on its edge and rolling it around on a table. (Nintendo says you can also use it on your pants, but I prefer using a clipboard on my lap.) It remains to be seen how many Switch 2 games will call for a mouse, but 2K's port of Sid Meier's Civilization VII seems like a good candidate.",
      "And then there's a new button labeled \u201cC\u201d on the right-hand Joy-Con. That calls up GameChat, which lets you start up a conversation with other players \u2014 provided you've all taken the time to register yourselves as friends. (Eventually, you'll also need to subscribe to the Nintendo Switch Online service, but that requirement doesn't kick in until March 31, 2026.) The microphone is built into the Switch 2, though if you want to upgrade to video chat, you'll need to buy a separate Nintendo camera.",
      "Finally, there\u2019s GameShare, which lets you play selected titles with other Switch users even if they don\u2019t own the software.",
      "Nintendo has been emphasizing the new social features in its marketing, though it feels like it's catching up to the competition. The kids I know who play Fortnite or Minecraft on competing consoles seem to have figured out long ago how to chat with their pals. Welcome to the 2010s?",
      "As with any console launch, the driving question is: Does it have the games?",
      "There are just a couple of Switch 2 exclusives out now: Mario Kart World and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a $10 demo package that really should have been free. There are some new-to-Nintendo ports of excellent titles like Split Fiction and Cyberpunk 2077. You can get upgrades of classics like the last two Legend of Zelda adventures. And the Switch 2 is fully backward-compatible, so you can play everything that came out for the Switch as well as a substantial library of older titles.",
      "There\u2019s no other machine that will let you play future installments of beloved franchises like Zelda, Super Mario Bros., Super Smash Bros. and Animal Crossing. None of those have been announced yet, but some marquee names \u2014 Donkey Kong and Kirby \u2014 will star in Switch 2 exclusives later this year.",
      "There\u2019s plenty of competition out there, though, and not just in the TV-connected console market Switch shares with the PlayStation and the Xbox. Nintendo no longer has the portable market to itself, thanks to Valve\u2019s SteamDeck. Some models of that device cost less than the Switch 2, and it already has a huge library of PC games. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced over the weekend that it's teaming up with Asus on the ROG Xbox Ally, a handheld that will be out before Christmas.",
      "Honestly, we\u2019ll probably have a better idea of the Switch\u2019s quality a few years down the line, after developers get a handle on what the new hardware can do. If you\u2019re dying to get back behind the wheel with Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach right now, though, you know what you need to do.",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "A previous version of this story was corrected to say that the Switch 2 social options can be used without a subscription until March 31, 2026.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Amazon said Monday that it will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, including one it is building alongside a nuclear power plant that has drawn federal scrutiny over an arrangement to essentially plug right into the power plant.",
      "Kevin Miller, vice president of global data centers at Amazon\u2019s cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, told The Associated Press that the company will build another data center complex just north of Philadelphia.",
      "One data center is being built next to northeastern Pennsylvania's Susquehanna nuclear power plant. The other will be in Fairless Hills at a logistics campus, the Keystone Trade Center, on what was once a U.S. Steel mill.",
      "In a statement, Gov. Josh Shapiro called it the largest capital investment in Pennsylvania's history.",
      "The announcements add to the billions of dollars in Big Tech's data center cash already flowing into the state.",
      "Since 2024 started, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina as it ramps up its investment in infrastructure to compete with other tech giants to meet growing demand for artificial intelligence products.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "The majority owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant, Talen Energy, announced last year that it had sold its data center to Amazon for $650 million in a deal to eventually provide 960 megawatts. That's 40% of the output of one of the nation's largest nuclear power plants, or enough to power more than a half-million homes.",
      "However, the arrangement between Talen and Amazon \u2014 called a \u201cbehind the meter\u201d connection \u2014 has been held up by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the first such case to come before the agency.",
      "It has raised questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it\u2019s fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid.",
      "For Big Tech, plugging energy-hungry data centers directly into a power plant can take years off their development timelines and is a much faster route to procuring power than having to connect to the congested electricity grid.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on a procedural grounds, will decide the matter, leaving in limbo regulatory treatment of the deal and others that likely would follow.",
      "Already in Pennsylvania, Microsoft announced a deal with the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to restart the reactor under a 20-year agreement to supply its data centers in four states with energy.",
      "Meanwhile, the owners of what was once Pennsylvania\u2019s biggest coal-fired power plant say they will turn it into a $10 billion natural gas-powered data center campus.",

      "LONDON -- Getty Images is facing off against artificial intelligence company Stability AI in a London courtroom for the first major copyright trial of the generative AI industry.",
      "Opening arguments before a judge at the British High Court are scheduled for Monday. The trial could last for three weeks.",
      "Stability, based in London, owns a widely used AI image-making tool that sparked enthusiasm for the instant creation of AI artwork and photorealistic images upon its release in August 2022. OpenAI introduced its surprise hit chatbot ChatGPT three months later.",
      "Seattle-based Getty has argued that the development of the AI image maker, called Stable Diffusion, involved \u201cbrazen infringement\u201d of Getty\u2019s photography collection \u201con a staggering scale.\"",
      "Tech companies have long argued that \u201cfair use\u201d or \u201cfair dealing\u201d legal doctrines in the United States and United Kingdom allow them to train their AI systems on large troves of writings or images. Getty was among the first to challenge those practices when it filed copyright infringement lawsuits in the United States and the United Kingdom in early 2023.",
      "\u201cWhat Stability did was inappropriate,\u201d Getty CEO Craig Peters told The Associated Press in 2023. He said creators of intellectual property should be asked for permission before their works are fed into AI systems rather than having to participate in an \u201copt-out regime.\"",
      "Stability has argued that the case doesn't belong in the United Kingdom because the training of the AI model technically happened elsewhere, on computers run by U.S. tech giant Amazon.",
      "Similar cases in the U.S. have not yet gone to trial.",
      "Stable Diffusion\u2019s roots trace to Germany, where computer scientists at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich worked with the New York-based tech company Runway to develop the original algorithms. The university researchers credited Stability AI for providing the servers that trained the models, which require large amounts of computing power.",

      "After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech\u2019s pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple tried to regain its footing Monday during a developers conference that focused mostly on incremental advances and cosmetic changes in it...",
      "CUPERTINO, Calif. -- After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech\u2019s pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple tried to regain its footing Monday during an annual developers conference that focused mostly on incremental advances and cosmetic changes in its technology.",
      "The presummer rite, which attracted thousands of developers from nearly 60 countries to Apple's Silicon Valley headquarters, subdued compared with the feverish anticipation that surrounded the event in the last two years.",
      "Apple highlighted plans for more AI tools designed to simplify people's lives and make its products even more intuitive. It also provided an early glimpse at the biggest redesign of its iPhone software in a decade. In doing so, Apple executives refrained from issuing bold promises of breakthroughs that punctuated recent conferences, prompting CFRA analyst Angelo Zino to deride the event as a \u201cdud\u201d in a research note.",
      "In 2023, Apple unveiled a mixed-reality headset that has been little more than a niche product, and last year WWDC trumpeted its first major foray into the AI craze with an array of new features highlighted by the promise of a smarter and more versatile version of its virtual assistant, Siri \u2014 a goal that has yet to be realized.",
      "\u201cThis work needed more time to reach our high-quality bar,\u201d Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s top software executive, said Monday at the outset of the conference. The company didn't provide a precise timetable for when Siri's AI upgrade will be finished but indicated it won't happen until next year at the earliest.",
      "\"The silence surrounding Siri was deafening,\" said Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee said. \u201cNo amount of text corrections or cute emojis can fill the yawning void of an intuitive, interactive AI experience that we know Siri will be capable of when ready. We just don\u2019t know when that will happen. The end of the Siri runway is coming up fast, and Apple needs to lift off.\u201d",
      "The showcase unfolded amid nagging questions about whether Apple has lost some of the mystique and innovative drive that has made it a tech trendsetter during its nearly 50-year history.",
      "Instead of making a big splash as it did with the Vision Pro headset and its AI suite, Apple took a mostly low-key approach that emphasized its effort to spruce up the look of its software with a new design called \u201cLiquid Glass\" while also unveiling a new hub for its video games and new features like a \u201cWorkout Buddy\u201d to help manage physical fitness.",
      "Apple executives promised to make its software more compatible with the increasingly sophisticated computer chips that have been powering its products while also making it easier to toggle between the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.",
      "\u201cOur product experience has become even more seamless and enjoyable,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told the crowd as the 90-minute showcase wrapped up.",
      "IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo said Apple seemed to be largely using Monday's conference to demonstrate the company still has a blueprint for success in AI, even if it's going to take longer to realize the vision that was presented a year ago.",
      "\u201cThis year\u2019s event was not about disruptive innovation, but rather careful calibration, platform refinement and developer enablement \u2014positioning itself for future moves rather than unveiling game-changing technologies,\u201d Jeronimo said.",
      "Besides redesigning its software. Apple will switch to a method that automakers have used to telegraph their latest car models by linking them to the year after they first arrive at dealerships. That means the next version of the iPhone operating system due out this autumn will be known as iOS 26 instead of iOS 19 \u2014 as it would be under the previous naming approach that has been used since the device's 2007 debut.",
      "The iOS 26 upgrade is expected to be released in September around the same time Apple traditionally rolls out the next iPhone models.",
      "Apple opened the proceedings with a short video clip featuring Federighi speeding around a track in a Formula 1 race car. Although it was meant to promote the June 27 release of the Apple film, \u201cF1\u201d starring Brad Pitt, the segment could also be viewed as an unintentional analogy to the company's attempt to catch up to the rest of the pack in AI technology.",
      "While some of the new AI tricks compatible with the latest iPhones began rolling out late last year as part of free software updates, the delays in a souped-up Siri became so glaring that the chastened company stopped promoting it in its marketing campaigns earlier this year.",
      "While Apple has been struggling to make AI that meets its standards, the gap separating it from other tech powerhouses is widening. Google keeps packing more AI into its Pixel smartphone lineup while introducing more of the technology into its search engine to dramatically change the way it works. Samsung, Apple's biggest smartphone rival, is also leaning heavily into AI. Meanwhile, ChatGPT recently struck a deal that will bring former Apple design guru Jony Ive into the fold to work on a new device expected to compete against the iPhone.",
      "Besides grappling with innovation challenges, Apple also faces regulatory threats that could siphon away billions of dollars in revenue that help finance its research and development. A federal judge is currently weighing whether proposed countermeasures to Google's illegal monopoly in search should include a ban on long-running deals worth $20 billion annually to Apple while another federal judge recently banned the company from collecting commissions on in-app transactions processed outside its once-exclusive payment system.",
      "On top of all that, Apple has been caught in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump's trade war with China, a key manufacturing hub for the Cupertino, California, company. Cook successfully persuaded Trump to exempt the iPhone from tariffs during the president's first administration, but he has had less success during Trump's second term, which seems more determined to prod Apple to make its products in the U.S.",
      "The multidimensional gauntlet facing Apple is spooking investors, causing the company's stock price to plunge by 20% so far this year \u2014 a decline that has erased about $750 billion in shareholder wealth. After beginning the year as the most valuable company in the world, Apple now ranks third behind longtime rival Microsoft, another AI leader, and AI chipmaker Nvidia.",
      "Apple's shares closed down by more than 1% on Monday \u2014 an early indication the company's latest announcements didn't inspire investors.",

      "The crashes, which began late last year and carried into 2025, were the tipoff to a sophisticated cyberattack that may have allowed hackers to infiltrate a phone without a single click from the user.",
      "The attackers left no clues about their identities, but investigators at the cybersecurity firm iVerify noticed that the victims all had something in common: They worked in fields of interest to China's government and had been targeted by Chinese hackers in the past.",
      "Foreign hackers have increasingly identified smartphones, other mobile devices and the apps they use as a weak link in U.S. cyberdefenses. Groups linked to China's military and intelligence service have targeted the smartphones of prominent Americans and burrowed deep into telecommunication networks, according to national security and tech experts.",
      "It shows how vulnerable mobile devices and apps are and the risk that security failures could expose sensitive information or leave American interests open to cyberattack, those experts say.",
      "\u201cThe world is in a mobile security crisis right now,\u201d said Rocky Cole, a former cybersecurity expert at the National Security Agency and Google and now chief operations officer at iVerify. \u201cNo one is watching the phones.\u201d",

      "\u201cThey were able to listen in on phone calls in real time and able to read text messages,\u201d said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois. He is a member of the House Intelligence Committee and the senior Democrat on the Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, created to study the geopolitical threat from China.",
      "Chinese hackers also sought access to phones used by Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance during the 2024 campaign.",
      "The Chinese government has denied allegations of cyberespionage, and accused the U.S. of mounting its own cyberoperations. It says America cites national security as an excuse to issue sanctions against Chinese organizations and keep Chinese technology companies from the global market.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. has long been using all kinds of despicable methods to steal other countries\u2019 secrets,\u201d Lin Jian, a spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, said at a recent press conference in response to questions about a CIA push to recruit Chinese informants.",
      "U.S. intelligence officials have said China poses a significant, persistent threat to U.S. economic and political interests, and it has harnessed the tools of digital conflict: online propaganda and disinformation, artificial intelligence and cyber surveillance and espionage designed to deliver a significant advantage in any military conflict.",
      "Mobile networks are a top concern. The U.S. and many of its closest allies have banned Chinese telecom companies from their networks. Other countries, including Germany, are phasing out Chinese involvement because of security concerns. But Chinese tech firms remain a big part of the systems in many nations, giving state-controlled companies a global footprint they could exploit for cyberattacks, experts say.",
      "Chinese telecom firms still maintain some routing and cloud storage systems in the U.S. \u2014 a growing concern to lawmakers.",
      "\u201cThe American people deserve to know if Beijing is quietly using state-owned firms to infiltrate our critical infrastructure,\u201d U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich. and chairman of the China committee, which in April issued subpoenas to Chinese telecom companies seeking information about their U.S. operations.",
      "Mobile devices can buy stocks, launch drones and run power plants. Their proliferation has often outpaced their security.",
      "The phones of top government officials are especially valuable, containing sensitive government information, passwords and an insider's glimpse into policy discussions and decision-making.",
      "The White House said last week that someone impersonating Susie Wiles, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, reached out to governors, senators and business leaders with texts and phone calls.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how the person obtained Wiles\u2019 connections, but they apparently gained access to the contacts in her personal cellphone, The Wall Street Journal reported. The messages and calls were not coming from Wiles\u2019 number, the newspaper reported.",
      "While most smartphones and tablets come with robust security, apps and connected devices often lack these protections or the regular software updates needed to stay ahead of new threats. That makes every fitness tracker, baby monitor or smart appliance another potential foothold for hackers looking to penetrate networks, retrieve information or infect systems with malware.",
      "Federal officials launched a program this year creating a \u201ccyber trust mark\u201d for connected devices that meet federal security standards.

      "A new study that examined five years\u2019 worth of prices at one U.S. grocery chain found that digital price tags haven\u2019t led to demand-based pricing surges",
      "Digital price labels, which are rapidly replacing paper shelf tags at U.S. supermarkets, haven\u2019t led to demand-based pricing surges, according to a new study that examined five years' worth of prices at one grocery chain.",
      "But some shoppers, consumer advocates and lawmakers remain skeptical about the tiny electronic screens, which let stores change prices instantly from a central computer instead of having workers swap out paper labels by hand.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s corporations vs. the humans, and that chasm between us goes further and further,\u201d said Dan Gallant, who works in sports media in Edmonton, Canada. Gallant's local Loblaws supermarket recently switched to digital labels.",
      "Social media is filled with warnings that grocers will use the technology to charge more for ice cream if it\u2019s hot outside, hike the price of umbrellas if it\u2019s raining or to gather information about customers.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania fired off a letter to Kroger last fall demanding to know whether it would use its electronic labels as part of a dynamic pricing strategy.",
      "Lawmakers in Rhode Island and Maine have introduced bills to limit the use of digital labels. In Arizona, Democratic state Rep. Cesar Aguilar recently introduced a bill that would ban them altogether.",
      "The bill hasn\u2019t gotten a hearing, but Aguilar said he\u2019s determined to start a conversation about digital labels and how stores could abuse them.",
      "\u201cGrocery stores study when people go shopping the most. And so you might be able to see a price go down one day and then go up another day,\u201d Aguilar told The Associated Press.",
      "Researchers say those fears are misplaced. A study published in late May found \u201cvirtually no surge pricing\u201d before or after electronic shelf labels were adopted. The study was authored by Ioannis Stamatopoulos of the University of Texas, Austin, Robert Evan Sanders of the University of California, San Diego and Robert Bray of Northwestern University",
      "The researchers looked at prices between 2019 and 2024 at an unnamed grocery chain than began using digital labels in October 2022. They found that temporary price increases affected 0.005% of products on any given day before electronic shelf labels were introduced, a share that increased by only 0.0006 percentage points after digital labels were installed.",
      "The study also determined that discounts were slightly more common after digital labels were introduced.",
      "Economists have long wondered why grocery prices don\u2019t change more often, according to Stamatopoulos. If bananas are about to expire, for example, it makes sense to lower the price on them. He said the cost of having workers change prices by hand could be one issue.",
      "But there\u2019s another reason: Shoppers watch grocery prices closely, and stores don\u2019t want to risk angering them.",
      "\u201cSelling groceries is not selling a couch. It\u2019s not a one-time transaction and you will never see them again,\u201d Stamatopoulos said. \u201cYou want them coming to the store every week.\u201d",
      "Electronic price labels aren\u2019t new. They\u2019ve been in use for more than a decade at groceries in Europe and some U.S. retailers, like Kohl's.",
      "But they\u2019ve been slow to migrate to U.S. grocery stores. Only around 5% to 10% of U.S. supermarkets now have electronic labels, compared to 80% in Europe, said Amanda Oren, vice president of industry strategy for North American grocery at Relex Solutions, a technology company that helps retailers forecast demand.",
      "Oren said cost is one issue that has slowed the U.S. rollout. The tiny screens cost between $5 and $20, Oren said, but every product a store sells needs one, and the average supermarket has 100,000 or more individual products.",
      "Still, the U.S. industry is charging ahead. Walmart, the nation's largest grocer and retailer, hopes to have digital price labels at 2,300 U.S. stores by 2026. Kroger is expanding the use of digital labels this year after testing them at 20 stores. Whole Foods is testing the labels in nearly 50 stores.",
      "Companies say electronic price labels have tremendous advantages. Walmart says it used to take employees two days to change paper price labels on the 120,000 items it has in a typical store. With digital tags, it takes a few minutes.",
      "The labels can also be useful. Some have codes shoppers can scan to see recipes or nutrition information. Instacart has a system in thousands of U.S. stores, including Aldi and Schnucks, that flashes a light on the digital tag when Instacart shoppers are nearby to help them find products.",
      "Ahold Delhaize\u2019s Albert Heijn supermarket chain in the Netherlands and Belgium has been testing an artificial intelligence-enabled tool since 2022 that marks down prices on its digital labels every 15 minutes for products nearing expiration. The system has reduced more than 250 tons of food waste annually, the company said.",
      "But Warren and Casey are skeptical. In their letter to Kroger, the U.S. senators noted a partnership with Microsoft that planned to put cameras in grocery aisles and offer personalized deals to shoppers depending on their gender and age.",
      "In its response, Kroger said the prices shown on its digital labels were not connected to any sort of facial recognition technology. It also denied surging prices during periods of peak demand.",
      "\u201cKroger\u2019s business model is built on a foundation of lowering prices to attract more customers,\u201d the company said.",
      "Aguilar, the Arizona lawmaker, said he also opposes the transition to digital labels because he thinks they will cost jobs. His constituents have pointed out that grocery prices keep rising even though there are fewer workers in checkout lanes, he said.",
      "\u201cThey are supposed to be part of our community, and that means hiring people from our community that fill those jobs,\" Aguilar said.",
      "But Relex Solutions' Oren said she doesn't think cutting labor costs is the main reason stores deploy digital price tags.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about working smarter, not harder, and being able to use that labor in better ways across the store rather than these very mundane, repetitive tasks,\u201d she said.",

      "NEW YORK -- The world\u2019s richest man could lose billions in his fight with world\u2019s most powerful politician.",
      "The feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump could mean Tesla\u2019s plans for self-driving cars hit a roadblock, SpaceX flies fewer missions for NASA, Starlink gets fewer overseas satellite contracts and the social media platform X loses advertisers.",
      "Maybe, that is. It all depends on Trump\u2019s appetite for revenge and how the dispute unfolds.",
      "Joked Telemetry Insight auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid, \u201cSince Trump has no history of retaliating against perceived adversaries, he\u2019ll probably just let this pass.\u201d",
      "Turning serious, he sees trouble ahead for Musk.",
      "\u201cFor someone that rants so much about government pork, all of Elon\u2019s businesses are extremely dependent on government largesse, which makes him vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Trump and the federal government also stand to lose from a long-running dispute, but not as much as Musk.",
      "The dispute comes just a week before a planned test of Tesla\u2019s driverless taxis in Austin, Texas, a major event for the company because sales of its EVs are lagging in many markets, and Musk needs a win.",
      "Trump can mess things up for Tesla by encouraging federal safety regulators to step in at any sign of trouble for the robotaxis.",
      "Even before the war of words broke out on Thursday, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration requested data on how Musk\u2019s driverless, autonomous taxis will perform in low-visibility conditions. That request follows an investigation last year into 2.4 million Teslas equipped with full self-driving software after several accidents, including one that killed a pedestrian.",
      "A spokesman for NHTSA said the probe was ongoing and that the agency \"will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice has also probed the safety of Tesla cars, but the status of that investigation is unclear. The DOJ did not respond immediately to requests for comment.",
      "The promise of a self-driving future led by Tesla inspired shareholders to boost the stock by 50% in the weeks after Musk confirmed the Austin rollout. But on Thursday, the stock plunged more than 14% amid the Trump-Musk standoff. On Friday, it recovered a bit, bouncing back nearly 4%.",
      "\u201cTesla\u2019s recent rise was almost entirely driven by robotaxi enthusiasm,\" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \u201cElon\u2019s feud with Trump could be a negative.\u201d",
      "One often-overlooked but important part of Tesla\u2019s business that could take a hit is its sales of carbon credits.",
      "As Musk and Trump were slugging it out Thursday, Republican senators inserted new language into Trump\u2019s budget bill that would eliminate fines for gas-powered cars that fall short of fuel economy standards. Tesla has a thriving side business selling \u201cregulatory credits\u201d to other automakers to make up for their shortfalls.",
      "Musk has downplayed the importance of the credits business, but the changes would hurt Tesla as it reels from boycotts of its cars tied to Musk\u2019s time working for Trump.",
      "Credit sales jumped by a third to $595 million in the first three months of the year even as total revenue slumped.",
      "Musk\u2019s foray into right-wing politics cost Tesla sales among the environmentally minded consumers who embraced electric cars and led to boycotts of Tesla showrooms.",
      "If Musk has indeed ended his close association with Trump, those buyers could come back, but that\u2019s far from certain.",
      "Meanwhile, one analyst speculated earlier this year that Trump voters in so-called red counties could buy Teslas \u201cin a meaningful way.\u201d But he\u2019s now less hopeful.",
      "\u201cThere are more questions than answers following Thursday developments,\u201d TD Cowen\u2019s Itay Michaeli wrote in his latest report, \u201cand it\u2019s still too early to determine any lasting impacts.\u201d",
      "Michaeli\u2019s stock target for Tesla earlier this year was $388. He has since lowered it to $330. Tesla was trading Friday at $300.",
      "Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump said Thursday that he could cut government contracts to Musk\u2019s rocket company, SpaceX, a massive threat to a company that has received billions of federal dollars.",
      "The privately held company that is reportedly worth $350 billion provides launches, sends astronauts into space for NASA and has a contract to send a team from the space agency to the moon next year.",
      "But if Musk has a lot to lose, so does the U.S.",
      "SpaceX is the only U.S. company capable of transporting crews to and from the space station, using its four-person Dragon capsules. The other alternative is politically dicey: depending wholly on Russia's Soyuz capsules.",
      "Musk knew all this when he shot back at Trump that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft. But it is unclear how serious his threat was. Several hours later \u2014 in a reply to another X user \u2014 he said he wouldn\u2019t do it.",
      "A subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk\u2019s once-close relationship with the president.",
      "Musk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved Starlink for some services during a trip with Trump in the Middle East last month. The company has also won a string of other recent deals in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and elsewhere as Trump has threatened tariffs.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much politics played a role, and how much is pure business.",
      "On Friday, The Associated Press confirmed that India had approved a key license to Starlink. At least 40% of India\u2019s more than 1.4 billion people have no access to the internet.",
      "Big advertisers that fled X after Musk welcomed all manner of conspiracy theories to the social media platform have started to trickle back in recent months, possibly out of fear of a conservative backlash.",

      "If Trump sours on X, \"there\u2019s a risk that it could again become politically radioactive for major brands,\u201d said Sarah Kreps, a political scientist at Cornell University. She added, though, that an \u201cexodus isn\u2019t obvious, and it would depend heavily on how the conflict escalates, how long it lasts and how it ends.\u201d",

      "\"The flight, which departed from Ahmedabad at 13:38 hrs, was carrying 242 passengers and crew members on board the Boeing 787-8 aircraft,\" the airline said in a statement posted on social media. \"Of these, 169 are Indian nationals, 53 are British nationals, 1 Canadian national and 7 Portuguese nationals.\"",
      "The plane, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, crashed in the Meghaninagar area near the airport, the Ahmedabad Police Commissioner said Thursday. Boeing's Dreamliner planes have not previously been involved in a incident where passenger fatalities were reported.",
      "\"We are aware of initial reports and are working to gather more information,\" Boeing said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "\"It is unheard of in this country,\" one legal expert told ABC News.",
      "Remarkable images are emerging of Marines training and National Guardsmen armed with rifles accompanying ICE agents on raids in Los Angeles.",
      "It's a scene President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth say can be replicated in any other American city where there are protests against the administration's immigration crackdown.",
      "It's also raising a host of legal questions regarding what Trump can and can't do with regards to the military on U.S. soil, and whether he's crossing the line.",
      "A first hearing on some of these issues is set for Thursday as California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, challenges the federal deployment and seeks emergency relief.",
      "How Trump mobilized the troops",
      "To send thousands of National Guardsmen to Los Angeles, Trump invoked Section 12406 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code.",
      "The statute allows the president to call on federal service members when there \"is a rebellion or danger of rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States\" or when \"the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "In his order, Trump said the troops would protect federal property and federal personnel who are performing their functions.",
      "Trump, however, did not invoke the Insurrection Act -- a clear exception to the mandates of the Posse Comitatus Act, the law that limits the military from being involved in civilian law enforcement.",
      "\"Instead, he's using authorities in a very novel way,\" Elizabeth Goitein, a senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center, said on ABC News Live.",
      "Goitein noted how broad Trump's memorandum is in nature, saying it\u2019s not limited to Los Angeles and allows for troops to be sent anywhere protests \"are likely to occur.\"",
      "\"This is a preemptive, nationwide, potentially, deployment of the federal military to effectively police protests. It is unheard of in this country,\" Goitein said.",
      "California seeks emergency relief",
      "California leaders claim Trump inflamed the protests by sending in the military when it was not necessary, and did so illegally.",
      "Newsom argues the situation, which has been relatively confined to a few square blocks in downtown Los Angeles, doesn't justify the use of Section 12406 in Title 10.",
      "\"To put it bluntly, there is no invasion or rebellion in Los Angeles; there is civil unrest that is no different from episodes that regularly occur in communities throughout the country, and that is capable of being contained by state and local authorities working together. And nothing is stopping the President from enforcing the laws through use of ordinary, civilian mechanisms available to federal officers,\" the state contended in an emergency motion.",
      "The state's lawsuit also lambasts Trump for bypassing the governor and local leaders who objected to the mobilization of the National Guard and active duty Marines.",
      "However, some legal experts say Section 12406 in Title 10 does not on its face require a request from the governor. There is also precedent for the president sending in the National Guard without governor support: in 1965 President Lyndon B. Johnson sent the National Guard to deal with civil unrest in the South without cooperation from state leaders.",
      "Immigration raids raise more questions",
      "\"If this ultimately gets to the Supreme Court, I don't think they're going to find that the president unlawfully federalized the National Guard troops,\" said Rachel VanLandingham, a professor at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles and a former active duty judge advocate in the U.S. Air Force.",
      "\"A different issue is if these federalized troops, either National Guard or Marines, cross the line into law enforcement and therefore violate Posse Comitatus,\" she said.",
      "National Guard members joining ICE on raids marks a significant escalation, she said.",
      "\"It's getting dangerously close to law enforcement,\" VanLandingham said.",
      "California made that argument in its emergency motion.",
      "\"Defendants intend to use unlawfully federalized National Guard troops and Marines to accompany federal immigration enforcement officers on raids throughout Los Angeles,\" the motion states. \"They will work in active concert with law enforcement, in support of a law enforcement mission, and will physically interact with or detain civilians.\"",
      "The Trump administration has steadfastly defended the moves and is urging a federal judge to block California's request for a temporary restraining order.",
      "\"The extraordinary relief Plaintiffs request would judicially countermand the Commander in Chief's military directives -- and would do so in the posture of a temporary restraining order, no less. That would be unprecedented. It would be constitutionally anathema. And it would be dangerous,\" lawyers with the Department of Justice said in a court filing.",
      "The DOJ lawyers argued that California should not \"second-guess the President's judgment that federal reinforcements were necessary\" and that a federal court should defer to the president's discretion on military matters.",

      "Among those, the numbers of internally displaced people jumped by more than 9% to 73.5 million at the end of last year. The numbers represent cumulative figures from years of conflict, violence and persecution, and some displaced people returned home last year even as others fled.",
      "The report comes at a time when humanitarian groups are facing budget cuts from the United States and other traditional Western donors.",

      "He stepped down as a vice chair ahead of Democratic Party elections Thursday.",
      "David Hogg on Wednesday stepped down from his post as a Democratic National Committee vice chair and will not run in the new version of elections set to start Thursday, ABC News has learned.",
      "In an emailed statement through his PAC, Leaders We Deserve, Hogg says he is stepping down to fully focus on his group's mission to endorse and support aligned candidates in Democratic primaries, a desire at the center of much of the drama between Hogg and senior DNC leaders, including chair Ken Martin.",
      "Hogg said that there is \"a clear fundamental disagreement\" between himself and the party apparatus about the role of vice chair.",
      "\"I came into this role to play a positive role in creating the change our party needs. It is clear that there is a fundamental disagreement about the role of a Vice Chair -- and it's okay to have disagreements,\" Hogg wrote.",
      "\"What isn't okay is allowing this to remain our focus when there is so much more we need to be focused on. Ultimately, I have decided to not run in this upcoming election so the party can focus on what really matters. I need to do this work with Leaders We Deserve, and it is going to remain my number one mission to build the strongest party possible,\" he added.",
      "Hogg went on to write he has respect for his fellow officers, despite disagreements. His fellow vice chair, Malcolm Kenyatta, made no secret of his frustrations with Hogg over the last few weeks.",
      "\"I have nothing but admiration and respect for my fellow officers. Even though we have disagreements, we all are here to build the strongest party possible,\" Hogg wrote.",
      "In response to Hogg stepping down, DNC chair Martin lauded his record and wished him well despite the escalating tensions.",
      "\"I commend David for his years of activism, organizing, and fighting for his generation, and while I continue to believe he is a powerful voice for this party, I respect his decision to step back from his post as Vice Chair,\" Martin said in a statement to ABC News. \"I have no doubt that he will remain an important advocate for Democrats across the map. I appreciate his service as an officer, his hard work, and his dedication to the party,\" he said.",
      "It appeared the DNC re-do election was still on track, just without Hogg on the ticket. Many other details remain unclear, namely if Kenyatta now automatically wins the candidate ballot since he is now unopposed.",

      "The new members will be at an upcoming ACIP meeting scheduled to be held between June 25 and June 27, according to Kennedy. The meeting is to discuss new recommendations for several vaccines, including the HPV vaccine and the COVID-19 vaccine.",
      "\"The committee will review safety and efficacy data for the current schedule as well,\" Kennedy wrote in the post on X.",
      "The new eight members appear to have strong credentials related to medicine, public health, epidemiology and statistics, but with less of an emphasis on credentials related to immunology, virology and vaccinology in comparison with previous committees.",
      "Kennedy told ABC News on Tuesday that the replacements for ACIP would not be \"anti-vaxxers.\" However, some of the new members have previously espoused anti-vaccine sentiments, especially around COVID-19 vaccines and mRNA technology.",
      "One of them, Dr. Robert Malone -- who made some early contributors to mRNA vaccine technology -- spread misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic, claiming people were \"hypnotized\" into believing mainstream ideas about COVID-19, such as vaccination.",

      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. shocked many when he announced all 17 sitting members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's independent vaccine advisory committee would be removed.",
      "In an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, Kennedy said the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) was plagued by conflicts of interest and was a \"rubber stamp\" for all vaccines.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is the agency that authorizes or approves vaccines. The ACIP holds public hearings and then has non-binding votes on potential recommendations, and the CDC director finalizes the recommendations.",
      "Currently the CDC director role remains vacant and Kennedy has been making the final recommendations.",
      "Kennedy told ABC News on Tuesday that the replacements for ACIP will not be \"anti-vaxxers\" and that he intends to replace the panel by the end of the month.",
      "\"We're going to be bringing people onto the ACIP panel -- not anti-vaxxers -- we're bringing people on who are credentialed scientists, who are highly credentialed physicians, who are going to do evidence-based medicine, who are going to be objective and who are going to follow the science and make critical public health determinations for our children based upon the best science,\" Kennedy said.",
      "But Kennedy also suggested that current list of vaccines that are recommended for children would be re-analyzed by the new ACIP members, because he doesn't trust the science that led to their initial approvals.",
      "A number of public health experts and vaccinologists told ABC News that they are concerned new committee members could lead to changes in which vaccines are no longer covered by public and private insurers, and that committee seats may now be filled by vaccine skeptics without scientific knowledge to evaluate the recommendations.",
      "\"I think it's disingenuous. I don't think this has anything to do with conflict of interest,\" Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor of pediatrics and molecular virology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who has helped develop several vaccines, told ABC News. \"I think he either wants to get rid of ACIP altogether or stack it with his with people that believe in his ... pseudoscience.\"",
      "Who will the new members of the committee be?",
      "The ACIP is comprised of up to 19 voting members, six ex officio members representing other federal agencies and 30 non-voting representatives of liaison organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.",
      "The panel develops recommendations on the use of vaccines in the U.S including timing and dosage or if there are situations in which a vaccine should not be used.",
      "According to the CDC, ACIP makes recommendations on incorporating licensed new vaccines into the current immunization schedule as well as recommendations on vaccine formulations. It also reviews older vaccines to consider revising its recommendations.",
      "The CDC sets immunization schedules for adults and children based on ACIP recommendations.",
      "The members removed by Kennedy include experts in pediatrics, infectious diseases, global public health, epidemiology and family medicine.",
      "Among them was Dr. Noel Brewer, a professor in the department of health behavior at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health.",
      "According to his biography page on the school's website, he has been a co-author in the publication of more than 375 papers examining vaccination, tobacco use, medical screening and other cancer-related health behaviors.",
      "Brewer told ABC News Live he and his colleagues did not see the purge coming and said he learned of it from journalists contacting him and asking if he saw Kennedy's op-ed in The Wall Street Journal.",
      "He said that ACIP has one of the strictest set of rules around conflict-of-interest of any committee he's been part of and there's no evidence of members voting in favor of products because of personal, or business, interests.",
      "\"They work really hard to make sure that we don't have the conflicts of interest,\" Brewer said. \"So, I can't accept any money from a drug company. I cannot accept any sort of funding from them. I can't be part of a lawsuit against a drug company. None of that stuff is possible.\"",
      "The CDC has published a list of conflicts of interest declarations disclosed by voting members during public meetings since 2000, which was most recently updated in early March.",
      "Dr. Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco -- whose research focuses on legal and policy issues related to vaccines -- told ABC News very few members of the committee have conflicts of interest, and those who do announce them at the beginning of the meeting and don't vote on those issues.",
      "Brewer said he assumes Kennedy's new nominations will \"have the same level of vaccine skepticism as the current secretary, but it's hard to know, and I'm just hoping for the best.\"",
      "In a statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon told ABC News, \"Secretary Kennedy is committed to restoring public trust in vaccine policy by ensuring that advisory panels like ACIP are guided by independent, gold standard science -- free from conflicts of interest and ideology.\"",
      "Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccinologist and president and co-director of the Atria Research Institute -- who previously served two terms on the ACIP and then two terms as a liaison -- told ABC News there's only speculation as to whom Kennedy will select because no names have been announced.",
      "However, he added he doesn't have concerns as long as the new members bring \"some domain of expertise\" and \"adhere to the rigor of the scientific method.\"",
      "\"Presumably, the criteria will be around a concept that the administration has announced called 'Gold Standard Science,'\" Poland said, referring to Trump's executive order in late May that seeks to promote the standard through replication, transparency, unbiased peer review and without conflicts of interest.",
      "\"I think a definition of 'gold standard science' is appropriate. We know what that means in the scientific field, and then if you array experts who adhere to gold standard science, that's a good thing,\" he continued.",
      "Reiss said the timing of Kennedy's announcement comes just prior to an upcoming ACIP meeting scheduled to be held between June 25 and June 27 to discuss new recommendations for several vaccines, including the HPV vaccine and the COVID-19 vaccine.",
      "\"That's a really short time for vetting members, which usually takes months,\" she told ABC News. \"The first question is: is Kennedy going to try to quickly put in a range of names, which would suggest that he either has been preparing a roster for a long time, or is he going to do it really quickly?\"",
      "Could any changes be coming to vaccine recommendations?",
      "Reiss said if the new ACIP members make any changes to vaccine recommendations, it could lead to changes related to insurance coverage.",
      "Private insurance providers are required under the Affordable Care Act to cover ACIP recommendations, but not required to cover others, she said.",
      "Additionally, the federal Vaccine for Children program, which provides vaccines to children whose parents or guardians may not be able to afford them, automatically covers vaccines recommended by ACIP and approved by the CDC.",

    "story": [
      "After a bruising war between Israel and Hezbollah, Lebanon\u2019s new leaders sense an opportunity to revitalize the country\u2019s devastated economy with help from its wealthy Gulf neighbors",
      "BEIRUT -- Fireworks lit up the night sky over Beirut\u2019s famous St. Georges Hotel as hit songs from the 1960s and 70s filled the air in a courtyard overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "The retro-themed event was hosted last month by Lebanon\u2019s Tourism Ministry to promote the upcoming summer season and perhaps recapture some of the good vibes from an era viewed as a golden one for the country. In the years before a civil war began in 1975, Lebanon was the go-to destination for wealthy tourists from neighboring Gulf countries seeking beaches in summer, snow-capped mountains in winter and urban nightlife year-round.",
      "In the decade after the war, tourists from Gulf countries \u2013 and crucially, Saudi Arabia \u2013 came back, and so did Lebanon\u2019s economy. But by the early 2000s, as the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah gained power, Lebanon's relations with Gulf countries began to sour. Tourism gradually dried up, starving its economy of billions of dollars in annual spending.",
      "Now, after last year's bruising war with Israel, Hezbollah is much weaker and Lebanon's new political leaders sense an opportunity to revitalize the economy once again with help from wealthy neighbors. They aim to disarm Hezbollah and rekindle ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, which in recent years have prohibited their citizens from visiting Lebanon or importing its products.",
      "\u201cTourism is a big catalyst, and so it\u2019s very important that the bans get lifted,\u201d said Laura Khazen Lahoud, the country's tourism minister.",
      "On the highway leading to the Beirut airport, once-ubiquitous banners touting Hezbollah\u2019s leadership have been replaced with commercial billboards and posters that read \u201ca new era for Lebanon.\u201d In the center of Beirut, and especially in neighborhoods that hope to attract tourists, political posters are coming down, and police and army patrols are on the rise.",
      "There are signs of thawing relations with some Gulf neighbors. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have lifted yearslong travel bans.",
      "All eyes are now on Saudi Arabia, a regional political and economic powerhouse, to see if it will follow suit, according to Lahoud and other Lebanese officials. A key sticking point is security, these officials say. Although a ceasefire with Israel has been in place since November, near-daily airstrikes have continued in southern and eastern Lebanon, where Hezbollah over the years had built its political base and powerful military arsenal.",
      "As vital as tourism is \u2014 it accounted for almost 20% of Lebanon's economy before it tanked in 2019 \u2014 the country's leaders say it is just one piece of a larger puzzle they are trying to put back together.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s agricultural and industrial sectors are in shambles, suffering a major blow in 2021, when Saudi Arabia banned their exports after accusing Hezbollah of smuggling drugs into Riyadh. Years of economic dysfunction have left the country's once-thriving middle class in a state of desperation.",
      "The World Bank says poverty nearly tripled in Lebanon over the past decade, affecting close to half its population of nearly 6 million. To make matters worse, inflation is soaring, with the Lebanese pound losing 90% of its value, and many families lost their savings when banks collapsed.",
      "Tourism is seen by Lebanon's leaders as the best way to kickstart the reconciliation needed with Gulf countries -- and only then can they move on to exports and other economic growth opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the thing that makes most sense, because that\u2019s all Lebanon can sell now,\u201d said Sami Zoughaib, research manager at The Policy Initiative, a Beirut-based think tank.",
      "With summer still weeks away, flights to Lebanon are already packed with expats and locals from countries that overturned their travel bans, and hotels say bookings have been brisk.",
      "At the event hosted last month by the tourism ministry, the owner of the St. Georges Hotel, Fady El-Khoury, beamed. The hotel, owned by his father in its heyday, has acutely felt Lebanon's ups and downs over the decades, closing and reopening multiple times because of wars. \u201cI have a feeling that the country is coming back after 50 years,\u201d he said.",
      "On a recent weekend, as people crammed the beaches of the northern city of Batroun, and jet skis whizzed along the Mediterranean, local business people sounded optimistic that the country was on the right path.",
      "\u201cWe are happy, and everyone here is happy,\u201d said Jad Nasr, co-owner of a private beach club. \u201cAfter years of being boycotted by the Arabs and our brothers in the Gulf, we expect this year for us to always be full.\u201d",
      "Still, tourism is not a panacea for Lebanon's economy, which for decades has suffered from rampant corruption and waste.",
      "Lebanon has been in talks with the International Monetary Fund for years over a recovery plan that would include billions in loans and require the country to combat corruption, restructure its banks, and bring improvements to a range of public services, including electricity and water.",
      "Without those and other reforms, Lebanon's wealthy neighbors will lack confidence to invest there, experts said. A tourism boom alone would serve as a \u201cmorphine shot that would only temporarily ease the pain\" rather than stop the deepening poverty in Lebanon, Zoughaib said.",
      "The tourism minister, Lahoud, agreed, saying a long-term process has only just begun.",
      "\"But we\u2019re talking about subjects we never talked about before,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think the whole country has realized that war doesn\u2019t serve anyone, and that we really need our economy to be back and flourish again.\u201d",

      "Among those, the numbers of internally displaced people jumped by more than 9% to 73.5 million at the end of last year. The numbers represent cumulative figures from years of conflict, violence and persecution, and some displaced people returned home last year even as others fled.",
      "The report comes at a time when humanitarian groups are facing budget cuts from the United States and other traditional Western donors.",
      "UNHCR said nearly two-thirds of people who crossed national borders to flee remained in neighboring countries, countering the \u201cwidespread perception in wealthier regions\u201d that a majority of people were fleeing in a bid to reach places like Europe or the United States.",
      "The agency said Sudan, which has been riven by civil war, has become home to the world's largest displacement crisis, with more than 14 million people displaced by the conflict \u2014 surpassing Syria, at 13.5 million. More than 10 million in Afghanistan have been forcibly displaced, and some 8.8 million within or from Ukraine, UNHCR said.",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- The U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote Thursday on a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages held by Hamas, and the opening of all Israeli border crossings for deliveries of desperately needed food and other aid.",
      "The resolution, drafted by Spain and obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press, \u201cstrongly condemns any use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare.\u201d",
      "Experts and human rights workers say hunger is widespread in Gaza and some 2 million Palestinians are at risk of famine if Israel does not fully lift its blockade and halt its military campaign, which it renewed in March after ending a ceasefire with Hamas.",
      "Last week, the U.N. Security Council failed to pass a resolution demanding a ceasefire in Gaza and calling on Israel to lift all restrictions on the delivery of aid. The United States vetoed the resolution because it was not linked to the release of the hostages, while all 14 other members of the council voted in favor.",
      "There are no vetoes in the 193-member General Assembly, where the resolution is expected to pass overwhelmingly. But unlike in the Security Council, assembly resolutions are not legally binding, though they are seen as a barometer of world opinion.",
      "After a 10-week blockade that barred all aid to Gaza, Israel is allowing the United Nations to deliver a trickle of food assistance and is backing a newly created U.S. aid group, which has opened several sites in the center and south of the territory to deliver food parcels.",
      "But the aid system rolled out last month by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has been troubled by near-daily shootings as crowds make their way to aid sites, while the longstanding U.N.-run system has struggled to deliver food because of Israeli restrictions and a breakdown of law and order.",
      "The draft resolution being voted on Thursday references a March 28 legally binding order by the top United Nations court for Israel to open more land crossings into Gaza for food, water, fuel and other supplies. The International Court of Justice issued the order in a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of acts of genocide in its war in Gaza, charges Israel strongly denies.",
      "The resolution stresses that Israel, as an occupying power, has an obligation under international law to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches those in need.",
      "It reiterates the assembly's commitment to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with the Gaza Strip as part of a Palestinian state. The assembly is holding a high-level meeting next week to push for a two-state solution, which Israel has rejected.",
      "The resolution supports mediation efforts by Egypt, Qatar and the United States aimed at implementing a January ceasefire agreement. When the U.S. vetoed last week\u2019s Gaza resolution, acting Ambassador Dorothy Shea said it would have undermined the security of Israel and diplomatic efforts to reach a ceasefire \u201cthat reflects the realities on the ground.\u201d",
      "Like the failed Security Council resolution, the resolution to be voted on Thursday also does not condemn Hamas\u2019 deadly attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which ignited the war, or say the militant group must disarm and withdraw from Gaza. Both are U.S. demands.",
      "The Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage. About 55 hostages are still being held. Israel\u2019s military campaign has killed over 55,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. It says women and children make up most of the dead, but doesn\u2019t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",

Brad Schneider, chair of the centrist New Democrat Coalition, said he\u2019s weighing two factors: which candidate could best help Democrats win the 2026 midterm elections and whether they can successfully lead investigations into the Trump administration and \u201ctry to repair some of the damage that\u2019s been done.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe committee can be a flash point, or it can be a very effective place for us to make our point, and we want to know who\u2019s going to do best in that role to make sure the committee works to help us secure 218 (members) next November,\u201d Schneider said.",
      "Some Democratic caucuses have traditionally prized seniority as a clear and reliable way for lawmakers of color to rise through the ranks. There has never been a Hispanic Oversight chairman and only one Black chairman, Elijah Cummings.",
      "\u201cThe CBC has always stood for seniority,\u201d said Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia. But Johnson noted that the Black Caucus has at times \u201cdeviated\u201d from that norm. He said many in the caucus are open to a conversation about age.",
      "\u201cSo, Steve Lynch, I think, is the next senior member. And but as I said, other factors have to be considered and I\u2019m sure that, along with myself, other CBC members are going through that process,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "\u201cSince I\u2019ve been here, seniority has had weight,\u201d said Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, who said he was undecided on which candidate to back. \u201cBut seniority is not the only thing. And there are times and circumstances where the person with the most seniority has not won. Whether that\u2019s one of these times or not is what we\u2019re going to see.\u201d",

      "California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is calling President Donald Trump's military intervention at protests over federal immigration policy in Los Angeles an assault on democracy and has sued to try to stop it. Meanwhile, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is putting the National Guard on standby in areas in his state where demonstrations are planned.",
      "The divergent approaches illustrate the ways the two parties are trying to navigate national politics and the role of executive power in enforcing immigration policies.",
      "In his live TV address this week, Newsom said that Trump\u2019s move escalated the situation \u2014 and for political gain.",
      "All 22 other Democratic governors signed a statement sent by the Democratic Governors Association on Sunday backing Newsom, calling the Guard deployment and threats to send in Marines \u201can alarming abuse of power\u201d that \"undermines the mission of our service members, erodes public trust, and shows the Trump administration does not trust local law enforcement.\u201d",
      "The protests in Los Angeles have mostly been contained to five blocks in a small section of downtown; nearly 200 people were detained on Tuesday and at least seven police officers have been injured.",
      "In Republican-controlled states, governors have not said when or how they're planning to deploy military troops for protests.",
      "Since Trump's return to office, Democratic governors have been calculating about when to criticize him, when to emphasize common ground and when to bite their tongues.",
      "The governors' responses are guided partly by a series of political considerations, said Kristoffer Shields, director of the Eagleton Center on the American Governor at Rutgers University: How would criticizing Trump play with Democrats, Republicans and independent voters in their states? And for those with presidential ambitions, how does that message resonate nationally?",
      "Democratic governors are weighing a number of considerations.",
      "\u201cThere probably is some concern about retributions \u2014 what the reaction of the administration could be for a governor who takes a strong stance,\" Shields said.",
      "And in this case, polling indicates about half of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling immigration, though that polling was conducted before the recent military deployment.",
      "On other issues, Democratic governors have taken a variety of approaches with Trump.",
      "At a White House meeting in February, Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills told Trump, \u201c we\u2019ll see you in court \u201d over his push to cut off funding to the state because it allowed transgender athletes in girls' school sports. Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer, a possible 2028 presidential candidate, publicly sparred with Trump during his first term but this time around, has met with him privately to find common ground.",
      "Initially, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green referred to Trump as a \u201cstraight-up dictator,\" but the next month he told a local outlet that he was treading carefully, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not going to criticize him directly much at all.\"",
      "Apart from their joint statement, some of the highest-profile Democratic governors have not talked publicly about the situation in California. When asked, on Wednesday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul's office pointed to a Sunday social media post about the joint statement. Whitmer didn't respond.",
      "The office of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who is set to testify before Congress on Thursday about his state laws protecting people who are in the country without legal status, reiterated in a statement that he stands with Newsom. The office said \u201clocal authorities should be able to do their jobs without the chaos of this federal interference and intimidation.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, in an interview Wednesday in The Washington Post, said Trump should not send troops to a weekend protest scheduled in Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s injected chaos into the world order, he\u2019s injected it into our economy, he is trying to inject chaos into our streets by doing what he did with the Guard in California,\" Shapiro said.",
      "As state attorney general during Trump\u2019s first term, Shapiro routinely boasted that he sued Trump over 40 times and won each time. As governor he has often treaded more carefully, by bashing Trump\u2019s tariffs, but not necessarily targeting Trump himself.",
      "Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has often clashed with Newsom, a fellow term-limited governor with national ambitions.",
      "Newsom's office said DeSantis offered to send Florida State Guard troops to California.",
      "\u201cGiven the guard were not needed in the first place, we declined Governor DeSantis attempt to inflame an already chaotic situation made worse by his Party\u2019s leader,\u201d Newsom spokesperson Diana Crofts-Pelayo said in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Speaking on Fox News on Tuesday, DeSantis said the gesture was a typical offer of mutual aid during a crisis \u2014 and was dismissive of the reasons it was turned down.",
      "\u201cThe way to put the fire out is to make sure you have law and order,\u201d he said.",
      "Protests against immigration enforcement raids have sprung up in other cities \u2014 and a series of \u201cNo Kings\u201d demonstrations are planned for the weekend \u2014 with governors preparing to respond.",
      "In Connecticut, Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said he has spoken with his public safety commissioner to make sure state and local police work together.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to give the president any pretext to think he can come into Connecticut and militarize the situation. That just makes the situation worse,\u201d said Lamont, who called Trump \"a little eager to send federal troops and militarize the situation in Los Angeles.\u201d",
      "It is unclear how many Texas National Guard members will be deployed or how many cities asked for assistance. In Austin, where police used chemical irritants to disperse several hundred protesters on Monday, the mayor\u2019s office said the National Guard was not requested.",
      "San Antonio officials also said they didn\u2019t request the Guard.",
      "Florida's DeSantis said law enforcement in his state is preparing \u201cThe minute you cross into attacking law enforcement, any type of rioting, any type of vandalism, looting, just be prepared to have the law come down on you,\u201d DeSantis said Tuesday. \u201cAnd we will make an example of you, you can guarantee it.\u201d",

      "John Fitzgerald Hanson, 61, is set to receive a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. Hanson was sentenced to die after he was convicted of carjacking, kidnapping and killing a Tulsa woman in 1999.",
      "Hanson, whose name in some federal court records is George John Hanson, had been serving a life sentence in federal prison in Louisiana for several unrelated federal convictions. Federal officials transferred him to Oklahoma custody in March to follow through on President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping executive order to more actively support the death penalty.",
      "Hanson's attorneys argued in a last-minute appeal that he did not receive a fair clemency hearing last month, claiming that one of the board members who denied him clemency was biased because he worked for the Tulsa County District Attorney's Office when Hanson was prosecuted. A district court judge this week temporary halted the execution, but an appeals court later cleared the way for it.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court late Wednesday rejected a separate appeal that alleged a key witness testified against Hanson in exchange for favorable treatment from prosecutors in a criminal case, information that was never disclosed to his defense team.",
      "Prosecutors allege Hanson and accomplice, Victor Miller, kidnapped Mary Bowles from a Tulsa shopping mall. Prosecutors allege the pair drove Bowles to a gravel pit near Owasso, where Miller shot and killed property owner Jerald Thurman. The two then drove Bowles a short distance away, where Hanson shot and killed Bowles, according to prosecutors. Miller received a no-parole life prison sentence for his role in the crimes.",
      "During last month's clemency hearing, Hanson expressed remorse for his involvement in the crimes and apologized to the victims' families.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not an evil person,\u201d Hanson said via a video link from the prison. \u201cI was caught in a situation I couldn\u2019t control. I can\u2019t change the past, but I would if I could.\u201d",
      "Hanson\u2019s attorneys acknowledged he participated in the kidnapping and carjacking, but said there was no definitive evidence that he shot and killed Bowles. They painted Hanson as a troubled youth with autism and who was controlled and manipulated by the domineering Miller.",

Newsom has depicted the federal military intervention in the nation's second largest city as the onset of a much broader effort by Trump to overturn political and cultural norms at the heart of the nation\u2019s democracy. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has echoed that, saying the deployment of troops was unnecessary and meant to undermine local jurisdictions and intimidate the city\u2019s large immigrant population.",
      "Newsom filed an emergency motion requesting the court's intervention after President Donald Trump ordered the deployment of roughly 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angeles following protests over his stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws.",
      "The Trump administration called the lawsuit a \u201ccrass political stunt endangering American lives\u201d in its official response on Wednesday.",
      "The Democratic governor argued the troops were originally deployed to protect federal buildings and said sending troops to help support immigration raids would only promote civil unrest.",

      "Most demonstrations have been peaceful but this weekend some turned raucous with protesters setting cars on fire in downtown Los Angeles. The city has imposed a nightly curfew covering a 1-square-mile (2.5-square-kilometer) section where protests have occurred in the sprawling metropolis of 4 million people.",

The change moves troops closer to engaging in law enforcement actions like deportations as Trump has promised as part of his administration\u2019s immigration crackdown. The Guard has the authority to temporarily detain people who attack officers but any arrests ultimately would be made by law enforcement.",

      "Unlike a similar lawsuit filed in February in a Washington, D.C., federal court representing people who had already reached U.S. soil and sought asylum after crossing between ports of entry, Wednesday's lawsuit focuses on people who are not on U.S. soil and are seeking asylum at ports of entry.",

      "Harvey Weinstein has been found guilty again",
      "NEW YORK -- Harvey Weinstein has been found guilty again, convicted Wednesday of a top sex crimes charge at his #MeToo retrial in New York City. The mixed and partial verdict came more than five years after his first conviction, which an appeals court overturned last year.",
      "The jury returned a verdict on two of three charges against Weinstein, acquitting him of one. Jurors indicated that they had yet to achieve unanimity on the final count. That could mean more deliberations on Thursday.",
      "The verdict capped an extraordinary fifth day of deliberations.",
      "The jury foreperson complained that he was being bullied by other jurors. Weinstein\u2019s lawyer then asked for a mistrial, and Weinstein himself addressed the judge without jurors in the courtroom, imploring him to end the case without a verdict.",
      "Minutes later, the jury of seven women and five men declared the ailing 73-year-old guilty of one count of criminal sex act, which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison. Weinstein denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone. Once he\u2019s sentenced, he can appeal.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about the verdict:",
      "Jurors convicted Weinstein of one count of criminal sex act, finding that he forcibly performed oral sex on a TV and movie producer and production assistant, Miriam Haley, nearly two decades ago.",
      "Haley, who had a short stint working on the Weinstein-produced \u201cProject Runway,\u201d testified that he assaulted her in July 2006 after inviting her to stop by his SoHo apartment before a flight his company booked her on the next day to Los Angeles to attend a movie premiere.",
      "Haley testified that Weinstein backed her into a bedroom, pushed her onto a bed and forced oral sex on her, undeterred by her kicks and pleas of, \u201cNo, no \u2014 it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d",
      "Weinstein was convicted of the same charge at his first trial.",
      "Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, told jurors that she was never interested in any sexual or romantic relationship with Weinstein but still wanted his help professionally.",
      "She acknowledged she kept in touch and exchanged warm messages with him and accepted an invitation to his hotel room two weeks after the alleged assault, when she said he pulled her into bed for sex.",
      "Weinstein acquitted of a charge of criminal sex act relating to a previously uncharged allegation that he forced oral sex on Kaja (KEYE\u2019-ah) Sokola, a psychologist and former Polish model and actor, at a Manhattan hotel in 2006 just before her 20th birthday.",
      "Sokola, who wasn\u2019t a part of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, testified that Weinstein assaulted her after luring her to his hotel room by telling her had a script to show her. As he pushed her onto a bed, stripped off her boots, her stockings and her underwear, \u201cmy soul was removed from me,\" she said.",
      "Now 39, Sokola said he held her down while ignoring her pleas of \u201cplease don\u2019t, please stop, I don\u2019t want this.\u201d She said she tried to push him away but was no match against the much larger Weinstein.",
      "Sokola also testified that Weinstein sexually assaulted her when she was 16 years old, but that allegation was beyond legal time limits for a potential criminal charge.",
      "Sokola said she stayed in touch with Weinstein because she had dreams of an acting career.",
      "She went to authorities in January 2020, a few days into Weinstein\u2019s first trial. Prosecutors halted their investigation after Weinstein was convicted, but revived it when the verdict was thrown out last year.",
      "The jury hasn't reached a verdict on a third-degree rape charge involving Jessica Mann\u2019s allegation that Weinstein assaulted her in March 2013.",
      "Mann, a cosmetologist and hairstylist, said she met Weinstein at a party in late 2012 or early 2013, when she was 27 and trying to launch an acting career.",
      "She alleges Weinstein trapped her in a Manhattan hotel room, demanded that she undress as he loomed over her, grabbed her arms and raped her after, she believes, he injected himself with an erection-promoting drug that she later found in the bathroom trash.",
      "Mann said she had a consensual, on-and-off relationship with the then-married Weinstein, but that he was volatile and violated her if she refused him.",
      "She said she kept in touch with Weinstein after the alleged rape, telling jurors she \u201ccompartmentalized the part of Harvey that was hurting me,\u201d and that flattery and friendliness \u201ckept the peace.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name sexual assault accusers without their permission, which Haley, Mann and Sokola have given.",
      "New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction in April 2024.",
      "In a 4-3 decision, the court said the judge in the first trial, James Burke, denied Weinstein a fair trial by letting three women testify about allegations that didn't result in charges and by deciding that prosecutors could confront Weinstein, if he testified, about stories of him behaving brutishly.",
      "The court labeled the allegations against Weinstein \u201cappalling, shameful, repulsive conduct\u201d but warned that \u201cdestroying a defendant\u2019s character under the guise of prosecutorial need\u201d did not justify some trial evidence and testimony.",
      "Burke\u2019s term expired at the end of 2022, and he is no longer a judge.",
      "Prosecutors were not allowed to retry Weinstein on charges that he was acquitted of during his first trial, including predatory sexual assault and one count of first-degree rape.",
      "Weinstein is appealing his conviction in Los Angeles in a similar case in 2022.",
      "Jurors there found him guilty of three of seven charges, including rape, and he was sentenced to 16 years in prison. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers argued he did not get a fair trial.",
      "They contend that the judge in the California case wrongly allowed jurors to know about Weinstein\u2019s 2020 New York conviction, and that the jury was unfairly prejudiced by testimony from women about alleged assaults Weinstein was not charged with.",

      "President Donald Trump is expected to sign a measure Thursday that blocks California\u2019s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is expected to sign a measure Thursday that blocks California\u2019s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, a White House official told The Associated Press.",
      "The resolution Trump plans to sign, which Congress approved last month, aims to quash the country\u2019s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. He also plans to approve measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.",
      "The timing of the signing was confirmed Wednesday by a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to share plans not yet public.",
      "The development comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump's move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It's the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over everything from tariffs to the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s a day ending in Y, it\u2019s another day of Trump\u2019s war on California,\u201d Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villase\u00f1or said in an email. \"We\u2019re fighting back.\"",
      "According to the White House official, Trump is expected to sign resolutions that block California\u2019s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and ending the sale of new ones by 2035. He will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.",
      "The president is scheduled to sign the measures and make remarks during an event at the White House on Thursday morning.",
      "Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal and said the state plans to sue.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin are expected to attend, along with members of Congress and representatives from the energy, trucking and gas station industries.",
      "The signings come as Trump has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.",
      "The move will also come a day after the Environmental Protection Agency proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas. Zeldin said it would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help \u201cunleash\u201d American energy.",
      "California, which has some of the nation\u2019s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.",
      "In his first term, Trump revoked California\u2019s ability to enforce its standards, but President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.",
      "Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.",
      "That\u2019s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California\u2019s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.",
      "California, which makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, has significant power to sway trends in the auto industry. About a dozen states signed on to adopt California's rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.",
      "The National Automobile Dealers Association supported the federal government\u2019s move to block California\u2019s ban on gas-powered cars, saying Congress should decide on such a national issue, not the state.",
      "The American Trucking Associations said the rules were not feasible and celebrated Congress\u2019 move to block them.",
      "Chris Spear, the CEO of the American Trucking Associations, said in a statement Wednesday: \u201cThis is not the United States of California.\u201d",
      "It was also applauded by Detroit automaker General Motors, which said it will \u201chelp align emissions standards with today\u2019s market realities.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have long advocated for one national standard that will allow us to stay competitive, continue to invest in U.S. innovation, and offer customer choice across the broadest lineup of gas-powered and electric vehicles,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "Dan Becker with the Center for Biological Diversity, in anticipation of the president signing the measures, said earlier Thursday that the move would be \u201cTrump\u2019s latest betrayal of democracy.\u201d",
      "\u201cSigning this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people\u2019s health and their wallets,\u201d Becker said in a statement.",

      "All 12 members of the board overseeing the prestigious Fulbright scholarships on Wednesday resigned in protest of what they call the Trump administration\u2019s meddling with the selection of award recipients, according to a statement they issued",
      "All 12 members of the board overseeing the prestigious Fulbright scholarships on Wednesday resigned in protest of what they call the Trump administration\u2019s meddling with the selection of award recipients, according to a statement.",
      "A statement published online by the board members said the administration usurped the board\u2019s authority by denying awards to \u201ca substantial number of people\u201d who already had been chosen. Another 1,200 award recipients who were already approved to come to the U.S. are undergoing an unauthorized review process that could lead to their rejection, the board members said.",
      "\u201cTo continue to serve after the Administration has consistently ignored the Board\u2019s request that they follow the law would risk legitimizing actions we believe are unlawful and damage the integrity of this storied program and America\u2019s credibility abroad,\u201d the statement reads.",
      "Congress established the Fulbright program nearly 80 years ago to promote international exchange and American diplomacy. The highly selective program awards about 9,000 scholarships annually in the U.S. and in more than 160 other countries to students, scholars, and professionals in a range of fields.",
      "A message seeking comment was left with the State Department, which runs the scholarship program.",
      "The resignations were first reported by The New York Times.",
      "The intervention from the Trump administration undermined the program's merit-based selection process and its insulation from political influence, the board members wrote.",
      "\u201cWe believe these actions not only contradict the statute but are antithetical to the Fulbright mission and the values, including free speech and academic freedom, that Congress specified in the statute,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is our sincere hope that Congress, the courts, and future Fulbright Boards will prevent the administration\u2019s efforts to degrade, dismantle, or even eliminate one of our nation\u2019s most respected and valuable programs.\u201d",
      "Award recipients are selected in a yearlong process by nonpartisan staff at the State Department. The recipients who had their awards canceled are in fields including biology, engineering, medical sciences, and history, the board members said.",
      "The announcement comes as the Trump administration ratchets up scrutiny of international students on several fronts. The administration has expanded the grounds for revoking foreign students' legal status, and recently paused scheduling of new interviews for student visas as it increases vetting of their social media activity. The government also has moved to block foreign students from attending Harvard as it pressures the Ivy League school to adopt a series of reforms.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to eliminate rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas, an action that Administrator Lee Zeldin said would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help \u201cunleash\u201d American energy.",
      "The EPA also proposed weakening a regulation that requires power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants that can harm the brain development of young children and contribute to heart attacks and other health problems in adults.",
      "The rollbacks are meant to fulfill Republican President Donald Trump's repeated pledge to \u201c unleash American energy \u201d and make it more affordable for Americans to power their homes and operate businesses.",
      "If approved and made final, the plans would reverse efforts by Democratic President Joe Biden's administration to address climate change and improve conditions in areas heavily burdened by industrial pollution, mostly in low-income and majority Black or Hispanic communities.",
      "The power plant rules are among about 30 environmental regulations that Zeldin targeted in March when he announced what he called the \u201cmost consequential day of deregulation in American history.\u201d",
      "Zeldin said Wednesday the new rules would help end what he called the Biden and Obama administrations\u2019 \u201cwar on so much of our U.S. domestic energy supply.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe American public spoke loudly and clearly last November,'' he added in a speech at EPA headquarters. \u201cThey wanted to make sure that \u2026 no matter what agency anybody might be confirmed to lead, we are finding opportunities to pursue common-sense, pragmatic solutions that will help reduce the cost of living \u2026 create jobs and usher in a golden era of American prosperity.\u201d",
      "Environmental and public health groups called the rollbacks dangerous and vowed to challenge the rules in court.",
      "Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate & Health, called the proposals \u201cyet another in a series of attacks\u201d by the Trump administration on the nation's \u201chealth, our children, our climate and the basic idea of clean air and water.\u201d",
      "She called it \u201cunconscionable to think that our country would move backwards on something as common sense as protecting children from mercury and our planet from worsening hurricanes, wildfires, floods and poor air quality driven by climate change.\u201d",
      "\u201cIgnoring the immense harm to public health from power plant pollution is a clear violation of the law,'' added Manish Bapna, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cIf EPA finalizes a slapdash effort to repeal those rules, we\u2019ll see them in court.\u201d",
      "The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press examination that included the agency\u2019s own prior assessments and a wide range of other research.",
      "It\u2019s by no means guaranteed that the rules will be entirely eliminated \u2014 they can\u2019t be changed without going through a federal rulemaking process that can take years and requires public comment and scientific justification.",
      "Even a partial dismantling of the rules would mean more pollutants such as smog, mercury and lead \u2014 and especially more tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs and cause health problems, the AP analysis found. It would also mean higher emissions of greenhouse gases, driving Earth\u2019s warming to deadlier levels.",
      "Biden, a Democrat, had made fighting climate change a hallmark of his presidency. Coal-fired power plants would be forced to capture smokestack emissions or shut down under a strict EPA rule issued last year. Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting a reliable, long-term supply of electricity.",
      "The power sector is the nation\u2019s second-largest contributor to climate change, after transportation.",
      "In its proposed regulation, the Trump EPA argues that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-fired power plants \u201cdo not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution\u201d or climate change and therefore do not meet a threshold under the Clean Air Act for regulatory action. Greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired plants \u201care a small and decreasing part of global emissions,'' the EPA said, adding: \u201cThis Administration\u2019s priority is to promote the public health or welfare through energy dominance and independence secured by using fossil fuels to generate power.\u201d",
      "The Clean Air Act allows the EPA to limit emissions from power plants and other industrial sources if those emissions significantly contribute to air pollution that endangers public health.",
      "If fossil fuel plants no longer meet the EPA\u2019s threshold, the Trump administration may later argue that other pollutants from other industrial sectors don\u2019t either and therefore shouldn\u2019t be regulated, said Meghan Greenfield, a former EPA and Justice Department lawyer now in private practice at Jenner & Block LLP.",
      "The EPA proposal \u201chas the potential to have much, much broader implications,\u201d she said.",
      "Zeldin, a former New York congressman, said the Biden-era rules were designed to \u201csuffocate our economy in order to protect the environment,\u201d with the intent to regulate the coal industry \u201cout of existence\u201d and make it \u201cdisappear.\u201d",
      "National Mining Association president and CEO Rich Nolan applauded the new rules, saying they remove \u201cdeliberately unattainable standards\u201d for clean air while \u201cleveling the playing field for reliable power sources, instead of stacking the deck against them.\u201d",
      "But Dr. Howard Frumkin, a former director of the National Center for Environmental Health and professor emeritus at the University of Washington School of Public Health, said Zeldin and Trump were trying to deny reality.",
      "\u201cThe world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal- and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms and many other health threats,\u201d Frumkin said. \u201cThese are indisputable facts. If you torpedo regulations on power plant greenhouse gas emissions, you torpedo the health and well-being of the American public and contribute to leaving a world of risk and suffering to our children and grandchildren.\u201d",
      "A paper published earlier this year in the journal Science found the Biden-era rules could reduce U.S. power sector carbon emissions by 73% to 86% below 2005 levels by 2040, compared with a reduction of 60% to 83% without the rules.",
      "\u201cCarbon emissions in the power sector drop at a faster rate with the (Biden-era) rules in place than without them,\u201d said Aaron Bergman, a fellow at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research institution and a co-author of the Science paper. The Biden rule also would result in \u201csignificant reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, pollutants that harm human health,\u201d he said.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is defending his decision to order National Guard troops to provide security during immigrations raids in Los Angeles",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended his decision to order troops to provide security during federal immigration raids in Los Angeles, telling senators on Wednesday it's about \u201cmaintaining law and order.\u201d",
      "Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., condemned the move as illegal, saying it erodes military readiness and questioning how it is being funded. It was the second day of harsh congressional questioning for Hegseth on the deployment of troops over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, continued military aid to Ukraine, a deal on a gifted Qatari jet and more.",
      "\u201cThe mission in Los Angeles, as you know well, sir, is not about lethality,\u201d Hegseth said in response to questions. \u201cIt\u2019s about maintaining law and order on behalf of law enforcement agents who deserve to do their job without being attacked by mobs of people.\u201d",
      "The exchange underscored confusion about the deployment of more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to provide security at the immigration protests and operations in Los Angeles. Photos have shown Guard troops setting a security perimeter around agents as they make arrests in the city, moving them closer to law enforcement functions, which by law they are not allowed to do.",
      "About 2,000 of the Guard soldiers are in place in Los Angeles, initially sent to provide security. The Marines are at a nearby base and have not yet been used.",
      "Speaking at a Senate defense appropriations subcommittee hearing, Reed said law and order is a civil function, not a job for the U.S. military. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., added that the California deployment, along with President Donald Trump's threat to use force against protesters at the Army's 250th anniversary parade on Saturday, \u201cshould stop every one of us cold.\u201d",
      "She added that \u201cthreatening to use our own troops on our own citizens at such scale is unprecedented. It is unconstitutional. And it is downright un-American.\u201d",
      "Asked later what constitutional authority the department is using to deploy active duty Marines to the protests, Hegseth said he didn't know the specific provision but would provide it.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was testifying alongside Hegseth, was asked whether he sees evidence of \u201crebellion\u201d in the U.S. That could be used to invoke the Insurrection Act to use the military for law enforcement functions.",
      "\u201cThere are definitely some frustrated folks out there,\u201d Caine said in response.",
      "Answering the same question, Hegseth repeated Trump\u2019s argument that \u201cthere has been an invasion\u201d of migrants entering the country without legal permission, and he said the protests in Los Angeles could spread to other areas.",
      "Caine, asked if he believes the U.S. is being invaded by a foreign power, said, \u201cI don\u2019t see any foreign, state-sponsored folks invading, but I\u2019ll be mindful of the fact that there have been some border issues.\u201d",
      "Hegseth also faced bipartisan criticism for failing to provide details about the administration\u2019s first proposed defense budget and over an array of other decisions he's made during his tenure.",
      "The panel's chairman, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other senators expressed frustration that Congress has not yet gotten a full defense budget from the Trump administration and that the current level does not have the U.S. spending enough on defense.",
      "McConnell also noted that the limited budget request that lawmakers have received has no funding for Ukraine security assistance, questioning whether that makes \u201clasting peace\u201d more or less likely.",
      "Hegseth, in his opening remarks, said the department needed more time to pull a spending plan together but that he has moved quickly to kill wasteful programs and redirect funding to Trump\u2019s priorities.",
      "Hegseth said a negotiated peace in Ukraine makes America look strong, even though Russia is the aggressor. He said the budget includes hard choices and \u201creflects the reality that Europe needs to step up more for the defense of its own continent. And President Trump deserves the credit for that.\"",
      "Hegseth said some U.S. security spending for Ukraine is still in the pipeline, but he provided no details.",
      "Hegseth repeatedly refused to provide details on plans for the Defense Department to accept a 747 jet offered by Qatar for use as Air Force One. He said budgeting and schedules for security upgrades to turn the plane into the president's aircraft are classified.",
      "Hegseth confirmed reports that the Qataris have not come to an agreement with the Trump administration over a memo that would allow the military to take possession of the aircraft.",
      "That also means no contracts have been signed to move forward on overhauling the Qatari jet.",
      "He refused to answer questions on the cost or potential timeframe of that upgrade \u2014 even though data on two other 747s being reconditioned by Boeing to serve as Air Force One is public.",
      "\u201cA memorandum of understanding remains to be signed,\u201d Hegseth said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is looking to cancel $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress. That's just a sliver of the $1.7 trillion that lawmakers OK'd for the budget year ending Sept. 30.",
      "The package of 21 budget rescissions will have to be approved by both chambers of Congress for the cuts to take place, beginning with a House vote expected Thursday. Otherwise, the spending remains in place.",
      "The White House is betting that cutting federal investments in public media and some foreign aid programs will prove politically popular. Republicans say if this first effort is successful, they hope more rescission packages will follow as they look to continue work by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency once run by billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "Democrats describe the cuts as inhumane and say they would rip life-saving support from hungry and sick people across the globe. Republicans are describing the cuts as \u201cmodest\u201d and say the U.S. will continue to play a critical role in helping the world's most vulnerable people.",
      "Here's a look at some of the spending the White House is trying to claw back:",
      "The Republican president has asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it's slated to receive during the next two budget years. Congress has traditionally provided public media with advanced funds to reduce political pressures.",
      "The corporation distributes the money mostly to public television and radio stations around the country, with some assigned to National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting System to support national programming.",
      "The White House says the public media system is politically biased and an unnecessary expense.",
      "Much of the conservatives' ire is focused on NPR and PBS. \u201cWe believe that you all can hate us on your own dime,\u201d said Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, during a hearing in March.",
      "But about two-thirds of the money goes to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Nearly half of those stations serve rural areas of the country.",
      "\u201cThey want to punish the national guys, that's fine,\u201d said Rep. Mark Amodei, a Republican who said he was undecided going into this week's vote. \u201cBut I'm trying to get a handle on what it means for my stations in Nevada, because the ability to fundraise at the national level ain't the same as the ability to fundraise in Reno.\u201d",
      "The association representing local public television stations warns that many of them would be forced to close if the GOP bill passes. Those stations provide emergency alerts, free educational programming and high school sports coverage and highlight hometown heroes.",
      "Meanwhile, local radio stations say their share of the allocation provides funding for 386 stations employing nearly 10,000 people. Dozens of stations rely on the public grants for more than half of their budget. Many others for nearly half.",
      "Some Republicans say they worry about what the cuts would mean for local public stations but tough decisions are necessary.",

      "\u201cSo these rescissions are not going to be comfortable for South Dakota to deal with,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat being said, we're $37 trillion in debt.\"",
      "Trump's administration is looking to claw back about $900 million from $10 billion that Congress has approved for global health programs.",
      "That includes canceling $500 million for activities related to infectious diseases and child and maternal health and another $400 million to address the global HIV epidemic.",
      "The administration says the $500 million rescission for infectious diseases would not reduce treatment but would \u201celiminate programs that are antithetical to American interests and worsen the lives of women and children, like \u2018family planning\u2019 and \u2018reproductive health,\u2019 LGBTQI+ activities, and equity programs.\u201d It makes a similar assurance on the HIV funding, saying it would eliminate \u201conly those programs that neither provide life-saving treatment nor support American interests.\u201d",
      "Scores of humanitarian aid groups have asked lawmakers to oppose the proposed cuts. Catholic Relief Services called on donors to contact their members of Congress to urge them to vote against the bill. Without the U.S. assistance, \"countless lives are at risk, and the needs will continue to rise,\u201d said the plea to supporters.",
      "The importance of the United States' contribution to the global\u202fHIV\u202fresponse cannot be overstated, according to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS. It says the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, has saved more than 26 million lives and averted almost 5 million new HIV infections since it was launched in 2003 under President George W. Bush, a Republican.",
      "\u201cInstead of facing a death sentence, people supported by PEPFAR are raising families, building their communities, and helping their communities grow and develop,\u201d said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn.",
      "The Trump administration is looking to cancel $800 million, or a quarter of the amount Congress approved, for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation, and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country. The program also helps vetted refugees who come to the U.S. get started in their new country.",

      "Refugees International urged Congress to reject what it described as a reckless proposal.",
      "About 45% of the savings sought by the White House would come from two programs designed to boost the economies, democratic institutions and civil societies in developing countries.",
      "The administration wants to claw back $2.5 billion of the $3.9 billion approved for the Development Assistance program at the U.S. Agency for International Development and about $1.7 billion, or nearly half of the funds, dedicated to the State Department's Economic Support Fund.",
      "The administration says in its request to Congress that the Development Assistance account is supposed to fund programs that work to end extreme poverty and promote resilient democratic societies, but in practice many of the programs \u201cconflict with American values\u201d and bankroll corrupt leaders' evasion of responsibilities to their citizens while providing \"no clear benefit to Americans.\u201d",

      "The upcoming parade in Washington to celebrate the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary has divided veterans",
      "NORFOLK, Va. -- James McDonough served in the U.S. Army for 27 years, fighting in Vietnam and delivering humanitarian aid to Rwanda. For him, Saturday\u2019s military parade in Washington for the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary \u2014 coinciding with President Donald Trump's birthday \u2014 is about the resilience of a vital institution and the nation it serves.",
      "\u201cThe soldiers marching that day represent all of that history,\u201d said McDonough, 78, of Crofton, Maryland. \u201cThey don\u2019t represent a single day. They don\u2019t represent a single person. It\u2019s the American Army still standing straight, walking tall, ready to defend our country.\u201d",
      "Christopher Purdy, an Army veteran who served in Iraq, called the parade a facade that paints over some of the Republican president\u2019s policies that have targeted military veterans and current service members, including cuts at the Department of Veterans Affairs and a ban on transgender troops.",
      "Purdy said the parade, long sought by Trump, will needlessly display U.S. military might on the president\u2019s 79th birthday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d said Purdy, 40, of Atlanta. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive. And whatever his reasons are for doing it, I think it\u2019s entirely unnecessary.\u201d",
      "Until recently, the Army\u2019s long-planned birthday celebration did not include a big parade. Added under the Trump administration, the event, featuring hundreds of military vehicles and aircraft and thousands of soldiers, has divided veterans.",
      "Some liken it to the military chest-pounding commonly seen in North Korea, a step toward authoritarianism or a perverse birthday party for Trump.",
      "Others see it as a once-in-a-lifetime accounting of the Army's achievements and the military service of millions of soldiers over centuries. The parade is not about Trump, they say, but the public seeing the faces of soldiers when so few Americans serve.",
      "The Army expects up to 200,000 people could attend and says the parade will cost an estimated $25 million to $45 million.",
      "Trump, speaking at Fort Bragg this week, said Saturday would be \u201ca big day\" and noted \"we want to show off a little bit.\"",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to celebrate our greatness and our achievements,\" he said. \"This week, we honor 250 years of valor and glory and triumph by the greatest fighting force ever to walk the face of the Earth: the United States Army.\u201d",
      "For Edmundo Eugenio Martinez Jr., an Army veteran who fought in Iraq, the parade is a missed opportunity to honor generations of veterans, many of whom paid a steep price and came home to little fanfare.",
      "\u201cSadly, the timing and the optics and divisive politics have ruined it,\u201d said Martinez, 48, of Katy, Texas. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not picking one side or the other. Both sides are guilty.\u201d",
      "Joe Plenzler, a retired Marine who fought in Iraq, said Trump wants to see troops saluting him on his birthday as tanks roll past.",
      "\u201cIt's just suspicious,\" the 53-year-old from Middletown, Virginia, said of the timing.",
      "\u201cI absolutely love the Army from the bottom of my cold black Marine heart,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the Army\u2019s birthday was a day later, we probably wouldn't be doing it. I\u2019d rather see that $50 million take care of the men and women who went off to war and came back with missing arms, legs and eyeballs, and with damaged brains.\u201d",
      "Joe Kmiech, who served in the Army and Minnesota National Guard from 1989 to 1998, supports the parade because the Army is \"part of American culture and our fabric.\u201d",
      "He notes the Army's pioneering contributions to engineering and medicine, from dams to new surgical techniques. Like many veterans, he has a strong familial connection: His father served in the Army, and so did his maternal grandfather, who fought in World War II.",
      "\u201cI didn't vote for President Trump, but the commander in chief is going to be part of that celebration,\u201d said Kmiech, 54, of Roberts, Wisconsin. \u201cThe distinction needs to be made that the parade is a celebration of our Army, not of a person.\u201d",
      "For Gulf War Army veteran Paul Sullivan, Trump and the parade are inextricably linked.",
      "\u201cThis Trump tank travesty is all about stroking Trump\u2019s ego,\u201d said Sullivan, 62, who lives outside Charlottesville, Virginia. \u201cIf Trump truly cared about our service members, he would sit down with them quietly and say, \u2018What can we do with $50 million or $100 million to make your lives better?\u2019 He\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "McDonough, the veteran from Crofton, Maryland, disagrees that the parade is about Trump or too costly. He said the U.S. held a grand celebration in New York after World War II when the nation was deeply in debt.",
      "\u201cWe certainly need to bring our debt down, and we certainly need to take care of our veterans,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a false dichotomy. It\u2019s like saying if we bought two less aircraft carriers, we could do so much better to take care of our poor.\u201d",
      "And McDonough said soldiers' oath is to the Constitution, not to Trump.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is set to take a seat at Wednesday's opening night of the award-winning musical \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\" at the Kennedy Center, where he replaced the previous leadership with loyalists, had himself installed as chairman and pledged to rid the performing arts venue of programming he has complained is \u201cwoke\u201d and too focused on leftist ideology and political correctness.",
      "The Republican president's attendance at the sold-out showing of the Tony Award-winning tale of redemption in 19th century France comes as he has focused more than any recent predecessor on the arts center along the Potomac River that is a memorial to a slain Democratic president.",
      "Presidents' involvement in the Kennedy Center's affairs had been limited to naming members to the board of trustees and attending the taping of its annual honors program in the fall.",
      "But after returning to office in January, Trump stunned the arts world by firing the Kennedy Center's longtime director and board and replacing them with loyalists, who then named him as chairman, and promising to overhaul its programming, management and even appearance as part of an effort to put his stamp on the national arts scene.",
      "Trump's appearance in the Opera House on Wednesday, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, will also mark his first time at a Kennedy Center performance as president. He avoided the venue after entertainment industry pushback to his policies in his first term in office, breaking with presidential tradition by never attending the annual Kennedy Center Honors taping.",
      "His moves have upset some of the center's patrons and performers.",
      "In March, the audience booed Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, after they slipped into upper-level seats in the Concert Hall to hear the National Symphony Orchestra. Trump appointed Usha Vance to the Kennedy Center board along with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Fox News Channel hosts Maria Bartiromo and Laura Ingraham, among other supporters.",
      "Sales of subscription packages are said to have declined since Trump's takeover, and several touring productions, including \u201cHamilton,\u201d have canceled planned runs at the center. Artists such as actor Issa Rae and musician Rhiannon Giddens scrapped scheduled appearances, and Kennedy Center consultants including musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming have resigned.",
      "Understudies may perform Wednesday night due to boycotts by \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d cast members.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has adopted a more aggressive posture toward the arts. The White House has taken steps to cancel millions of dollars in previously awarded federal humanities grants to arts and culture groups, and Trump\u2019s budget blueprint proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.",
      "Trump has also targeted Smithsonian museums by signing executive orders to restrict their funding and by attempting to fire the director of the National Portrait Gallery.",
      "Trump hosted the board at the White House for dinner in May and said congressional Republicans have pushed for more than $250 million for repairs and maintenance at the Kennedy Center. He claimed that \u201ctremendous amounts of money\u201d had been spent at the center but \u201cthey certainly didn't spend it on wallpaper, carpet or painting.\u201d",
      "He characterized previous programming as \u201cout of control with rampant political propaganda\u201d and said it featured \u201csome very inappropriate shows,\u201d including a \u201cMarxist anti-police performance\u201d and \u201cLesbian-only Shakespeare.\u201d",
      "Trump cited some drag show performances as a reason to take control of the center, though next season's theater lineup includes \u201dMrs. Doubtfire,\" which tells the story of a divorced man who disguises himself as a female nanny so he can spend time with his children.",
      "Trump also visited the Kennedy Center in March to preside over a board meeting and take a tour.",

      "It was first conceived in the late 1950s, during the administration of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, who backed a bill from the Democratic-led Congress calling for a National Culture Center. In the early 1960s, Democratic President John F. Kennedy launched a fundraising initiative, and his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, signed into law a 1964 bill renaming the project the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Kennedy had been assassinated the year before.",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers for a South Carolina death row inmate are heading to federal court to argue that the state is not properly carrying out executions",
      "Lawyers for a South Carolina death row inmate will be in federal court Wednesday trying to convince a judge that the state is not properly carrying out lethal injections or firing squad executions, an argument meant to spare the prisoner just two days before he's scheduled to die.",
      "Stephen Stanko's attorneys said the two doses of lethal injection drugs used in the past three executions by that method show those subjected to the procedure have died a lingering death, still conscious as they felt like they were drowning when fluid rushed into their lungs.",
      "Stanko changed his mind and decided to die by lethal injection because of accounts about the last firing squad death.",
      "In that April execution, the volunteer shooters nearly missed Mikal Mahdi's heart, meaning the man convicted of killing an off-duty police officer took three to four times as long to die as he was supposed to, Stanko's lawyers said in court papers.",
      "One expert hired by Stanko's attorneys said the evidence suggests the firing squad may have aimed slightly below the target or the target was not placed on Mahdi's heart to \u201ccause great pain before his death,\u201d according to court papers filed last week.",
      "Lawyers for the state vigorously denied the claims. They point out that the South Carolina Supreme Court rejected a similar last-ditch appeal on May 28. They said every execution is different and that lawyers representing incarcerated people have not proven any condemned prisoner suffered gratuitous pain.",
      "\u201cSo (perhaps) it\u2019s not the method that\u2019s the issue \u2014 instead, these inmates just don\u2019t want to have their sentences carried out and are willing to make any argument that they can,\u201d wrote Grayson Lambert, a lawyer for South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster.",
      "Lawyers for the state will ask federal Judge Richard Gergel on Wednesday to dismiss the claims.",
      "Stanko would be the sixth inmate executed in South Carolina in nine months. There were originally four executions scheduled around the country this week, one in South Carolina and one each in Florida and Alabama. On Monday, an Oklahoma judge granted a temporary stay to a man scheduled to be put to death Thursday.",
      "Stanko, 57, is slated to die at 6 p.m. Friday at a Columbia prison for killing his 74-year-old friend, Henry Turner. Stanko went to Turner\u2019s Horry County home in April 2006 after lying about his father dying.",
      "Hours before killing Turner, Stanko beat and strangled his girlfriend in her Georgetown County home and raped her daughter before slashing the teen\u2019s throat. The daughter survived and testified against him at one of his trials. Stanko was also sentenced to death in that case.",
      "Stanko's lawyers, in their 49-page brief, include a number of ways their experts think South Carolina is improperly carrying out executions.",
      "They include using bullets in the firing squad that aren't powerful enough to guarantee the heart will be destroyed, failing to properly oversee how an IV line is placed for lethal injections and improper storage of the powerful sedative pentobarbital, which is used to kill inmates.",
      "The lawyers said the state is using two doses of pentobarbital in executions because \u2014 while inmates might be paralyzed by the drug \u2014 they remain conscious enough to feel like they are drowning and take longer than 10 minutes to die.",
      "Attorneys for the state said witnesses to the executions have not reported any signs of distress and said the inmates appeared to stop breathing within a minute or two.",
      "The most serious accusations in Stanko's lawsuit come from Dr. Jonathan Groner, an expert in lethal injection and other capital punishments and a surgeon who teaches at Ohio State University.",
      "\u201cI am concerned that some element of those responsible for carrying out Mr. Mahdi\u2019s execution intended not to hit his target and to cause great pain before his death,\u201d Groner wrote.",
      "State Correction Department officials deny anything went wrong in Mahdi's execution. Agency leaders have signed sworn statements saying that all three guns fired and no bullets or fragments were found in the death chamber after Mahdi's lawyers suggested one shot missed entirely.",
      "\u201cHow bullets react once they strike the body is something that neither SCDC nor the members of the firing squad can control. That one condemned inmate dies more quickly than another does not necessarily mean that something went awry in one execution,\u201d the state said.",
      "Complicating any investigation into Madhi's death is an inadequate autopsy. It did not include X-rays to allow the results to be independently verified. Only one photo was taken of Mahdi\u2019s body and there were no close-ups of the wounds. The inmate's clothing was not examined to determine where the target was placed or how it aligned with the damage the bullets caused, according to forensic pathologist Terri Haddix of California, one of the defense experts.",
      "Stanko's lawyers want to pause his execution to take a closer look at Mahdi's death and require the three firing squad members to take a sworn oath they will \u201cshoot at the target in good faith.\u201d",

    "summary": "Brian Wilson was one of the world's most influential recording artists.",
    "story": [
      "Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys' visionary and fragile leader whose genius for melody, arrangements and wide-eyed self-expression inspired \"Good Vibrations,\" \"California Girls\" and other summertime anthems and made him one of the world's most influential recording artists, has died, his family said in a statement posted to his website and social media\u00a0accounts. He was 82.",
      "\"We are heartbroken to announce that our beloved father Brian Wilson has passed away,\" the family said in Wednesday's statement. \"We are at a loss for words right now. Please respect our privacy at this time as our family is grieving. We realize that we are sharing our grief with the world.\"",
      "Further details weren't immediately available. Since May 2024, Wilson had been under a court conservatorship to oversee his personal and medical affairs, with Wilson's longtime representatives, publicist Jean Sievers and manager LeeAnn Hard, in charge.",
      "The eldest and last surviving of three musical brothers \u2014 Brian played bass, Carl lead guitar and Dennis drums \u2014 he and his fellow Beach Boys rose in the 1960s from local California band to national hitmakers to international ambassadors of surf and sun. Wilson himself was celebrated for his gifts and pitied for his demons. He was one of rock's great Romantics, a tormented man who in his peak years embarked on an ever-steeper path to aural perfection, the one true sound.",
      "\"It is indeed hard to talk about the influence of Brian Wilson just on music because he is a shaper of American myth and American culture,\" Joe Levy, a contributor to Rolling Stone and Billboard, told CBS News following the news of Wilson's death. \"Our popular ideas about California \u2014 a land of surf and sun \u2014 many of them come from Beach Boys songs.\"",
      "The Beach Boys rank among the most popular groups of the rock era, with more than 30 singles in the Top 40 and worldwide sales of more than 100 million. The 1966 album \"Pet Sounds\" was voted No. 2 in a 2003 Rolling Stone list of the best 500 albums, losing out, as Wilson had done before, to the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\" The Beach Boys, who also featured Wilson cousin Mike Love and childhood friend Al Jardine, were voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.",
      "Wilson feuded with Love over songwriting credits, but peers otherwise adored him beyond envy, from Elton John and Bruce Springsteen to Katy Perry and Carole King. The Who's drummer, Keith Moon, fantasized about joining the Beach Boys. Paul McCartney cited \"Pet Sounds\" as a direct inspiration on the Beatles and the ballad \"God Only Knows\" as among his favorite songs, often bringing him to tears.",
      "Wilson moved and fascinated fans and musicians long after he stopped having hits. In his later years, Wilson and a devoted entourage of younger musicians performed \"Pet Sounds\" and his restored opus, \"Smile,\" before worshipful crowds in concert halls. Meanwhile, The Go-Go's, Lindsey Buckingham, Animal Collective and Janelle Mon\u00e1e were among a wide range of artists who emulated him, whether as a master of crafting pop music or as a pioneer of pulling it apart.",
      "An endless summer",
      "The Beach Boys' music was like an ongoing party, with Wilson as host and wallflower. He was a tall, shy man, partially deaf (allegedly because of beatings by his father, Murry Wilson), with a sweet, crooked grin, and he rarely touched a surfboard unless a photographer was around. But out of the lifestyle that he observed and such musical influences as Chuck Berry and the Four Freshmen, he conjured a golden soundscape \u2014 sweet melodies, shining harmonies, vignettes of beaches, cars and girls \u2014 that resonated across time and climates.",
      "Decades after its first release, a Beach Boys song can still conjure instant summer \u2014 the wake-up guitar riff that opens \"Surfin' USA\"; the melting vocals of \"Don't Worry Baby\"; the chants of \"fun, fun, fun\" or \"good, good, GOOD, good vibrations\"; the behind-the-wheel chorus \"'Round, 'round, get around, I get around.\" Beach Boys songs have endured from turntables and transistor radios to boom boxes and iPhones, or any device that could lay on a beach towel or be placed upright in the sand.",
      "The band's innocent appeal survived the group's increasingly troubled backstory, whether Brian's many personal trials, the feuds and lawsuits among band members or the alcoholism of Dennis Wilson, who drowned in 1983. Brian Wilson's ambition raised the Beach Boys beyond the pleasures of their early hits and into a world transcendent, eccentric and destructive. They seemed to live out every fantasy, and many nightmares, of the California myth they helped create.",
      "From the suburbs to the national stage",
      "Brian Wilson was born June 20, 1942, two days after McCartney. His musical gifts were soon obvious, and as a boy he was playing piano and teaching his brothers to sing harmony. The Beach Boys started as a neighborhood act, rehearsing in Brian's bedroom and in the garage of their house in suburban Hawthorne, California. Surf music, mostly instrumental in its early years, was catching on locally: Dennis Wilson, the group's only real surfer, suggested they cash in. Brian and Love hastily wrote up their first single, \"Surfin,'\" a minor hit released in 1961.",
      "They wanted to call themselves the Pendletones, in honor of a popular flannel shirt they wore in early publicity photos. But when they first saw the pressings for \"Surfin,'\" they discovered the record label had tagged them \"The Beach Boys.\"",
      "Other decisions were handled by their father, a musician of some frustration who hired himself as manager and holy terror. By mid-decade, Murry Wilson had been displaced and Brian, who had been running the band's recording sessions almost from the start, was in charge, making the Beach Boys the rare group of the time to work without an outside producer.",
      "Their breakthrough came in early 1963 with \"Surfin' USA,\" so closely modeled on Berry's \"Sweet Little Sixteen\" that Berry successfully sued to get a songwriting credit. It was their first Top 10 hit and a boast to the nation: \"If everybody had an ocean / across the USA / then everybody'd be surfin,' / like Cali-for-nye-ay.\" From 1963-66, they were rarely off the charts, hitting No. 1 with \"I Get Around\" and \"Help Me, Rhonda\" and narrowly missing with \"California Girls\" and \"Fun, Fun, Fun.\" For television appearances, they wore candy-striped shirts and grinned as they mimed their latest hit, with a hot rod or surfboard nearby.",
      "Their music echoed private differences. Wilson often contrasted his own bright falsetto with Love's nasal, deadpan tenor. The extroverted Love was out front on the fast songs, but when it was time for a slow one, Brian took over. \"The Warmth of the Sun\" was a song of despair and consolation that Wilson alleged \u2014 to some skepticism \u2014   he wrote the morning after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. \"Don't Worry Baby,\" a ballad equally intoxicating and heartbreaking, was a leading man's confession of doubt and dependence, an early sign of Brian's crippling anxieties.",
      "Stress and exhaustion led to a breakdown in 1964 and his retirement from touring, his place soon filled by Bruce Johnston, who remained with the group for decades. Wilson was an admirer of Phil Spector's \"Wall of Sound\" productions and emulated him on Beach Boys tracks, adding sleigh bells to \"Dance, Dance, Dance\" or arranging a mini-theme park of guitar, horns, percussion and organ as the overture to \"California Girls.\"",
      "By the mid-1960s, the Beach Boys were being held up as the country's answer to the Beatles, a friendly game embraced by each group, transporting pop music to the level of \"art\" and leaving Wilson a broken man.",
      "The Beach Boys vs. the Beatles",
      "The Beatles opened with \"Rubber Soul,\" released in late 1965 and their first studio album made without the distractions of movies or touring. It was immediately praised as a major advance, the lyrics far more personal and the music far more subtle and sophisticated than such earlier hits as \"She Loves You\" and \"A Hard Day's Night.\" Wilson would recall getting high and listening to the record for the first time, promising himself he would not only keep up with the British band, but top them.",
      "Wilson worked for months on what became \"Pet Sounds,\" and months on the single \"Good Vibrations.\" He hired an outside lyricist, Tony Asher, and used various studios, with dozens of musicians and instruments ranging from violins to bongos to the harpsichord. The air seemed to cool on some tracks and the mood turn reflective, autumnal. From \"I Know There's an Answer\" to \"You Still Believe in Me,\" many of the songs were ballads, reveries, brushstrokes of melody, culminating in the sonic wonders of \"Good Vibrations,\" a psychedelic montage that at times sounded as if recorded in outer space.",
      "The results were momentous, yet disappointing. \"Good Vibrations\" was the group's first million-seller and \"Pet Sounds,\" which included the hits \"Sloop John B\" and \"Wouldn't It Be Nice,\" awed McCartney, John Lennon and Eric Clapton among others. Widely regarded as a new kind of rock LP, it was more suited to headphones than to the radio, a \"concept\" album in which individual songs built to a unified experience, so elaborately crafted in the studio that \"Pet Sounds\" couldn't be replicated live with the technology of the time. Wilson was likened not just to the Beatles, but to Mozart and George Gershwin, whose \"Rhapsody in Blue\" had inspired him since childhood.",
      "But the album didn't chart as highly as previous Beach Boys releases and was treated indifferently by the U.S. record label, Capitol. The Beatles, meanwhile, were absorbing lessons from the Beach Boys and teaching some in return. \"Revolver\" and \"Sgt. Pepper,\" the Beatles' next two albums, drew upon the Beach Boys' vocal tapestries and melodic bass lines and even upon the animal sounds from the title track of \"Pet Sounds.\" The Beatles' epic \"A Day in the Life\" reconfirmed the British band as kings of the pop world and \"Sgt. Pepper\" as the album to beat.",
      "All eyes turned to Wilson and his intended masterpiece \u2014 a \"teenage symphony to God\" he called \"Smile.\" It was a whimsical cycle of songs on nature and American folklore written with lyricist Van Dyke Parks. The production bordered on method acting; for a song about fire, Wilson wore a fire helmet in the studio. The other Beach Boys were confused, and strained to work with him. A shaken Wilson delayed \"Smile,\" then canceled it.",
      "Remnants, including the songs \"Heroes and Villains\" and \"Wind Chimes\" were re-recorded and issued in September 1967 on \"Smiley Smile,\" dismissed by Carl Wilson as a \"bunt instead of a grand slam.\" The stripped down \"Wild Honey,\" released three months later, became a critical favorite but didn't restore the band's reputation. The Beach Boys soon descended into an oldies act, out of touch with the radical '60s, and Wilson withdrew into seclusion.",
      "Years of struggle, and late life validation",
      "Addicted to drugs and psychologically helpless, sometimes idling in a sandbox he had built in his living room, Wilson didn't fully produce another Beach Boys record for years. Their biggest hit of the 1970s was a greatest hits album, \"Endless Summer,\" that also helped reestablish them as popular concert performers.",
      "Although well enough in the 21st century to miraculously finish \"Smile\" and tour and record again, Wilson had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and baffled interviewers with brief and disjointed answers. Among the stranger episodes of Wilson's life was his relationship with Dr. Eugene Landy, a psychotherapist accused of holding a Svengali-like power over him. A 1991 lawsuit from Wilson's family blocked Landy from Wilson's personal and business affairs.",
      "His first marriage, to singer Marilyn Rovell, ended in divorce and he became estranged from daughters Carnie and Wendy, who would help form the pop trio Wilson Phillips. His life stabilized in 1995 with his marriage to Melinda Ledbetter, who gave birth to two more daughters, Daria and Delanie. He also reconciled with Carnie and Wendy and they sang together on the 1997 album \"The Wilsons.\" (Melinda Ledbetter died in 2024.)",
      "In 1992, Brian Wilson eventually won a $10 million out-of-court settlement for lost songwriting royalties. But that victory and his 1991 autobiography, \"Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story,\" set off other lawsuits that tore apart the musical family.",
      "Carl Wilson and other relatives believed the book was essentially Landy's version of Brian's life and questioned whether Brian had even read it. Their mother, Audree Wilson, unsuccessfully sued publisher HarperCollins because the book said she passively watched as her husband beat Brian as a child. Love successfully sued Brian Wilson, saying he was unfairly deprived of royalties after contributing lyrics to dozens of songs. He would eventually gain ownership of the band's name.",
      "The Beach Boys still released an occasional hit single: \"Kokomo,\" made without Wilson, hit No. 1 in 1988. Wilson, meanwhile, released such solo albums as \"Brian Wilson\" and \"Gettin' In Over My Head,\" with cameos by McCartney and Clapton among others. He also completed a pair of albums for the Walt Disney label \u2014 a collection of Gershwin songs and music from Disney movies. In 2012, surviving members of the Beach Boys reunited for a 50th anniversary album, which quickly hit the Top 10 before the group again bickered and separated.",
      "Wilson won two competitive Grammys, for the solo instrumental \"Mrs. O'Leary's Cow\" and for \"The Smile Sessions\" box set. Otherwise, his honors ranged from a Grammy lifetime achievement prize to a tribute at the Kennedy Center to induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2018, he returned to his old high school in Hawthorne and witnessed the literal rewriting of his past: The principal erased an \"F\" he had been given in music and awarded him an \"A.\"",

    "story": [
      "A jury found Harvey Weinstein guilty of one count in his\u00a0sexual assault retrial\u00a0as they returned a partial verdict after days of deliberations.",
      "Weinstein, 73, faced three charges. He was accused of third-degree rape, and two counts of first-degree criminal sexual assault.",
      "The jury told the judge they found Weinstein guilty of criminal sexual assault against\u00a0Miriam Haley.",
      "The jury found Weinstein not guilty of criminal sexual assault regarding accuser\u00a0Kaja Sokola.",
      "The jury told the judge they have not reached a verdict on the charge of third degree rape involving Jessica Mann. The judge sent the jury home for the day, and told them they would continue to deliberate on that count Thursday.",
      "Jury foreperson reports alleged threat from fellow juror",
      "The jury is made up of seven women and five men. They started deliberating on June 5. The verdict came after days of apparently tense deliberations, with jurors sending notes to the judge asking to speak with him privately. Weinstein's defense attorneys has repeatedly asked for a mistrial.",
      "Wednesday, the jury foreperson asked to speak to the judge in private, saying there was infighting going on between the jurors over the rape count, with one allegedly telling another they'd meet them outside one day as an apparent threat.",
      "According to a transcript, the foreperson said, \"Somebody talk to me, 'Oh, we will see you outside,' because I got my decision. I say, 'No, that's my personal decision. You don't have to change me.'\"",
      "That prompted the defense attorney to call for a mistrial and suggest the juror file a complaint with police.",
      "Despite all the fighting between attorneys, Weinstein himself then said, \"This isn't fair. This isn't right. I'm the one on trial. This is my life that's on the line, I am not getting a fair trial. You are endangering me.\"",
      "Weinstein's defense attorney Arthur Aidala told the judge he was disgusted by what was happening. The judge told Aidala the tension in the jury room appears to be schoolyard antics.",

      "Accusers Kaja Sokola, Jessica Mann, Miriam Haley speak out",
      "Because the jury is still deliberating on the remaining count, neither the prosecutors nor defense attorneys could comment about the outcome to the press. Weinstein's publicist, however, said the split verdict is still a win.",
      "\"So today we consider this a victory, a win for us, because he beat the toughest charge, which was Kaja Sokola, which is the new charge, which meant that the clock would've had to start ticking again,\" publicist Juda Engelmayer said, \"whereas on the other two, he's already served time for them. So whatever time he might get on this, he's already served five-and-a-half, six years.\"",
      "But the lawyer for Sokola said this is a victory for all women who testified and survivors everywhere Even though Weinstein was not found guilty on her count, the lawyer said Sokola's truth was heard, and her testimony helped bring down a man who believed he was untouchable.",
      "\"I'm very happy he's convicted. That's all that matters,\" Sokola said.",
      "\"I knew how hard it is to prove reasonable doubt for a crime that happened almost 20 years ago. I made sure Kaja knew it, too, and she still stood in her truth, and history is going to remember her for that,\" attorney Lindsay Goldbrum said.",
      "\"I truly hope from the bottom of my heart that standing right here now will give courage to others to speak up, to don't suffer in silence. Because suffering and living with a trauma like this without sharing with other people is like cancer, it can eat you alive,\" Sokola said.",
      "Gloria Allred, Haley's attorney, called her client \"the real hero of this case ... because he was convicted not once but twice based on her testimony.\"",
      "\"The defense set a very disruptive and chaotic tone from the very beginning of this trial, which I suppose was meant to distract jury from undeniable facts. And I'm so grateful that they saw through the nonsense and the antics,\" Haley said.",
      "In a statement, Haley said the verdict gives her hope.",
      "\"Hope that there is a new awareness around sexual violence, and that the myth of the 'perfect victim' is fading. I hope this result empowers others to speak out and seek justice,\" she wrote, in part.",
      "Mann released a statement.",
      "\"I would never lie about rape or use something so traumatic to hurt someone,\" Mann said in her statement. \"Coming forward cost me everything. My privacy, my safety. I laid bare my trauma, my shame \u2013 everything I'd tried to bury just to keep living. Still, I stood up and told the truth. Again and again.\"",
      "Legal expert on Wednesday's happenings",
      "\"This is really rare,\" said Rich Schoenstein, vice chair of litigation practice at Tarter Krinsky & Drogin. \"We're well into deliberations, and the jury essentially said we've agreed on two of the three counts. On one of the counts, we find him guilty. On another of the counts, we find him not guilty. And on the third count we haven't been able to reach a decision. And remember, each count is basically a different victim ... this is just a different decision with respect to each of three women.\"",
      "The charges against Harvey Weinstein",
      "The trial involved accusations from three women:\u00a0Haley, Mann and Sokola.",
      "Haley and Sokola both testified Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on each of them on separate occasions \u2013 Haley at Weinstein's apartment in July 2006 and Sokola at a Manhattan hotel sometime in late April or early May 2006.",
      "Mann testified Weinstein raped her at a New York hotel in 2013.",
      "All three accusers took the stand during the trial, along with Sokola's former roommate and an ex-aide who worked for Weinstein's film production company. Weinstein himself decided not to testify, his attorney said.",
      "Haley and Mann's accusations were the focus of Weinstein's original 2020 trial. Sokola came forward with her accusations as that trial was ongoing, and the related charges were added to the retrial.",
      "Harvey Weinstein trial timeline",
      "These charges date back to October 2017 when a bombshell expos\u00e9 into Weinstein's alleged misconduct was published in The New York Times, sparking the #MeToo movement.",
      "He surrendered to police in Lower Manhattan months later, in May 2018, and was arraigned on multiple sex assault charges, some of which were later tossed.",
      "As his New York trial got underway in January 2020, he was also indicted on separate sex assault charges in Los Angeles.",
      "On Feb. 24, 2020, after five days of deliberations, Weinstein was found guilty of third-degree rape and criminal sexual act. He was acquitted of three other counts, including predatory sexual assault. The following month, he was sentenced to 23 years in prison.",
      "In December 2022, a Los Angeles jury found Weinstein guilty of three counts of sexual assault, including rape. Two months later, he was sentenced to 16 years in prison on those charges.",
      "Weinstein's 2020 conviction was overturned by the State of New York Court of Appeals in April 2024\u00a0because the judge in the original trial allowed prosecutors to call alleged victims whose accusations were not part of the charges against Weinstein.",
      "The retrial began April 23, 2025, with Weinstein facing an additional new sex crime charge. The trial lasted just over five weeks, with closing arguments given on June 3. Jury deliberations began June 5.",

    "story": [
      "The 2025 Tribeca Festival continues this week with movie screenings, Q&As, industry panel discussions and public performances across New York City. But one program in this year's festival takes place in virtual worlds.",
      "For more than a decade, Tribeca has been expanding its focus beyond cinema and television to include new avenues of storytelling through the use of virtual reality, augmented reality, and other nascent technologies, producing some vivid immersive displays. Even if the storytelling aspect of the programs were limited, the artistic expressions could be powerful. This was especially true with past exhibits that enveloped the viewer in massive spaces, in which computer-generated imagery or time-lapse photography placed the viewer in new worlds, from exploding galaxies to swirling blood vessels.",
      "Hosted under the umbrella title \"In Search of Us,\"\u00a0this year's installation in Lower Manhattan ties 11 projects together under the rubric of impacts on humanity \u2014 exploring topics from artificial intelligence to climate change, war, school shootings and transphobia. The exhibits with the most profound effects are those with the strongest and most emotional stories embedded inside them.",
      "Within a simple, delineated space furnished with minimal furniture, \"Fragile Home,\" by Ond\u0159ej Moravec and Victoria Lopukhina, uses mixed reality to recreate a home in Ukraine that comes under bombardment. Wearing goggles, the viewer walks through a comfortable, well-appointed living room, past a dinner table and a purring cat, and looks outside the window to a peaceful vista \u2014 all of which, in a flash, is replaced by the home's bombed-out remains, vandalized with Russian forces' \"Z\" graffiti.",
      "The sense of violation is made so powerful in so simple a setting \u2014 and the recognition that such destruction is multiplied millions of times over is heart-wrenching. But the objects that survived \u2014 those with personal meaning to just a handful of people \u2013 become representations of resilience to many.",
      "\"Scent,\" by Alan Kwan, is a first-person cinematic game in which the player becomes a dog wandering a landscape, who observes people being attacked and killed by malevolent forces. In between avoiding bombs and gunfire, the dog helps guide the souls of those killed to become reincarnated. It's a meditative view of cruel violations impacting humanity and nature.",
      "Armed with a tablet, viewers of the augmented reality \"There Goes Nikki\" can wander a garden populated by virtual flowers, and a visualization of the late poet Nikki Giovanni reciting her poem, \"Quilting the Black-eyed Pea (We're going to Mars).\" By Idris Brewster, Michele Stephenson and Joe Brewster.",
      "How dangerous is artificial intelligence? How dumb is it? How snarky?\u00a0 \"AI & Me: The Confessional and AI Ego,\" directed by Daniela Nedovescu and Octavian Mot, provides viewers with an opportunity to become test subjects, as it were, to AI's judgmental streak. Upon sitting in a chair, the participant is captured on camera and analyzed by AI, which conjures up your name, personality traits, and goals. How close are they to reality? Prepare to get snarked. But if the AI program \"likes\" you? Your AI-altered image will turn up in its pantheon of favored carbon-based units (pictured above, right).",
      "Other exhibits are immersive representations of culture \u2014 some self-generated, some created by AI.",
      "\"Uncharted\" (VR, by Kidus Hailesilassie) combines footage of a dancer with spoken word and visualizations of symbols to become a rapturous demonstration of pan-African language and storytelling.",
      "The interactive \"New Maqam City,\" by MIPSTERZ, allows you to become a DJ, manipulating drum beat patterns recognizable in Muslim communities around the world to create a transcendent vibe.",
      "\"The Innocence of Unknowing\" is a video essay and AI project studying media coverage of mass shootings, projected within a simulated classroom. (Created by Ryat Yezbick and Milo Talwani through the MIT Open Documentary Lab.)",
      "One of the strongest impacts of any installation was made by \"In the Current of Being,\" by Cameron Kostopoulos. Using haptic VR, the viewer is literally strapped into a chair; electrodes are attached to your fingertips, arms, and torso, along with VR goggles. Interesting, you think. Then, the presentation begins, recounting the true story of a survivor of electroshock conversion therapy. (As a teenager, Carolyn Mercer had been \"treated\" with electrical shocks in an attempt to \"cure\" her from becoming trans.) As images of female beauty are flashed before you, electrical impulses throb across your body. Ironically, the creators' use of  haptic VR to demonstrate the harrowing effects of the pseudoscience of conversion therapy makes  one never want to have VR electrodes attached to your body.",
      "Beyond the confines of\u00a0 the exhibition space at 161 Water Street, the two-part \"The Power Loom and The Founders Pillars\" (by Lesiba Mabitsela, Meghna Singh and Simon Wood) includes a site-specific AR experience, visible on a mobile app six blocks away, at the New York Stock Exchange, creating a memorial to enslaved people once sold at the Wall Street Slave Market, established in the 18th century.",
      "While the Tribeca Festival proper concludes on June 15, \"In Search of Us,\" presented in partnership with Onassis ONX and Agog: The Immersive Media Institute, runs through June 29. For more details and ticket info click here.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 21:37:16 -0400",
    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired the previous roster of the CDC's vaccine advisers on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Wednesday he's naming eight new advisers to serve on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, after firing the committee's entire previous roster of 17 advisers.",
      "\"All of these individuals are committed to evidence-based medicine, gold-standard science, and common sense. They have each committed to demanding definitive safety and efficacy data before making any new vaccine recommendations,\" Kennedy said Wednesday in a post on X.",
      "Kennedy's picks circumvented the usual CDC process for selecting members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known as ACIP. In previous administrations, career agency officials \u2014 not political leaders \u2014 vetted potential experts before forwarding them to the department for the secretary's approval.",
      "The panel's influential recommendations are closely watched because they are directly tied to federal policies, like which vaccines insurers are required to cover.",
      "The picks announced by Kennedy include some close allies of the secretary and his inner circle. Several have a history of criticizing vaccine recommendations or questioning their safety.",
      "\"The speed with which these members were selected, and the lack of transparency in the process, does not help to restore public confidence and trust, and contributes to confusion and uncertainty,\" Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, said in a statement.",
      "Here is a look at those named:",
      "Dr. Robert Malone",
      "One of the Kennedy allies named to the committee, Dr. Robert Malone, worked on early research related to mRNA vaccine technology but was accused during the COVID-19 pandemic of spreading misinformation about the mRNA vaccines. He was with Kennedy and President Trump at the Trump election night celebration in Florida.",
      "\"On the basis of data from all over the world, approximately three years ago it was my impression that the risk/benefit ratio of these products did not merit continued use in any cohort,\" Malone posted last month on his Substack about the mRNA COVID vaccines.",
      "Like Kennedy, Malone has questioned the benefits of measles vaccines during the recent record outbreak in Texas, which killed two children, and he has promoted unproven treatments for the virus.",
      "Dr. Martin Kulldorff",
      "Another member picked by Kennedy is Dr. Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist who co-authored the pandemic-era Great Barrington Declaration criticizing COVID-19 restrictions, along with now-NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. Bhattacharya has described Kulldorff as a close friend.",
      "Kulldorff previously worked with the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, before authoring an opinion piece in 2021 criticizing the agency's decision to pause use of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine over safety concerns.",
      "He claimed he was fired from working with the committee over the opinion piece. Kulldorff later claimed he was fired from Harvard University for criticizing COVID-19 vaccine requirements.",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's own vaccines panel \u2014 the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee \u2014 was also named to the committee.",
      "Meissner opposed COVID-19 vaccine requirements for children. He also co-authored an opinion piece with now-FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary speaking out against masking of children during the pandemic.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, Ph.D., R.N.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses, was also a former member of the FDA vaccines panel.",
      "Pebsworth spoke at a 2020 meeting of the FDA vaccines committee, where she identified herself as the research director for the National Vaccine Information Center and \"mother of a child injured by his 15-month well-baby shots in 1998.\" She said the center's position was that any \"coercion and sanctions to persuade adults to take an experimental vaccine, or give it to their children, is unethical and unlawful.\"",
      "Retsef Levi, Ph.D.",
      "Kennedy also praised another pick, MIT professor Retsef Levi, saying: \"Dr. Levi has collaborated with public health agencies to evaluate vaccine safety, including co-authoring studies on mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and their association with cardiovascular risks.\"",
      "Levi previously called for more detailed data from the COVID-19 vaccine trials, suggesting that changes to how Pfizer's shot was produced may have caused side effects.",
      "But Levi\u00a0faced criticism\u00a0for a paper co-authored with Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, which was cited in the state's move to recommend that young men not get mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Experts\u00a0condemned\u00a0the paper for misleading methods that could inflate the risk.",
      "Dr. Michael A. Ross",
      "Kennedy said Dr. Michael A. Ross \"contributed to national strategies for cancer prevention and early detection, including those involving HPV immunization,\" working with the CDC's breast and cervical cancer committee.",
      "Ross is described by Kennedy as an obstetrics and gynecology professor at George Washington University and Virginia Commonwealth University, though his name does not appear on directories for either university. Spokespeople for the two institutions did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The investment firm Havencrest Capital Management lists Ross as a partner, and says he previously worked as an executive for India-based drugmaker Cadila Pharmaceutical.",
      "Dr. James Pagano",
      "Dr. James Pagano, described by Kennedy as a \"strong advocate for evidence-based medicine,\" has published two fiction titles about hospital medicine, but little about vaccines or medicine.",
      "\"Over the course of his medical career he has worked in a number of emergency departments in the greater L.A. area, including major trauma centers as well as smaller community hospitals. He has been the medical director of one ER or another for many years,\" describes an Amazon listing for one of his books in 2012.",
      "Records from the Medical Board of California list Pagano as being retired.",
      "Dr. Joseph Hibbeln",
      "Another Kennedy pick, Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, retired from the National Institutes of Health in 2020. His research portfolio previously covered nutritional intake of fatty acids like omega-3. Kennedy described him as bringing \"expertise in immune-related outcomes, psychiatric conditions, and evidence-based public health strategies.\"",
      "Hibbeln previously co-authored a study probing whether exposure during pregnancy to mercury was linked to autism, in the wake of now-debunked research that falsely suggested a mercury-based preservative that was previously used in vaccines was causing autism.",
      "Kennedy's monthslong search for new members",
      "Kennedy's picks cap a monthslong search that the secretary and his aides have conducted for replacements to the committee.",
      "Former CDC official Jeffrey Klausner, a professor at the USC Keck School of Medicine, said he was among those approached for suggestions early this year.",
      "Klausner criticized Kennedy's pick of Malone, calling him a \"a well-known promoter of various conspiracy theories and was advocating for use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID.\"",
      "\"Seems like his appointment is not consistent with some of Secretary Kennedy's public commitments,\" Klausner said.",
      "Kennedy told reporters on Monday that he was picking \"highly credentialed\" experts for the panel.",
      "\"We're going to bring people onto the ACIP panel, not anti-vaxxers, who are bringing people on who are credentialed scientists, who are highly credentialed physicians, who are going to do evidence-based medicine,\" he said.",
      "In an \"FAQ\" document shared with stakeholder groups, HHS said the department intended \"to ensure balanced membership in terms of the points of view represented.\"",

Typically as we move into summer, demand for eggs soften as people shift to consuming more meat and grilling outdoors,\" Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"People aren't making heavy breakfasts, so we don't see demand for eggs being as strong as it typically is during the winter months.\"",
      "While egg prices have declined for two consecutive months, down from $6.23 a dozen in March, they remain elevated compared with 12 months ago. In May 2024, a dozen eggs cost $2.70.",
      "David Ortega, a food economics professor at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch that containing avian flu explains most of the drop in egg prices.",
      "\"This is primarily due to a reduction in the number of commercial facilities that have been impacted by the bird flu,\" he said. \"A lot of bird flu activity in the beginning of the year led to a significant surge in egg prices, but those impacts have really lessened over the past couple of months.\"",
      "Wholesale egg prices began to decrease in March, according to Ortega, and the price drops are now starting to show up at the retail level.",
      "\"There's a bit of a lag before they reach consumers at the grocery store,\" he said.",
      "Yet the bird flu outbreak, which began in the spring of 2022, is not yet entirely contained and continues to impact the industry, Ortega cautioned. \"It's still very much an issue.\"",
      "A May outbreak at an Arizona layer farm affected nearly 1.4 million birds, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Consumer Price Index data shows that while overall food costs rose slightly in May, egg prices dropped.",
      "\"But egg prices are still substantially higher than they were 12 months ago, even after two months of decreases,\" House said.",

      "Much like a golf course, Venmo can bring some unexpected traps and other hazards.",
      "The popular payment app enables users to send requests and payments to Venmo accounts listed as public \u2014 a default setting that opened up a can of worms for the world's top golfer, Scottie Scheffler.",
      "Scheffler, 28, who is competing in the U.S. Open this week, said Tuesday that he deleted the app after receiving a string of unwanted financial requests and payments from strangers betting on his performance.",
      "\"That's why I had to get rid of my Venmo because I was either getting paid by people or people requesting me a bunch of money when I didn't win. It wasn't a good feeling,\" the 16-time PGA Tour winner recently told reporters, according to CBS Sports.",
      "While he occasionally received small payments after winning a game, Scheffler said he more typically got requests from gamblers looking to cash in if he had lost.",
      "\"I don't remember the most that somebody would send me,\" he said. \"Maybe a couple bucks here or there. That didn't happen nearly as much as the requests did.\"",
      "Ordinary Venmo users may not attract the same attention on the app as Scheffler, but they can still benefit from knowing how to protect their privacy on the payment platform.",
      "Read on for tips on how to navigate Venmo safely.",
      "What should I do if I get an unexpected payment or request on Venmo?",
      "With the proliferation on online scams, Venmo encourages its users to play it safe. If you get a payment from a stranger, Venmo says you should not accept the transfer, but instead contact the app's\u00a0support team.",
      "Likewise, payment requests from suspicious accounts, or people you don't know, should also be declined, the company says.",
      "\"In some cases, you may receive a payment request from someone who appears to be a friend or relative,\" Venmo warns on its website. \"This can be a common scam tactic, so we recommend contacting your friend or family member outside of Venmo to confirm the legitimacy of the request before taking any action.\"",

      "Paying your roommate for the electricity bill? Others might be able to see that transaction on Venmo, depending on your account settings.",
      "If your profile is public, which is the default setting on the app, then each of your payment transactions will appear on Venmo's main feed, making them visible to anyone online. That includes information on who you're paying, when you paid them and what you're paying them for \u2014 cue the pizza emoji.",
      "To limit the number of people who can see your transactions, you can switch your privacy settings to \"Friends only\" or \"Private.\" The \"Friends only\" setting makes your payment transactions visible to Venmo friends only. The \"Private\" setting, the most restrictive of the three options, limits payment visibility to the two parties engaged in the transaction. Venmo also allows you to retroactively change your transactions to private mode which would hide your entire payment history, according to a company spokesperson.",
      "If you're paying or requesting money from someone who has different privacy setting than you, Venmo will default to whoever's setting is more restrictive.",
      "For example, if your account is private and you're making a payment to someone with a public account, the payment will automatically be private, and only visible to you and the recipient.",

    "summary": "The federal government now spends more on servicing its debt than it does on defense. The GOP's new tax bill could ratchet that higher, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Republicans' \"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0is uniting everyone from Elon Musk to Wall Street over an issue that experts say could pose a threat to the nation's long-term fiscal stability: the rising cost of servicing the U.S. government's growing mountain of debt.",
      "The U.S. spent $1.1 trillion in interest on its debt in 2024 \u2014 almost double the amount it was paying five years ago, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. The nation now spends more on interest payments than it does on defense,\u00a0data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows.",
      "Those costs could rise even more under the Republican tax and spending bill now being considered in the Senate, according to a June 5 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office. The version of the tax bill\u00a0passed by the House last month is projected to increase the federal deficit \u2014 the gap between what the federal government spends each year and what it collects in revenue \u2014 by $2.4 trillion over the next decade, the nonpartisan agency found.",
      "That would require the government to raise additional debt, resulting in additional interest payments of about $550 billion over the next decade, the CBO forecasts. By 2035, interest on the nation's debt could reach $1.8 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think tank focused on fiscal issues.",
      "\"The interest costs now are bigger than defense spending, which is an extraordinary,\" Chris Edwards, an expert on federal tax issues at the Cato Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The budget threat here is that all of these increasing federal interest costs will crowd out all the other priorities in the federal budget that the policymakers want to spend on.\"",
      "In other words, the federal government could struggle to support vital programs like Social Security as a larger share of its budget is eaten up by interest payments on the nation's swelling debt.",
      "Federal interest payments as a share of the nation's gross domestic product stood at 3% last year,\u00a0according\u00a0to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. If current trends holds, that could rise to 4.1% of GDP by 2035, the nonpartisan Peter G. Peterson Foundation estimates.",
      "Democrats have pointed to analyses showing the bill's tax cuts will benefit wealthier Americans far more than low- and middle-income workers while also adding to the national debt.",
      "\"No single piece of legislation in my time here in Congress will do more to add to the national debt than this one,\" Rep. Brendan Boyle, a Democrat from Pennsylvania who voted against the legislation,\u00a0said\u00a0last month on the House floor.",
      "Many Republicans, however, point to the bill's proposed tax cuts as providing an avenue for economic growth. \"We are going to celebrate a new golden age in America,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said last month after the bill passed in the House.",
      "Concerns from Elon Musk, Wall Street",
      "The cost of paying for the nation's debt has drawn concern from many corners, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who earlier this month posted about it on social media as he voiced his objections to the GOP bill.",
      "\"Congress is spending America into bankruptcy!\" Musk posted on June 5, pointing to data showing that interest payments have risen from $416 billion in 2014 to more than $1 trillion in 2024.",
      "Moody's Ratings downgraded U.S. credit\u00a0last month, citing among its reasons the mounting concerns about the nation's increasing debt load and interest payments.",
      "\"Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,\" the credit rating agency said. \"Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat.\"",
      "Moody's added, \"In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher.\"",
      "On June 7, the White House said in a memo that the GOP tax bill \"significantly improves our nation's fiscal trajectory by including $1.7 trillion in mandatory savings,\" while President Trump's tax cuts will spur economic growth.",
      "Some economic forecasters project that Mr. Trump's tariffs will drag down U.S. growth. The nation's growth could slide to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% next year partly because of those import levies, a sharp reduction from the 2.8% growth recorded last year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said last week.",
      "How did interest payments get so big?",
      "In recent years, interest payments on the federal debt have ballooned for two main reasons. First, a series of COVID-related spending bills provided $4.6 trillion to individuals and businesses to help them keep afloat during the pandemic, with much of that funding financed through the issuance of new government debt.",
      "Second, the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in March of 2022 to tame high inflation. But that also meant the Treasury Department needed to pay higher rates to bondholders, adding to the cost of servicing the nation's burgeoning debt.",
      "In 2020, the U.S. had about $27 trillion in outstanding debt, according to Treasury data. By 2024, that had jumped 32% to $35.5 trillion. Over that time, the Fed's benchmark interest rate rose from close to zero percent to a high of more than 5% in 2024.",
      "One reason the Republican budget bill is forecast to increase the deficit \u2014 and add to the nation's interest costs \u2014 is that it would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add other breaks, such as eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay.",
      "Altogether, those tax cuts will cost $3.75 trillion, the CBO estimates. The revenue loss would be partially offset by nearly $1.3 trillion in reduced federal spending elsewhere, namely through Medicaid and food assistance. But that still leaves a significant funding gap.",
      "In the meantime, the U.S. could face a financial strain in servicing its debt, especially in the face of an economic slowdown, experts have warned.",
      "\"The most dangerous scenario is that the giant size of our debt precipitates a U.S., and even global, economic recession and financial crisis,\" Cato's Edwards told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We saw this 15 or so years ago in Greece and some other European countries. That sort of crisis could be coming to the United States at some point, but no financial expert knows exactly when that's going to be.\"",

      "Two police officers who defended the Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021 attack filed a federal civil lawsuit, asking a judge to order the hanging of a plaque to honor police heroes who protected the Capitol, lawmakers and staff from rioters.",
      "The lawsuit cites a 2022 law signed by President Biden that required the honorary plaque be hung by March 2023. The plaque has been completed and in storage since at least last year, but GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson\u00a0has not committed to installing it at the Capitol.",

      "For now, the plaque remains in storage on the Capitol grounds, according to multiple sources who spoke with CBS News. The delay in hanging the plaque has fueled broader disputes and anger over Trump's controversial pardons of more than 1,500 Capitol riot defendants, and the lack of statements by Republican House members commemorating the four-year mark of the assault on the Capitol in January.",

      "U.S. officials have been told Israel is fully ready to launch an operation into Iran, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "The U.S. anticipates Iran could retaliate on certain American sites in neighboring Iraq. This is part of the reason the U.S. advised some Americans to leave the region earlier Wednesday. The State Department ordered non-emergency government officials to exit Iraq due to \"heightened regional tensions,\" and the Pentagon has authorized military family members to voluntarily leave locations throughout the Middle East, a defense official told CBS News.",
      "President Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is still planning to meet with Iran for a sixth round of talks on the country's nuclear program in the coming days, two U.S. officials said.",
      "Mr. Trump spoke about Iran at an appearance at the Kennedy Center Wednesday evening, telling reporters Americans were advised to leave the region \"because it could be a dangerous place, and we'll see what happens.\" Mr. Trump also reiterated the U.S. did not want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, saying: \"We're not going to allow that.\"",
      "When asked at the White House why dependents of military personnel were allowed to voluntarily leave the region, Mr. Trump said, \"You'll have to see.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Iran's Defense Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh told reporters Wednesday that if nuclear talks fail and \"a conflict is imposed on us,\" the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps \"will target all U.S. bases in the host countries.\"",
      "A source familiar with the situation and a U.S. official told CBS News that the Trump administration was weighing options regarding how to support Israeli military action without leading it. Those options could include aerial refueling or intelligence sharing, but the U.S. official was unaware of any commitment.",
      "The source familiar said the options are unlikely to include direct participation by U.S. B-2 bombers that carry the type of bombs that can penetrate Iran's deep underground fortified uranium enrichment facilities at Fordow and Natanz. Without that type of strike by U.S. B-2 bombers, it is unlikely Israeli military action could destroy the underground portions of Iran's program, and thus solo military action by Israel is presumed to be limited in its capability to fully eliminate the program.",
      "The U.S. official said the U.S. could help defend Israel against Iranian ballistic missiles in case of a counterattack, as it did during the two tit-for-tat episodes between Iran and Israel in\u00a0April 2024 and\u00a0October 2024.",
      "The U.K. Maritime Trade Organization on Wednesday advised ships to exercise caution in the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman \u2014 three key waterways for the global oil trade \u2014 due to \"increased tensions within the region which could lead to an escalation of military activity.\"",
      "Israeli officials and White House spokespeople declined to comment.",
      "The Trump administration has sought a deal with Iran to limit the country's nuclear program, as international watchdogs say the country has continued to enrich uranium to near-weapons level. The talks are delicate, and it's unclear how close the two sides are to a deal: Mr. Trump has said he will not accept any uranium enrichment by Iran, but Iranian leaders have indicated they won't accept those terms, the president said earlier this week.",
      "For years, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been deeply skeptical of any deal with Iran. The two countries have been nemeses since Iran's 1979 revolution. Netanyahu's office says Israel has conducted \"countless overt and covert operations\" to stunt the growth of Iran's nuclear program.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump said publicly he had urged Netanyahu not to strike Iran while his administration pursues negotiations with the regime.",
      "\"I told him this would be inappropriate to do right now because we're very close to a solution,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Iran's nuclear program dates back decades, though the country has long insisted the program is only intended for peaceful purposes.",
      "In 2015, former President Barack Obama struck a deal with Iran limiting the scope of the country's uranium enrichment program, over the objections of Netanyahu, who alleged Iran is unreliable and had covertly violated the agreement. Mr. Trump exited the agreement during his first term and ratcheted up sanctions against Iran, while the Middle Eastern country expanded its stockpile of highly enriched uranium.",
      "In a report two weeks ago, the International Atomic Energy Agency estimated Iran had enriched 408.6 kilograms of uranium up to 60% purity \u2014 which is very close to the 90% enrichment level required to build a nuclear weapon. That's a significant jump from the 274.8-kilogram stockpile the United Nations agency had estimated in February.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is urging President Trump to \"reverse course\" on the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to cut government spending and agencies, advocating instead that he implement her policy proposals to find savings, days after a split between Elon Musk and the president spilled into public view.",
      "\"Although Mr. Musk and DOGE have failed at achieving their purported savings goals, you could choose to end this government waste while avoiding dangerous cuts to important federal Programs,\" Warren wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump along with Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico, the top Democrat on the House DOGE subcommittee. \"You should learn from Elon Musk and DOGE's mistakes, end your attacks on critical federal programs, and instead act on these recommendations.\"",
      "The Democrats penned a letter to Mr. Trump outlining \"DOGE's failures,\" along with recommendations that they said would save the U.S. more than $2 trillion over 10 years. The letter, obtained exclusively by CBS News, follows a letter Warren wrote to Musk in January, outlining the 30 recommendations.",
      "\"Mr. Musk ignored these recommendations \u2014 but you could choose to reverse course, abandon Mr. Musk's inefficient and harmful DOGE actions, and instead carefully review and implement our policy proposals,\" the lawmakers wrote.",
      "Musk initially pledged to cut $2 trillion of government spending, but later lowered the benchmark to $1 trillion. Ultimately, the White House said DOGE's efforts saved roughly $170 billion in spending. But that figure has been disputed, with a number of errors and miscalculations on the initiative's \"wall of receipts.\" Musk said he expected the DOGE cuts would achieve the $1 trillion goal \"over time.\"",
      "Warren's suggestions include cracking down on prescription drug middlemen known as Pharmacy Benefit Managers; eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in federal charter school programs and ending support for-profit schools; reforming the estate tax exemption; negotiating better Defense Department contracts; and ending practices surrounding \"unnecessary federal arrests.\"",
      "\"It is time to eliminate the real waste, fraud, and abuse in government spending, rather than ravaging programs that keep Americans safe, secure, and healthy just to pay for tax cuts for billionaires and large corporations,\" Warren and Stansbury said.",
      "The letter comes after Musk's opposition to a massive budget bill central to enacting the president's agenda erupted into a dramatic and public feud between him and Mr. Trump last week. The spat marked a swift turnaround, coming one week after Mr. Trump gifted Musk a key to the White House as the world's richest man wrapped up his time in the federal government.",
      "Despite the public blowup, administration officials told CBS News last week that there had been no efforts to oust officials who came from Musk's orbit. And the White House's top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, praised DOGE's work in recent days, while expressing doubt that the feud would affect its continued efforts.",
      "\"Waste, fraud and abuse, unfortunately, is alive and well in America, and the DOGE folks here, they're good folks,\" Navarro told reporters at the White House Friday. \"When you work with them and bring to them the institutional knowledge of how bureaucracies work and what's important in a bureaucracy and what's not, when you wed to that, it's a great thing. So, we're happy.\"",
      "Musk expressed some remorse for the spat on X on Wednesday, after deleting some of the most inflammatory posts days earlier.",
      "\"I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week,\" Musk said. \"They went too far.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Three Democratic governors are defending their responses to the migrant crisis and dispute claims of failing to cooperate with federal authorities, according to prepared remarks that will be delivered Thursday before a House oversight panel.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are among the witnesses scheduled to testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on so-called \"sanctuary policies\".",
      "\"Let me be clear: Sanctuary policies don't protect Americans. They protect criminal illegal aliens,\" Oversight Chair James Comer, a Kentucky Republican will say in his opening statement.",
      "The governors' appearances come as President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom remain embroiled in a legal and political standoff\u00a0over the deployment of the National Guard troops and Marines to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles.\u00a0Demonstrations have spread to other U.S. cities, including New York and Chicago following a series of deportation raids.",
      "\"Minnesota is not a sanctuary state,\" Walz will tell lawmakers. \"It is ridiculous to suggest that Minnesota \u2014 a state that is over 1,500 miles away from the Southern border and a thousand miles from lawmakers in Washington, D.C. who decide and implement border policy is somehow responsible for a failure of immigration enforcement.\"",
      "The former vice presidential candidate has drawn intense scrutiny not only over immigration policy but also for his handling of social justice protests that broke out in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd in 2020. Trump administration officials have cited Walz' actions\u00a0to justify the president's decision to federalize troops in California. While Walz does not appear to directly address the controversy in his testimony, he says he is \"disappointed\" in the federal government's overall approach.",
      "\"As governor of Minnesota, it is incumbent on me to use the state's resources to help Minnesota families\u2014not turn those resources over to the administration so they can stage another photo-op in tactical gear or accidentally deport more children without observing due process,\" Walz is set to say.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, the GOP-led panel released a video compilation\u00a0of various news clips\u00a0 accusing the governors of \"shielding\" undocumented immigrants and \"causing chaos\" in their states.",
      "A memo from Hochul's office suggested the hearing could be \"derailed by wild accusations\" and \"twisted characterizations\" but noted the governor's position is \"clear\" when it comes to supporting strong borders and comprehensive immigration reform.",
      "\"New York state cooperates with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in criminal cases,\" Hochul says. \"And our values as New Yorkers demand that we treat those who arrive here in search of a better life with dignity and reject policies that tear law-abiding families apart.\"",
      "Hochul also addresses the influx of more than 220,000 migrants to New York City since early 2022, many of whom were bussed from border states, calling it \"an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.\"",
      "\"We have responded to this crisis with both compassion and pragmatism,\" Hochul states.\"And as a result, we largely prevented what could have become an additional crisis \u2014 one of street homelessness and tent cities.\"",
      "Pritzker says Illinois also stepped up to the challenge, and blamed the lack of federal intervention and cooperation from border states for exacerbating the problem.",
      "\"As governor, my responsibility is to ensure that all Illinoisans feel safe in their homes, their businesses, and their communities,\" Pritzker is prepared to say. \"That is why my administration continued to make significant investments in public safety, even as our resources were strained because of the lack of federal support during the crisis \u2014 expanding our state police force and investing in efforts to reduce gun violence.\"",
      "Thursday's session follows a March hearing on sanctuary cities\u00a0with four Democratic mayors: Eric Adams, of New York, Mike Johnston of Denver, Brandon Johnson of Chicago and Michelle Wu of Boston.",

      "Washington \u2014 The House is expected to vote Thursday on the White House's rescission package \u2014 its formal request to claw back funding for NPR, PBS and international aid that lawmakers had previously approved.",
      "The package would cancel $9.4 billion appropriated by Congress, looking to make permanent some of the Department of Government Efficiency's spending cuts. Its primary focus is slashing foreign aid \u2014 from peacekeeping efforts to refugee assistance and climate projects \u2014 but it would also essentially cut off federal funding for NPR and PBS.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, touted the request to cancel what he called \"wasteful spending\" in recent days, calling it a \"manifestation of the DOGE effort,\" adding that it would \"ensure greater accountability in government going forward.\"",
      "The rescissions package includes $1.1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding to NPR and PBS. The White House has targeted the entities, claiming they have \"spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\" PBS received $325 million in CPB funding this year.",
      "Johnson said of NPR and PBS that funding them is an outmoded idea because \"we're in a different era now.\"",
      "\"There is no reason for any media organization to be singled out to receive federal funds,\" Johnson said. \"Especially those who appear to have so little regard for the truth.\"",
      "The package would cut $8.3 billion for the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, among other international assistance programs, after the foreign aid agency became an early target of the administration. Johnson said the resolution would make cuts in what he called the \"USAID abuses area.\"",
      "Johnson said DOGE \"went after USAID first for their review, their audits,\" because USAID \"opposed the loudest of this accountability measure,\" claiming they \"put the scrutiny targets on their own backs.\"",
      "But some of the cuts have sparked objections among Republican lawmakers, like cuts to a program aimed at combatting HIV and AIDS globally. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, was started by former President George W. Bush, and has been credited for saving millions of lives around the world. Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told The New York Times he would oppose the rescissions package because of these cuts, though he seemed to warm to the package this week, telling reporters he feels \"better\" about the cuts to the program after the House GOP conference met Tuesday. But he wouldn't say how he planned to vote on the measure.",
      "Other Republicans, like Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, have voiced concerns as well.",
      "\"PEPFAR cuts make no sense to me whatsoever, given the extraordinary record of PEPFAR in saving lives,\" Collins told reporters last week, while pointing to several other global health care programs targeted in the rescissions package. \"So, I have a lot of concerns.\"",
      "But Republican leaders in Congress were bullish about the path forward.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, said Tuesday that \"our members are ready to go lock in some of those DOGE cuts,\" adding that \"this is a start \u2014 it's a good start, it's an important first step and we're going to take it on Thursday.\"",
      "Johnson said the vote on the package \"is an important signal \u2014 House Republicans are serious about getting our fiscal house in order, and we'll do that.\"",
      "The rescissions process",
      "Congress can cancel funds that the federal government has not yet spent but has previously appropriated under the rescissions process. Each year, Congress approves funding to keep the federal government running before the funds are disbursed to government agencies and programs. The president can temporarily defer funds or withhold them altogether \u2014 but only with Congress' approval.",
      "The White House's official transmission of the rescission package on June 3 started the clock on a process that gives Congress 45 days to act. Rescissions requests first go before relevant committees for consideration, before moving to the full House and Senate for votes. In the Senate, rescission bills are not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most legislation in the upper chamber and only require a simple majority.",

Another 1,200 foreign award recipients who were already approved to come to the U.S. are undergoing an unauthorized review process that could lead to their rejection, the board members said.",
      "\"To continue to serve after the Administration has consistently ignored the Board's request that they follow the law would risk legitimizing actions we believe are unlawful and damage the integrity of this storied program and America's credibility abroad,\" the statement reads.",
      "Congress established the Fulbright program nearly 80 years ago to promote international exchange and American diplomacy.

It's ridiculous to believe that these members would continue to have final say over the application process, especially when it comes to determining academic suitability and alignment with President Trump's Executive Orders. The claim that the Fulbright Hayes Act affords exclusive and final say over Fulbright Applications to the Fulbright board is false. This is nothing but a political stunt attempting to undermine President Trump,\" a senior State Department official told CBS News.",

      "\"We believe these actions not only contradict the statute but are antithetical to the Fulbright mission and the values, including free speech and academic freedom, that Congress specified in the statute,\" the statement said. \"It is our sincere hope that Congress, the courts, and future Fulbright Boards will prevent the administration's efforts to degrade, dismantle, or even eliminate one of our nation's most respected and valuable programs.\"",
      "The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on international students in recent weeks. The State Department\u00a0halted all new student visa interviews late last month, in preparation for \"expanded social media vetting.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has also tried to block virtually all international students from traveling to the U.S. to attend Harvard University amid a feud with the Ivy League school, leading a federal judge to issue a restraining order.

      "Jeremy Greenberg's planned departure comes less than two weeks into hurricane season and amid a major leadership exodus at the nation's disaster response and recovery agency.",
      "Greenberg confirmed his departure to CBS News but deferred all comment to FEMA, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA, also did not immediately respond.",
      "The National Response Coordination Center is the nerve center for FEMA during emergencies. During major disasters, it serves as a 24/7 emergency operations hub, hosting experts from different federal agencies, the military and even nonprofits. When a major hurricane, wildfire or other crisis hits, the NRCC helps coordinate everything from getting rescue teams on the ground to dispatching food, water and medical supplies to disaster zones.",
      "Among his many responsibilities, Greenberg oversaw and approved mission assignments to the Pentagon amid major disasters and was responsible for deploying FEMA's 28 Urban Search and Rescue Teams.",
      "\"This will be a significant loss. He led all of FEMA's planners that prepared for all hazards,\" a former FEMA senior official told CBS News. \"He had strong interagency relationship that fostered collaboration and coordination in responding to disasters.\"",
      "One current FEMA official told CBS News, \"He's irreplaceable. The brain drain continues and the public will pay for it. I don't see how FEMA will find someone who can coordinate with national, state and local emergency organizations like he did.\"",
      "Tony Robinson, the regional administrator for FEMA Region 6 has also announced his intention to depart the agency this week, sources told CBS News. Robinson began his career with FEMA as an intern in 1987 and has led Region 6, which oversees several disaster-prone states in the Gulf, including Louisiana and Texas, for the past dozen years.",
      "He led FEMA's response and recovery efforts for several notable disasters, including Hurricanes Harvey, Isaac, Ike, Gustav, Rita and Katrina. Robinson will also depart the agency by the end of June, the sources said. Robinson's departure follows the resignation of his deputy, Tracy Brasher, just last week, according to the sources.",

      "\"These leaders don't want to participate in the dismantling of the agency they value,\" the former senior FEMA official said. \"They have been dedicated to the mission over multiple administrations but won't support the current administration's direction.\"",
      "President Trump said Tuesday that his administration wants to \"wean\" states off assistance from FEMA after this year's hurricane season. The president's remarks came after he received a briefing from top administration officials about wildfire and emergency management. He claimed that FEMA has not been successful, and said governors are better positioned to respond to natural disasters like hurricanes, wildfires and tornadoes.",

    "summary": "The federal government now spends more on servicing its debt than it does on defense. The GOP's new tax bill could ratchet that higher, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Republicans' \"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0is uniting everyone from Elon Musk to Wall Street over an issue that experts say could pose a threat to the nation's long-term fiscal stability: the rising cost of servicing the U.S. government's growing mountain of debt.",
      "The U.S. spent $1.1 trillion in interest on its debt in 2024 \u2014 almost double the amount it was paying five years ago, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. The nation now spends more on interest payments than it does on defense,\u00a0data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows.",
      "Those costs could rise even more under the Republican tax and spending bill now being considered in the Senate, according to a June 5 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office. The version of the tax bill\u00a0passed by the House last month is projected to increase the federal deficit \u2014 the gap between what the federal government spends each year and what it collects in revenue \u2014 by $2.4 trillion over the next decade, the nonpartisan agency found.",
      "That would require the government to raise additional debt, resulting in additional interest payments of about $550 billion over the next decade, the CBO forecasts. By 2035, interest on the nation's debt could reach $1.8 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think tank focused on fiscal issues.",
      "\"The interest costs now are bigger than defense spending, which is an extraordinary,\" Chris Edwards, an expert on federal tax issues at the Cato Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The budget threat here is that all of these increasing federal interest costs will crowd out all the other priorities in the federal budget that the policymakers want to spend on.\"",
      "In other words, the federal government could struggle to support vital programs like Social Security as a larger share of its budget is eaten up by interest payments on the nation's swelling debt.",
      "Federal interest payments as a share of the nation's gross domestic product stood at 3% last year,\u00a0according\u00a0to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. If current trends holds, that could rise to 4.1% of GDP by 2035, the nonpartisan Peter G. Peterson Foundation estimates.",
      "Democrats have pointed to analyses showing the bill's tax cuts will benefit wealthier Americans far more than low- and middle-income workers while also adding to the national debt.",
      "\"No single piece of legislation in my time here in Congress will do more to add to the national debt than this one,\" Rep. Brendan Boyle, a Democrat from Pennsylvania who voted against the legislation,\u00a0said\u00a0last month on the House floor.",
      "Many Republicans, however, point to the bill's proposed tax cuts as providing an avenue for economic growth. \"We are going to celebrate a new golden age in America,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said last month after the bill passed in the House.",
      "Concerns from Elon Musk, Wall Street",
      "The cost of paying for the nation's debt has drawn concern from many corners, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who earlier this month posted about it on social media as he voiced his objections to the GOP bill.",
      "\"Congress is spending America into bankruptcy!\" Musk posted on June 5, pointing to data showing that interest payments have risen from $416 billion in 2014 to more than $1 trillion in 2024.",
      "Moody's Ratings downgraded U.S. credit\u00a0last month, citing among its reasons the mounting concerns about the nation's increasing debt load and interest payments.",
      "\"Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,\" the credit rating agency said. \"Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat.\"",
      "Moody's added, \"In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher.\"",
      "On June 7, the White House said in a memo that the GOP tax bill \"significantly improves our nation's fiscal trajectory by including $1.7 trillion in mandatory savings,\" while President Trump's tax cuts will spur economic growth.",
      "Some economic forecasters project that Mr. Trump's tariffs will drag down U.S. growth. The nation's growth could slide to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% next year partly because of those import levies, a sharp reduction from the 2.8% growth recorded last year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said last week.",
      "How did interest payments get so big?",
      "In recent years, interest payments on the federal debt have ballooned for two main reasons. First, a series of COVID-related spending bills provided $4.6 trillion to individuals and businesses to help them keep afloat during the pandemic, with much of that funding financed through the issuance of new government debt.",
      "Second, the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in March of 2022 to tame high inflation. But that also meant the Treasury Department needed to pay higher rates to bondholders, adding to the cost of servicing the nation's burgeoning debt.",
      "In 2020, the U.S. had about $27 trillion in outstanding debt, according to Treasury data. By 2024, that had jumped 32% to $35.5 trillion. Over that time, the Fed's benchmark interest rate rose from close to zero percent to a high of more than 5% in 2024.",
      "One reason the Republican budget bill is forecast to increase the deficit \u2014 and add to the nation's interest costs \u2014 is that it would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add other breaks, such as eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay.",
      "Altogether, those tax cuts will cost $3.75 trillion, the CBO estimates. The revenue loss would be partially offset by nearly $1.3 trillion in reduced federal spending elsewhere, namely through Medicaid and food assistance. But that still leaves a significant funding gap.",
      "In the meantime, the U.S. could face a financial strain in servicing its debt, especially in the face of an economic slowdown, experts have warned.",
      "\"The most dangerous scenario is that the giant size of our debt precipitates a U.S., and even global, economic recession and financial crisis,\" Cato's Edwards told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We saw this 15 or so years ago in Greece and some other European countries. That sort of crisis could be coming to the United States at some point, but no financial expert knows exactly when that's going to be.\"",

    "story": [
      "More than 85 million years ago, a smaller-bodied ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the plains of Mongolia. The dinosaur's identity was unknown \u2014 until now.",
      "In a study\u00a0published Wednesday in Nature, scientists describe the identification of a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",
      "\"This species, Khankhuuluu, is the missing link between smaller and earlier forms and the larger apex predatory tyrannosaurs,\" paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky, a professor at the University of Calgary and study co-author, told CBS News.",
      "The Khankhuuluu's skeleton was discovered in Mongolia in the Gobi Desert in 1972 or 1973, but wasn't studied scientifically until a few years later, Zelenitsky said. The remains were identified by Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle as Alectrosaurus olsoni, another obscure species. After it was misidentified, the bones became part of a museum collection and were relatively untouched for almost 50 years.",
      "Referred to as mid-grade tyrannosauroids, these smaller-bodied predators were evolutionary intermediates, the study found. During the period when Khankhuuluu lived in Mongolia, the tyrannosaurs began growing larger and taking on the features of apex predators. Not much else is known about these elusive tyrannosauroids due to fragmentary fossil remains, but researchers said the dinosaurs weighed around 1,700 pounds. They were one of the larger predators in the ecosystem at the time.",
      "\"It's essentially the immediate ancestor of the tyrannosaur family,\" Zelenitsky said.",
      "A surprise discovery",
      "University of Calgary postdoctoral scholar and study co-author Jared Voris traveled to Mongolia a few years earlier to research the bones of various tyrannosaurs and, in the process, gained access to see the bones of what they would later determine are the Khankhuuluu.",
      "Voris thought the remains could be something important, as he often saw references to the specimens pop up, but after he started examining the bones, he knew it could be something special. While studying the individual characteristics of the bones, one of the things he noticed was that the Khankhuuluu's teeth couldn't crush bone, Voris said, a defining characteristic of the larger apex predatory Tyrannosaurus.",
      "\"This animal had features we had never seen before in more of our iconic tyrannosaurs,\" Voris said.",
      "He texted Zelenitsky from Mongolia that he \"thought it could be a new species.\" Zelenitsky said she responded, \"I said, great going, keep looking at this so we can be sure this is a new species.\"",
      "The two paleontologists aren't new to groundbreaking scientific discoveries \u2014 they've had several.\u00a0In 2023, Zelenitsky was part of a team that identified a Tyrannosaurus fossil with a meal in its stomach, and Voris discovered a new species of tyrannosaurid dinosaur, Thanatotheristes degrootorum \u2014 whose genus name translates to \"Reaper of Death.\"",
      "\"Rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs\"",
      "These Asian tyrannosauroids eventually crossed over into North America using a northern land bridge between Alaska and Siberia, Zelenitsky said. Dinosaurs used these land bridges, which appeared periodically over the past 100 million years, to travel between Asia and North America.",
      "And from it, these tyrannosauroids evolved and morphed into apex predators. T. rex is the\u00a0deadliest land predator\u00a0ever to live, and there has long been a fascination with the dinosaur that has been extinct for about 66 million years.",
      "The study co-authors said the new identification shows there are still big discoveries to be made in science. \"What really started just as a discovery of a new species ended up with us kind of rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs,\" Zelenitsky said.",

      "Suiter added that people who have adverse reactions to bee and ant stings are especially vulnerable and could go into anaphylactic shock from the needle ant's sting. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within seconds of being exposed to something you're allergic to, such as a sting, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"If you suffer from anaphylaxis, you should really know what this ant looks like,\" Suiter says. \"And it might be smart to carry an EpiPen.\"",
      "Suiter urged people to be vigilant for these invasive species, especially with ant populations peaking later this summer.",
      "What are Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are technically known as Brachyponera chinensis\u00a0\u2014 roughly translated as \"short, wicked ant from China\" \u2014 but their native range also includes Japan and the Koreas, according to the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "The insect was first discovered in the U.S. in 1932 in Georgia, but has only recently started to \"cause problems in North America after being relatively unnoticed for many years,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "The pest has now been detected all the way from Washington state to Florida, according to the site\u00a0antmaps.org as well as Mississippi State University, and the ant is recently getting more attention in Texas.",
      "Suiter says Asian needle ants are \"sneaky\" because they are less than a quarter of an inch long and are adept at hiding.",
      "\"Unlike many invasive species that tend to colonize areas in the wake of natural or human disturbance, Asian needle ants are capable of invading undisturbed forest areas where they nest under and within logs and other debris, under stones, and in leaf litter,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "Environmental impacts",
      "According to Suiter, Asian needle ants wreak havoc in native environments.",
      "\"They outcompete other ant species that are important to the ecology of that area,\" he says.",
      "Asian needle ants prey on other insects and are capable of displacing ant species that are critical for seed dispersal, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Researchers have documented large decreases in seed dispersal in forests where Asian needle ants are present.",
      "\"Thus, this invasive species could have dramatic, long-term negative effects on forest understory,\" the service says.",
      "What should people do if they see Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are about 0.2 inches in length, and dark brown or black with the end of the antennae and the legs being a lighter orange-brown, the U.S. Forest Service says. Other ant species can look similar, \"so it takes an experienced eye to positively identify them,\" the service says.",
      "Suiter says that you can send a photograph or a specimen to a local University of Georgia Extension office, which can help with identification. The public can also contact a professional to come out and bait for the ants, he says.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service advises people to avoid the pest and to be especially vigilant in areas with logs, rotting wood or rocks where the ants can nest.",
      "\"Unfortunately, as with many invasive species, it appears Asian needle ants are here to stay,\" the service says.",

      "For more than a decade, Tribeca has been expanding its focus beyond cinema and television to include new avenues of storytelling through the use of virtual reality, augmented reality, and other nascent technologies, producing some vivid immersive displays. Even if the storytelling aspect of the programs were limited, the artistic expressions could be powerful. This was especially true with past exhibits that enveloped the viewer in massive spaces, in which computer-generated imagery or time-lapse photography placed the viewer in new worlds, from exploding galaxies to swirling blood vessels.",
      "Hosted under the umbrella title \"In Search of Us,\"\u00a0this year's installation in Lower Manhattan ties 11 projects together under the rubric of impacts on humanity \u2014 exploring topics from artificial intelligence to climate change, war, school shootings and transphobia. The exhibits with the most profound effects are those with the strongest and most emotional stories embedded inside them.",
      "Within a simple, delineated space furnished with minimal furniture, \"Fragile Home,\" by Ond\u0159ej Moravec and Victoria Lopukhina, uses mixed reality to recreate a home in Ukraine that comes under bombardment. Wearing goggles, the viewer walks through a comfortable, well-appointed living room, past a dinner table and a purring cat, and looks outside the window to a peaceful vista \u2014 all of which, in a flash, is replaced by the home's bombed-out remains, vandalized with Russian forces' \"Z\" graffiti.",

      "Apple is also making changes to its messages app. Texters with iOS 26 will be able to change the background, or wallpaper, of a chat conversation. The feature is similar to the \"chat theme\" setting on WhatsApp but with more options. In group chats, dots will appear to indicate who is typing \u2014 something previously reserved for one-on-one chats. Texters will also be able create and share polls directly in group messages.",

      "A hallmark feature of the new OS is\u00a0Liquid Glass, described by the company as an \"expressive material\" meant to mimic the qualities of glass. The dynamic new interface make apps, widgets and docs appear translucent, allowing users to see multiple layers of their screen at once.",
      "Liquid Glass also creates more movement on your interface by morphing into your display. For example, as messages pop up on your home screen, the time display starts to shrink to accommodate them. The color of Liquid Glass also shifts depending on the content on your screen and adapts between light and dark environments.",
      "\"From navigating apps to system experiences like the lock screen notifications and control center app icons have been crafted with multiple layers of Liquid Glass and come to life in light mode, dark mode, colorful, new tints, or an all new clear look,\" said Dye during the company's keynote Monday.",

      "Apple also delivered long-awaited updates to Apple Intelligence, the company's artificial intelligence system that's now integrated with ChatGPT. AI-powered features arriving this fall include Live Translation, which automatically translates messages as they're being received.",
      "\"So if you're making plans with some new friends while studying abroad, your message can be translated as you type and delivered in their preferred language, and when they respond, each text can be instantly translated for you,\" said Leslie Ikemoto, an engineering director at Apple said at the conference Monday.",
      "Visual Intelligence, another AI tool, allows users to take a screenshot of an image they see online \u2014 say, a cute sweater they come across on one of their apps \u2014 and then look up where to find a similar design online. They can also ask ChatGPT specific questions about the image, such as, keeping with the example of the sweater, \"What material is this made of?\"",
      "Another feature builds on Apple broad selection of emojis by giving users the power to combine and personalize existing emojis to create their own unique expressions. In their presentation, Apple showed how someone could merge the lightbulb emoji with the sloth emoji to indicate they were the last one to get a joke, for example.",
      "Still lingering on Apple's to do list is new AI integrations for Siri. Apple introduced updates to the voice assistant at last year's conference, but the full suite of upgrades for the voice assistant have yet to take effect. \"We're continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal,\" said senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi on Monday. \"This work needed more time to reach our high quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.\"",

      "\"Almost anybody in that audience, irrespective of the job that they're pursuing, will be expected to use AI with some facility right away,\" said Joseph Fuller, a professor at Harvard Business School and founder of the Managing the Future of Work\u00a0project, comparing the task to learning how to use Microsoft Office for a previous generation of grads.",
      "To get the ball rolling, experts encourage those who are starting to hunt for work to familiarize themselves with the array of tools at their disposal, such as Anthropic's Claude or OpenAI's ChatGPT. That means learning how to engage with such tools beyond simply using them as a search engine.",
      "\"You want to get in a dialogue with it,\" Fuller said. \"You want to ask it to take different perspectives.\"",
      "Emily Rose McRae, an analyst at research and advisory firm Gartner, said learning how to use AI apps can also be a good way to develop transferable skills. For example, asking AI to summarize documents and then validating its findings to ensure accuracy.",
      "Meanwhile, although AI can be helpful when it comes time to filling out job applications, users should proceed with caution given that recruiters can often spot AI-generated language, experts note. Nearly two-thirds of job candidates today use AI at some point in the application process, according to a\u00a0report from recruitment firm Career Group Companies.",
      "\"If you're using it to write your cover letter and your resume and you did not review it, everyone can tell,\" McRae said.",
      "Another way to gain potentially valuable experience with AI, while also seeking work, is for interview practice. For example, users can ask the chatbot both to provide sample questions they might face in an interview and then rate the quality of their responses.",
      "\"If you are using it as a tool to get your own understanding of self in interviews, you're going to start being leaps ahead of everyone else,\" Raman said.",
      "Hone your soft skills",
      "Experts say that as AI surpasses humans in executing certain tasks \u2014 think actuarial math or corporate compliance, for example \u2014more attention will shift to job candidates' so-called soft skills, such as problem solving and communication.",
      "\"You cannot outsource your thinking to AI,\" LinkedIn's Raman said. \"You have to continue to hone critical thinking and complex strategy thinking.\"",
      "The focus will be less on your pedigree \u2014 where you went to school or even whether you have a college degree \u2014 he added, and more on what he calls the \"5 Cs\": curiosity, compassion, creativity, courage and communication.",
      "To improve their soft skills, Fuller encourages entry-level job candidates to work on turning what they regard as their biggest weakness into a strength. For instance, if you typically shy away from public speaking or talking in groups, push yourself to get comfortable in those situations.",
      "\"The inability to do that is going to be penalized more severely in the work of the future than it has been in the past,\" he said.",
      "The Harvard professor also suggested highlighting examples of advanced social skills directly on your resume to help paint a picture for recruiters of how you can contribute to the workplace.",
      "Choose your employer wisely",
      "Beyond skills development, experts say college grads should be thoughtful about the type of company they choose to work at, knowing that AI could drastically alter the business in the coming years.",
      "\"The most important thing, if you're a new grad, is where you work \u2014 not what you do at the place you're going to work,\" Raman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He encouraged college graduates to seek out employers that are integrating AI responsibly and with respect for their workforce \u2014 as opposed to embracing it chiefly to replace people. Companies that are adapting to what is a major technological shift in real time will typically offer the best opportunities for learning and growth, Fuller said.",
      "In evaluating a prospective employer, young job candidates should try to gain an understanding of how they fit into the company's future. For example, McRae recommends asking hiring managers up front what types of investments the organization is making in its employees and what the room for growth looks like.",
      "\"What are they telling me they care about? What do career paths look like for this role like now? How do you help people develop the skills they need to become experts?\" she said.",
      "In researching companies, McRae also encouraged recent college grads to look for places that offer apprenticeship or rotational programs, which can offer ways to quickly ramp up their knowledge base, especially if traditional entry-level roles are in short supply.",

    "summary": "Meta platforms such as Instagram have marketed AI tools that let users create sexually explicit images of real people.",
    "story": [
      "Meta has removed a number of ads promoting \"nudify\" apps \u2014 AI tools used to create sexually explicit deepfakes using images of real people \u2014 after a CBS News investigation found hundreds of such advertisements on its platforms.",
      "\"We have strict rules against non-consensual intimate imagery; we removed these ads, deleted the Pages responsible for running them and permanently blocked the URLs associated with these apps,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "CBS News uncovered dozens of those ads on Meta's Instagram platform, in its \"Stories\" feature, promoting AI tools that, in many cases, advertised the ability to \"upload a photo\" and \"see anyone naked.\" Other ads in Instagram's Stories promoted the ability to upload and manipulate videos of real people. One promotional ad even read \"how is this filter even allowed?\" as text underneath an example of a nude deepfake.",
      "One ad promoted its AI product by using highly sexualized, underwear-clad deepfake images of actors Scarlett Johansson and Anne Hathaway. Some of the ads' URL links redirect to websites that promote the ability to animate real people's images and get them to perform sex acts. And some of the applications charged users between $20 and $80 to access these \"exclusive\" and \"advance\" features. In other cases, an ad's URL redirected users to Apple's app store, where \"nudify\" apps were available to download.",
      "An analysis of the advertisements in Meta's ad library found that there were, at a minimum, hundreds of these ads available across the company's social media platforms, including on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, the Facebook Messenger application and Meta Audience Network \u2014 a platform that allows Meta advertisers to reach users on mobile apps and websites that partner with the company.",
      "According to Meta's own Ad Library data, many of these ads were specifically targeted at men between the ages of 18 and 65, and were active in the United States, European Union and United Kingdom.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told CBS News the spread of this sort of AI-generated content is an ongoing problem and they are facing increasingly sophisticated challenges in trying to combat it.",
      "\"The people behind these exploitative apps constantly evolve their tactics to evade detection, so we're continuously working to strengthen our enforcement,\" a Meta spokesperson said.",
      "CBS News found that ads for \"nudify\" deepfake tools were still available on the company's Instagram platform even after Meta had removed those initially flagged.",
      "Deepfakes are manipulated images, audio recordings, or videos of real people that have been altered with artificial intelligence to misrepresent someone as saying or doing something that the person did not actually say or do.",
      "Last month, President Trump signed into law the bipartisan \"Take It Down Act,\" which, among other things, requires websites and social media companies to remove deepfake content within 48 hours of notice from a victim.",
      "Although the law makes it illegal to \"knowingly publish\" or threaten to publish intimate images without a person's consent, including AI-created deepfakes, it does not target the tools used to create such AI-generated content.",
      "Those tools do violate platform safety and moderation rules implemented by both Apple and Meta on their respective platforms.",
      "Meta's advertising standards policy says, \"ads must not contain adult nudity and sexual activity. This includes nudity, depictions of people in explicit or sexually suggestive positions, or activities that are sexually suggestive.\"",
      "Under Meta's \"bullying and harassment\" policy, the company also prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company says its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share nonconsensual intimate imagery.",
      "Apple's guidelines for its app store explicitly state that \"content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy\" is banned.",
      "Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell University's tech research center, has been studying the surge in AI deepfake networks marketing on social platforms for more than a year. He told CBS News in a phone interview on Tuesday that he'd seen thousands more of these ads across Meta platforms, as well as on platforms such as X and Telegram, during that period.",
      "Although Telegram and X have what he described as a structural \"lawlessness\" that allows for this sort of content, he believes Meta's leadership lacks the will to address the issue, despite having content moderators in place.",
      "\"I do think that trust and safety teams at these companies care. I don't think, frankly, that they care at the very top of the company in Meta's case,\" he said. \"They're clearly under-resourcing the teams that have to fight this stuff, because as sophisticated as these [deepfake] networks are \u2026 they don't have Meta money to throw at it.\"",
      "Mantzarlis also said that he found in his research that \"nudify\" deepfake generators are available to download on both Apple's app store and Google's Play store, expressing frustration with these massive platforms' inability to enforce such content.",
      "\"The problem with apps is that they have this dual-use front where they present on the app store as a fun way to face swap, but then they are marketing on Meta as their primary purpose being nudification. So when these apps come up for review on the Apple or Google store, they don't necessarily have the wherewithal to ban them,\" he said.",
      "\"There needs to be cross-industry cooperation where if the app or the website markets itself as a tool for nudification on any place on the web, then everyone else can be like, 'All right, I don't care what you present yourself as on my platform, you're gone,'\" Mantzarlis added.",
      "CBS News has reached out to both Apple and Google for comment as to how they moderate their respective platforms. Neither company had responded by the time of writing.",
      "Major tech companies' promotion of such apps raises serious questions about both user consent and about online safety for minors. A CBS News analysis of one \"nudify\" website promoted on Instagram showed that the site did not prompt any form of age verification prior to a user uploading a photo to generate a deepfake image.",
      "Such issues are widespread. In December, CBS News' 60 Minutes reported on the lack of age verification on one of the most popular sites using artificial intelligence to generate fake nude photos of real people.",
      "Despite visitors being told that they must be 18 or older to use the site, and that \"processing of minors is impossible,\" 60 Minutes was able to immediately gain access to uploading photos once the user clicked \"accept\" on the age warning prompt, with no other age verification necessary.",
      "Data also shows that a high percentage of underage teenagers have interacted with deepfake content. A March 2025 study conducted by the children's protection nonprofit Thorn showed that among teens, 41% said they had heard of the term \"deepfake nudes,\" while 10% reported personally knowing someone who had had deepfake nude imagery created of them.",

    "story": [
      "Two police officers who defended the Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021 attack filed a federal civil lawsuit, asking a judge to order the hanging of a plaque to honor police heroes who protected the Capitol, lawmakers and staff from rioters.",
      "The lawsuit cites a 2022 law signed by President Biden that required the honorary plaque be hung by March 2023. The plaque has been completed and in storage since at least last year, but GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson\u00a0has not committed to installing it at the Capitol.",
      "The dispute over the plaque has angered victims and inflamed a politically divisive issue on Capitol Hill. Republican leaders, who control the administration of the Capitol complex, have not honored requests by some officers and Democratic colleagues to hang the plaque, as required under federal law.",
      "In their lawsuit, former Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn and D.C. Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges argue President Trump has spun conspiracy theories about Jan. 6, that have been adopted by his Republican allies in Congress.",
      "\"After Congress passed the law, the politics of January 6 began to change. Donald Trump began to call the attack on the Capitol a 'day of love,' and said that 'the cops should be charged and the protesters should be freed,\" the lawsuit said. \"As Trump's political fortunes rebounded, elected officials began to parrot his claims about the day.\"",
      "The lawsuit argues the failure to hang the plaque violates the Equal Protection clause of the Constitution. It also contends the Aarchitect of the Capitol, who helps manage the facilities and grounds of the Capitol, has failed to complete a required duty under the 2022 law.",
      "\"There seems to be no indication that congressional leadership is going to install this without judicial intervention,\" said attorney Brendan Ballou, who has helped with crafting the lawsuit.. Ballou, a former Justice Department prosecutor who handled Jan. 6 criminal cases and resigned from the agency earlier this year, also told CBS News, \"Congress was required by law to install this plaque to honor the officers that defended the Capitol and those inside on Jan. 6. They have not done so, and they have not done so two years past the legal deadline.\"",
      "In the civil lawsuit, the officers argue, \"While Congress has installed a memorial to other officers who died in a different tragedy, it has not installed the plaque to honor those who defended the Capitol on January 6. Meanwhile, though Congress has not installed the memorial to the officers who defended it, members have managed to honor the man who inspired the violence.\"",
      "\"Since President Trump's inauguration, bills have been introduced to make his birthday a federal holiday, to rename Dulles International Airport after him, to put his face on the $100 bill (or to create a new $250 bill in his honor), and to carve his face into Mount Rushmore,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "It's been filed in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia, where more than 1,500 Capitol riot criminal cases were filed. A judge has not yet been assigned, from among the nearly two dozen federal judges on the D.C. federal court.",
      "For now, the plaque remains in storage on the Capitol grounds, according to multiple sources who spoke with CBS News. The delay in hanging the plaque has fueled broader disputes and anger over Trump's controversial pardons of more than 1,500 Capitol riot defendants, and the lack of statements by Republican House members commemorating the four-year mark of the assault on the Capitol in January.",
      "In a statement during a service honoring police in May, Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat, said the plaque \"is still sitting in storage because Republican leadership refuses to act. Until they condemn these pardons and honor these officers, their hollow words of support for law enforcement are meaningless.\"",
      "Rep. Joe Morelle, a New York Democrat who is the ranking member on the Committee on House Administration, has pushed unsuccessfully to get the the plaque installed.",

But that figure has been disputed, with a number of errors and miscalculations on the initiative's \"wall of receipts.\" Musk said he expected the DOGE cuts would achieve the $1 trillion goal \"over time.\"",
      "Warren's suggestions include cracking down on prescription drug middlemen known as Pharmacy Benefit Managers; eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in federal charter school programs and ending support for-profit schools; reforming the estate tax exemption; negotiating better Defense Department contracts; and ending practices surrounding \"unnecessary federal arrests.\"",
      "\"It is time to eliminate the real waste, fraud, and abuse in government spending, rather than ravaging programs that keep Americans safe, secure, and healthy just to pay for tax cuts for billionaires and large corporations,\" Warren and Stansbury said.",
      "The letter comes after Musk's opposition to a massive budget bill central to enacting the president's agenda erupted into a dramatic and public feud between him and Mr. Trump last week. The spat marked a swift turnaround, coming one week after Mr. Trump gifted Musk a key to the White House as the world's richest man wrapped up his time in the federal government.",
      "Despite the public blowup, administration officials told CBS News last week that there had been no efforts to oust officials who came from Musk's orbit. And the White House's top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, praised DOGE's work in recent days, while expressing doubt that the feud would affect its continued efforts.",
      "\"Waste, fraud and abuse, unfortunately, is alive and well in America, and the DOGE folks here, they're good folks,\" Navarro told reporters at the White House Friday. \"When you work with them and bring to them the institutional knowledge of how bureaucracies work and what's important in a bureaucracy and what's not, when you wed to that, it's a great thing. So, we're happy.\"",

    "summary": "Lava fountains reached heights of more than 330 feet and feeding multiple lava streams.",
    "story": [
      "One of the world's most active volcanoes, Kilauea on Hawaii's Big Island, began spewing lava from the north vent Wednesday, the latest event in an ongoing eruption that began almost six months ago.",
      "Lava fountains reached heights of more than 330 feet and feeding multiple lava streams. Scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said the fountains were likely to go higher.",
      "\"Here we go again!\" the observatory wrote on its Facebook page.",
      "The latest event was preceded by gas-pistoning, in which gas accumulates at a lava column's top within a vent, on Tuesday.",
      "The observatory said this process causes the lava surface to rise or piston. \"Eventually, gas escapes as splatter/lava is erupted, and lave drains back into the vent,\" the observatory wrote.",
      "These were occurring up to 10 times an hour, but increased in intensity until a small, sustained dome fountain began to feed flows to the crater floor a day later.",
      "The USGS has set up three K\u012blauea summit livestream videos, which can be seen here.",
      "It is the 25th eruptive episode since the volcano on the southeastern part of the island began erupting Dec. 23. It has been pausing and resuming since.",
      "Most of the eruptive episodes have spewed lava for about a day or less, with pauses between them generally lasting a few days.",
      "The USGS warned that high levels of volcanic gas can have far-reaching\u202feffects downwind. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) reacts in the atmosphere to create the visible haze known as vog\u202f(volcanic smog), which may cause respiratory and other problems, the agency said.",
      "Additional hazards include Pele's hair (strands of volcanic glass often produced by lava fountaining activity) and other volcanic fragments that can fall on the ground within a few hundred yards of the eruptive vents, the USGS said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House is expected to vote Thursday on the White House's rescission package \u2014 its formal request to claw back funding for NPR, PBS and international aid that lawmakers had previously approved.",
      "The package would cancel $9.4 billion appropriated by Congress, looking to make permanent some of the Department of Government Efficiency's spending cuts. Its primary focus is slashing foreign aid \u2014 from peacekeeping efforts to refugee assistance and climate projects \u2014 but it would also essentially cut off federal funding for NPR and PBS.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, touted the request to cancel what he called \"wasteful spending\" in recent days, calling it a \"manifestation of the DOGE effort,\" adding that it would \"ensure greater accountability in government going forward.\"",
      "The rescissions package includes $1.1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding to NPR and PBS. The White House has targeted the entities, claiming they have \"spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\" PBS received $325 million in CPB funding this year.",
      "Johnson said of NPR and PBS that funding them is an outmoded idea because \"we're in a different era now.\"",
      "\"There is no reason for any media organization to be singled out to receive federal funds,\" Johnson said. \"Especially those who appear to have so little regard for the truth.\"",
      "The package would cut $8.3 billion for the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, among other international assistance programs, after the foreign aid agency became an early target of the administration. Johnson said the resolution would make cuts in what he called the \"USAID abuses area.\"",
      "Johnson said DOGE \"went after USAID first for their review, their audits,\" because USAID \"opposed the loudest of this accountability measure,\" claiming they \"put the scrutiny targets on their own backs.\"",
      "But some of the cuts have sparked objections among Republican lawmakers, like cuts to a program aimed at combatting HIV and AIDS globally. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, was started by former President George W. Bush, and has been credited for saving millions of lives around the world. Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told The New York Times he would oppose the rescissions package because of these cuts, though he seemed to warm to the package this week, telling reporters he feels \"better\" about the cuts to the program after the House GOP conference met Tuesday. But he wouldn't say how he planned to vote on the measure.",
      "Other Republicans, like Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, have voiced concerns as well.",
      "\"PEPFAR cuts make no sense to me whatsoever, given the extraordinary record of PEPFAR in saving lives,\" Collins told reporters last week, while pointing to several other global health care programs targeted in the rescissions package. \"So, I have a lot of concerns.\"",
      "But Republican leaders in Congress were bullish about the path forward.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, said Tuesday that \"our members are ready to go lock in some of those DOGE cuts,\" adding that \"this is a start \u2014 it's a good start, it's an important first step and we're going to take it on Thursday.\"",
      "Johnson said the vote on the package \"is an important signal \u2014 House Republicans are serious about getting our fiscal house in order, and we'll do that.\"",
      "The rescissions process",
      "Congress can cancel funds that the federal government has not yet spent but has previously appropriated under the rescissions process. Each year, Congress approves funding to keep the federal government running before the funds are disbursed to government agencies and programs. The president can temporarily defer funds or withhold them altogether \u2014 but only with Congress' approval.",
      "The White House's official transmission of the rescission package on June 3 started the clock on a process that gives Congress 45 days to act. Rescissions requests first go before relevant committees for consideration, before moving to the full House and Senate for votes. In the Senate, rescission bills are not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most legislation in the upper chamber and only require a simple majority.",

Hawk also pleaded guilty to aggravated assault, possessing a gun while committing a crime and concealing the death of another. A murder charge was dropped as part of the plea agreement.",
      "In the early morning hours on Jan. 21, 2021, the DeKalb County Police Department found Hawk's cousin, Frederick Rooks III, suffering from multiple gunshot wounds, with 10 bullet casings found near his body. He was pronounced dead at the scene.",

      "The rapper was a high school junior in suburban Atlanta in 2015 when he released \"Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae)\" and watched it skyrocket into a dance craze. Hawk made multiple other albums, but said in an interview with the medical talk show \"The Doctors\" in 2019 that he struggled with depression and had grown up in a family where he witnessed mental illness and violence.",

      "In August 2020, he was arrested in Santa Ana, California, on a domestic violence charge. The next day, the Los Angeles Police Department charged him with assault with a deadly weapon after witnesses said he entered a home, where he didn't know anyone, looking for his girlfriend and swung a hatchet at two people before he was disarmed.",

      "President Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is still planning to meet with Iran for a sixth round of talks on the country's nuclear program in the coming days, two U.S. officials said.",
      "Mr. Trump spoke about Iran at an appearance at the Kennedy Center Wednesday evening, telling reporters Americans were advised to leave the region \"because it could be a dangerous place, and we'll see what happens.\" Mr. Trump also reiterated the U.S. did not want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, saying: \"We're not going to allow that.\"",

Those options could include aerial refueling or intelligence sharing, but the U.S. official was unaware of any commitment.",
      "The source familiar said the options are unlikely to include direct participation by U.S. B-2 bombers that carry the type of bombs that can penetrate Iran's deep underground fortified uranium enrichment facilities at Fordow and Natanz. Without that type of strike by U.S. B-2 bombers, it is unlikely Israeli military action could destroy the underground portions of Iran's program, and thus solo military action by Israel is presumed to be limited in its capability to fully eliminate the program.",

      "For years, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been deeply skeptical of any deal with Iran. The two countries have been nemeses since Iran's 1979 revolution. Netanyahu's office says Israel has conducted \"countless overt and covert operations\" to stunt the growth of Iran's nuclear program.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump said publicly he had urged Netanyahu not to strike Iran while his administration pursues negotiations with the regime.",
      "\"I told him this would be inappropriate to do right now because we're very close to a solution,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Iran's nuclear program dates back decades, though the country has long insisted the program is only intended for peaceful purposes.",

Mr. Trump exited the agreement during his first term and ratcheted up sanctions against Iran, while the Middle Eastern country expanded its stockpile of highly enriched uranium.",

      "Before cross-examination continued Wednesday of Diddy's ex-girlfriend, who testified using the pseudonym \"Jane,\" the defense told Judge Arun Subramanian that they'd like to respond to the government's attempt to dismiss a Black juror from the case. The U.S. Attorney's Office allegedly told the court that while the situation was less than desirable, they were compelled to because of a lack of candor.",
      "The judge told the court he would rule on the issue if there was any basis for removing a juror and once the defense submitted a letter.",

      "\"Around this time, I just really wanted my partner to get sober,\" Jane testified. \"I just really cared so much about Sean's health, and I could see that he just, like, was excessively partying on top of just so many pills that he takes daily for I don't know what.

This case is about false accusations of sexual harassment and retaliation and a nonexistent smear campaign, which Ms. Lively\u2019s own team conveniently describes as \u2018untraceable\u2019 because they cannot prove what never happened.\"",

      "How the Atom Touch prosthetic arm uses AI and muscle signals",
      "Atom Bodies' flagship product, Atom Touch, is setting a new standard in prosthetic arms. Unlike traditional prosthetics, which often offer only basic movement and can be uncomfortable to wear, Atom Touch uses EMG (electromyography) sensors placed on the user's skin to detect muscle activity. These signals are then interpreted by machine-learning algorithms, allowing users to control individual fingers, the wrist and the elbow with remarkable precision just by thinking about the movement they want to make.",
      "AI ENABLES PARALYZED MAN TO CONTROL ROBOTIC ARM WITH BRAIN SIGNALS",

      "Atom Touch stands out for several reasons. It is the first prosthetic arm to offer true individual finger movement, which means users can perform tasks like typing, gripping and delicate manipulation with much greater ease. The device uses the Atom A1 AI neural interface, which learns from the user's muscle signals to provide seamless, natural movement. Dozens of sensors in the hand generate haptic feedback, so users can better gauge grip strength and control. With more than 10 motors in the hand alone, Atom Touch offers a near-human range of motion and dexterity. The load-balanced harness system also makes the arm lighter than a human arm and comfortable enough for extended wear, addressing a challenge that many current prosthetics have yet to solve.",

Jason Morris, who lost his arm due to a work accident and is Atom Bodies' lead test user, notes that most prosthetics can only be worn for about two hours due to discomfort. Atom Touch is designed for initial wear of four to six hours, with the goal of achieving all-day use. Atom Bodies has already attracted significant interest, with over 11,000 people on its\u00a0wait list and plans to begin clinical trials within the next year, pending FDA approval.",

While state-of-the-art myoelectric arms can cost around $200,000, Atom Bodies plans to offer Atom Touch for approximately $25,000.

When a device is hacked, malicious software might be running in the background, using up memory and processing power. This can make apps slow to open, cause lagging or freezing and even lead to more frequent crashes. You might also notice the battery draining much faster than usual along with the slowdown, since unwanted software can chew through battery life while it secretly runs in the background.",
      "A sudden flood of pop-up ads or strange messages on your iPad screen is a big red flag. Under normal circumstances, iPads should not bombard you with random pop-ups, especially outside of safe apps or websites. If you start seeing lots of unsolicited ads or \"Your iPad is hacked!\" alerts popping up, it could mean an adware program or scam has found its way onto the device. These pop-ups might try to trick you or your kids into clicking links or downloading something harmful, so they\u2019re not just annoying, they\u2019re dangerous signs that something is wrong.",

      "1) Reset your passwords: Change your Apple ID password right away (and any other important account passwords used on the iPad) to lock out any intruders. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don\u2019t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Remove unfamiliar apps: Check the iPad for any apps you or your child didn\u2019t install. If you find an unknown app or a suspicious profile, delete it immediately. This helps eliminate any malicious programs the hacker may have added. To do this, open\u00a0Settings, tap\u00a0General\u00a0>\u00a0iPad Storage, scroll to find the unfamiliar app, tap\u00a0it, then tap\u00a0Delete App and confirm.",
      "3) Update iOS: Make sure the iPad is running the latest version of iPadOS. Apple frequently releases security updates to fix vulnerabilities, so\u00a0updating the software can shut down any loopholes the hacker might have used. Turning on automatic updates is a good idea to stay protected going forward.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication: If you haven\u2019t already,\u00a0turn on two-factor authentication for your Apple ID account. This feature adds an extra verification step (like a code sent to your phone) whenever someone tries to sign in, which can stop hackers in their tracks even if they somehow know your password. It\u2019s an excellent safeguard to prevent unauthorized access.",
      "5) Have strong antivirus protection on all devices: Malware, spyware and viruses can run quietly in the background or compromise enough data before it is discovered. While not being hacked in the first place is the best position to be in, it is worse to give access to your iPad\u2019s data to a hacker for a prolonged period of time.

      "2) Avoid public Wi-Fi when accessing your SSN: If you're checking your SSA account, avoid doing so over unsecured networks like\u00a0public Wi-Fi.

That\u2019s where identity protection services come in. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.

      "A man looking over his Social Security information (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5) Check your credit reports: Make it a habit to review your credit reports regularly. Look for unfamiliar accounts, unauthorized inquiries or incorrect personal information. If something seems off, contact the credit bureau right away to dispute it.",
      "6) Request an IRS Identity Protection PIN: Prevent fraudulent tax filings using your SSN by setting up an\u00a0Identity Protection PIN with the IRS. This six-digit number adds another layer of protection during tax season.",
      "7) Review your Social Security earnings record: Log in to your\u00a0\"My Social Security\" account regularly to review your earnings history and benefits. This helps ensure your information hasn\u2019t been altered or compromised.",

      "Glide underwater with CudaJet and make the ocean your playground. Kurt Knutsson discusses the redesigned tech that might be your next big thrilling adventure.",
      "If you've ever dreamed of gliding underwater with the freedom of a dolphin, the CudaJet might be the gadget for you. Unlike most underwater propulsion systems that strap onto your arms or legs, the CudaJet is worn like a backpack, giving you a hands-free way to cruise beneath the surface. It's a fresh approach that feels a lot more natural and comfortable, especially for longer swims.",
      "The CudaJet's story started almost seven years ago. Back then, it was just a prototype called the Cuda, a passion project by British designer Archie O'Brien during his final year at Loughborough College of Art and Design, now known as Loughborough Design School. Archie wanted something lighter and faster than anything else out there, and in 2023 his vision became reality with the first commercial CudaJet.",
      "Now, the CudaJet has been redesigned with a longer battery life, lighter build and updated features, making it even more appealing to underwater adventure seekers.",

      "CudaJet underwater jetpack: How it works and what\u2019s new",
      "So, what's it like to use? The main unit is a dual-jet-drive pack that attaches to a padded neoprene harness, which you wear on your torso. You control everything with a hardwired, trigger-style remote that lets you adjust your speed and keep an eye on the battery level. One of the biggest improvements for 2025 is the battery. While the original model provided approximately 40 minutes of underwater fun for every 75-minute charge, the latest version extends that time to a full 90 minutes per charge. That's more than double the original runtime, so you can explore even more on a single outing.",
      "CudaJet can take you down to a maximum depth of 131 feet, and it delivers about 88 pounds of thrust. That translates to a top speed of roughly 10 feet per second, or about 6.7 mph. Now, that might not sound fast on land, but underwater it's a whole different story. The company likes to point out that at 10 feet per second, the drag force on your body is about the same as flying through air at nearly 200 mph. It's an exhilarating experience that feels powerful and smooth.",
      "The 2025 redesign also trimmed some weight from the original, reducing it from approximately 33 pounds to just over 30 pounds, including the harness. The harness itself comes in four sizes, so you can get a fit that feels just right. Safety is clearly a priority as well. Each CudaJet ships with a factory-set safety depth of about 10 feet, which you can adjust up to the full 131 feet if you're feeling adventurous. If you ever go past your set limit, the motor cuts out and floats you right back to the surface. The controller's full-color display keeps you updated on your speed, battery and depth at all times.",

Each jetpack is made to order, handcrafted and painted in the U.K. The\u00a02025 package starts at around $31,000, which is a jump from the original price, but it now includes a two-year warranty, a luxury hard case and a fast charger. For those who want something even more exclusive, there's a Founder's Edition with lifetime product access, in-water training with the founder and a lifetime warranty, but only 20 of those are being made.",

The process involves custom-fitting the harness to your size and selecting your preferred finish, all of which are handcrafted in the U.K. Due to this approach, there is typically a wait time before delivery, which varies depending on demand and the customization options.

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Online scams thrive on the urgency and fear of their victims. If you've ever been a victim of a scam, you\u2019d know that bad actors often try to rush you into taking action by creating a sense of fear. A scammer may call you impersonating a government agency and claim your Social Security number has been linked to drug trafficking.",
      "A phishing email might ask you to update your tax details or claim you\u2019ve won a lottery or a free product, all to get you to click a malicious link.",
      "A more effective tactic scammers use is sending fake login alerts. These are warnings that someone has logged into your account, prompting you to take immediate action. This method works well because legitimate services like Google, Apple, Netflix and Facebook also send these types of notifications when someone, including you, logs in from a new device. It can be tricky to tell the difference.",

      "How login alert scams work and why they\u2019re so effective",
      "Scammers often pose as login alerts from Google, Apple, Meta or even your bank, complete with official-looking logos, because fear is effective. But not every alert is a scam. In many cases, these notifications are legitimate and can help you detect unauthorized access to your accounts. Let\u2019s focus on the scam side first.",
      "Login alert scams have been around for a while. Early reports date back to 2021, and the trend has persisted since then. In 2022, reports surfaced that scammers were impersonating Meta and sending phishing emails to users.",
      "FBI WARNS OF SCAM TARGETING VICTIMS WITH FAKE HOSPITALS AND POLICE",
      "One such email used a clean layout with minimal text. It avoided the usual scare tactics and stuck to a simple message. But that is not always the case. A common red flag in phishing attempts is the tendency to overload the email with unnecessary details. These messages often include cluttered formatting, excessive explanations and an increasing number of typos or design errors. One phishing email simply gets to the point:",
      "Someone tried to Iog into Your Account, User lD",

      "What\u2019s concerning now is that poor grammar is no longer a reliable sign of a scam. Thanks to AI, even those with limited English skills can write emails that sound polished and professional. As a result, many phishing messages today read just like legitimate emails from trusted companies.",
      "Receiving a phishing email is not the real issue. The real problem starts when you click on it. Most of these emails contain links that lead to fake login pages, designed to look exactly like platforms such as Facebook, Google or your bank.",
      "If you enter your credentials there, they go directly to the scammer. In some cases, simply clicking the link can trigger a malware download, especially if your browser is outdated or your device lacks proper security.

      "For instance, a legit Google security alert might say, \"We detected a login from a new sign-in to your Google Account on a Pixel 6 Pro device. If this was you, you don't need to do anything. If not, we'll help you secure your account.\"\u00a0\u00a0It may include a \"Check activity\" button, but that link always redirects to a google.com address, and it won\u2019t prompt you to reenter your password via the email link.

Don\u2019t click any links or attachments and use strong antivirus software: Instead, manually log in to the real site (or open the official app) by typing the URL or using a bookmarked link. This guarantees you\u2019re not walking into a scammer\u2019s trap. The FTC recommends this: if you have an account with that company, contact them via the website or phone number you know is real,\u00a0not the info in the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "2. Remove your data from the internet: Scammers are able to send you targeted messages because your data, like your email address or phone number, is already out there. This often happens due to past data breaches and shady data brokers. A data removal service can help clean up your digital trail by removing your information from public databases and people-search sites. It\u2019s not a quick fix, but over time, it reduces how easily scammers can find and target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "3. Check your account activity:\u00a0Go to your account\u2019s security or sign-in page. Services like Gmail, iCloud or your bank let you review recent logins and devices. If you see nothing unusual, you\u2019re safe. If you do find a strange login, follow the site\u2019s process (usually changing your password and logging out all devices). Even if you don\u2019t find anything odd, change your password as a precaution. Do it through the official site or app, not the email. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): This is your best backup. With\u00a02FA enabled, even if someone has your password, they can\u2019t gain access without your phone and an additional second factor. Both Google and Apple make 2FA easy and say it \"makes it harder for scammers\" to hijack your account.",
      "5. Report suspicious emails: If you receive a suspicious email claiming to be from a specific organization, report it to that organization\u2019s official support or security team so they can take appropriate action.",
      "THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING WRONG WHEN SCAMMERS CALL",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "You shouldn\u2019t have to vet every sketchy email. In fact, your email\u2019s spam filters catch most phishing attempts for you. Keep them enabled, and make sure your software is up to date so that malicious sites and attachments are blocked. Still, the most powerful filter is your own awareness. You're definitely not alone in this. People receive these spammy login scares every day. By keeping a cool head and following the steps above, you're already ahead of the game.",

      "May 7 is the deadline to get a REAL ID, and some DMVs are facing large crowds and major backup. FOX's Asher Reed spoke with FOX 35 Orlando from outside a DMV in Antioch, Tennessee, with more on the issue.",
      "If you've received a text message claiming to be from your state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and threatening you with fines or penalties unless you pay up, you're not alone. A new wave of scam texts is sweeping across the country, targeting drivers in states like Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida, New York, California, Illinois, New Jersey, Virginia, Colorado, Vermont, Texas, North Carolina and even Washington, D.C.",
      "These messages look official and urgent, warning you about supposed unpaid tickets or tolls and demanding immediate payment. But don't be fooled, as these texts are sophisticated scams designed to steal your personal information or money.",

      "These scam messages vary slightly depending on the state you're in, but they\u2019re generally structured in the same way. The text threatens consequences, such as credit score damage, revoked driving privileges, suspended vehicle registration or increased toll fees, if you do not pay the bill you have supposedly incurred. To make the message appear legit, the scammers often include a date for penalties to begin, a fake administrative code and a link that appears to be an official DMV website.",

These are two powerful psychological motivators that can send you into a panic since your driving privileges are at risk, or you're facing financial consequences. The aim is to get you to act hastily without pausing to verify the source.

      "If you receive a suspicious text message claiming to be from your state's DMV and demanding payment or personal information, follow these steps to protect yourself:",
      "1. Be skeptical of any message creating urgency or panic: Scammers rely on fear and urgency to trick you into acting without thinking. If a message pressures you to act immediately, that's a major red flag.",
      "2. Check for obvious red flags: Look for signs like strange sender addresses, awkward language, misspellings or links that don't match your state's official DMV website.",
      "3. Do not click any links or reply, and use strong antivirus software: Legitimate DMVs will not ask for payments, personal details or sensitive information via unsolicited text messages. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Verify directly with your DMV: If you're concerned the message might be real, contact your state's DMV using the official website or a trusted phone number. Never use the contact information provided in the suspicious text.",
      "5. Consider a Personal Data Removal Service:\u00a0Your personal information is widely available online, which can make you a bigger target for these types of scams, therefore you might look into a personal data removal service. These services work by submitting opt-out requests to data brokers that collect and sell your information, helping to reduce your digital footprint and making it harder for scammers to find your contact details.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6. Delete the message immediately and block the sender: Removing the text helps prevent accidental clicks and reduces the risk of falling for the scam later. Also, be sure to\u00a0block phone numbers and texts that send spam or scam messages, reducing future risk.",
      "7. Register your number with the\u00a0National Do Not Call Registry: While this won't stop all scams, it can help reduce unwanted communications.",
      "8. Don't provide any personal or financial information: Never share your Social Security number, driver's license number, banking information, or passwords in response to an unsolicited text.",
      "9. If you clicked the link or gave out information, act quickly: If you accidentally entered personal or financial information, contact your bank, credit card provider or local law enforcement right away to minimize potential damage.",
      "10. Keep your phone's security features updated: Ensure your\u00a0device's operating system and security software are current to help block known scam numbers and malicious links.",
      "11. Report the scam:\u00a0Forward the message to 7726 (SPAM) to alert your mobile provider and help block similar messages in the future. Mark the message as junk or spam within your messaging app, if possible. File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at\u00a0reportfraud.ftc.gov or the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center at\u00a0ic3.gov.",
      "DON\u2019T GET CAUGHT IN THE \"APPLE ID SUSPENDED\" PHISHING SCAM",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Scam texts pretending to be from the DMV are getting more convincing, but you don't have to be their next victim. Staying skeptical of urgent messages, double-checking anything that seems off and never clicking suspicious links can go a long way in protecting your personal information. Remember, the real DMV will never pressure you for payment or sensitive details over text. By staying alert, you can help prevent these scams and keep your personal information and money secure.",

      "E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users.",
      "The demographic landscape in the U.S. is shifting rapidly, with the median age now at 38.9, almost a decade older than it was in 1980.",
      "By 2050, the population of adults over 65 is projected to surge from 58 million to 82 million, intensifying the already urgent challenge of eldercare. With falls remaining the top cause of injury among older adults, the need for innovative, tech-driven solutions has never been clearer.",

      "How MIT\u2019s E-BAR robot helps prevent falls and support senior mobility",
      "E-BAR, short for\u00a0Elderly Bodily Assistance Robot, is not your typical assistive device. Rather than relying on harnesses or wearables, which many seniors find cumbersome or stigmatizing, E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users from behind. This allows individuals to walk freely, lean on the robot's arms for support or receive full-body assistance when transitioning between sitting and standing. The robot's articulated body, constructed from 18 interconnected bars, mimics the natural movement of the human body, delivering a seamless and intuitive experience.",
      "AI ROBOTS HELP NURSES BEAT BURNOUT AND TRANSFORM HOSPITAL CARE",
      "The engineering behind E-BAR's mobility is equally impressive. The robot's 220-pound base is meticulously designed to support the weight of an average adult without tipping or slipping, and its omnidirectional wheels enable smooth navigation through tight spaces and around household obstacles. This means E-BAR can move effortlessly alongside users, providing support in real time, whether they are reaching for a high shelf or stepping out of a bathtub.",

      "BEST CREDIT CARDS FOR SENIORS AND RETIREES 2025",
      "Inside MIT\u2019s E-BAR: A fall-prevention robot designed for aging in place",
      "What sets E-BAR apart from previous eldercare robots is its integrated fall-prevention system. Each arm is embedded with airbags made from soft, grippable materials that can inflate instantly if a fall is detected. This rapid response cushions the user without causing bruising, and, crucially, it does so without requiring the user to wear any special gear. In lab tests, E-BAR successfully supported elderly volunteers as they performed everyday tasks that often pose a risk for falls, such as bending down, stretching up or navigating the tricky edge of a bathtub.",
      "Currently, E-BAR is operated via remote control, but the MIT team is already working on automating its navigation and assistance features. The vision is for future versions to autonomously follow users, assess their real-time fall risk using machine learning algorithms and provide adaptive support as their mobility needs evolve.",

      "The E-BAR project is rooted in extensive interviews with seniors and caregivers, which revealed a strong preference for unobtrusive, non-restrictive support systems. E-BAR's U-shaped handlebars leave the front of the user completely open, allowing for a natural stride and easy exit at any time. The robot is slim enough to fit through standard doorways and is designed to blend into the home environment, making it a practical addition rather than an intrusive medical device.",
      "MIT researchers see E-BAR as part of a broader ecosystem of assistive technologies, each tailored to different stages of aging and mobility. While some devices may offer predictive fall detection or harness-based support, E-BAR's unique combination of full-body assistance, fall prevention and user autonomy addresses a critical gap for those who want to maintain independence but need occasional support.",

The research team is continuing to refine the design and aims to bring it to market in the coming years, but it could take 5\u201310 years before the device receives full regulatory approval and becomes commercially accessible.",
      "Looking forward, the research team is also focused on refining E-BAR's design to make it slimmer, more maneuverable and even more intuitive to use. They are also exploring ways to integrate advanced AI for real-time fall prediction and adaptive assistance, ensuring that the robot can meet users' changing needs as they age.

      "\"The longer this war continues on our territory, the more warfare technologies evolve, and the greater the threat will be to everyone,\" Zelenskyy said Tuesday. \"This must be addressed now, not when thousands of upgraded Shahed drones and ballistic missiles begin to threaten Seoul and Tokyo.\"",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s warning came just one day after Ukraine's military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, confirmed in an interview with The War Zone that Russia has significantly improved\u00a0North Korea's KN-23 ballistic missiles.",

      "Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, on Monday issued a warning statement that the agency has not only long been barred access to old and new nuclear sites, but that Iran has scrubbed locations in an apparent move to cover up its activities.",
      "In 2020, the IAEA found man-made particles of enriched uranium at three sites, including Varamin, Marivan and Turquzabad. The locations were previously utilized in Iran\u2019s nuclear program and gave the agency credence to believe Tehran had once again turned to deadly nuclear ambitions.",
      "\"Since then, we have been seeking explanations and clarifications from Iran for the presence of these uranium particles, including through a number of high-level meetings and consultations in which I have been personally involved,\" Grossi said. \"Unfortunately, Iran has repeatedly either not answered, or not provided technically credible answers to, the Agency\u2019s questions.",
      "\"It has also sought to sanitize the locations, which has impeded Agency verification activities,\" he added.",
      "Grossi, who confirmed during an April trip to Washington, D.C. that the IAEA has not been involved in nuclear negotiations between the U.S. and Iran, said on Monday that he has been working \"closely and intensively\" with both parties in \"support of their bilateral negotiation[s].\"",
      "The warning comes after the IAEA in a report late last month, also confirmed that Iran had drastically increased its stockpile of near-weapons-grade enriched uranium by nearly 35% in three months.",

    "story": [
      "It was approaching nightfall in Los Angeles on Sunday when black-clad demonstrators began to torch a row of self-driving Waymo taxis. Within minutes, videos of the fiery scenes began to pop up on social media.",
      "\u201cMORE. MORE AND MORE AND MORE,\u201d a group known as Unity of Fields posted on X, along with a video of the flaming vehicles.",
      "The post wasn\u2019t an anomaly. Since the start of the demonstrations against immigration raids in Los Angeles, the Unity of Fields X account has been pumping out messages urging people to wreak havoc in the streets and \u201cgive 'em hell.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s part of a far-left online ecosystem that has proliferated in recent years, experts say. Some of the groups behind the accounts express contempt for peaceful resistance and glorify acts of violence \u2014 and even murders, like those of the UnitedHealthcare CEO and two Israeli Embassy staffers.",
      "The leftist networks tend to be different from right-wing groups in that they are typically decentralized with no leadership structures. But they can be highly adept at using social media, and some have been working hard to amplify and celebrate the acts of violent protesters in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cWhether they directly threw a Molotov cocktail is actually not as essential as the ecosystem of encouragement and coordination they have created,\u201d said Joel Finkelstein, a co-founder of the Network Contagion Research Institute, a nonpartisan group that tracks online extremism.",
      "The unrest in Los Angeles follows a pattern that has played out in numerous cities over the past five years in which protests that break out remain mostly peaceful during the day, but at night agitators engage in fiery clashes with police.",
      "That dynamic tends to distract from the focus of the demonstrations \u2014 in this case, workplace immigration raids by federal agents \u2014 and provide fodder to people who oppose them. In this case, that\u2019s President Donald Trump and his supporters, who have sought to dismiss the broader protest movement as the work of \u201cpaid insurrectionists.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s concerning is the attempt to conflate the individual actors who do commit violence with the mass movement as a whole,\u201d said Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University.",
      "He said the narrative pushed by some people on the right \u2014 in his words, that there\u2019s a \u201croving band of antifa groupies who are following protests from city to city\u201d \u2014 doesn\u2019t comport with reality.",
      "But, Lewis added, there has no doubt been a normalization of violence in parts of the left, although it is more fractured than in right-wing groups.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of anti-capitalist stuff in one case. A little bit of antisemitic stuff in another case,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that reflects the nature of those online leftist movements where there is no cohesive, central structure.\u201d",
      "More than 300 people have been arrested since the demonstrations broke out Friday in Los Angeles, police say. The charges include failure to disperse, looting, arson and attacks on police officers. Police Chief Jim McDonnell said demonstrators have shot commercial-grade fireworks at police officers and hurled pieces of concrete at them.",
      "Were they the acts of lone wolves seizing an opportunity to target police? Or was there a level of coordination and planning among the instigators?",
      "Experts say it\u2019s likely to be a combination of both.",
      "\u201cYou have the organized protests by people who are committed to a particular cause, and then you have radical fringes,\u201d said Dan Byman, the director of the Warfare, Irregular Threats and Terrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "\u201cThey might put on airs and call themselves anarchists or something like that, but they\u2019re young people who like destruction.\u201d",
      "The Network Contagion Research Institute has been analyzing the rise of what it calls \u201canarcho-socialist extremism.\u201d It has found that the chaos and violence that have broken out at some of the major protests in recent years, like those against the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, weren\u2019t as spontaneous as they might have seemed.",
      "\u201cWhat we found in our research is there are groups that were attempting to exploit the situation, oftentimes after dark, and their coordination was somewhat sophisticated,\u201d said Alex Goldenberg, a senior adviser to the Network Contagion Research Institute.",
      "That involved demonstrators\u2019 surveilling police movements and sharing tips about making the most destructive Molotov cocktails, Goldenberg said.",
      "\u201cThey were trying to exploit an already volatile situation in an attempt to provoke violent clashes with police, create viral moments to inflame tensions and draw in others through emotional triggers,\u201d he said.",
      "Soon after it launched in 2019, the Network Contagion Research Institute focused on right-wing threats like the Boogaloos, a loose-knit anti-government movement that calls for violence against law enforcement and political opponents. But it soon found that left-wing groups were using many of the same tactics to incite violence.",
      "A 2022 report by the institute found that animus toward law enforcement among anarchist types had been proliferating online for years. The appearance of posts with anti-police outrage and/or memes and coded language increased over 1,000% on Twitter and 300% on Reddit during the period of the Floyd protests in 2020, the report found.",

      "The violent demonstrators seemed to represent a mishmash of causes.",
      "Many of the people seen hurling objects at police and setting fires were dressed in all black, their faces covered in masks. Some waved Mexican flags, others Palestinian flags. At least one man was photographed wearing a Hamas armband.",
      "\u201cAngelenos throwing Modelo Molotovs at ICE while wearing Keffiyehs,\u201d read a post on X by Unity of Fields. \u201cWe are locked the f--k in, folks.\u201d",
      "Unity of Fields, which was formerly known as Palestine Action US, describes itself as a \u201cmilitant front against the US-NATO-zionist axis of imperialism.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Unity of Fields concept comes from the Palestinian resistance,\u201d the group said last year in a blog post announcing the name change. \u201cIt refers to the coordination between all the factions on the battlefield despite their geographic fragmentation or ideological differences.\u201d",
      "Finkelstein, the co-founder of the Network Contagion Research Institute, said such groups and the people who follow them represent what he described as \u201cassassination culture\u201d \u2014 in which targeted killings are considered acceptable by those who harbor an array of grievances.",
      "Unity of Fields, for example, is helping raise money to cover legal costs for Elias Rodriguez, the Chicago man accused of fatally shooting the Israeli Embassy workers outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington last month.",
      "\u201cMy sense is that beneath these grievances is a shared sense of loss of control,\u201d said Finkelstein, who is a psychologist and a neuroscientist. \u201cWho are the people that really feel a sense of hopelessness in their lives? Most are looking for significance, and they think they found it here.\u201d",
      "In response to a request for comment, Unity of Fields wrote: \u201cWe will never condemn people who fight to free themselves.

    "summary": "Uniformed soldiers cheered and booed along with political statements, something typically frowned upon and potentially a violation of military regulations.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Defense Department officials say troops who cheered and jeered Tuesday at President Donald Trump\u2019s political statements at a rally at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, did not violate military regulations, but a former military legal officer said they did just that.",
      "During the speech, uniformed soldiers yelled in support of Trump\u2019s political statements and booed former President Joe Biden and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "\u201cDo you think this crowd would have showed up for Biden? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Trump said to boos about Biden.",
      "Trump made other comments about Newsom and about Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, where protests against the administration\u2019s crackdown on immigrants have been taking place and where Trump has ordered thousands of National Guard members and active-duty Marines deployed in response. Other Trump comments about the \u201cfake news media,\u201d transgender people, protesters in California and flag-burning also drew boos from the uniformed military members in attendance.",
      "Trump is known for his rallies at which he goes after and pokes fun at political enemies and other issues, but typically he makes those remarks at political events, not on U.S. military bases.",
      "Such overt political activity on a base is the prerogative of the commander in chief. But military leaders would typically frown upon troops\u2019 reacting the way they did as inconsistent with military good order and discipline, and, according to one expert, it is a violation of military regulations found in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or UCMJ.",
      "Presidents of both parties often use troops as political props and put them and their commanders in difficult positions by doing so, but Trump\u2019s speech took that to a new level, said Geoffrey DeWeese, a retired judge advocate general who is now an attorney with Mark S. Zaid PC. (Zaid has represented whistleblowers on both sides of the aisle, including one who filed a complaint about Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in 2019 that led to Trump\u2019s impeachment, and he was one of the people whose security clearances Trump revoked this year.)",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sad tradition to use the military as a backdrop for political purposes,\u201d DeWeese said. \u201cTo actively attack another president or a sitting governor and incite the crowd to boo, that\u2019s a step in a dangerous direction, that really says we want to politicize the military, that sends a bad message.\u201d",
      "DeWeese said there were likely to have been violations of the UCMJ.",
      "\u201cI would be cringing if I was a senior officer and it happened under my watch,\u201d he said.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said repeatedly that he wants to take politics out of the military by removing diversity, equity and inclusion programs and banning service by transgender service members.",
      "Kori Schake, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who worked at the State Department and the National Security Council under former President George W. Bush and at the Pentagon under former President George H.W. Bush, said in an email that commanders at Fort Bragg should have done a better job preparing troops there.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s predictably bad behavior by the President to try and score political points in a military setting, and it\u2019s a command failure by leaders at Ft Bragg not to prepare soldiers for that bad behavior and counsel them not to participate.\u201d",
      "The Pentagon said in a statement that there had been no violation of the UCMJ and suggested the media was against policies that Trump has championed.",
      "Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell also alleged in a statement that the media \u201ccheered on the Biden administration\u201d and its policies regarding the Defense Department \u201cwhen they forced drag queen performances on military bases, promoted service members on the basis of race and sex in violation of federal law, and fired troops who refused an experimental vaccine.\u201d",
      "\u201cBelieve me, no one needs to be encouraged to boo the media,\u201d Parnell said. \u201cLook no further than this query, which is nothing more than a disgraceful attempt to ruin the lives of young soldiers.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, Army officials at Fort Bragg addressed the sale of some MAGA merchandise at the event, which was planned in cooperation with a nonpartisan organization, American 250.",
      "\u201cThe Army remains committed to its core values and apolitical service to the nation,\u201d Col. Mary Ricks, a spokeswoman for the Army\u2019s 18th Airborne Corps at Bragg, said in a statement. \u201cThe Army does not endorse political merchandise or the views it represents. The vendor\u2019s presence is under review to determine how it was permitted and to prevent similar circumstances in the future.\u201d",
      "The Army\u2019s own new field manual, published recently, says the apolitical nature of being a U.S. soldier is what contributes to the public trust.",

      "\u201cAs a private citizen you are encouraged to participate in our democratic process, but as a soldier you must be mindful of how your actions may affect the reputation and perceived trustworthiness of our Army as an institution,\u201d it says."

    "story": [
      "Scientists searching for a cure for cancer have no trouble finding public support. But for those studying potato disease, it\u2019s a tougher sell.",
      "The Trump administration seems to have banked on the idea that the public will see much of scientific research as wasteful or arcane. It has slashed \u2014 or proposed slashing \u2014 billions in research funding.",
      "Faced with this existential crisis, academics are seeking new ways to rally public and political support to fight the cuts and preserve their funding.",
      "Enter a group of Cornell University graduate students with an ambitious plan to change the way people think about science. They have recruited more than 500 researchers across all 50 states to write op-eds for local news outlets, to be published over the next week. The idea, said Emma Scales, a Cornell doctoral student involved in the effort, is to have scientists introduce themselves to the public.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s speaking to people who are angry about not knowing where their money is going,\u201d Scales said. \u201cLike, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m one of those people using your money. I\u2019m sorry that we haven\u2019t talked, but let me tell you what I do.\u2019\u201d",
      "The McClintock Letters, as the project is known, is one of several efforts underway by graduate students and faculty members with the same goal in mind.",
      "They reflect a growing recognition that researchers can\u2019t take public support for granted. If they don\u2019t act now, many are starting to realize, public trust in scientists will continue to slide and the funding may never return.",
      "Science Homecoming, a letter-writing campaign, encourages academics to focus on the role government dollars play in science. Stand Up for Science, a new nonprofit, is planning a series of demonstrations at state fairs and farmers markets, along with teach-ins at churches and open lab days this summer. Another new organization, Your Neighborhood Scientist, publishes essays by researchers and tries to encourage community-based conversations about science.",
      "Audrey Drotos, a University of Pennsylvania neuroscience researcher who co-founded Your Neighborhood Scientist, sees efforts like hers as a way for scientists to share their own excitement.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to just add more noise to the system,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to humanize scientists \u2014 that\u2019s really the underlying goal.\u201d",
      "The inspiration for the McClintock Letters took root in February, when Isako Di Tomassi, a doctoral student studying plant pathology, vented online about losing her Ph.D. adviser at the U.S. Department of Agriculture after widespread government layoffs this year.",
      "Some online commenters were sympathetic, Di Tomassi said, but one person insisted that the cuts had stopped \u201cstupid research,\u201d and many others expressed confusion as to what universities were even studying. Few seemed to see the value in their work.",
      "Di Tomassi and Scales brainstormed with the Cornell Advancing Science and Policy Club about what to do in response and landed on the idea of having researchers tell their own stories.",
      "They named their effort after Barbara McClintock, the late Cornell cytogeneticist who won a Nobel Prize, and planned it around her birthday, June 16. Her research on the genes in corn changed scientists\u2019 understanding of heredity and laid the foundation for treating genetic defects in humans.",
      "\u201cBarbara McClintock is famous as hell,\u201d Di Tomassi said, \u201cbut maybe not to a nonscientist because she studied corn DNA. So most people will be like, \u2018Who cares about corn DNA?\u2019\u201d",
      "But that\u2019s exactly the point, Di Tomassi said: bridging the disconnect between what the scientific community knows and what the average person understands. Even mundane-sounding experiments can help fuel medical and scientific breakthroughs, she said.",
      "Researchers have signed up to write about breast cancer metastasis, how memories are formed and sustainable grape-harvesting, among other things. They are on track to reach 8 million potential readers, based on the organizers\u2019 back-of-the-envelope calculations of each news outlet\u2019s audience size.",
      "During a June 6 webinar, Katherine Xue, a microbiologist at the University of California, Irvine, walked some 100 people through how to write an op-ed. She showed them a 2015 op-ed by Newt Gingrich that called for more research funding as a template.",
      "Xue reminded them to avoid jargon and make it personal. She plans to write for a newspaper in her hometown of Oak Ridge, Tennessee, about how a high school internship got her interested in microbiology.",
      "\u201cAs scientists, we\u2019re trained to stay impersonal and to take ourselves out of the equation,\u201d Xue told NBC News. But there\u2019s a downside to that approach, she said. \u201cI think a lot of people haven\u2019t met scientists and don\u2019t know a lot about what we do and why, which means it\u2019s easy to distrust science as a whole.\u201d",
      "Recent polling backs up her point. While 76% of Americans have confidence in scientists, that\u2019s down from 87% in 2020, surveys by the Pew Research Center show. Pew also found a majority of Americans believe that scientists are not good communicators, and that nearly half think scientists view themselves as superior to others.",
      "Silly-sounding research projects have long been a political punching bag. Some senators have issued annual reports flagging what they consider wasteful spending on science.",
      "During Trump\u2019s March speech to Congress, he rattled off a list of what he deemed ridiculous projects funded by the Biden administration, including research he incorrectly described as making mice transgender (it actually looked at the role of hormones in health and fertility). The White House defended the president\u2019s remarks.",
      "In response to questions about research cuts, White House spokesman Kush Desai said they were in line with what voters want. \u201cThe American people gave President Trump a resounding mandate to realign government spending to better reflect their priorities,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThe Administration is committed to delivering on this mandate.\u201d",
      "For her new book, \u201cThe Salmon Cannon and the Levitating Frog,\u201d Carly Anne York, an animal behaviorist at Lenoir-Rhyne University in North Carolina, profiled a handful of scientists who have engaged directly with disparagers to defend their research.",
      "One professor profiled in the book responded to mockery of her work as \u201cShrimp Fight Club\u201d by joining other academics in setting up a mini-science fair on Capitol Hill, where she shared that the research into how shrimp fight had generated interest in designing new types of body armor for humans.",
      "\u201cI wish that more scientists would think that way,\u201d York said. \u201cThis is actually our burden to make sure the public understands why their taxpayer dollars go to us, what we do with it, and why what we do matters.\u201d",
      "So will the McClintock Letters or other campaigns work? Students and faculty members planning to participate aren\u2019t sure, but many say that\u2019s not the only goal \u2014 and hope they go further.",
      "For Michael Lubell, a physics professor at City College of New York and a former public affairs director for the American Physical Society, their success will depend on whether there\u2019s an ongoing effort to connect with the public.",
      "Lubell said they should meet people in person as well \u2014 at Rotary Clubs, churches and temples, or in PTA meetings.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to try to do something and get people to come to you, you\u2019re only going to get a sliver of the population to do that, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll move the needle,\u201d he said. \u201cGo where they are \u2014 see what they value.

      "During the same period, 15 suburbs went from being predominantly composed of homeowners to majority-renter communities. The trend spans fast-growing Sun Belt metros like Dallas, Houston and Miami as well as Northeastern cities like Boston and Philadelphia.",
      "In five of those top 20 metro areas \u2014 Dallas, Minneapolis, Boston, Tampa and Baltimore \u2014 the suburbs are gaining renters faster than the urban centers they surround, Point2Homes found. The share of residents who rent surged in the Dallas suburbs by 17.6% from 2018 to 2023, while that rate rose just 7.9% in the city itself \u2014 with the nearby suburbs of Frisco, McKinney and Grand Prairie each gaining over 5,000 renter households apiece during that period.",

That\u2019s no longer the case: Homebuying is now more difficult in the suburban counties surrounding Dallas than it is in Dallas County itself, the NBC News Home Buyer Index shows.",

Average interest rates on the popular 30-year fixed home loan currently hover just under 7%, levels not seen since before the 2008 financial crisis.

      "\u201cThe ability to have one payment that covers all your expenses generally \u2014 you don\u2019t have to deal with the mortgage payment and the home insurance and maybe the HOA and then a lot of maintenance expense, so on \u2014 has been something that for a lot of people has been worth it,\u201d said George Ratiu, vice president of research at the National Apartment Association trade group, which represents rental operators.",
      "Developers have also been building different types of properties for suburban tenants, including multifamily complexes. Jay Parsons, a housing economist and host of \u201cThe Rent Roll\u201d podcast, points to the rise of \u201csuburban downtowns,\u201d partly fueled by the pandemic-era shift to remote work. These mixed-use developments are typically aimed at offering younger families a balance between urban convenience and suburban amenities, he said.",
      "\u201cYou can still be close to your job. You can be close to nice restaurants and shops but live in a suburban area where you\u2019re still using a car, and you still have probably a rent that\u2019s more affordable than living in most downtowns,\u201d Parsons said.",
      "Coulson doesn\u2019t expect the appeal of the suburbs to fade anytime soon, which could prop up prices in many of them for buyers and renters alike.",
      "\u201cIf you work downtown, it\u2019s still an advantage to live downtown, but it\u2019s not as great an advantage\u201d as it used to be, he said, now that remote work remains commonplace \u2014 despite an ongoing drumbeat of return-to-office mandates. \u201cWhat that does is also raise the cost of living in the suburbs, because now more people want to live in the suburbs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a dynamic that\u2019s going to have to work itself out a little bit more before we know the final impact on suburban versus downtown pricing,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Early in the second quarter of Game 3 of the NBA Finals, the Indiana Pacers\u2019 home crowd was in a bit of a lull.",
      "After leading nearly the entire first quarter, the Oklahoma City Thunder began the second period with an eight-point advantage, a sobering continuation from Game 2, which the Thunder led for the last 38 minutes of play.",
      "Despite it being the first finals game in Indiana in 25 years, the energy in the arena was fading.",
      "But then T.J. McConnell went to work.",
      "In the first three and minutes and 52 seconds of the second, Indiana went on a 15-4 run, taking its first lead of the finals since the first quarter of Game 2.",
      "In that time, McConnell recorded four assists, three steals, two points and one offensive rebound \u2014 a scintillating stretch of play that brought a tense home crowd back to life.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a guy that inspires a lot of people,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said postgame. \u201cHe inspires our team a lot.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis energy is unbelievable,\u201d guard Tyrese Haliburton said. \u201cYou guys know he\u2019s definitely a crowd favorite. I joke with him, I call him the \u2018Great White Hope.\u2019 He does a great job of bringing energy in this building.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s just so dynamic in terms of running the floor for us,\u201d forward Pascal Siakam added. \u201cAnd when you add those steals and just bringing the crowd into the game the way he does, he was special tonight.\u201d",
      "McConnell\u2019s energy boost and clutch play played a critical role in Indiana\u2019s 116-107 win, which also gave the team a 2-1 lead in a series that very few expected the Pacers to win. McConnell finished the game with 10 points, five assists and five steals, the first player in NBA history to post those numbers off the bench in a finals game. He was also a plus-12 in only 15 minutes.",
      "Three of McConnell\u2019s five steals came via what\u2019s become his signature play \u2014 lurking in the backcourt and taking advantage of unsuspecting and/or lazy inbounds passes for turnovers. Two of those steals led to points for Indiana, including a game-tying bucket in the fourth quarter, and all of them drew huge reactions from the crowd.",
      "McConnell, who is listed at 6\u20191\u201d, is the shortest player on either team in the finals. But despite taking up little space on the court, and playing the second-fewest bench minutes on the team, his impact was outsized.",
      "\u201cIn a series like this what\u2019s so important is the margins,\u201d Haliburton said. \u201cYou have to win in the margins. It\u2019s not necessarily who can make the most shots or anything. It\u2019s taking care of the ball, rebounding, little things like that...[McConnell] did a great job of consistently getting there and making hustle play after hustle play, and sticking with it, and I thought we did a great job of just feeding off of what he was doing.\u201d",
      "The entire Indiana bench, in particular, seemed to feed off McConnell.",
      "The Pacers\u2019 backups made a massive difference in Game 3, outscoring the Thunder reserves 49-18. Pacers guard Bennedict Mathurin was the game\u2019s leading scorer, racking up 27 points in only 22 minutes.",
      "A 10-year veteran in his sixth season with Indiana, McConnell has always been the type of player to make the most of his opportunity. He hasn\u2019t started more than eight games in a season since 2017, and he\u2019s never averaged more than 26.3 minutes a night in his career.",
      "On Wednesday, though, he changed the course of the game, and perhaps even the series.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been like a big brother to me since I\u2019ve gotten here,\u201d Haliburton said. \u201cYou look at T.J. McConnell and his story is unbelievable. So I just enjoy being able to play alongside him and the energy he gives his teammates in this building is \u2014 he\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK \u2014 More than 460 laid-off employees at the nation\u2019s top public health agency received notices Wednesday that they are being reinstated, according to a union representing the workers.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services confirmed reinstatement notices went out to the former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employees, but provided few details.",
      "About 2,400 CDC employees lost their jobs in a wave of cuts across federal health agencies in early April, according to a tally at the time.",
      "Whole CDC programs were essentially shut down, including some focused on smoking, lead poisoning, gun violence, asthma and air quality, and workplace safety and health. The entire office that handles Freedom of Information Act requests was shuttered. Infectious disease programs took a hit, too, including programs that fight outbreaks in other countries, labs focused on HIV and hepatitis in the U.S., and staff trying to eliminate tuberculosis.",
      "An estimated 200 of the reinstated workers are based in the CDC\u2019s National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention, HHS officials confirmed. Staffers at a CDC lab that does testing for sexually transmitted diseases are being brought back, said one CDC employee who wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss what happened and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
      "Also reinstated are an estimated 150 employees at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Environmental Health, including people staffing a lab that works on lead poisoning, according to the union and employees.",
      "Layoffs at federal agencies were challenged in lawsuits, with judges in some cases ordering federal agencies to halt terminations of employees.",
      "Officials at HHS have never detailed how they made the layoff decisions in the first place. And they did not answer questions about why the notices went out, or how decisions were made about who to bring back.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the agency was streamlining operations and that \u201cthe nation\u2019s critical public health functions remain intact and effective.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration is committed to protecting essential services \u2014 whether it\u2019s supporting coal miners and firefighters through NIOSH, safeguarding public health through lead prevention, or researching and tracking the most prevalent communicable diseases,\u201d he said.",
      "The reinstatements don\u2019t undo the damage being done by Kennedy and the Trump administration to federal public health, said members of Fired But Fighting, a group of affected CDC workers who have helped organize rallies in Atlanta. The most recent was in the rain on Tuesday, at which some attendees called for Kennedy to resign.",
      "\u201cBringing a few hundred people back to work out of thousands fired is a start, but there are still countless programs at CDC that have been cut, which will lead to increased disease and death,\u201d one of the group\u2019s founding members, Abby Tighe, said in a statement.",
      "This is not the first time that employees at the Atlanta-based agency were told they were being terminated only to then be told to come back. After an earlier round of termination notices went out in February, about 180 CDC employees in March were told to come back."

      "John Fitzgerald Hanson, 61, is set to receive a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. Hanson was sentenced to die after he was convicted of carjacking, kidnapping and killing a Tulsa woman in 1999.",
      "Hanson, whose name in some federal court records is George John Hanson, had been serving a life sentence in federal prison in Louisiana for several unrelated federal convictions. Federal officials transferred him to Oklahoma custody in March to follow through on President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping executive order to more actively support the death penalty.",
      "Hanson\u2019s attorneys argued in a last-minute appeal that he did not receive a fair clemency hearing last month, claiming that one of the board members who denied him clemency was biased because he worked for the Tulsa County District Attorney\u2019s Office when Hanson was prosecuted. A district court judge this week temporary halted the execution, but an appeals court later cleared the way for it.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court late Wednesday rejected a separate appeal that alleged a key witness testified against Hanson in exchange for favorable treatment from prosecutors in a criminal case, information that was never disclosed to his defense team.",
      "Prosecutors allege Hanson and accomplice, Victor Miller, kidnapped Mary Bowles from a Tulsa shopping mall. Prosecutors allege the pair drove Bowles to a gravel pit near Owasso, where Miller shot and killed property owner Jerald Thurman. The two then drove Bowles a short distance away, where Hanson shot and killed Bowles, according to prosecutors. Miller received a no-parole life prison sentence for his role in the crimes.",
      "During last month\u2019s clemency hearing, Hanson expressed remorse for his involvement in the crimes and apologized to the victims\u2019 families.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not an evil person,\u201d Hanson said via a video link from the prison. \u201cI was caught in a situation I couldn\u2019t control. I can\u2019t change the past, but I would if I could.\u201d",
      "Hanson\u2019s attorneys acknowledged he participated in the kidnapping and carjacking, but said there was no definitive evidence that he shot and killed Bowles. They painted Hanson as a troubled youth with autism and who was controlled and manipulated by the domineering Miller."

      "America\u2019s housing affordability problem has seeped into suburbs \u2014 so much so that it has become easier to rent than buy in several areas near major cities, according to recent analysis looking at rentership from 2018 to 2023. Among the metros where nearby suburbs have become majority-renter communities are Dallas, Houston, Miami, Boston and Philadelphia.",
      "From my perch in Los Angeles, where renting feels more like the norm than the exception, I find the shift in who has a stake in America\u2019s suburbs to be eye-opening. As experts told intern Evie Steele for this story, renting is a way for families to get the space and lifestyle of suburbia without the cost of a mortgage, which has risen sharply since the pandemic.

      "Renting is taking off in the suburbs as homeownership remains out of reach for many would-be buyers.",
      "Between 2018 and 2023, rentership surged by at least 5 percentage points in 11 out of 20 suburbs surrounding the largest U.S. metro areas, according to a recent analysis by Point2Homes, a rental market research company.",
      "During the same period, 15 suburbs went from being predominantly composed of homeowners to majority-renter communities. The trend spans fast-growing Sun Belt metros like Dallas, Houston and Miami as well as Northeastern cities like Boston and Philadelphia.",
      "In five of those top 20 metro areas \u2014 Dallas, Minneapolis, Boston, Tampa and Baltimore \u2014 the suburbs are gaining renters faster than the urban centers they surround, Point2Homes found. The share of residents who rent surged in the Dallas suburbs by 17.6% from 2018 to 2023, while that rate rose just 7.9% in the city itself \u2014 with the nearby suburbs of Frisco, McKinney and Grand Prairie each gaining over 5,000 renter households apiece during that period.",
      "Back in 2018, it was harder to buy a home in Dallas County, where most of the city sits, than it was in the metro area\u2019s more suburban counties, like those including Frisco, McKinney and Grand Prairie \u2014 suburbs where the ranks of renters have swelled faster than virtually anywhere else, Point2Homes found. That\u2019s no longer the case: Homebuying is now more difficult in the suburban counties surrounding Dallas than it is in Dallas County itself, the NBC News Home Buyer Index shows.",
      "Housing affordability is a nationwide problem spanning cities and suburbs alike.",
      "Mortgage costs have risen sharply since the pandemic, pricing out many prospective buyers in all sorts of in-demand areas. Average interest rates on the popular 30-year fixed home loan currently hover just under 7%, levels not seen since before the 2008 financial crisis. In a market this tough, some housing experts say the proliferation of rental properties has helped keep suburban lifestyles accessible to people who otherwise couldn\u2019t afford them.",
      "\u201cYou have your own land, you have kids or you have a dog, and you want that space,\u201d said N. Edward Coulson, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, and the director of its Center for Real Estate. \u201cThey get all that amenity from having a single-family home.\u201d",
      "Mark, a suburbanite just outside Chicago who asked to be identified by his first name to avoid professional blowback for weighing in on hot-button housing issues, said the type of property he has rented for three years is out of budget for him to buy. He estimated many comparable properties in the area would cost 30% more in monthly housing payments than his current rent, and he\u2019s considering leaving the area so he can purchase someplace else.",

      "Andrew Decker, a renter in Lake Villa, Illinois, halfway between Chicago and Milwaukee, said he and his family would love to buy the property where they live now, which he said was offered to him for $340,000.",
      "\u201cWe would like to make it our forever home if we could afford it, but it\u2019s just so expensive,\u201d Decker said. \u201cIf they were to come at me and tell me that, \u2018Hey, you can buy this house for 200 grand today,\u2019 I\u2019d pull the trigger tomorrow. I wouldn\u2019t even hesitate. But 340\u2019s crazy.\u201d",
      "Tara Raghuveer, who runs the tenant advocacy group Tenant Union Federation, said affordability issues that have fueled the suburban rental boom threaten to push people farther from urban cores.",
      "\u201cAs people are moved out of the city, they\u2019re further from transportation, they might be further from employment, they might be living in homes that are not necessarily connected to other people like them, which impacts things like child care, Social Security,\u201d Raghuveer said.",
      "Landlords, however, tout the benefits that come from renting in the \u2019burbs.",
      "\u201cThe ability to have one payment that covers all your expenses generally \u2014 you don\u2019t have to deal with the mortgage payment and the home insurance and maybe the HOA and then a lot of maintenance expense, so on \u2014 has been something that for a lot of people has been worth it,\u201d said George Ratiu, vice president of research at the National Apartment Association trade group, which represents rental operators.",
      "Developers have also been building different types of properties for suburban tenants, including multifamily complexes. Jay Parsons, a housing economist and host of \u201cThe Rent Roll\u201d podcast, points to the rise of \u201csuburban downtowns,\u201d partly fueled by the pandemic-era shift to remote work. These mixed-use developments are typically aimed at offering younger families a balance between urban convenience and suburban amenities, he said.",
      "\u201cYou can still be close to your job. You can be close to nice restaurants and shops but live in a suburban area where you\u2019re still using a car, and you still have probably a rent that\u2019s more affordable than living in most downtowns,\u201d Parsons said.",
      "Coulson doesn\u2019t expect the appeal of the suburbs to fade anytime soon, which could prop up prices in many of them for buyers and renters alike.",
      "\u201cIf you work downtown, it\u2019s still an advantage to live downtown, but it\u2019s not as great an advantage\u201d as it used to be, he said, now that remote work remains commonplace \u2014 despite an ongoing drumbeat of return-to-office mandates. \u201cWhat that does is also raise the cost of living in the suburbs, because now more people want to live in the suburbs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a dynamic that\u2019s going to have to work itself out a little bit more before we know the final impact on suburban versus downtown pricing,\u201d he said."

      "\u201cThis is a multi-decade plan. There will be governments that come and go and I think whenever we see a new government, a review of this kind is going to be something which will be undertaken,\u201d Marles told the ABC.",

      "\u201cIt is important that those production and sustainment rates are improved,\u201d he added.",
      "AUKUS would grow the U.S. and Australian defense industries and generate thousands of manufacturing jobs, Marles said in a statement.",

      "It\u2019s part of a far-left online ecosystem that has proliferated in recent years, experts say. Some of the groups behind the accounts express contempt for peaceful resistance and glorify acts of violence \u2014 and even murders, like those of the UnitedHealthcare CEO and two Israeli Embassy staffers.",
      "The leftist networks tend to be different from right-wing groups in that they are typically decentralized with no leadership structures.

      "The unrest in Los Angeles follows a pattern that has played out in numerous cities over the past five years in which protests that break out remain mostly peaceful during the day, but at night agitators engage in fiery clashes with police.",
      "That dynamic tends to distract from the focus of the demonstrations \u2014 in this case, workplace immigration raids by federal agents \u2014 and provide fodder to people who oppose them. In this case, that\u2019s President Donald Trump and his supporters, who have sought to dismiss the broader protest movement as the work of \u201cpaid insurrectionists.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s concerning is the attempt to conflate the individual actors who do commit violence with the mass movement as a whole,\u201d said Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University.",

      "\u201cWhat we found in our research is there are groups that were attempting to exploit the situation, oftentimes after dark, and their coordination was somewhat sophisticated,\u201d said Alex Goldenberg, a senior adviser to the Network Contagion Research Institute.",
      "That involved demonstrators\u2019 surveilling police movements and sharing tips about making the most destructive Molotov cocktails, Goldenberg said.",
      "\u201cThey were trying to exploit an already volatile situation in an attempt to provoke violent clashes with police, create viral moments to inflame tensions and draw in others through emotional triggers,\u201d he said.",

    "summary": "The legislation from Sen. Cynthia Lummis seeks to address the legal gray area of exactly who is liable when AI is used in a sensitive medical, legal or financial situation.",
    "story": [
      "Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., is introducing legislation Thursday that would shield artificial intelligence developers from an array of civil liability lawsuits provided they meet certain disclosure requirements.",
      "Lummis\u2019 bill, the Responsible Innovation and Safe Expertise Act, seeks to clarify that doctors, lawyers, financial advisers, engineers and other professionals who use AI programs in their decision-making retain legal liability for any errors they make \u2014 so long as AI developers publicly disclose how their systems work.",
      "\u201cThis legislation doesn\u2019t create blanket immunity for AI \u2014 in fact, it requires AI developers to publicly disclose model specifications so professionals can make informed decisions about the AI tools they choose to utilize,\u201d Lummis, a member of the Commerce Committee, said in a statement first shared with NBC News. \u201cIt also means that licensed professionals are ultimately responsible for the advice and decisions they make. This is smart policy for the digital age that protects innovation, demands transparency, and puts professionals and their clients first.\u201d",
      "Lummis\u2019 office touted the bill as the first piece of federal legislation that offers clear guidelines for AI liability in a professional context. The measure would not govern liability for other AI elements, such as self-driving vehicles, and it would not provide immunity when AI developers act recklessly or willfully engage in misconduct.",
      "\u201cAI is transforming industries \u2014 medicine, law, engineering, finance \u2014 and becoming embedded in professional tools that shape critical decisions,\u201d her office said in a release. \u201cBut outdated liability rules discourage innovation, exposing developers to unbounded legal risk even when trained professionals are using these tools.\u201d",
      "Exactly who is liable when AI is used in sensitive medical, legal or financial situations is a bit of a gray area, with some states seeking to enact their own standards.",
      "The House-passed \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill,\u201d which is advancing through Congress and supported by President Donald Trump, includes a provision that would ban states from enacting any AI regulations for 10 years. Senate Republicans last week proposed changing the provision to instead block federal funding for broadband projects to states that regulate AI.",
      "Both Democratic and Republican state officials have criticized the effort to prohibit state-level regulations over the next decade, while AI executives have argued that varying state laws would stifle industry growth when the United States is in stiff competition with countries like China."

    "story": [
      "Scientists searching for a cure for cancer have no trouble finding public support. But for those studying potato disease, it\u2019s a tougher sell.",
      "The Trump administration seems to have banked on the idea that the public will see much of scientific research as wasteful or arcane. It has slashed \u2014 or proposed slashing \u2014 billions in research funding.",
      "Faced with this existential crisis, academics are seeking new ways to rally public and political support to fight the cuts and preserve their funding.",
      "Enter a group of Cornell University graduate students with an ambitious plan to change the way people think about science. They have recruited more than 500 researchers across all 50 states to write op-eds for local news outlets, to be published over the next week. The idea, said Emma Scales, a Cornell doctoral student involved in the effort, is to have scientists introduce themselves to the public.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s speaking to people who are angry about not knowing where their money is going,\u201d Scales said. \u201cLike, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m one of those people using your money. I\u2019m sorry that we haven\u2019t talked, but let me tell you what I do.\u2019\u201d",
      "The McClintock Letters, as the project is known, is one of several efforts underway by graduate students and faculty members with the same goal in mind.",
      "They reflect a growing recognition that researchers can\u2019t take public support for granted. If they don\u2019t act now, many are starting to realize, public trust in scientists will continue to slide and the funding may never return.",
      "Science Homecoming, a letter-writing campaign, encourages academics to focus on the role government dollars play in science. Stand Up for Science, a new nonprofit, is planning a series of demonstrations at state fairs and farmers markets, along with teach-ins at churches and open lab days this summer. Another new organization, Your Neighborhood Scientist, publishes essays by researchers and tries to encourage community-based conversations about science.",
      "Audrey Drotos, a University of Pennsylvania neuroscience researcher who co-founded Your Neighborhood Scientist, sees efforts like hers as a way for scientists to share their own excitement.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to just add more noise to the system,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to humanize scientists \u2014 that\u2019s really the underlying goal.\u201d",
      "The inspiration for the McClintock Letters took root in February, when Isako Di Tomassi, a doctoral student studying plant pathology, vented online about losing her Ph.D. adviser at the U.S. Department of Agriculture after widespread government layoffs this year.",
      "Some online commenters were sympathetic, Di Tomassi said, but one person insisted that the cuts had stopped \u201cstupid research,\u201d and many others expressed confusion as to what universities were even studying. Few seemed to see the value in their work.",
      "Di Tomassi and Scales brainstormed with the Cornell Advancing Science and Policy Club about what to do in response and landed on the idea of having researchers tell their own stories.",
      "They named their effort after Barbara McClintock, the late Cornell cytogeneticist who won a Nobel Prize, and planned it around her birthday, June 16. Her research on the genes in corn changed scientists\u2019 understanding of heredity and laid the foundation for treating genetic defects in humans.",
      "\u201cBarbara McClintock is famous as hell,\u201d Di Tomassi said, \u201cbut maybe not to a nonscientist because she studied corn DNA. So most people will be like, \u2018Who cares about corn DNA?\u2019\u201d",
      "But that\u2019s exactly the point, Di Tomassi said: bridging the disconnect between what the scientific community knows and what the average person understands. Even mundane-sounding experiments can help fuel medical and scientific breakthroughs, she said.",
      "Researchers have signed up to write about breast cancer metastasis, how memories are formed and sustainable grape-harvesting, among other things. They are on track to reach 8 million potential readers, based on the organizers\u2019 back-of-the-envelope calculations of each news outlet\u2019s audience size.",
      "During a June 6 webinar, Katherine Xue, a microbiologist at the University of California, Irvine, walked some 100 people through how to write an op-ed. She showed them a 2015 op-ed by Newt Gingrich that called for more research funding as a template.",
      "Xue reminded them to avoid jargon and make it personal. She plans to write for a newspaper in her hometown of Oak Ridge, Tennessee, about how a high school internship got her interested in microbiology.",
      "\u201cAs scientists, we\u2019re trained to stay impersonal and to take ourselves out of the equation,\u201d Xue told NBC News. But there\u2019s a downside to that approach, she said. \u201cI think a lot of people haven\u2019t met scientists and don\u2019t know a lot about what we do and why, which means it\u2019s easy to distrust science as a whole.\u201d",
      "Recent polling backs up her point. While 76% of Americans have confidence in scientists, that\u2019s down from 87% in 2020, surveys by the Pew Research Center show. Pew also found a majority of Americans believe that scientists are not good communicators, and that nearly half think scientists view themselves as superior to others.",
      "Silly-sounding research projects have long been a political punching bag. Some senators have issued annual reports flagging what they consider wasteful spending on science.",
      "During Trump\u2019s March speech to Congress, he rattled off a list of what he deemed ridiculous projects funded by the Biden administration, including research he incorrectly described as making mice transgender (it actually looked at the role of hormones in health and fertility). The White House defended the president\u2019s remarks.",
      "In response to questions about research cuts, White House spokesman Kush Desai said they were in line with what voters want. \u201cThe American people gave President Trump a resounding mandate to realign government spending to better reflect their priorities,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThe Administration is committed to delivering on this mandate.\u201d",
      "For her new book, \u201cThe Salmon Cannon and the Levitating Frog,\u201d Carly Anne York, an animal behaviorist at Lenoir-Rhyne University in North Carolina, profiled a handful of scientists who have engaged directly with disparagers to defend their research.",
      "One professor profiled in the book responded to mockery of her work as \u201cShrimp Fight Club\u201d by joining other academics in setting up a mini-science fair on Capitol Hill, where she shared that the research into how shrimp fight had generated interest in designing new types of body armor for humans.",
      "\u201cI wish that more scientists would think that way,\u201d York said. \u201cThis is actually our burden to make sure the public understands why their taxpayer dollars go to us, what we do with it, and why what we do matters.\u201d",
      "So will the McClintock Letters or other campaigns work? Students and faculty members planning to participate aren\u2019t sure, but many say that\u2019s not the only goal \u2014 and hope they go further.",
      "For Michael Lubell, a physics professor at City College of New York and a former public affairs director for the American Physical Society, their success will depend on whether there\u2019s an ongoing effort to connect with the public.",
      "Lubell said they should meet people in person as well \u2014 at Rotary Clubs, churches and temples, or in PTA meetings.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to try to do something and get people to come to you, you\u2019re only going to get a sliver of the population to do that, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll move the needle,\u201d he said. \u201cGo where they are \u2014 see what they value.

      "The U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation accused Hamas of killing at least five of its Palestinian employees on Wednesday, as almost 40 other Palestinians were killed near the foundation\u2019s aid sites in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), whose aid delivery has been mired in controversy and violence, said in a statement that more than two dozen of its employees were traveling by bus to a distribution center west of the southern city of Khan Younis when it was \u201cbrutally attacked by Hamas\u201d around 10 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET), leaving at least five people dead and multiple others injured.",
      "The foundation said there was also \u201cfear that some of our team members may have been taken hostage.\u201d",
      "\u201cDespite this heinous attack, we will continue our mission to provide critical aid to the people of Gaza,\u201d it said.",
      "Hamas has not responded to the allegations and NBC News was unable to independently verify them.",
      "The GHF, which said it had been threatened by Hamas in recent days, began distributing aid in Gaza after Israel in mid-May eased its three-month total blockade on all supplies into the enclave, including food, medicine and other vital items, following an international outcry and warnings of famine from United Nations food experts.",
      "Despite the apparent loosening of the blockade, it is mostly the GHF that has been allowed to distribute aid \u2014 partly because it is supported by Israel and the U.S., which has raised doubts over its independence.",
      "GHF executive chairman Johnnie Moore has declined to reveal the organization\u2019s sources of funding.",
      "\u201cLike lots of private foundations, you know, it doesn\u2019t disclose its donors,\u201d he told NBC News in an exclusive interview.",
      "\u201cAnything that we do and anything that we say publicly is going to distract from the mission, and we have one mission, just one mission, which is to feed Gazans,\u201d said Moore, an evangelical Christian and former adviser to President Donald Trump who was appointed last week after his predecessor resigned citing \u201chumanitarian principles.\u201d",
      "Scrutiny of GHF has intensified in the past week as dozens of Palestinians were killed in and around its multiple aid sites in Gaza, which are in military zones and off limits to independent media.",
      "Dr. Munir al-Barsh, director-general of the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, said 39 Palestinians had been shot and killed Wednesday as they sought aid from GHF.",
      "\u201cAid distribution sites have become death traps in the Gaza Strip,\u201d he said.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 200 Palestinians have been killed and about 1,500 have been injured in shootings near GHF sites, according to the health ministry, whose numbers are considered credible by the World Health Organization.",
      "While the GHF says there has been no violence in and around those distribution points, the Israeli military has previously acknowledged firing warning shots.",
      "On Wednesday, the U.N. said that even though people in Gaza were being killed and injured while trying to access food, Israel was still declining more than half of its requests to access critical supplies of fuel and to coordinate humanitarian movement inside the enclave.",
      "\u201cIf the population is inadequately supplied with the essentials for their survival, Israel must agree to humanitarian relief and facilitate it by all the means at its disposal,\u201d Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the U.N. secretary-general, said at a news briefing.",
      "The U.N. agency in Gaza, UNRWA, also renewed its criticism of GHF on Wednesday, saying in a post on X that the aid distribution model was \u201cputting lives at risk.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is also a distraction from the ongoing atrocities and a waste of resources,\u201d it said.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas carried out a terrorist attack on southern Israel in which at least 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage, according to an Israeli tally. Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas in response, launching a military campaign in Gaza that has so far killed more than 55,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry.",
      "The U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote Thursday on a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas, and the opening of all Israeli border crossings to allow for the delivery of aid. A similar resolution failed last week in the U.N. Security Council, where it was supported by 14 of the 15 members but vetoed by the United States because it was not tied to the release of the hostages.",
      "The U.N. vote comes a day after Israeli forces said they had recovered the bodies of two of the hostages inside Gaza, naming one of them as Yair Yaakov and not releasing the name of the other.",
      "Hamas still holds 53 hostages, less than half of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "Tensions are also rising between Israel and Iran, where Israel is considering taking military action in the coming days, five people with knowledge of the situation told NBC News.",
      "Any strike would most likely be carried out without U.S. support as Trump is in advanced discussions with Tehran on a deal to curtail its nuclear program.",

      "\"Permanently posting the Ten Commandments in every classroom and library \u2014 rendering them unavoidable \u2014 unconstitutionally pressures students into religious observance, veneration, and adoption of the state's favored religious scripture,\" the lawsuit said.",

The lawsuit names four school districts in northwest Arkansas \u2014 Fayetteville, Bentonville, Siloam Springs and Springdale \u2014 as defendants.",
      "A spokesperson for Fayetteville schools said the district would not comment on pending litigation, while the other three districts did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "A spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin said his office was reviewing the lawsuit and considering options.",
      "Attorneys for the families, who are Jewish, Unitarian Universalist or nonreligious, said they planned to ask the federal judge in Fayetteville for a preliminary injunction blocking the law's enforcement. The attorneys say the law violates longstanding Supreme Court precedent and the families' First Amendment rights.",
      "\"By imposing a Christian-centric translation of the Ten Commandments on our children for nearly every hour of every day of their public-school education, this law will infringe on our rights as parents and create an unwelcoming and religiously coercive school environment for our children,\" Samantha Stinson, one of the plaintiffs, said in a news release.",
      "Louisiana was the first state to enact such a requirement, and a federal judge blocked the measure before it was to take effect Jan 1. Proponents of Louisiana's law say that ruling only applies to the five school boards listed in the suit, but The Associated Press is unaware of any posters being displayed in schools as the litigation continues."

      "\u201cWe can\u2019t call him up and we can\u2019t see him,\u201d Carnie Wilson told the Los Angeles Times in 1992. \u201cI guess we could, but we\u2019re so afraid of each other. I don\u2019t know what I would say to him.\u201d",
      "Carnie Wilson noted that she and her dad had not spoken for two years at the time of the interview. She said she and her sister wrote \u201cFlesh and Blood\u201d in hopes of a reunion with him.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s either going to cry real hard, or else just stare at something and get (mad),\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cIt was the first time I was in the studio with him as an adult and he cried the whole time. He walked back and forth and cried the whole time,\u201d Carnie Wilson later recalled during a May 2025 interview with People.",

      "Brian Wilson called his kids \u2018the light of my life\u2019",
      "In 2006, Brian Wilson spoke to Ability Magazine about the happiness his seven children brought him.",
      "\u201cYes, they\u2019re the light of my life. Nothing brings joy into my life like my children. I have two girls by a previous marriage who are in their 30s, and now I have 9 and 8-year-old girls and a little 2-and-a-half year-old boy. And they are all beautiful kids. My children and my music are my two greatest loves,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cThe good news is I can say that today, it doesn\u2019t matter what has happened in the past,\u201d she said, adding that her father, on the other hand, is \u201chaunted by his past.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never known anybody that can live in the past and be in the present like my dad,\u201d she said. \u201cI know he loves his children and his grandchildren, but he has a problem expressing love. It\u2019s hard for him. It scares him.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have been able to connect and tap into love with him over these years and it\u2019s been the most healing, best thing ever,\u201d she added. \u201cBut the amount of acceptance that I\u2019ve had to have around what I\u2019m going to be able to receive from him is my biggest life\u2019s lesson.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "\u201cGinny & Georgia\u201d is a show about a mother and her two children. But in Season 3, a father steps into the spotlight.",
      "Zion Miller (played by Nathan Mitchell) rises to the fore of the show not only as Georgia\u2019s on-again, off-again love interest, but as a father reckoning with the emotional toll his absence has taken on his daughter, Ginny.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Mitchell reflects on Zion\u2019s evolution and the weighty arcs shaping the Miller family dynamic this season.",
      "One of the most powerful moments comes in therapy, where Ginny opens up about how much Zion missed in her life.",
      "To recap, Zion and Georgia met as teenagers. When she became pregnant with Ginny, his parents stepped in to care for the infant. After they requested guardianship, though, Georgia ran away. She was gone for a year but returned, beginning Georgia\u2019s longest on-again, off-again romantic relationship.",
      "\u201cIt was really cathartic,\u201d Mitchell says of Zion and Ginny's conversation. \u201cZion is someone who\u2019s always followed his own path, but he cares deeply about Ginny. That scene shows him realizing the full impact of his absence.\u201d",
      "As Ginny continues to navigate trauma, secrecy and identity, Mitchell says Zion shares the blame.",
      "\u201cIf he could go back, he wouldn\u2019t have left,\u201d Mitchell reveals. \u201cHe finally sees what Georgia is capable of and realizes he needed to be the stable force all along.\u201d",
      "This season, Zion provides calm amid the chaos, stepping up for both Ginny and Georgia \u2014 even as Georgia faces legal trouble.",
      "\u201cGeorgia has this chaotic energy. Zion is the contrast,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cHe\u2019s fiercer, more protective now. That\u2019s been exciting to play.\u201d",
      "The drama intensifies when Zion broaches the idea of joint custody. Mitchell hints at what\u2019s to come: \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that Georgia will be open to sharing custody of Ginny with Zion,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we\u2019re still in for some spicy drama.\u201d",
      "Zion\u2019s growing involvement as a father forces Georgia to confront a reality she\u2019s long resisted: that Ginny isn\u2019t hers alone.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s always felt Ginny needed to be with her no matter what,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cBut Zion\u2019s love and commitment are just as valid. The tension will come from whether Georgia can finally acknowledge that and make space for him.\u201d",
      "With Ginny making adult decisions, including an abortion, Zion\u2019s parenting style is more visible than ever: steady, open-hearted, and nonjudgmental.",
      "\u201cZion honors Ginny\u2019s autonomy,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cSometimes you need to be firm, but more often, you need to be loving and present.\u201d",
      "Still, the road ahead isn\u2019t smooth. Ginny begins to mirror Georgia\u2019s manipulative traits, raising alarms for Zion.",
      "\u201cHe fears she might internalize the wrong lessons,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cHe\u2019s encouraging her artistic side, her growth, but he\u2019s worried.\u201d",
      "Mitchell, though not a father himself, offers a message for parents: \u201cBe present. Be open. Vulnerability matters. Listen. You don\u2019t need all the answers \u2014 just care.\u201d",
      "Co-creators Sarah Lampert and Sarah Glinski echoed these themes. Glinski highlighted the therapy session between Ginny and Zion as a turning point.",
      "\u201cGinny always blames her mom, but the therapist asks, \u2018Where\u2019s your dad in all this?\u2019\u201d Glinski says. \u201cThat question shifts Ginny\u2019s perspective. She begins to hold Zion accountable too.\u201d",
      "Lampert says, \u201cThere\u2019s so much love, but also dysfunction. Zion stepping up now doesn\u2019t erase the past. But it does matter.\u201d",
      "Looking ahead, Season 4 teases even more drama between Zion and Georgia. But at its heart, both parents are learning to prioritize Ginny\u2019s future, however messy that road might be."

    "summary": "Jack Wagner talks to TODAY.com in an interview about Nick Marone returning to \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" and his reunion with Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang).",
    "story": [
      "Jack Wagner's iconic soap-opera character, Nick Marone, is a man on a mission as he prepares to return to \"The Bold and the Beautiful.\"",
      "It's been three years since the actor made a brief appearance on the CBS daytime drama to mark the show's 35th anniversary. Before that, Wagner played Nick from 2003-2012.",
      "So, what brings the character back this time around? Love, naturally.",
      "\"Nick is coming back because he heard that Brooke\u2019s (Katherine Kelly Lang) heart is broken and what\u2019s happened in this triangle with Ridge (Thorsten Kaye) and Taylor (Rebecca Budig),\" he tells TODAY.com during a video interview.",
      "For those not in the know, Brooke Logan's relationship with her longtime love, Ridge Forrester, has hit a rough patch in recent months.",
      "The on-again, off-again couple are currently on the outs after a series of unfortunate events, including a power struggle at Forrester Creations and the return of Ridge's ex-wife, Taylor Hayes.",
      "Despite Brooke's best efforts to win Ridge back and pry him away from Taylor, she has yet to succeed. And that's where Nick, another one of Brooke's former flames, comes in.",
      "\"He\u2019s decided that he\u2019s going to step in and try to wake Brooke up to this toxic pattern she\u2019s been in with Ridge for years and years,\" Wagner explains. \"That is his primary motivation. (It's like he's saying to Brooke), 'I am back to try to get you to wake up and realize that I\u2019m still in love with you, and I want you to step out of this insanity.'\"",
      "Brooke and Nick also have a complicated history. Over the years, Nick has been romantically linked to Brooke's two sisters and one of her daughters, in addition to Taylor. But Wagner says his character keeps coming back to Brooke since she was \"his initial love.\"",
      "In the years since viewers have last seen Nick, he\u2019s had a lot going on, and fans will get to learn a bit more about his backstory.",
      "\u201cI really felt he needed to upgrade from living on the Shady Marlin (his boat). Like he wasn\u2019t this scruffy, bearded, smoking sea captain anymore. This guy is now a shipping titan. He runs Marone Industries, an international shipping company,\" Wagner says.",
      "While preparing for his return to the show, Wagner advocated for an upgraded wardrobe that was fit for his character's advanced professional status. He also had a say in how his character would present himself when he reunited with Brooke.",
      "\u201cI told Brad (Bell, executive producer and head writer of the show), 'I think the key here is masculine. This has to be real masculine, confident energy from Nick,'\u201d he says.",
      "While shooting on location on Italy's Amalfi Coast and Capri, Wagner and Lang re-created a famous scene from their characters\u2019 past: the moment they first saw each other at Forrester Creations.",
      "\"We tried to re-create that as best we could with Kelly trying on some lingerie, and all of a sudden I'm kind of like, 'Who\u2019s there?'\" he recalls.",
      "Talking some sense into Brooke is Nick's main goal, but he will briefly interact with a few other characters, including Taylor and Ridge, his rival and half brother.",
      "\u201cWhen Ridge comes into the scenes, he\u2019s surprised. \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019 Nick is unmoved and doesn\u2019t have one ounce of fear when it comes to Eric Forrester (John McCook) or Ridge or anything that has to do with the powerful Forrester family. He is unmoved, confident and fearless,\" Wagner says.",
      "Viewers won't get to see Nick and Brooke's son, Jack, on screen, but they will get a quick update on how he's doing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a reference because we didn\u2019t feel we had time to really explore that storyline. That could be (a) future (storyline). But for right now, we needed to just kind of focus on Nick trying to wake Brooke up out of this toxic pattern with Ridge and the Forresters,\" Wagner says.",
      "Returning to the show after all these years felt like \"jumping on a moving train\" for Wagner in the best possible way.",
      "\"Kelly and I love to work together, and we collaborate very nicely,\" he says of his co-star. \"And Brad (Bell) collaborates with the dialogue and things I want to do for the character.\"",
      "In recent years, Wagner has starred as Bill Avery on the Hallmark series \"When Calls the Heart,\" and he was able to squeeze in his \u201cB&B\u201d story arc just before he\u2019s set to return to Vancouver to film the latest season of the show.",
      "The actor has a packed schedule but is still leaving the door open to returning to \u201cB&B\u201d for some more action.",
      "\u201cWe talked about it, and (Bell) said, \u2018I really would love to maybe keep this character alive. How do you feel about it?\u2019\" Wagner says. \"So I just got the script for my final scenes with Brooke after the whole location shoot in Italy, and it looks really promising.\"",
      "Viewers will have to tune in to see exactly what happens, but Wagner is happy to give a little teaser, saying, \"It's really a big deal how he leaves it and Brooke's reaction to what Nick presents for her.\"",
      "Looking ahead, the actor says it \"might be possible\" to pull double duty on \u201cB&B\u201d and \u201cWhen Calls the Heart.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll dust off my charming guy and my romantic guy on both shows. Who knows?\u201d he says.",
      "Wagner's first \"Bold and the Beautiful\" episode will air Monday, June 16, on CBS."

      "She describes the \u201cculture shock\u201d of the cafeteria at school \u2014 leaving behind the fresh variety of a Korean midday meal to eat a typical American lunch. This led her to the kitchen, fostering a lifelong interest in foods that don\u2019t come with a mini-carton of milk.",

      "\u201cI think overall I\u2019m really enjoying his company,\u201d she shared with her listeners in August 2020. \u201cAre we making plans for the future? Yeah. Am I obsessed with him? I don\u2019t know!\u201d",
      "Looking back, Kaplan appreciates the quirky nickname that started it all.",
      "\u201cMr. Sexy Zoom Man. I think that name that she created was silly but honest of how we met,\u201d he says in Cooper\u2019s new docuseries. \u201cI think it allowed me to ease my way into the Call Her Daddy fandom, because I enjoy being a behind-the-scenes person.\u201d",
      "Their Riviera Maya wedding",
      "The couple got engaged at Cooper\u2019s West Hollywood home in May 2023 during what she thought was a W Magazine photoshoot but was actually an elaborate proposal setup.",
      "Almost a year later, in April 2024, the couple tied the knot in Riviera Maya, Mexico.",
      "Cooper made the bold choice to walk down the aisle by herself, she told Vogue.",
      "\u201cAt the beginning of wedding planning, I really rejected the concept of being walked down by a man to be handed to another man,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom also walked herself down the aisle, so in a sense, I guess we are creating our own tradition for the women in our family.\u201d",
      "The couple's dogs, Henry and Bruce, served as ring bearers, while Cooper's brother Grant officiated the ceremony.",
      "Cooper's new two-part Hulu docuseries offers intimate glimpses into her wedding, including the couple's heartfelt vows.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re the best man I\u2019ve ever met. You inspire me every day. You\u2019re the most passionate about the people you love. Fiercely loyal, it\u2019s almost scary at times. And the way you love me, it\u2019s indescribable,\u201d Cooper said during the ceremony.",
      "Matt\u2019s vows focused on their smaller, intimate moments: \u201cIt\u2019s the conversations at 3 a.m. when we both can\u2019t sleep, shrouded in darkness of night, and thus able to speak more openly to one another. The whiskey in our yard on Friday nights after a long week. You mean the world to me. Thank you for coming into my life. I love you.\u201d",
      "What has Alex Cooper said about Matt Kaplan?",
      "Cooper has been refreshingly honest about how Kaplan changed her perspective on relationships and marriage.",
      "In \u201cCall Her Alex,\u201d she reflects on past dating experiences.",
      "\u201cI am very aware that I am a lot,\u201d Cooper said in Episode 2 of the docuseries. \u201cEvery man I\u2019ve ever dated has been so intimidated, whether it was by my success or even that I was just a confident woman that advocated for myself and spoke up for myself.\u201d",
      "She told W Magazine after their engagement why Kaplan was able to change her mind about marriage.",
      "\u201cWe had a really great dynamic early on that I didn\u2019t have in previous relationships, which is the amount that we communicate \u2014 even over communicate \u2014 about difficult things. Having that foundation of honesty and trust allowed us to get through things in life that made it so I couldn\u2019t envision anyone else by my side. On top of that, we have this insane chemistry.\u201d",
      "She said he\u2019s also \u201cso supportive\u201d of her career, in contrast to her past partners: \u201cA lot of men in my past were really intimidated by my success. They tried to suppress what I was doing or make me feel bad about it.\u201d",
      "In a post to Instagram yesterday about the premiere of \u201cCall Her Alex,\u201d Cooper wrote: \u201cTo my husband, who I love more than life itself, thank you for being my rock.\u201d"

    "link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/mark-hamill-the-life-of-chuck-stephen-king-interview-rcna211471",
    "published": "Tue, 10 Jun 2025 19:20:09 GMT",
    "summary": "Mark Hamill talks about his role in \"The Life of Chuck\" and why the Stephen King movie might make you cry \"tears of joy.\"",
    "story": [
      "Mark Hamill's new film is probably going to make you cry, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't see it.",
      "\"It's tears of joy because it reaffirms your belief in mankind,\" Hamill explains in a sit-down interview with TODAY.com.",
      "The movie? \"The Life of Chuck.\" It's the latest project for the \"Star Wars\" actor, who plays Albie Krantz, the wise grandfather of Charles \"Chuck\" Krantz. Chuck is a man whose life is chronicled in reverse by four different actors: Cody Flanagan, Benjamin Pajak, Jacob Tremblay and Tom Hiddleston, who portrays Chuck as an adult.",
      "Based on Stephen King's 2020 novella of the same name, it's a serious departure from the writer's typical horror genre, although  Hamill says it's still got a few of King's signature trademarks, including supernatural and apocalyptic elements.",
      "\"It's certainly nothing like Stephen King has ever written before,\" says Hamill. \"He's done 'Green Mile' and 'The Body,' which became 'Stand By Me,' but even by those standards, this is unlike anything he's done.\"",
      "Also starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mia Sara and Karen Gillan, Hamill says \"The Life of Chuck\" is \"indescribable\" but so profound \u2013 and good \u2013 that he asked if he could \"go out on the talk shows\" to encourage viewers to \"please see it. Trust me, you'll thank me later.\"",
      "If audiences at the Toronto International Film Festival are any indication, he doesn't have to worry. After premiering at the festival, the film took home the People's Choice Award and has since garnered rave reviews by many critics, some of whom called the film one of the year's best.",
      "\"It's so positive. It's so optimistic about life,\" Hamill tells TODAY.com. \"It also teaches you there are moments that, in life, you think are trivial that collectively become very important.\"",
      "And if \"The Life of Chuck\" leaves people in tears, Hamill says it's because a movie \"this original\" only \"comes along once in a lifetime.\"",
      "\"I just loved it,\" he says. \"It's wonderful.\"",
      "'The Long Walk'",
      "\"The Life of Chuck\" isn't Hamill's only collaboration with King. The actor also appears in the upcoming film \"The Long Walk,\" a horror movie based on King's 1979 novel of the same name (published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman), starring Ben Wang, Cooper Hoffman, David Jonsson and Judy Greer, among others.",
      "\"The premise is just ghastly,\" he says of the film. \"It is more in the mold of what you associate Stephen King with.\"",
      "Less of a supernatural movie and more straight-up horror, \"The Long Walk\" takes place in a dystopian future and revolves around a group of young men who are chosen, a la \"The Hunger Games,\" to participate in a walk that only ends when everyone dies, except for a single, indomitable winner.",
      "\"The rules are simple: You walk until only one is alive,\" explains Hamill, saying that if walkers lag behind, fall to their knees or deviate from the walk in any way, it's \"a bullet to the head.\"",
      "Based on its grim premise, Hamill says his initial reaction to the role was, \"Not only can I not be in this, I don't think I can see it.\"",
      "But given that Francis Lawrence, the iconic director of \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" and \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay\" Parts 1 and 2, along with other notable films including the sci-fi classic \"I Am Legend,\" was at the helm of \"The Long Walk,\" Hamill says he reconsidered.",
      "\"I really admire him as a director,\" he explains, saying that after a call with Lawrence he changed his mind. \"By the end of the Zoom call, I said, 'Well, I've got to do it.' And my boys, of course, read it and said, 'Dad, this is great. You've got to do it.'\"",
      "Hamill plays a military major, or as he puts it, \"a badass guy,\" but says the true stars of the movie are the young actors he worked with, calling them the \"heart and soul\" of the movie.",
      "\"I was so impressed. These are all the young actors you're going to see in the future.\"",
      "'I Owe the World to Mike Flanagan'",
      "As for his own future, Hamill says he's loving \"every minute\" of his career right now and hopes to work on more projects with Mike Flanagan, the director and screenwriter of \"The Life of Chuck.\" Flanagan also created such notable series as \"The Haunting of Hill House,\" \"Midnight Mass\" and \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" in which Hamill played Arthur Pym, a shadowy figure known as the \"Pym Reaper.\"",
      "\"It's the first time I've ever been asked to play something so far from myself on camera,\" he says of the role. \"Because I was playing a sociopathic, soulless, evil lawyer.\"",
      "Having done voice work for decades, Hamill says it's a role that would have been routine if he had done it as a voice-over, but he is grateful to Flanagan for giving him the opportunity to do such a \"juicy\" role in front of the camera.",
      "\"I owe the world to Mike Flanagan. That's why I'm so loyal to him. That's why I jumped at 'The Life of Chuck,'\" he says, continuing, \"He's just wonderful.\"",
      "As for what's next, Hamill says he's got yet another, undisclosed project in the works with Flanagan, but for the moment remains firmly focused on ensuring that audiences come out to see \"The Life of Chuck.\"",
      "\"You realize that human beings are inherently good,\" he says of the film's takeaway. \"And in this atmosphere of division and anger and uncertainty, it's exactly the right movie at exactly the right time.\""

      "Seattle police were dispatched to the home at 12:48 a.m. Saturday after a call from a woman who identified herself as a nanny and said two men had broken in. She told police she was able to get out of the home but that three children were still inside.",
      "A police report redacted the name of the owner of the home, but said it belonged to a \u201chigh-profile individual.\u201d The address listed in the report appeared to match that on Macklemore\u2019s voting record, the Seattle Times reported. A part of the report also left the surname \u201cDavis\u201d \u2014 the same last name as Macklemore\u2019s wife.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if the artist, whose real name is Ben Haggerty, was home at the time. He had performances in Ireland on June 4 and 5.",
      "The nanny told police the break-in happened after she had put the kids to bed on the second floor. She said was on the main floor when she saw \u201ctwo men entering a patio door.\u201d",

      "The nanny said the taller man yelled,\u201cWhere are the jewels?\u201d according to the police report.",
      "The woman directed them to the home\u2019s primary bedroom, where they raked through drawers, cabinets and the closet, police said. The nanny told police \u201cthey took numerous watches, jewelry items, and shoes that they put into bags,\u201d according to the police report.",
      "She was ordered to keep her hands up and face toward a mirror, police said. At one point the shorter man threw her to the ground and put a boot on her ankle, then on the back of her neck and took her phone, she told police.",
      "The nanny started to scream and was pinned against a wall, with the shorter one holding her mouth shut, the police report said. She tried to kick the shorter one in the groin but was unable to see so she bit onto his hand hard, causing him to let go. The nanny then ran out of the home and knocked on numerous neighbors\u2019 doors before someone opened the door and let her call police, the report said.",
      "The men were gone by the time police searched the home and removed the children, officials said. Family arrived and took the children to a nearby residence.",
      "A passerby told a responding officer that they had seen a man wearing all black running westbound through the yards north of the home.",
      "NBC News has reached out to Macklemore\u2019s reps for comment.",
      "Macklemore is married to Tricia Davis and they share three young children."

    "summary": "V. E. Schwab's newest novel, \"Bury Our Bones In the Midnight Soil,\" is a fantasy story about three queer vampires,",
    "story": [
      "For years, V. E. Schwab hasn\u2019t felt \"gay enough.\"",
      "\"With quotation marks \u2014 obviously it's an absurd concept,\" she tells TODAY.com. \"There is no such thing, and I know that.\"",
      "Schwab's journey coming out as queer started about 10 years ago, she says. But the hit fantasy author \u2014\u00a0known for 2013's \"Vicious,\" 2015's \"A Darker Shade of Magic,\" the 2020 BookTok darling \"The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue\" and more \u2014 has long strived to \"assimilate\" into the genre.",
      "When she started publishing, she downplayed the fact that she's a woman. And though her stories always featured LGBTQ+ characters, (in a 2018 tweet, Schwab notably said all characters in her \"Shades of Magic\" series \"should be presumed queer unless stated otherwise\"),\u00a0she didn't lead with her own \"queerness,\" she says.",
      "\"I didn't want to do anything that would limit the growth of readership,\" Schwab says.",
      "The result was that \"no one ever thinks I'm gay,\" she reflects now. She thought she didn't mind. If blending behind the pseudonym of her initials meant someone may read her books, not knowing the breadth of identities ahead, and learn something? Better than someone not picking up the book at all, she says.",
      "In 2020, Schwab told her coming out story publicly in an essay for Oprah Daily. But it wasn't until her latest novel, \"Bury Our Bones in the Midnight Soil,\" out June 10, that she felt comfortable living, being, existing in that story.",
      "\"What I didn't predict and what turned out to be true is the catharsis of writing this book as a gay person,\" Schwab says. \"I did not realize how badly I needed to write this in order to take up the space of this story.\"",
      "\u2018I Can't Think of Any Greater Gift\u2019",
      "\"Bury Our Bones in the Midnight Soil\" follows three women across a 500-year period, with alternating perspectives. The book opens with 10-year-old Maria in 1500s Spain. We next meet Alice, a college first-year in 2019 trying to face her anxiety at a party. Within pages, both Maria (who later renames herself Sabine) and Alice describe themselves \u2014 or who they want to be \u2014 as \"feral.\"",
      "Then there's Charlotte, or Lottie, born in 1800s England, who knots their stories all together.",
      "All three start as young women chafing against their circumstances, until another woman arrives. (Sabine encounters a widow passing through her home of Santo Domingo, Charlotte encounters Sabine, and Alice encounters Charlotte.) Their stories are different, but end the same: Each woman leaves dead \u2014 specifically, as a vampire.",
      "Schwab was inspired by the \"classic\" vampiric lore \u2014 \"everything from 'Carmilla' essentially up through Anne Rice,\" she says.",
      "\"If you go back and you look at these classic vampires, they're inherently queer, they're inherently liminal, they represent knowledge and the danger of being exposed to an alternate potential future,\" she says. \"And the idea is that once you're exposed, you can never go back to ignorance.\"",
      "A longtime love of vampires was just one of the \"ingredients\" that went into \"Bury Our Bones.\" (\"I see my stories as a meal,\" Schwab explains.) Other themes include queer love throughout history and collateral damage, first explored through what Schwab had long been taught about one-night stands.",
      "\"I'm an only child, and for some reason, my parents thought the way to keep me safe growing up \u2014 I remember this coming in at like, 13, it was a lesson for my future \u2014\u00a0was to never have a one-night stand,\" Schwab says, explaining she was taught that by definition, the act involves being in close quarters with a complete stranger and \"putting yourself in inherent danger.\"",
      "\"I always thought this was a hysterical take,\" she adds.",
      "For Alice's storyline, Schwab followed this lesson to its most extreme conclusion. In the spirit of taking on the mantle of a \"New Alice\" at university, Alice invites a woman (Charlotte) home to have sex ... and wakes up dead, paying the price of Charlotte's desire.",
      "She's robbed of a choice, but she's granted the metaphorical and literal teeth that ensure ultimate survival.",
      "\"I think we spend so much time with male vampires as the lead, and I'm like, 'They don't need it,'\" she says. \"You know who actually needs teeth, is the person who is made to feel small, told to limit their desire, told never to be insatiable, told never to want, told exactly how little they are supposed to take up in the world.\"",
      "To Schwab, the most important moment in the book occurs when Alice in the present day realizes the she has nothing to be afraid of. No, everyone else fears her.",
      "\"The thing about an immortal is that they endure. That is, by definition, what they do. They endure when you shouldn't be able to, and I can't think of any greater gift to give my lesbian women than the sense that they would get to know they would endure,\" she says.",
      "Writing Herself Into the Story",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com less than two weeks before publication date, Schwab says she's feeling \"deep, deep, crashing out in real time-level neuroses.\" Normally she'd be on deadline for her next project, but she purposefully finished a first draft of her next work (\"Victorious,\" the third and final book in the \"Villains\" series) early to be present for the release of \"Bury Our Bones in the Midnight Soil.\"",
      "\"In many ways, this story is about the three eras of my own queer coming out journey, and going from not knowing who you are, to just wanting to be loved, to being unapologetic,\" Schwab says. \"There's just a lot more nonfiction underpinning the fiction than I'm used to.\"",
      "Sabine represents the version of Schwab that was able to write a book like this, she says. Sabine is unapologetic about her beliefs, actions and behaviors, even as the novel's \"villain.\" She's fully realized and uninterested in \"conforming to anyone else's idea of what a life is,\" Schwab says.",
      "\"I think I had to get to her in my own journey before I could look back at my Alice and Lottie years,\" she says.",
      "Alice, the youngest of the pack, starts the novel open about her sexuality but struggling to define herself out of the shadow of her sister. She stands in for a version of Schwab who was trying to find her identity while dealing with the \"whiplash\" of a major event shaking one's foundation. For Schwab, it was realizing she was gay. For Alice, it was waking up a vampire.",
      "Then there's the \"Lottie years,\" or as Schwab calls them, \"the toxic years.\" Charlotte is defined by \"desperately wanting to be loved,\" even at the expense of others.",
      "When asked for one true \"villain\" of her vampire novel, Schwab gives the potentially hot take of Lottie. (\"We do not stan someone who perceives themselves as a victim when they are an abuser,\" Schwab says.) But all three women make terrible decisions and do awful things. That's, too, a reflection of Schwab's experience coming out and her relationship with publishing.",
      "\"For many, many years, even after I had come out, there was a sense that you could not write a queer villain, lest the readership conflate queerness and villainy,\" she says. \"It's such a harmfully reductive take because it suggests that queer characters, and by extension, queer humans, are not afforded the same level of complexity and nuance as their straight counterparts.\"",
      "By embracing a trio of \"messy b----es\" to lead the novel, every page, sentence and word, Schwab says, hones in on one purpose: hunger.",
      "\"I wanted to write a book about hunger in all of the forms that it takes, specifically for women and femme-presenting people and queer people \u2014 the hunger to be loved, to be seen, to be understood, and the hunger to take up space in a world that tries to make you small,\" she says. \"I think that's what I achieved.\"",
      "Returning to 'the Garden' \u2014 and the Easter Egg You Might Have Missed",
      "Before \"Bury Our Bones,\" Schwab didn't think she'd ever put herself \"so clearly\" into a project again. \"The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue\" featured a character named Henry, whom Schwab describes as a character she \"wrote myself into.\"",
      "In the 2020 novel, the titular character trades being forgotten by everyone she meets for immortality. Henry is the first person who remembers her after her deal with the devil.",
      "If Addie and her sense of hope are an inspiration, the story of Sabine, Charlotte and Alice is more about the messes immortal beings leave behind.",
      "\u201cI wanted something a little bit angrier,\u201d Schwab says. \u201cI think that\u2019s just an indicator of my own growth as a person. I think that\u2019s an indicator of the landscape of the world. I just spend a lot of my time feeling stifled or angry or what have you.\u201d",
      "It's fitting then that \"Bury Our Bones\" is set in the same universe as \"Addie LaRue.\" Both are Schwab's take on \"urban fantasy, but in a literary way,\" she says, a world facsimiled of our own that she refers to as \"the Garden.\"",
      "\"I wouldn't be surprised if I revisit this space, because it's a place that I really enjoy creatively and aesthetically,\" Schwab says. \"I can see the Garden growing together and apart and in multiple directions.\"",
      "There's even a cameo from a character in \"Addie LaRue\" in a blink-and-you-miss-it moment more than halfway through the book, told in Charlotte's perspective. The goal is to establish that in this Garden, \"there are multiple kinds of magic and wonder and monstrosity just intertwined with our time and place and our history.\"",
      "Schwab says only eagle-eyed readers may spot the reference. And though she calls it the \"loosest thread\" she'd likely ever tie between her Garden books, it has consequences for the wider story.",
      "\"It has a repercussion if readers stop and think about it, which is that these characters are occupying the same terrain,\" Schwab says. \"They are coexisting in the same landscape. Addie's history has at some point tangled with one of our vampires.'\""

      "The highest compliment Bryan Cranston can receive has nothing to do with his own acting career.",
      "\"The Studio\" star was a proud dad on TODAY on June 10 when asked about his daughter and fellow actor Taylor Dearden. She received a host of accolades earlier this year for her performance as Dr. Melissa King on the inaugural season of Max's acclaimed hospital drama \"The Pitt.\"",
      "\u201cWell, Taylor is a wonderful, hard-working actor,\" Cranston said. \"She grew up in this business with my wife and I being actors. And so, we\u2019re so proud of her.\"",
      "Dearden is the only child of Cranston, 69, and his wife of over 35 years, actor Robin Dearden. The younger Dearden's first television appearance came in a role in a 2010 episode of the legendary show \"Breaking Bad\" starring Cranston.",
      "She also appeared in Netflix's \"American Vandal\" in 2018 and three episodes of the Apple TV+ drama \"For All Mankind\" in 2022.",
      "\"When I hear praise for Taylor\u2019s work on \u2018The Pitt,\u2019 it means more to me than anything anyone could ever say to me about my work,\" Cranston told Craig Melvin, who is a father of two. \"You know, you\u2019re a proud dad. And I\u2019m OK. I could retire after you hear that.\u201d",
      "Dearden plays a young resident with a sister who has autism on \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d which details a chaotic and traumatic day in an emergency room at a Pittsburgh trauma center. It\u2019s the first day on the job for Dearden\u2019s character, who is neurodivergent.",
      "In real life, Dearden is neurodivergent, which she spoke about with NPR in April in connection to her role.",
      "\u201cI told them that I relate to this character because I see a lot of the neurodivergent parts of Mel as something I experience all the time,\u201d she said about the show's creator, R. Scott Gemmill, and executive producer John Wells.",
      "She said Wells asked if she was comfortable sharing that part of herself in the role.",
      "\u201cAnd I realized it\u2019s, like, you know, I can mask only so much, and I\u2019m really ready for people to know,\u201d she told NPR. \u201cI tell everyone I meet because there are certain social behaviors that might seem odd. And so I usually have to tell everyone I meet, like, in case I do this, just so you know, it\u2019s not on purpose. So it was great for them to let it be my decision completely. I feel like it\u2019s the right move.\u201d",
      "Watching his daughter's career blossom and spending time with family is what led Cranston to declare in January 2024 that he\u2019s planning to \u201chit the pause button\u201c on his own career. He clarified previous rumors that he had been planning to retire by saying on TODAY that he more just wants to take a break to spend time with his wife and pursue other interests.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been married to the best person in the world for 35 years,\u201d Cranston said at the time. \u201cBut she has been the \u2018plus one\u2019 in this industry, right, and I want to change that. I want to move that out of that kind of imbalance and go away with her and just kind of \u2026 she\u2019s looking forward to having me back, and not having to follow me around.\u201d"

      "\u201cI loved it,\u201d she said. \u201cI came onboard to play Christy, and I had about three and a half months of training. I started eating. I weight-trained in the morning for an hour, kickboxed midday for about two hours, and then weight-trained again at night for an hour.\u201d",

      "Israel, which relies on intelligence or other direct and logistical assistance from the United States, may be in a position to take unilateral action against Tehran, the source familiar said. The sources familiar and officials were not aware of any planned U.S. involvement in the possible action. The United States could support with aerial refueling or intelligence sharing rather than kinetic support, but the sources and officials were not aware of plans for that, either, at this point.",
      "U.S. officials have announced that the voluntary departure of nonessential employees from the region. And the Defense Department announced the voluntary departure of military families from locations all across the U.S. Central Command area of operations.",
      "The CENTCOM commander, Gen. Erik Kurilla, was due to testify on Capitol Hill on Thursday, but the hearing was postponed late Wednesday without explanation. A source familiar said Kurilla had to focus on this unfolding situation.",
      "Another possible factor: Iran is rebuilding its strategic air defenses, and manned strikes will soon be exponentially more dangerous for Israeli pilots. In October, Israel damaged nearly every one of Iran\u2019s strategic air defense systems (mainly S-300s), but much of the damage was to the radars or other parts that can be rebuilt. It\u2019s possible Israel\u2019s window for manned strikes, without being threatened by Iran\u2019s coordinated strategic air defenses, is closing.",
      "While Israel would most likely prefer U.S. military and intelligence support for strikes \u2014 especially against Iranian nuclear facilities \u2014 it showed in October that it can do a lot alone.",

      "The U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation accused Hamas of killing at least five of its Palestinian employees on Wednesday, as almost 40 other Palestinians were killed near the foundation\u2019s aid sites in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), whose aid delivery has been mired in controversy and violence, said in a statement that more than two dozen of its employees were traveling by bus to a distribution center west of the southern city of Khan Younis when it was \u201cbrutally attacked by Hamas\u201d around 10 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET), leaving at least five people dead and multiple others injured.",
      "The foundation said there was also \u201cfear that some of our team members may have been taken hostage.\u201d",
      "\u201cDespite this heinous attack, we will continue our mission to provide critical aid to the people of Gaza,\u201d it said.",
      "Hamas has not responded to the allegations and NBC News was unable to independently verify them.",
      "The GHF, which said it had been threatened by Hamas in recent days, began distributing aid in Gaza after Israel in mid-May eased its three-month total blockade on all supplies into the enclave, including food, medicine and other vital items, following an international outcry and warnings of famine from United Nations food experts.",
      "Despite the apparent loosening of the blockade, it is mostly the GHF that has been allowed to distribute aid \u2014 partly because it is supported by Israel and the U.S., which has raised doubts over its independence.",
      "GHF executive chairman Johnnie Moore has declined to reveal the organization\u2019s sources of funding.",
      "\u201cLike lots of private foundations, you know, it doesn\u2019t disclose its donors,\u201d he told NBC News in an exclusive interview.",
      "\u201cAnything that we do and anything that we say publicly is going to distract from the mission, and we have one mission, just one mission, which is to feed Gazans,\u201d said Moore, an evangelical Christian and former adviser to President Donald Trump who was appointed last week after his predecessor resigned citing \u201chumanitarian principles.\u201d",
      "Scrutiny of GHF has intensified in the past week as dozens of Palestinians were killed in and around its multiple aid sites in Gaza, which are in military zones and off limits to independent media.",
      "Dr. Munir al-Barsh, director-general of the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, said 39 Palestinians had been shot and killed Wednesday as they sought aid from GHF.",
      "\u201cAid distribution sites have become death traps in the Gaza Strip,\u201d he said.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 200 Palestinians have been killed and about 1,500 have been injured in shootings near GHF sites, according to the health ministry, whose numbers are considered credible by the World Health Organization.",
      "While the GHF says there has been no violence in and around those distribution points, the Israeli military has previously acknowledged firing warning shots.",
      "On Wednesday, the U.N. said that even though people in Gaza were being killed and injured while trying to access food, Israel was still declining more than half of its requests to access critical supplies of fuel and to coordinate humanitarian movement inside the enclave.",
      "\u201cIf the population is inadequately supplied with the essentials for their survival, Israel must agree to humanitarian relief and facilitate it by all the means at its disposal,\u201d Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the U.N. secretary-general, said at a news briefing.",
      "The U.N. agency in Gaza, UNRWA, also renewed its criticism of GHF on Wednesday, saying in a post on X that the aid distribution model was \u201cputting lives at risk.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is also a distraction from the ongoing atrocities and a waste of resources,\u201d it said.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas carried out a terrorist attack on southern Israel in which at least 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage, according to an Israeli tally. Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas in response, launching a military campaign in Gaza that has so far killed more than 55,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry.",
      "The U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote Thursday on a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas, and the opening of all Israeli border crossings to allow for the delivery of aid. A similar resolution failed last week in the U.N. Security Council, where it was supported by 14 of the 15 members but vetoed by the United States because it was not tied to the release of the hostages.",
      "The U.N. vote comes a day after Israeli forces said they had recovered the bodies of two of the hostages inside Gaza, naming one of them as Yair Yaakov and not releasing the name of the other.",
      "Hamas still holds 53 hostages, less than half of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "Tensions are also rising between Israel and Iran, where Israel is considering taking military action in the coming days, five people with knowledge of the situation told NBC News.",
      "Any strike would most likely be carried out without U.S. support as Trump is in advanced discussions with Tehran on a deal to curtail its nuclear program.",
      "The sixth round of U.S.-Iran talks will be held Sunday in Muscat, the capital of Oman, the country\u2019s foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi, said Thursday in a post on X."

      "The foundation says there has been no violence in or around the distribution points themselves. But it has warned people to stay on designated access routes and it paused delivery last week while it held talks with the military on improving safety.",

      "Additionally, three Palestinian medics were killed in an Israeli strike Tuesday in Gaza City, according to the health ministry.",
      "The medics from the health ministry\u2019s emergency service were responding to an Israeli attack on a house in Jaffa street in Gaza City when a second strike hit the building, the ministry said. The Israeli military did not comment on the strike, but said over the past day the air force has hit dozens of targets belonging to Hamas\u2019 military infrastructure, including rocket launchers.",
      "Israel and the United States say they set up the new food distribution system to prevent Hamas from stealing humanitarian aid and using it to finance militant activities.",
      "The United Nations, which runs a long-standing system capable of delivering aid to all parts of Gaza, says there is no evidence of any systematic diversion.",
      "U.N. agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the new system, saying it violates humanitarian principles by allowing Israel to decide who receives aid and by forcing Palestinians to relocate to just three currently operational sites.",
      "The other two distribution sites are in the now mostly uninhabited southern city of Rafah, which Israel has transformed into a military zone. Israeli forces maintain an outer perimeter around all three hubs, and Palestinians must pass close to them to reach the distribution points.",
      "Hamas started the war with its terrorist attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, when Palestinian militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 others hostage. They still hold 55 hostages, fewer than half of them alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.",
      "Israel\u2019s military campaign has killed nearly 55,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. It says women and children make up most of the dead, but doesn\u2019t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",

      "National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, key partners in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, are champions of Israeli settlement who support continuing the war in Gaza, facilitating what they call the voluntary emigration of its Palestinian population and the rebuilding of Jewish settlements there.",
      "They could now face asset freezes and travel bans.",
      "In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the five countries said Ben-Gvir and Smotrich \u201chave incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights.

    "story": [
      "As U.S. and Chinese negotiators meet for trade talks in London this week, a primary concern for Washington will be whether Beijing eases the flow of rare earth materials, which have become key components of modern life.",
      "China dominates the global supply chain for rare earths, mining about 70% and refining 90% of the materials used to produce everything from wind turbines and defense equipment to electric vehicles and car seats. The United States produces virtually none of the world\u2019s rare earths, whose extraction can be devastating for the environment.",
      "That economic vulnerability has come into sharper focus since April, when China imposed export controls on seven strategic rare earth metals and related magnets amid an escalating trade war with President Donald Trump. Companies, especially automakers and business associations in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere have sounded the alarm, warning that China\u2019s rare earth restrictions risk delays that could bring manufacturing to a halt.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC on Monday that U.S. negotiators in London were seeking a \u201chandshake\u201d from China on rare earths after Trump said last week that Chinese President Xi Jinping had agreed to resume their flow in the first call between the two leaders since Trump returned to office.",
      "\u201cThey were kind of releasing them, but it was going a lot slower than some companies believed was optimal,\u201d Hassett said.",
      "In an editorial Monday, the Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said the rare earth export controls were not a \u201cshort-term bargaining chip\u201d for trade talks but a responsible policy aimed at preventing rare earths, which have both civilian and military uses, \u201cfrom being used in activities that threaten international peace and security.\u201d",
      "\u201cImposing export controls on strategic resources with clear dual-use characteristics is a common international practice and a legitimate right of sovereign nations to safeguard their own security,\u201d the editorial said.",

    "story": [
      "A Burmese American woman was eager to bring her siblings over to the U.S. from Myanmar amid a more than 15-year wait for visas. She\u2019d been hoping to reunite with them since the 1990s, during military rule in her home country, so her brother\u2019s family could start a life in the U.S. But a day after she bought the plane tickets, President Donald Trump ordered a travel ban that included Myanmar.",
      "The woman, 51, and her husband, who were granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation, had sponsored her brother and sister-in-law to immigrate to the U.S. The siblings were then were hoping to bring their own adult kids, too, so that they wouldn\u2019t have to fulfill mandatory military service in the country\u2019s active civil war.",
      "With the travel ban in effect Monday, they said the policy has a heightened impact on people from war-torn countries like Myanmar who had hopes of finding sanctuary in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating because we were on the cusp of securing their safety to leave that situation,\u201d said her husband, 57, adding he felt like a \u201crug got pulled out from under us in an instant.\u201d",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump\u2019s policy is in the \u201cbest interest of the American people and their safety.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis commonsense, country-specific travel restrictions include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe restrictions fulfill the President\u2019s day one promise to protect American citizens from dangerous foreign actors who may come to the United States and cause us harm.\u201d",
      "The travel restrictions, announced on Wednesday, completely bar entry to the U.S. for people from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, in addition to those from Afghanistan, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Other countries, including Cuba, Laos and Venezuela, are under partial travel restrictions.",
      "According to Trump\u2019s proclamation, several of the countries on the list had declined to accept the repatriation of their nationals while others had visa overstay rates that the administration deemed \u201cunacceptable.\u201d A few countries lacked \u201cthe competence of the central authority\u201d for issuing passports, the proclamation said.",
      "Jackson also pointed out a section in the proclamation that allows for applications for refugee status.",
      "\u201cNothing in this proclamation shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the [international Convention Against Torture], consistent with the laws of the United States,\u201d the proclamation said.",
      "However, after he took office, Trump limited refugee admissions for almost all countries including Myanmar. And in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke the temporary legal status of more than 500,000 immigrants that was granted by the Biden administration. Those immigrants came from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and are now subject to deportation.",
      "Myanmar was among the nine countries in the latest proclamation that Trump also targeted during his first term. In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. issued 13,284 visas to the country, with business and tourism permits making up the most common types of visas. Myanmar recorded 1,384 overstays that fiscal year, equating to an overstay rate of almost 30%.",
      "The new travel ban comes as Myanmar\u2019s violent military regime fights to hold on to power after it seized control from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in a 2021 coup. Since then, violence has escalated across the region as the military clashes with ethnic minority rebel groups and pro-democracy militias.",
      "\u201cJunta forces have slaughtered thousands of civilians, bombed and burned villages, and displaced millions of people,\u201d Tom Andrews, United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, said in a press release earlier this year. \u201cMore than 20,000 political prisoners remain behind bars. The economy and public services have collapsed. Famine and starvation loom over large parts of the population.\u201d",
      "Under the new travel ban, anyone who obtained a visa prior to the policy is still able to come to the U.S. But there\u2019s confusion over how the restrictions will be implemented and enforced. The Burmese American woman and her husband are among those with concerns, particularly as there have been several cases of lawful permanent residents and citizens being swept up in the dragnet of Trump\u2019s immigration policies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to think that they could be randomly picked up because somebody had a bad day at the office, or somebody didn\u2019t do their job or didn\u2019t believe that their visa was true,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite frankly terrifying.\u201d",
      "For the woman, reunification with her brother has been a long time coming. She became a citizen in the late 1990s and began the process to help bring her sibling over a few years later. At the time, Myanmar had been under the control of a strict military junta that held power from the 1960s until 2011, and for decades had kept the country in a state of extreme isolation and deprivation. She said her brother, whose children were just a few years old then, hoped to come over and root his family in more stability.",
      "\u201cTheir circumstances in Myanmar at that time were very, very bad. That was the system that I grew up in. There was no future for them, no prosperity,\u201d the woman said. \u201cMy brother was concerned for his children\u2019s future and education.\u201d",
      "Amid moves and address changes, the couple said they never received the standard letter notifying them that the woman's brother had been able to progress in his visa process. They assumed the wait was a product of notorious immigration backlogs. It wasn\u2019t until the situation in Myanmar intensified again in recent years that the couple found out that the brother was close to finally being able to immigrate. But by then, the woman said, her brother\u2019s kids had aged out of the system.",
      "According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, those who turn 21 before being approved for legal permanent resident status are no longer considered a child for immigration purposes and need to file an entirely new application, prolonging the green card process.",
      "At this point, the woman said, her brother and sister-in-law said they were willing to risk possible detention to come to the U.S., particularly if it meant easier access to the American immigration system that would enable them to fight to get their children to come over as well. However, with Myanmar\u2019s military draft in effect, the family is particularly concerned for their safety now that the travel ban adds another barrier to leaving.",
      "\u201cThe reason they wanted to come here was for their kids,\u201d the woman said of her brother and sister-in-law. \u201cNow, it\u2019s really hard to bring my nephews here to save their lives.\u201d",
      "Quyen Dinh, executive director of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, said the bans are ultimately another part of \u201cthe engine of Trump\u2019s mass deportation machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s focused on demonizing immigrant families and communities by denying them family reunification, that we all rightfully deserve to be whole \u2014 especially now, when the world is more dangerous than ever,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "Rather than protecting individuals\u2019 safety, Dinh said, she believes Trump\u2019s policy punishes those who need an escape from dangerous conditions.",
      "\u201cIt perpetuates the violence that is happening across the world, as opposed to creating conditions for peace or humanitarian relief, and for these families who\u2019ve been separated,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "She also said she views the ban as evidence that the U.S. is misunderstanding its role as a humanitarian leader.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got people who are legitimately trying to escape a civil war,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cNow, because of some arbitrary decision by the Trump administration to pick a certain number of countries \u2026 without consideration of the actual cases, without an exception policy, it hurts them. They\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Leaders of an aid organization that has sent more than 100 Haitian children with serious cardiac conditions to the U.S. for heart surgery said President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on travelers from 19 countries will stall or cancel lifesaving procedures for at least a dozen children or young adults.",
      "The ban, which goes into effect Monday, has led to widespread uncertainty for many and drawn condemnation from international leaders. The proclamation issued Tuesday offered exceptions for those who are lawful permanent U.S. residents and those traveling to the U.S. for the World Cup and the Olympics, among other examples. No such mention was made for cases of medical necessity, such as those who are seeking treatment in the U.S. through the International Cardiac Alliance.",
      "The International Cardiac Alliance\u2019s total waitlist for Haitians, ranging from infants to young adults, totals at least 316 people who need heart surgery, said Executive Director Owen Robinson. Some are placed in hospitals in the Dominican Republic and occasionally the Cayman Islands. But there are currently five open surgical slots in the U.S.",
      "\u201cSome of them might be able to wait a few months, and others, if they don\u2019t go now, they\u2019re going to pass away very quickly,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "The president\u2019s executive order adds that the secretary of state can issue exemptions for visas in cases that \u201cserve a United States national interest.\u201d It is unclear if clients of the International Cardiac Alliance with medical needs would fit into that description. Neither the White House nor the State Department responded to a request for comment on the matter.",
      "\u201cWe do have kids die every week waiting because there\u2019s not a lot of international slots for these kids,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "Some of the children in the program travel directly from their home country to the U.S., undergo surgery, and then return to Haiti. But for many Haitians, international travel requires multiple levels of logistical wrangling, Robinson said. Some patients and their parents who can secure surgeries in other countries must apply for a visa to the U.S., travel here, and then head to their eventual destination. The United States\u2019 travel ban now throws a wrench in that process.",
      "Fabienne Rene, 16, was diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in February. Because of her condition, Fabienne, who lives in Port-au-Prince, cannot even attend school since she experiences shortness of breath, said her father, Fignole Rene. The \u201cbad news\u201d he received about the travel ban causing the postponement or potential cancellation of his daughter\u2019s travel through the U.S. to the Dominican Republic is \u201creally disturbing and breaking my heart,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI was not waiting to hear something like that,\u201d Rene, 53, said in Creole through a translator. \u201cWe know for sure that there is nowhere in Haiti we can have this possibility. The only option that we have was just waiting to have an open door from the Cardiac Alliance.\u201d",
      "He also said the news will be troubling for his family to hear and that they don\u2019t know \u201cwhere they will find another open door that can give her a chance.\u201d",
      "Robinson said the U.S. Embassy in Haiti recently informed him that it most likely wouldn\u2019t be able to issue any visas due to the travel ban. In the past, the embassy has repeatedly issued visas for Haitian children to travel to the U.S. for care. The office of Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., has offered to reach out to the State Department to see if the children can receive exceptions, he added.",
      "Dr. John Clark, a pediatric cardiologist at Akron Children\u2019s Hospital in Ohio who has worked with the ICA, said many children in impoverished countries like Haiti suffer from Fabienne\u2019s condition because they are not seen by a doctor and treated for the common illness strep throat. Untreated, recurring strep infections can lead to rheumatic heart disease.",
      "St. Damien Pediatric Hospital in Port-au-Prince received visiting pediatric surgical teams from 2015 to 2019, Robinson said. Now, dangerous conditions in Haiti prevent doctors from other countries from entering or providing care. Meanwhile, Haiti does not have enough doctors practicing there, and the loss of opportunities for a medical education in Haiti only perpetuates the problem, Clark said.",
      "Clark participated in a surgical mission there in 2019, when visiting U.S. doctors were performing two heart surgeries per day, he said. A drastic rise in gang violence \u2014 including an attack on one of the hospital\u2019s ambulances and a worker being stoned to death \u2014 ended most medical missions to Haiti.",
      "Gang violence has only escalated since then, United Nations figures show, particularly after the assassination of Haiti\u2019s President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in 2021. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world, and more than half of Haitians live below the poverty line. The country is also plagued with government corruption, gang violence and food insecurity, as well as vulnerability to natural disasters, including a devastating 2010 earthquake that killed at least 220,000 people. Lack of adequate health care also fuels diseases like cholera, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\u201cI hope things can calm down one day enough that we can get back there [to Haiti],\u201d Clark said. \u201cBut right now, there\u2019s no way for us to go back down.\u201d",
      "Andrice Boncoeur of Port-au-Prince received free open-heart surgery at CEDIMAT Cardiovascular Center in the Dominican Republic to repair a valve when he was 9 years old. That procedure, however, was only meant to be a temporary solution. Now, plans for Andrice, 16, to travel through the U.S. for more permanent surgery have been disrupted.",
      "On Thursday, Andrice\u2019s father, Andre Boncoeur, said he had not yet told his son about the travel ban preventing him from passing through the U.S. Boncoeur said he knows \u201csomething can change at any time.\u201d",
      "Still, children like Andrice do not have much time to wait. In April, Andrice was once again hospitalized for three days at Haiti\u2019s Centre Hospitalier Eben-Ezer for heart failure. Boncoeur said his family has spent \u201ceverything that we had\u201d and that their funds are \u201calmost gone.\u201d He said he hopes the situation will change so that his son, who aspires to become a pastor, \u201ccan have a chance to live his life as a normal kid.\u201d",
      "Clark, Robinson and the patient\u2019s parents all agree it comes down to the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to accommodate the sick children.",
      "\u201cThese children are somebody\u2019s child and somebody\u2019s grandchild  and they don\u2019t have access to lifesaving care,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIs there any room for compassion?\u201d"

      "Australia in 2023 committed to spend 368 billion Australian dollars ($239 billion) over three decades on AUKUS, the country\u2019s biggest ever defense project with the U.S. and Britain, to acquire and build nuclear-powered submarines.",
      "A Pentagon official said the administration was reviewing AUKUS to ensure it was \u201caligned with the President\u2019s America First agenda\u201d on the eve of expected talks between President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.",
      "In an Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio interview, Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said AUKUS was in the strategic interests of all three countries and that the new review of the deal signed in 2021 when Joe Biden was the U.S. president was not a surprise.",
      "\u201cI am very confident this is going to happen,\u201d he said of AUKUS, which would give Australia nuclear-powered submarines.",
      "\u201cThis is a multi-decade plan. There will be governments that come and go and I think whenever we see a new government, a review of this kind is going to be something which will be undertaken,\u201d Marles told the ABC.",
      "Albanese is expected to meet Trump for the first time next week on the sidelines of the Group of 7 meeting in Canada, where the security allies will discuss a request from Washington for Australia to increase defense spending from 2% to 3.5% of gross domestic product.",
      "Albanese has said defense spending would rise to 2.3% and has declined to commit to the U.S. target.",
      "The opposition Liberal party on Thursday pressed Albanese to increase defense spending.",
      "Under AUKUS, Australia was scheduled to make a $2 billion payment in 2025 to the U.S. to help boost its submarine shipyards and speed up lagging production rates of Virginia-class submarines to allow the sale of up to three U.S. submarines to Australia starting in 2032.",
      "The first $500 million payment was made when Marles met with his U.S. counterpart, Pete Hegseth, in February.",
      "The Pentagon\u2019s top policy adviser Elbridge Colby, who has previously expressed concern that the U.S. would lose submarines to Australia at a critical time for military deterrence against China, will be a key figure in the review, examining the production rate of Virginia-class submarines, Marles said.",
      "\u201cIt is important that those production and sustainment rates are improved,\u201d he added.",
      "AUKUS would grow the U.S. and Australian defense industries and generate thousands of manufacturing jobs, Marles said in a statement.",
      "John Lee, an Australian Indo-Pacific expert at Washington\u2019s conservative Hudson Institute think tank, said the Pentagon review was \u201cprimarily an audit of American capability\u201d and whether it can afford to sell up to five nuclear-powered submarines when it is not meeting its own production targets.",
      "\u201cRelatedly, the low Australian defense spending and ambiguity as to how it might contribute to a Taiwan contingency is also a factor,\u201d Lee said.",
      "John Hamre, president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former senior Pentagon official, told a Lowy Institute seminar in Sydney on Thursday there is a perception in Washington that \u201cthe Albanese government has been supportive of AUKUS but not really leaning in on AUKUS,\u201d and that defense spending is part of this.",
      "Under the multi-stage pact, four U.S.-commanded Virginia submarines will be hosted at a Western Australian navy base on the Indian Ocean starting in 2027, which a senior U.S. Navy commander told Congress in April gives the U.S. a \u201cstraight shot to the South China Sea.\u201d",

      "Britain and Australia will jointly build a new AUKUS-class submarine that is expected to come into service starting in 2040. Following a recent defense review, Britain said it would boost spending on its attack submarine fleet under AUKUS.",
      "Former Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who struck the AUKUS deal with Biden, said Thursday that Australia should \u201cmake the case again\u201d for the treaty.",

      "Public sentiment about the U.S. has gone up in a few countries over the last year, most notably in Israel. But most of the two-dozen countries surveyed saw public opinion about the U.S. dip as Trump began his second term.",
      "Overall, the poll shows an international community full of increased skepticism of Trump and his \"America First\" foreign policies, from his administration's antagonistic relationship with traditional close allies to its focus on tariffs to its friendly posture toward right-wing, populist movements that have been amassing more power in Europe.",
      "Yet while the results in many countries are negative, Trump's marks are broadly higher this year in these nations than they were during the beginning of his first term eight years ago.",
      "Fifteen countries have seen significant drops in their opinion of America over the last year. In Mexico, 61% of respondents had a favorable opinion of the U.S. in 2024, but just 29% feel that way this year.",
      "In Sweden, which joined NATO in 2024 following the Russian invasion of Ukraine two years prior, a 47% favorable rating of the U.S. last year plummeted to just 19% this year, with 79% of Swedish respondents viewing America unfavorably.",
      "And in Canada, a 54% favorability mark in 2024 dropped 20 points in 2025, to 34%, amid Trump's repeated threats to make the country America's newest state.",
      "On the other end of the spectrum, the share of people in Turkey, Nigeria and Israel who rated the U.S. favorably increased significantly over the last year.",
      "Pew polled 28,333 adults across 24 countries mostly over the phone or in person (Australia was the only country where people were polled online). The survey was in the field for various times across different countries from Jan. 8 to April 26. Polling in every country except Indonesia began after Trump\u2019s inauguration, but it was either concluded or close to done by Trump\u2019s April 2 announcement of sweeping international tariffs.",
      "When it comes to Trump specifically, a majority of respondents in five countries of the 24 surveyed said they have a lot or some confidence in the president to do the right thing when it comes to world affairs: Hungary, India, Israel, Nigeria and Kenya. Majorities in nine of the 10 European countries tested have either not too much or no confidence in Trump at all, with at least three-quarters of respondents saying so in the Netherlands, France, Spain, Germany and Sweden.",

      "Majorities in 20 countries said he's \"a strong leader,\" while majorities in 21 countries called him \"dangerous.\"",
      "Majorities in three countries (Nigeria, India and Kenya) said Trump was \"honest,\" and majorities in five countries (Greece, Japan, Indonesia, Hungary and Kenya) called him \"diplomatic.\"",
      "Compared with his first term, the share of people across most of the surveyed countries who see Trump as a strong leader and qualified has increased. There has also been a dramatic increase in the share of adults who believe America's president is \"dangerous\" in countries where Pew also tested Biden\u2019s first year in office.",
      "On confidence in Trump to tackle global economic problems, Trump is underwater in every European country surveyed, though Hungarians are effectively split. The survey was mostly conducted before Trump announced global tariffs on April 2.",
      "In Mexico, where the survey was conducted following weeks of changing tariff policies on the country, 83% lack confidence in Trump\u2019s economic policies. In Canada, which has faced similar targeting from Trump, 74% lack confidence, and 57% said they have no confidence at all.",
      "Majorities in three countries \u2014 Kenya (56%) and Nigeria and Israel (62% each) \u2014 have confidence in Trump to handle \"the conflict between Israel and its neighbors.\" His numbers among the countries tested are the lowest in Turkey, where 7% are confident in his handling of the issue.",
      "Though a majority of Israelis expressed confidence in Trump\u2019s ability to handle the ongoing war, the poll found that confidence in Trump among right-wing Israelis is nearly four times higher, at 83%, compared with the 21% of left-wing Israelis who have confidence in Trump on the issue. Adults in most other countries said they were not confident in Trump's ability to handle the conflict.",
      "On Trump\u2019s handling of the Russia-Ukraine war, majorities in nearly all of the European countries surveyed, with the exception of Greece and Hungary, expressed little or no confidence in Trump. (Adults in Greece were split, and a narrow majority of Hungarians had at least some confidence in Trump to handle that conflict.) In France, Germany, Spain and Sweden, about three-quarters of adults said they had little or no confidence in Trump to handle the war."

      "CHERNIHIV, Ukraine \u2014 For Olga Serhichuk, the sight of dozens of her countrymen returning home from brutal Russian captivity is bittersweet.",
      "Like hundreds of desperate others, she had come to a hospital in Chernihiv, north of Kyiv, not only to welcome the shaved, beaten-up Ukrainian prisoners of war who were coming home as part of a prisoner exchange with Russia.",
      "Serhichuk, who turns 39 on Friday, was also hoping that one of the liberated men had seen or heard news of her husband, Serhiy, 42, with whom she has a son, 5, at home.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy for those who came back. I\u2019m also very saddened that my husband is still out there somewhere,\u201d she told NBC News through tears Tuesday while, like most people here, holding a large photograph of her husband, whom she last heard from in November, when he called to say his 36th Marine Brigade was headed to the embattled northern city of Sumy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m waiting and hoping that he\u2019ll be back home soon,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if he\u2019s sick, it matters not. I want him to be alive.\u201d",
      "This was the latest round of prisoner exchanges that emerged from diplomatic talks between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey on June 2. Negotiations may have yielded little progress toward ending the war itself \u2014 the attritional trench warfare and Moscow\u2019s relentless bombardment remain as fierce as ever \u2014 but an agreement to each swap at least 1,200 prisoners of war and the bodies of thousands of dead fighters provided a silver lining."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 A life-size Labubu figure has been sold in China for more than $170,000, a record for the highly sought-after toothy monster toy boosted by celebrities.",
      "The 4-foot-tall mint-green doll, whose price included a 15% commission, was traded in Beijing on Tuesday at what was billed as the world\u2019s first auction dedicated to Labubu collectibles. Event organizer Yongle Auction said the life-size doll, which is made of hard-plastic PVC, is the only one of its kind.",
      "The auction sold all 48 lots for total sales of 3.73 million yuan, or about $520,000, with nearly 1,000 collectors making bids either in person or online, Yongle said in a statement Wednesday. The event came amid a global frenzy over Labubu, which is sold in \u201cblind boxes\u201d by Chinese toy company Pop Mart.",
      "The \u201cintense\u201d bidding showed the \u201cgrowing momentum of pop art in the auction market,\u201d Yongle said, adding that it will start holding Labubu auctions \u201cregularly.\u201d",
      "The Labubu item that received the second-highest bid was another life-size figure that sold for more than $130,000 and measured 5 feet tall. Coming in third was a set from a series called \u201cThree Wise Labubu\u201d \u2014 one doll crossing its arms, one making a peekaboo gesture and one covering its mouth \u2014 that sold for more than $80,000, including commission.",
      "The success of Labubu at auction reflects the \u201cgrowing presence\u201d of art toys in the market and the progress of Hong Kong and mainland China in setting trends in contemporary culture, said Felix Kwok, a registered auctioneer of China and the founder of Art and Culture Exchange.",
      "\u201cIn a somewhat stagnant art auction market, this development is both stimulating and indicative,\u201d he told NBC News via a messaging app.",
      "Created in 2015 by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung, Labubu is one of \u201cThe Monsters\u201d in his children\u2019s book series inspired by Nordic mythology. With high, pointed ears and serrated teeth, the small monster is \u201ckind-hearted and always wants to help, but often accidentally achieves the opposite,\u201d according to Pop Mart.",
      "Labubu dolls are often sold in \u201cblind boxes,\u201d sealed packages whose contents are revealed only upon opening. In the U.S. store, one blind box from a recent collection retails for $27.99, while a set of six costs $167.94, though prices can more than double on resale sites such as eBay.",
      "The dolls have also been popularized by celebrities such as Rihanna and Lisa from the South Korean girl group Blackpink, both of whom have been spotted sporting Labubu charms on their handbags.",
      "Despite the global trade disruptions caused by U.S. tariffs, fans have continued to line up at Pop Mart shops across the world to buy Labubu dolls. Last month, the Chinese retailer even paused Labubu sales in all 16 shops in the U.K. to avoid safety issues following reports of disorderly lines and fights.",
      "In the first three months of this year, Pop Mart\u2019s overseas revenue rose almost 480% overall compared with a year earlier, and nearly 900% in the Americas, according to its quarterly report.",
      "As Labubu\u2019s popularity soars globally, Wang Ning, the founder of Pop Mart, became $8 billion richer from 2024 to 2025, a fivefold increase in his wealth, according to Forbes.",
      "CORRECTION (June 11, 2025, 11:40 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misidentified the Chinese retailer behind the popular Labubu products. It is Pop Mart, not Pop Market."

    "story": [
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina \u2014 Argentina\u2019s highest court upheld a six-year prison sentence for former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner in a ruling Tuesday that permanently banned her from public office over the corruption conviction that found she had directed state contracts to a friend while she was the first lady and president.",
      "The explosive Supreme Court ruling left Fern\u00e1ndez, Argentina\u2019s charismatic yet deeply divisive ex-leader, subject to arrest and sent her supporters pouring into the streets of Buenos Aires, Argentina\u2019s capital, and blocking major highways in protest.",
      "The court asked Argentina\u2019s security ministry to set up a detention center to hold 72-year-old Fern\u00e1ndez. Her defense lawyer Carlos Beraldi told C5N, a television station in Buenos Aires, that he had requested Fern\u00e1ndez be allowed to serve her sentence in house arrest given her age.",
      "The ruling bars Fern\u00e1ndez from running in this fall\u2019s Buenos Aires legislative elections just days after she launched her campaign.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez \u2014 who dominated Argentine politics for two decades and forged the country\u2019s main left-wing populist movement known as Kirchnerism, after her and her husband, former President N\u00e9stor Kirchner \u2014 rejects the charges as politically motivated.",
      "During Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s eight years in office (2007\u20132015), Argentina expanded cash payments to the poor and pioneered major social assistance programs. But her governments funded the unbridled state spending by printing money, bringing Argentina notoriety for massive budget deficits and sky-high inflation.",
      "Critics blamed Argentina\u2019s years of economic volatility on Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s policies, and outrage over successive economic crises and the country\u2019s bloated bureaucracy helped vault radical libertarian President Javier Milei to the presidency in late 2023.",
      "The ruling dealt a severe blow to Milei\u2019s opposition during a crucial midterm election year. He celebrated the ruling, writing on social media: \u201cJustice. Period.\u201d",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez was embroiled in multiple corruption scandals during her tenure. She was convicted in 2022 in this corruption case, which centered on 51 public contracts for public works awarded to companies linked to L\u00e1zaro B\u00e1ez, a convicted construction magnate and friend of the presidential couple, at prices 20% above the standard rate in a scheme that cost the state tens of millions of dollars.",
      "The high court rejected Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s request for the court to review her prison sentence in March. In a resolution obtained by The Associated Press, the court said that the prison sentence \u201cdoes nothing more than to protect our republican and democratic system.\u201d",
      "The Kirchner governments carried out \u201can extraordinary fraudulent maneuver\u201d that harmed the interests of the government and resulted in the embezzlement of roughly $70 million at the current exchange rate, the resolution said.",
      "Supporters of Fern\u00e1ndez and her political movement blocked main roads into Buenos Aires and stormed the offices of Argentina\u2019s two main cable networks that are widely considered critical of the ex-leader, Channel 13 and Todos Noticias, smashing televisions, vandalizing cars and shattering windows. There were no injuries reported.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez rejected the decision, calling the court justices \u201cpuppets\u201d of those wielding economic power in the country.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re three puppets answering to those ruling far above them,\u201d she told supporters in a rousing speech outside her party\u2019s headquarters. \u201cIt\u2019s not the opposition. It\u2019s the concentrated economic power of Argentina\u2019s government.\u201d",
      "Gregorio Dalb\u00f3n, one of Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s lawyers, vowed \u201cto take this case to all international human rights organizations.\u201d",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez has questioned the impartiality of the judges. She claims her defense didn\u2019t have access to much of the evidence and that it was gathered without regard to legal deadlines.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez faces a series of other upcoming trials on corruption charges."

      "Apple, Google and Meta have not immediately commented.",
